SCANDAL-ROCKED GOPHERS GO DOWN GAMELY AGAINST GONZAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Minnesota went by the book.
</P>
<P>
   No homework, no mercy, no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   For the Golden Gophers, the NCAA West sub-regional Thursday was
double-elimination: First the hint of impropriety stopped them,
then Gonzaga. The former was a far more convincing foe.
</P>
<P>
   This much can be said. For 48 hours in Seattle, the Big Ten
entry made things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota returned home a 75-63 first-round loser, but not
before it had drawn national headlines for scandal and exhausted
every possible means for an improbable upset.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before tipoff, the Gophers suspended four players amid
allegations of long-term academic fraud in the program. Injury the
day before robbed them of yet another body.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the eight-man basketball carcass that remained _ mostly
freshmen and sophomoresn _ was able to squeeze a 21-point deficit
to just two with 1:43 remaining at KeyArena. Finally, the Gophers
were put out of their misery by their free-shooting opponent from
Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of my team,'' embattled Minnesota coach Clem
Haskins said. ``We competed and we did not quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Gophers study in an appropriate manner, according to
reports in the St. Paul Pioneer Press and verified by school
officials. And this startling revelation, that an academic
counseling employee took tests and wrote papers for players for
several seasons, could cost them a coach and a return trip to the
NCAA tourney any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, emerging from this vitriolic mess was Gonzaga with its
first NCAA postseason victory and its first win over a Big Ten
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags, improving to 27-6 and advancing to the next round
against Stanford, never trailed and gradually built a 51-30
advantage. They bombed away from the 3-point line, with guard
Richie Frahm hitting 5-of-11 trey attempts en route to a game-best
26 points. But he and his teammates nearly let it all slip away at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead just 65-63 with 1:43 remaining, Frahm took a big chance.
The 6-5 junior from Battle Ground let one fly near the Gonzaga
bench. The net rippled. That sent the Zags on a 10-0 run to finish
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shocked that I shot it,'' Frahm admitted later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He willed that one in,'' said fellow junior guard Matt
Santangelo, who added 14 points to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   There were awkward moments from start to finish. The Gophers
took the floor amid boos and catcalls. Gonzaga students held up a
sign that said: ``Zags write their own papers!''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's four suspended players, including normal starters
Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, sat glumly at the end of the bench.
Each was dressed in black and white sweats, which clashed
noticeably with the rest of the team's maroon and gold warmups.
Kind of like inmate garb.
</P>
<P>
   The Gophers replaced their regulars with 6-7 freshman Dusty
Rychart and 6-2 sophomore Mitch Ohnstad. Each had started one game
previously. Rychart had scored just 57 points all season. For subs,
Minnesota turned to little-used freshmen Terrance Simmons and John
Aune, who had appeared in 15 and three games, respectively. Aune
had scored just one point. Not exactly Final Four material.
</P>
<P>
   Things got comical at times. Freshman Nick Sinville, caught
underneath the basket, panicked and threw one over everyone's heads
for a midcourt violation. Quincy Lewis, the Gophers' leading scorer
and lone senior available, connected on just 3-of-19 shots, often
firing wildly and with no conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what would happen,'' Ohnstad said.
</P>
<P>
   Rychart, however, stepped up to the surprise of virtually
everyone. The walk-on from Grand Rapids, Minn., got stuffed a
couple of times underneath, but kept battling. He scored 23 points
and grabbed 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually contribute by playing good defense and getting
hustle points,'' he said. ``Tonight, the rules changed a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not the best choice of words, considering Minnesota's
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The Gophers eventually lost starters Joel Pryzbilla and Kevin
Nathaniel on fouls, to finish with just six players. It wasn't a
fair fight, but they hung in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' Lewis said. ``Basically, those were three or
four seniors we lost. Let's just leave it at that. I was glad to be
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskins was shaking hands with Gonzaga coach Dan Monson before
the buzzer sounded, apparently eager to distance himself from a
lost week in Seattle.

DiMAGGIO MET THE `CHALLENGE' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Media mayhem while attacking March Madness through
CBS SportsLine (updates every 90 seconds on Auburn's runaway
against Winthrop) and Broadcast.com (to drop in on a radio listen
of Louisville-Creighton) with an eye on the CBS (the Arkansas-Siena
generic feed) and, frantically, over to DirecTV (for Gonzaga's
shot-fest against Minnesota that CBS wouldn't show after the first
half):
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone: Imagine what it would take in today's media
climate to lure a retired superstar athlete to stop by and
participate on a TV sports trivia quiz show.
</P>
<P>
   The closest we seem to get is an occasional ``Wheel of Fortune''
with Kevin Greene.
</P>
<P>
   But back in the early '70s, Dick Enberg hosted the syndicated
``Sports Challenge'' for three years, drawing guests like Joe
DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, Bill
Russell, Joe Namath and Paul Hornung. All they were given was a
ride from the airport to the KTLA studio in Hollywood and a
$1,000-a-show stipend.
</P>
<P>
   The media-shy DiMaggio appeared on a couple of ``Sports
Challenge'' episodes that have aired on ESPN Classic this week in
tribute of the former New York Yankees great _ and that's something
even Enberg has a tough time believing could be ever pulled off
again with an athlete of DiMaggio's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have up to 20 former greats in that green room, some
waiting to go on, some who already (had been) on, some the mystery
guests, and they all enjoyed the camaraderie,'' Enberg said from
his home near San Diego before jetting off to do NBC's PGA coverage
of the Honda Classic in Coral Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'd be DiMaggio kibitzing with Johnny Unitas and Joe
Louis. We would bring about 100 kids into the studio to watch the
shows because they'd cheer loudly. But we didn't let fans come in
(the green room) and there were only a few producers. I think they
looked forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what a treat for me to meet all my heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those reunions, Enberg reminded, were what led directly to the
creation of the Curt Gowdy-hosted series ``The Way It Was.''
</P>
<P>
   Enberg believes it was the coaxing of former Yankees teammate
Tommy Henrich that led to DiMaggio's appearance, as well as his
brother, Dom, coming on with some Red Sox teammates to compete
against the Joe McCarthy Yankees. The mystery guest that show,
incidentally, was the DiMaggios' other brother, Vince.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Classic has another airing of the ``Sports Challenge'' when
DiMaggio's Yankees competed against the 1956 Yankees with Mantle,
Billy Martin and Hank Bauer at 12:45 p.m. on Saturday, which is in
the middle of a six-hour DiMaggio tribute block (9 a.m. to 3 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Those shows, looking at them now, were really ahead of their
time because of the rear-projection image behind the two panels
showing the film highlights as the players watched,'' Enberg said.
``No one had ever done it then. I'm pleased with the way they
really hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Enberg-DiMaggio moment: When Enberg was the Angels'
play-by-play man, one of his duties was to do three eight-minute
interviews in a minimal-production half-hour pregame show leading
up to the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   During an Angels game in Oakland in 1968, Enberg got to sit down
with then-A's batting instructor DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the few times I was truly tongue-tied,'' said
Enberg. ``I'm trying to introduce him, and finally I had to stop
and look into the camera and say, `Folks, this one of my heroes,'
and we just did the interview from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, I thanked him for coming on. And he said, `Was I
OK?' I'm thinking, `Were (begin ital)you(end ital) OK?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget how his greatness always befuddled him and
he never seemed comfortable wearing it. It was only as he grew
older and matured into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: This is how Life magazine described the young
DiMaggio in a 1939 profile:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he learned Italian first, Joe, now 24, speaks English
without an accent and is otherwise well adapted to most U.S. mores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of olive oil or smelly bear grease, he keeps his hair
slick with water. He never reeks of garlic and prefers chicken chow
mein to spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   Try writing (begin ital)that(end ital) today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   The March 22 issue of Forbes offers its first ``Power 100''
celebrity list, an attempt to rank how income plus ``media buzz''
(exposure on the Web, radio and TV, magazine covers and press
clippings) determine what celebs have the best future earnings
clout. Meaning that, even though Jerry Seinfeld was far and away
the show biz's wage-earning champ with $267 million last year, he's
got no juice next to one of sports' most recent retirees. Among
those sports figures on the list who made the top 25 power
ranking: &QL; 
1. Michael Jordan: Made $69 million last year to rank seventh, but
with more than 40,000 press clips and seven magazine covers, he's
the man. &QL; 
18. Tiger Woods: Made $26.8 million in '98 to rank 44th, but had
28,301 press clips, twice as many as Leonardo DiCaprio and fourth
to Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Jordan. &QL; 
23. Mark McGwire: A measly $10 million was 83rd on the list, but
47,000 press clips and 900 TV/radio hits and seven magazine covers
pushed him up). &QL; 
24. Dennis Rodman: Surprised? His $15.3 million income was only
56th, but the media hype propelled him almost 50 places above his
new Lakers teammate and fellow thespian. &QL; 
Among the others: &QL; 
33. Sammy Sosa: His $10 million tied McGwire for 83rd, but 29,000
newspaper clips and 579 radio/TV hits from the home run chase made
a big push. &QL; 
56. Gary Sheffield: Based only on his $17.2 million income, which
was actually 54th. &QL; 
58. Mo Vaughn: His $11.9 million was 70th, and he'll be better off
next year in Anaheim. &QL; 
68. Oscar De La Hoya: Another surprise, because he's so low. His
$18.5 million income was 50th. &QL; 
70. Shaquille O'Neal: The athlete who seemingly defined the
cross-over artist made $9.8 million last year (87th on the list),
which wasn't quite enough. Wait'll next year. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_Realizing that the fight probably won't sell itself, TVKO has a
massive ad campaign for the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
pay-per-view business meeting Saturday night (6 p.m., $49.95),
which goes beyond Holyfield making the usual boast of a third-round
knockout during every media stop this week. Microsoft has a Web
site set up (http://www.holyfieldlewis.com) and the Home Shopping
Network has fight merchandise and Don King peddling it. TVKO hopes
to get as many as 1 million buys before it rebroadcasts it on HBO,
most likely next Friday. &QL; 
_When it hit the Associated Press wires, the AM-1150 news updates
Wednesday night wouldn't credit all-news KFWB-AM (980) for breaking
the story on the FBI point-shaving investigation into UCLA's
football program. Yup, Joe McDonnell broke it. &QL; 
_ Bob Costas , who thankfully, for the first time in five weeks,
isn't doing a Rodman-bashing Lakers broadcast Sunday. He's at New
Jersey-Miami because of the Stephon Marbury trade to the Nets while
the Lakers play at Sacramento for KCAL. Costas has been given
permission by NBC to do a handful of baseball games on ESPN. His
hope is that he'll be able to work off some rust before the
postseason starts, which for NBC is a cherry-pick of the NLCS and
World Series this season while Fox does the regular season. The
probable truth is that he deep down needs the exposure on the cable
network so that, when Robert Quinlan (his real name) begins his
campaign for the office of commissioner, there'll be no mistaking
the face. &QL; 
_The Angels' spring training broadcasts from Arizona continue to
get technically tangled up on KLAC-AM (570), but there was nothing
like the first game last Saturday when botched commercials and
other miscommunication from the start resulted in play-by-play man
Mario Impemba 's exasperated profanity making it on the air. &QL; 
_If you're on the subscriber list to ESPN The Magazine, expect a
postal solicitation from the boys over in Anaheim gauging your
interest in one of their 21-game season-ticket packages. It's
called Disney synergy, folks. It might not be so tacky, except the
letter begins with the presumptuous salutation ``Dear Angels
Fan.'' &QL;

FLORIDA DERBY MAY BE ALSO-RAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Florida Derby, the highlight of the sunny Gulfstream Park
season near Miami, has proved to be the most influential Kentucky
Derby prep race of many a year since its creation in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it might not even be the biggest Derby prep of the
weekend _ or the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It will depend on the performance of Three Ring, whose entry in
Saturday's 11-horse field makes her the second filly to challenge
colts this season.
</P>
<P>
   It will depend on the result of Saturday's San Felipe Stakes at
Santa Anita, where Exploit and Prime Timber will decide who's No. 1
in the Bob Baffert barn.
</P>
<P>
   It will depend on the result of Sunday's Louisiana Derby at the
New Orleans Fair Grounds, where Baffert-trained General Challenge
will be favored over Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Answer Lively.
</P>
<P>
   And it will depend on the result of Sunday's Santa Anita Oaks,
in which Baffert-trained Excellent Meeting must trounce other
fillies to earn a shot at the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the races make for the busiest week yet in the buildup
to the May 1 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, it appeared the $750,000 Florida Derby would be
distinguished mainly by the fact the nearly omnipresent Baffert
won't have a horse in it.
</P>
<P>
   Then trainer Eddie Plesa Jr. decided to enter the filly Three
Ring in the 1[-mile race whose favorites are Fountain of Youth
Stakes winner Vicar and runner-up Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the second ``battle of the sexes'' of the
3-year-old season, following Honest Lady's close, fifth-place
finish behind Desert Hero in the San Rafael Stakes last month at
Santa Anita. The defeat hasn't dissuaded trainer Bobby Frankel from
aiming her for the April 3 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   This would also be the first ``battle of the sexes'' in the
Florida Derby since Ridan (and Manny Ycaza) nosed out the filly
Cicada (and Bill Shoemaker) in the bumpy 1962 running.
</P>
<P>
   When Three Ring was entered Wednesday morning, however, she
wasn't certain to run. Plesa had said he would scratch her if she
drew one of the outside post positions. Wouldn't you know it, she
drew post 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying no, but it's not helping the cause at all,''
Plesa said following that development. ``I don't mind running
against the boys. I just don't want to give them any advantages. I
don't want to get hung up on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   If Three Ring backs out, she'll run against other fillies
Tuesday in the Bonnie Miss Stakes, also at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   But why not try the Derby trail?
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring seems to have the talent, her 14}-length victory in
the Davona Dale Stakes having earned a 106 Beyer speed figure,
about six lengths faster than Vicar's Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   And Plesa's worry about the post position is curious. Three
Ring, who will be ridden by John Velazquez, is a front-runner. The
only other speed horse, Valid Trefaire, drew post 1. Three Ring
should be able to shoot to a perfect position up front.
</P>
<P>
   Plesa should look at the record book: Of the past seven Florida
Derbies with 11 or more horses, three were won by horses who broke
from post 10 or higher and grabbed the early lead. It's not hard.
</P>
<P>
   The record book also shows the Florida Derby is the best place
to be for a horse who wants to be a factor in the Kentucky Derby.
The Kentucky Derby favorite or winner _ or both _ has come out of
the Florida Derby in 27 of the past 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's field, from the rail out, with morning-line odds: 1.
Valid Trefaire (Jose Santos), 15-1; 2. Cat Thief (Pat Day), 4-1;
Certain (Kent Desormeaux), 6-1; 4. Adonis (Jorge Chavez), 10-1; 5.
Vicar (Shane Sellers), 3-1; 6. Casanova Star (Mike Smith), 20-1; 7.
Wondertross (Jerry Bailey), 8-1; 8. Grits'n Hard Toast (Robbie
Davis), 8-1; 9. First American (Jose Velez), 20-1; 10. Three Ring,
5-1; 11. Aly's Alley (Edgar Prado), 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   San Felipe: Sunbirds and national racing writers will flock to
the Florida Derby as always. But if they want to watch the
definitive race of the Derby campaign, they might have to stick
around about an hour and watch the San Felipe on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 San Felipe, the last steppingstone to the Santa
Anita Derby, poses the first 1 1/16-mile test for Exploit, the Bob
and Beverly Lewis-owned colt who's 5 for 5 and the consensus leader
of his age group.
</P>
<P>
   If Exploit loses his perfect record, Baffert might have only
himself to blame, because Prime Timber comes into the San Felipe
following a fastest-of-the-morning 5-furlong workout in :58 4/5
Monday. Prime Timber was wearing the blinkers he'll have on for the
first time in a race on Saturday. He'll also have a new jockey in
David Flores, who's filling in for Gary Stevens, who's following
Silverbulletday to the Fair Grounds Oaks the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Not forgotten: About 200 tearful horsemen and fans attended a
memorial Tuesday at Golden Eagle Farm near San Diego _ for a horse,
the popular Best Pal, who died of a heart attack at the farm in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar general manager Joe Harper presided over the event,
which featured speeches by Best Pal's owners, John and Betty Mabee,
trainers Gary Jones and Richard Mandella and jockey Corey Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God had a favorite horse, it would be Best Pal,'' Mandella
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gelding was 8 when he retired in 1996 after earning a
California-bred record $5.6 million and winning the Santa Anita
Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   He's buried on the farm under a 600-year-old oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Help from above? A daughter of the stallion Dimaggio won Santa
Anita's opener Wednesday _ the track's first race following the
death of baseball legend Joe DiMaggio on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Candi Lee, a 6-year-old mare, paid $6.40. You were hoping for
$56?
</P>
<P>
   Dimaggio the horse died in 1994 after a California breeding
career during which he sired Prince Spellbound, a winner of the
Hollywood Turf Cup and the Eddie Read Handicap. On the track,
Dimaggio had won the 1974 Hollywood Juvenile Championship and other
stakes around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Big 'Cap, indeed: Free House, Event of the Year and Silver Charm
_ 1-2-3 in Sunday's Santa Anita Handicap _ also are 1-2-3 in the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association's media poll this week.
</P>
<P>
   Free House's 2:00.67 for 1\ miles earned a 118 Beyer speed
figure, the highest reported since October.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate plans had Silver Charm aiming to defend his title in
the March 28 Dubai World Cup _ where Malek and Victory Gallop will
be the other U.S. horses _ and fifth-place Puerto Madero out of the
Dubai race because of a swollen ankle. &QL;

NEW MARINER PITCHERS FLEX ARMS AGAINST ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ There's no Cactus League road trip longer than
Peoria to Tucson, which is 140 miles each way. Veterans Ken Griffey
Jr., Alex Rodriguez, Jay Buhner, Edgar Martinez and David Segui had
permission to sleep in while the Mariners boarded their 7 a.m. bus
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But those were the front-line Colorado Rockies in the other
dugout at Hi Corbett Field, and two Mariner newcomers did a
credible job of handling them. Starter John Halama and reliever
Eric Weaver allowed one run in five combined innings in the M's 3-0
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've both done a real excellent job so far,'' said Mariners
pitching coach Stan Williams. ``They've done everything we've asked
them to do. The run off Halama today was the only one off either
one of them all spring. They're throwing strikes and both are good
competitors who know how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama and Weaver came to the Mariners quietly in early October.
Halama was the player to be named later from July's Randy Johnson
trade with Houston; Weaver was acquired from Los Angeles for
minor-leaguer Scott Prouty. Now, both find themselves with
reasonable chances at making the M's opening day roster.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Halama has been a starter the last three years,
making six starts last April for Houston, but he could fit in as a
reliever for Seattle. The Mariners have no established left-handed
relievers on their roster, and the one with the most experience,
Greg McCarthy, gave up two runs on three hits in one inning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was fighting for the fifth spot (in the Astros'
rotation), and this year, from what I understand, there are two
open spots,'' Halama said. ``I don't know how many bullpen spots
are available, but I might be a reliever here. I'm basically a
starter, but I relieved one year in the minors and I could do that
also.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have eight pitchers who should make the team
barring trades or injuries: Jeff Fassero, Jamie Moyer, Ken Cloude,
Mark Leiter, Bobby Ayala, Jose Paniagua, Jose Mesa and Butch Henry,
who, like Halama, could fill the left-handed relief role. That
leaves three open spots, at least one in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   That job could be won by Weaver, a 6-foot-5 right-hander who was
2-0 with an 0.93 earned-run average in seven games with the Dodgers
last year. A starter in the minors from 1992-97, Weaver became a
full-time reliever in '98, striking out 63 in 612/3 innings at
Class AAA Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   He credits learning a split-finger fastball with rejuvenating
his career. Weaver developed the pitch near the end of the '97
season with coach Claude Osteen, and found it the ideal complement
to his 88-92 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just took off,'' said Weaver. ``It was like a new toy _ it
made pitching fun again. I had reached a point where I was spinning
my wheels with Albuquerque, and with the split-finger, I knew I had
a pitch to put guys away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama's best pitch is his change-up, which earns him frequent
comparisons to Moyer. He also throws a curveball and two kinds of
fastballs, and Williams likes the assortment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can throw off-speed and locate, it's the way to
pitch,'' he said. ``Most of the guys in this league can handle
fastballs better than anything else. If you can change speeds and
move the ball, you can have success here.''
</P>
<P>
   MARINER NOTES: A strong wind was blowing in much of Thursday,
and Mariner pitchers said it helped them. But they also showed good
command, issuing no walks after allowing only one on Wednesday and
two in each of the previous two games. ``I hate walks, and I guess
I've gotten the point across,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hitting coach Jesse Barfield said rookie second baseman
Carlos Guillen is one of those rare switch-hitters with the same
mechanics from both sides of the plate. ``About 70 percent of
pitchers are right-handed now, so obviously he's going to get a lot
more at-bats left-handed,'' Barfield said. ``But he's outstanding
from both sides. He's a player.'' Guillen went 2-for-4 with a
perfect bunt and is hitting .571 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   -- Guillen was developed as a shortstop, but he won't play there
for the Mariners unless Rodriguez has to stay out of the lineup for
an extended length of time. On Rodriguez's routine days off, David
Bell will replace him at shortstop, as he did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   -- A day after he blanked the Brewers for two innings, Freddy
Garcia was still earning praise in the Mariners' dugout. ``He was
overpowering,'' said catcher Tom Lampkin, who was working with
Garcia for the first time. Lampkin said Garcia's curveball and
mid-90s fastball already are major-league quality, and his revamped
changeup is nearly there. Manager Lou Piniella said Garcia earned
himself a spring start with the outing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Before being shut out Thursday, Mariners hitters were leading
the majors with a .376 average. ... Non-roster right-hander Melvin
Bunch was re-assigned to minor-league camp ... The latest major
leaguer to dye his hair? Red-coiffed Rockies strongman Dante
Bichette. ... Fassero starts Friday against the pride of Yakima,
Todd Stottlemyre, as the Mariners host the Arizona Diamondbacks at
12:05 (KIRO 710-AM).

<P>
   A hostile takeover in France? And not of one company but two?
And in the banking industry at that, where deals are made over long
lunches after a nod from the finance ministry? Something is going
on.
</P>
<P>
   BNP, which, on March 10, bid for Paribas and Societe Generale to
create a bank that would be worth FFr340 billion ($56 billion),
would have you believe that this something is a restructuring of
the French banking system.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is the transaction the market has been waiting for,'' said
the bank. No it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   There will be many who say that the simple fact of a hostile bid
is remarkable in itself in a country where such things are as rare
as a bottle of 1928 Chateau Petrus.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore, for a moment, that hostile takeovers in banking are
unlikely to work, and that attempting two at once is, shall we say,
ambitious. This is a hostile takeover with little rationale, and
even less hostility.
</P>
<P>
   BNP promises to sack nobody (costs will cut through natural
attrition), close no branches, and keep all the banks' brands
intact. So what is the point?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps BNP felt left out: it courted Societe Generale
unsuccessfully for two years only to see the bank fall into the
arms of Paribas. Perhaps it felt desperate: its investment-banking
business has been poor; with Paribas and SocGen on board it might
rise to mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspicion is that BNP wants to be too big to be taken
over, and that it would relish the title of national champion of
French banking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this deal fails to come off (and it is still a long way
from succeeding), it will lead to talk of the long-overdue
consolidation in European banking now that the euro is here.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is certainly needed. Europe has too many
unprofitable banks with too many branches _ as it happens, twice as
many branches per head as in America. Sadly, however, what this bid
tells you is not how much consolidation there will be, but how
little.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for a start, hard for European banks to merge. Germany
and to a lesser extent France and Italy are dominated by mutually
owned and state-owned institutions. In Germany, three-quarters of
the banking market is in the hands of such banks.
</P>
<P>
   Unless countries privatize and mutuals convert into stockholding
companies, the scope for consolidation is limited.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope: ten years ago in Italy 70 percent of the
country's banking system was in public hands; now, thanks to
privatization, the figure is about 20 percent. Yet elsewhere,
particularly in France and Germany, things remain far more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   There is worse. In America and Britain, once banks have clinched
a merger, they can then set about closing branches and sacking
people; this, indeed, is often the rationale for the deal in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Not in most European countries: strong labor laws and strongish
unions make that awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the pains that Societe Generale and Paribas went to in
February to emphasize that there would be few, if any, job cuts
domestically. And hence the pains that BNP has gone to now to say
the same, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   It talks of ``multi-branding'' (keeping the existing banks
almost exactly as they are) and of ``cost-cutting synergies''
(technology, possibly; and sacking foreigners, very probably). It
talks, to be blunt, nonsense: BNP can't cut costs at home and it
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border mergers are doubly difficult. There is little
overlap between banks from the different countries and the logic
here is different: less cost-cutting, more revenue generation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is precisely why banks are hesitant. Buying a bank in
another country with another language and another legal system is a
risk that few want to take.
</P>
<P>
   There have been one or two attempts, but full mergers have
proved difficult. Deutsche had a tilt at Credit Lyonnais and
Societe Generale, but was sent away with a flea in its ear.
</P>
<P>
   Every European country seems to want strong banks, but until
they can live with layoffs, foreign shareholders and less
nationalistic regulation, they will be disappointed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a European, the agenda for this year's Ides of March
should make you gulp.
</P>
<P>
   This coming Monday, March 15, is the day when a committee of
investigators will say whether it thinks that members of the
European Commission have been culpably careless with the taxpayers'
money.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, in the wider world, it is also the day when the
Kosovo negotiations begin again, and Europeans will have to decide
whether they are ready to be as tough as Americans with Slobodan
Milosevic in order to get Serbia off the Kosovars' backs.
</P>
<P>
   And, to rub home the transatlantic point, the World Trade
Organization will on Monday be expecting both Europe and America to
show some sign of willingness to settle the blush-making banana
war, which Europe started but the Americans have now made sharply
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the Ides, indeed. It is not surprising that on both sides
of the Atlantic the glummer sort of ``realist'' _ the sort whose
``realism'' is based on looking backward rather than forward _ is
predicting the end of the Euro-American partnership that repeatedly
saved the 20th century from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold-War solitary American superpower, say many
Europeans, has to be held in check, lest it create an unacceptably
Americanized world.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty dollar needs to be balanced by the gallant young
euro. The spread of American popular culture must be slowed, even
if it is popular outside America too.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should be discouraged from demonizing Iran (here
America's critics may be right, if last month's local elections in
Iran further strengthen President Khatami's liberalizing hand).
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should also stop bombing the armory of Saddam
Hussein's praetorian guard (but here the critics are wrong, unless
they can come up with a better way of bringing a
germ-warfare-capable Iraq back under sane leadership).
</P>
<P>
   What many of these Europeans do not realize is that their
grumblings are drowned by the growlings of frustrated Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that Bosnia's agonies were prolonged by the
Europeans' unwillingness to recognize that a just peace required
the serious threat of force (and that the same thing could yet go
wrong in Kosovo); or that the banana war began with Europe's
reluctance to respect the rules of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The arthritic economy of continental Europe, say angry
Americans, leaves it to them to bear most of the burden of helping
recession-hit Asia and Latin America, by buying more imports from
these regions and thereby making their own trade deficit even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, though richer than the United States,
provides a tiny and diminishing proportion of the high-tech
military equipment that NATO depends on if it is to be able to
fight wars without an intolerable number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Europe no longer has to worry about Hitler's Germany or
a communist Russia, conclude these exasperated Americans, Europe
can be left to its own devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep structural forces,'' says Stephen Walt in the current
issue of the National Interest, are ``beginning to pull Europe and
America apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sky is not quite that black: a few gleams of
sunshine peer through the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of NATO goes ahead this spring without any of the
awful consequences _ an uncontrollably furious Russia, a sharp
increase in the democracies' defense budgets _ that the pessimists
had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The continued American and British bombing of Iraq has not been
supported by other Europeans but neither have they (or most Arabs,
be it noted) strongly objected to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the gloomsters could yet prove right. The Atlantic
alliance may indeed collapse, unless both Europeans and Americans
look forward rather than backward: unless they base their plans not
on memories of the past 50 years but on a reasonable calculation of
what the next 50 years will bring.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were indeed going to remain the world's
only great power as far ahead as the eye can see, people who like
this newspaper believe in the danger of monopoly and the need for
competition would draw the necessary conclusion: Europe should
provide a counterbalance to this overwhelming American power.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not in fact what the future really holds. If the
European part of NATO raises its eyes beyond its own borders, and
sees what will probably happen out there in the next generation or
so, it will understand why it still needs America and _ even more
important _ why America increasingly needs Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The one-superpower world will not last. Within the next couple
of decades a China with up to 1 billion people, a strongly growing
economy and probably a still-authoritarian government will almost
certainly be trying to push its interests eastward into the Pacific
and westward into Central Asia, whose oil and gas this energy-poor
China will badly need.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later some strong and honest man will pull
post-Yeltsin Russia together, and another contender for global
influence will have reappeared on the scene (unless fear of China
sends a horrified Russia running into NATO's arms).
</P>
<P>
   The Islamist superpower that nervous people predicted a few
years ago will probably never come into being, but the Muslim world
will certainly continue to produce localized explosions of
ideological wrath and geopolitical envy.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the alliance of the democracies needs not only new
members but also a new purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance can no longer be just a protective American arm
around Europe's shoulder; it also has to be a way for Europe and
America to work together in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And those who hope to construct a politically united Europe
should recognize that this must be done _ if it can be done at all
_ in partnership with America, not to separate Europe from America.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO was what NATO seems to Cold-War nostalgics, how soon
we'd drop her. But, as Kipling would be the first to explain, it
ain't.
</P>
<P>
   A new Atlantic partnership will be more than the Cold-War NATO.
Through the squabbling about bananas and the head-scratching about
Kosovo, the shape of a 21st-century alliance of the democracies at
last begins to emerge. &QL;

<P>
   If you are a European, the agenda for this year's Ides of March
should make you gulp.
</P>
<P>
   This coming Monday, March 15, is the day when a committee of
investigators will say whether it thinks that members of the
European Commission have been culpably careless with the taxpayers'
money.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, in the wider world, it is also the day when the
Kosovo negotiations begin again, and Europeans will have to decide
whether they are ready to be as tough as Americans with Slobodan
Milosevic in order to get Serbia off the Kosovars' backs.
</P>
<P>
   And, to rub home the transatlantic point, the World Trade
Organization will on Monday be expecting both Europe and America to
show some sign of willingness to settle the blush-making banana
war, which Europe started but the Americans have now made sharply
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the Ides, indeed. It is not surprising that on both sides
of the Atlantic the glummer sort of ``realist'' _ the sort whose
``realism'' is based on looking backward rather than forward _ is
predicting the end of the Euro-American partnership that repeatedly
saved the 20th century from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold-War solitary American superpower, say many
Europeans, has to be held in check, lest it create an unacceptably
Americanized world.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty dollar needs to be balanced by the gallant young
euro. The spread of American popular culture must be slowed, even
if it is popular outside America too.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should be discouraged from demonizing Iran (here
America's critics may be right, if last month's local elections in
Iran further strengthen President Khatami's liberalizing hand).
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should also stop bombing the armory of Saddam
Hussein's praetorian guard (but here the critics are wrong, unless
they can come up with a better way of bringing a
germ-warfare-capable Iraq back under sane leadership).
</P>
<P>
   What many of these Europeans do not realize is that their
grumblings are drowned by the growlings of frustrated Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that Bosnia's agonies were prolonged by the
Europeans' unwillingness to recognize that a just peace required
the serious threat of force (and that the same thing could yet go
wrong in Kosovo); or that the banana war began with Europe's
reluctance to respect the rules of free trade.

MARATHONER OVERCOMES ILLS
</HEADLINE>

By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She's not supposed to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   She's fought cancer three times.
</P>
<P>
   She (begin ital)will(end ital) finish Sunday's L.A. Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll crawl,'' she said, ``if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Uliantzeff, 39, is a soft-spoken, slender blonde who rarely
discusses her past. But what a past it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a beacon of light for everyone to do well. I don't know
a better way to say it,'' said Pat Connelly, coach of the Road
Runners track program that prepares athletes for the L.A. Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see her and all that she's been through, and she's
right there with them. It really makes their pain and discomfort
seem insignificant and helps them keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliantzeff, an interpreter for the Superior Court, was first
diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago. Cancer also claimed the
lives of her brother and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``Everyone I knew
who had it, had died. I wasn't ready to die. That's why I stayed
active and kept doing as much as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a lumpectomy and six months of radiation and
chemotherapy, all while she was training for her first L.A.
Marathon, melanoma was discovered on her leg. She finished that
race.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1993, her breast cancer had spread to both
lungs, and she was given less than a 20 percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Her cancer is now in remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a quitter,'' she says. ``I know there are limits you
hit when you do have to stop, but I truly believe God made us very
strong and wants us to keep pushing. I don't think a lot of people
realize that, and they quit when it starts hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   When she recovered from the cancer, the deeply religious woman
returned to volunteering for the St. Innocent Orphanage in Tijuana,
Mexico, and the Project Mexico outreach program.
</P>
<P>
   This year she's running to raise money for the orphanage, which
she visits monthly. Many of its boys are traveling to see the race
and cheer for Uliantzeff and their friend Ismeal Valadez, a
16-year-old who Uliantzeff has helped train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have different battles,'' Uliantzeff said, ``and it
shows if you have faith and keep persevering, dreams can come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliantzeff's dedication to others, as well as her own bravery,
earned her this year's Patsy Choco Courage Award. L.A. Marathon
officials established the award in honor of a cancer victim whose
last wish was to complete the marathon, which she did, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While a recent bout with the flu has jeopardized Uliantzeff's
goal of finishing the marathon in less than five hours, she won't
be ready for a rest after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to go out dancing and have a margarita,'' she
said.

   LITTLE ROCK, ARK. _ At the end of February, a group of Canadian
hemophiliacs infected with HIV and hepatitis C descended on
Washington. They want an inquiry into why the United States,
particularly the federal Food and Drug Administration, allowed the
export of tainted prison plasma from Arkansas and Louisiana to
Canada in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, and the FDA
had already ruled that prison plasma was too unsafe to be used for
the manufacture of blood products inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the same group filed a $1 billion suit against the
Canadian government and companies involved in the plasma
production.
</P>
<P>
   This month, it plans to bring lawsuits in the $5 billion range
which will name the FDA, the states of Arkansas and Louisiana,
their prison systems and various medical-care providers for the
prison inmates, including Health Management Associates (HMA), which
ran the Arkansas prison plasma program from 1978 to 1994 and also
bought prison plasma from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The suit may also name the president, if evidence is found that
Clinton knew about repeated FDA violations and yet did not shut
down the plasma industry in his state's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Krever Commission, set up by the Canadian government in 1995
to look into contaminated blood issues, found that the tainted
plasma often came from Cummins Prison in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins is a vast farm-based penitentiary that sits in bleak
countryside, strewn with shanties and burned-out churches, 70 miles
southeast of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates' blood was sold by the Arkansas Department of
Correction to HMA which, in turn, sold it to North American
Biologics, a subsidiary of Continental Pharma Cryosan, a
blood-broker based in Montreal. From there, it was shipped all
through Canada and across the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arkansans seemed unaware of the plasma program in their
state prisons until last summer, when Michael Galster, a prison
doctor, wrote a fictionalized account that exposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In past news reports, prison officials had denied knowledge of
what was going on. Yet not only did the prisons run such a program
from 1969 on, they were often in trouble for it.
</P>
<P>
   In Cummins, even when the existence of AIDS and hepatitis C was
recognized and tests for these diseases became available, they were
not always used; the FDA discovered that one hepatitis-testing
laboratory was out of action for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Needles were often dirty, so that many inmates now claim to have
been infected as they gave blood. (People caught in homosexual acts
were, however, removed from the list of suitable donors.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the FDA accused the center of numerous
violations and even ordered a temporary shutdown. It didn't matter.
Arkansas police investigations have shown that HMA continued to try
to find ways to sell inmates' blood, especially to Connaught, a
Canadian company that may have sold the plasma worldwide (the
matter is under investigation).
</P>
<P>
   The Krever Commission found that Connaught decided it was
``impracticable'' to inspect all the plasma-collection sites
itself, and decided to rely instead on FDA reports which it did
not, in fact, review.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Arkansas prison blood products found their way to
Europe and Japan, and in at least one instance were sent back to
the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever trouble appeared, HMA asked for Clinton's help. The
group invited a friend of the governor's, Leonard Dunn (now chief
of staff to the lieutenant-governor), to come on board as HMA's
president in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When the prison's plasma license was revoked, HMA simply applied
for a new one under a different name.
</P>
<P>
   Prison administrators wanted to keep the program, and prisoners
liked it for the pocket money it provided: $7 a pint, with which
they could buy soap and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Henderson, the creator of HMA and chairman of its board,
maintains that AIDS cases simply did not exist in the South during
the 1980s, and that prison plasma was no riskier than other kinds.
</P>
<P>
   However, Art Lockhart, then director of the Arkansas Department
of Correction, contributed in 1984 to an information bulletin about
prison plasma centers published by the American Correctional
Association, in which prison populations were said to be at high
risk, and concerns were raised about ``quality control'' in taking
blood from them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Arkansas Department of Correction went on
running its plasma program for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks the Canadian hemophiliacs will go to
Cummins itself, seeking answers from a state that has long and
steadily denied even having a prison plasma program.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether they will get an invitation to the
prison where, in effect, they received a death sentence. &QL;

   In January, the same group filed a $1 billion suit against the
Canadian government and companies involved in the plasma
production.
</P>
<P>
   This month, it plans to bring lawsuits in the $5 billion range
which will name the FDA, the states of Arkansas and Louisiana,
their prison systems and various medical-care providers for the
prison inmates, including Health Management Associates (HMA), which
ran the Arkansas prison plasma program from 1978 to 1994 and also
bought prison plasma from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The suit may also name the president, if evidence is found that
Clinton knew about repeated FDA violations and yet did not shut
down the plasma industry in his state's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Krever Commission, set up by the Canadian government in 1995
to look into contaminated blood issues, found that the tainted
plasma often came from Cummins Prison in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins is a vast farm-based penitentiary that sits in bleak
countryside, strewn with shanties and burned-out churches, 70 miles
southeast of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates' blood was sold by the Arkansas Department of
Correction to HMA which, in turn, sold it to North American
Biologics, a subsidiary of Continental Pharma Cryosan, a
blood-broker based in Montreal. From there, it was shipped all
through Canada and across the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arkansans seemed unaware of the plasma program in their
state prisons until last summer, when Michael Galster, a prison
doctor, wrote a fictionalized account that exposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In past news reports, prison officials had denied knowledge of
what was going on. Yet not only did the prisons run such a program
from 1969 on, they were often in trouble for it.
</P>
<P>
   In Cummins, even when the existence of AIDS and hepatitis C was
recognized and tests for these diseases became available, they were
not always used; the FDA discovered that one hepatitis-testing
laboratory was out of action for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Needles were often dirty, so that many inmates now claim to have
been infected as they gave blood. (People caught in homosexual acts
were, however, removed from the list of suitable donors.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the FDA accused the center of numerous
violations and even ordered a temporary shutdown. It didn't matter.
Arkansas police investigations have shown that HMA continued to try
to find ways to sell inmates' blood, especially to Connaught, a
Canadian company that may have sold the plasma worldwide (the
matter is under investigation).
</P>
<P>
   The Krever Commission found that Connaught decided it was
``impracticable'' to inspect all the plasma-collection sites
itself, and decided to rely instead on FDA reports which it did
not, in fact, review.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Arkansas prison blood products found their way to
Europe and Japan, and in at least one instance were sent back to
the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever trouble appeared, HMA asked for Clinton's help. The
group invited a friend of the governor's, Leonard Dunn (now chief
of staff to the lieutenant-governor), to come on board as HMA's
president in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When the prison's plasma license was revoked, HMA simply applied
for a new one under a different name.
</P>
<P>
   Prison administrators wanted to keep the program, and prisoners
liked it for the pocket money it provided: $7 a pint, with which
they could buy soap and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Henderson, the creator of HMA and chairman of its board,
maintains that AIDS cases simply did not exist in the South during
the 1980s, and that prison plasma was no riskier than other kinds.
</P>
<P>
   However, Art Lockhart, then director of the Arkansas Department
of Correction, contributed in 1984 to an information bulletin about
prison plasma centers published by the American Correctional
Association, in which prison populations were said to be at high
risk, and concerns were raised about ``quality control'' in taking
blood from them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Arkansas Department of Correction went on
running its plasma program for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks the Canadian hemophiliacs will go to
Cummins itself, seeking answers from a state that has long and
steadily denied even having a prison plasma program.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether they will get an invitation to the
prison where, in effect, they received a death sentence. &QL;

<P>
   RICHMOND, VA. _ As America's black farmers see it, they are not
much better off than the slaves and sharecroppers from whom many of
them are descended.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, whose numbers have dwindled from about 925,000 in
1920 to fewer than 20,000 today _ about 1 percent of all American
farmers _ have long claimed that, because of the color of their
skin, they have been denied loans, disaster relief and other aid
from the federal Agriculture Department (USDA).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, several thousand black farmers joined a $2.5 billion
lawsuit alleging discrimination by the agriculture agency _ derided
by some as the ``last plantation'' _ between 1983 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Brown, a 72-year-old tobacco farmer in Brunswick County,
Va., claimed that blacks usually had difficulty getting
appointments at the local Farmers Home Administration Office, and
that his local agent would delay co-signing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was going out of his way to put me out of
the farming business,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Another black farmer in Virginia, who abandoned farming and is
now a counsellor at a federal prison, alleged that Farmers Home
would never lend him enough to expand his small farm.
</P>
<P>
   But, said James Beverly of Nottoway County: ``They'd give
Caucasian farmers operating loan and operating loan, year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has acknowledged problems in its dealings with black
farmers. Dan Glickman, the agriculture secretary, has heard their
concerns at firsthand at more than a dozen town hall meetings
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report for the agency concluded that ``minority farmers
have lost significant amounts of land and potential income as a
result of discrimination'' in USDA programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration suggests that much of the blame
lies with Ronald Reagan, under whom, in 1983, the department closed
down the investigative wing of its civil-rights office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the farmers and the Clinton administration settled
the lawsuit just before a scheduled trial in February. But now the
deal, worth $400 million, is in jeopardy from the very farmers who
wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   They say it is not enough, and they want Paul Friedman, a
federal district court judge in Washington, to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, between 2,000 and 4,000 farmers would have
received damage awards of $50,000 from the department, most of it
tax-free. The USDA would also have forgiven their outstanding
loans.
</P>
<P>
   But ``$50,000 is a drop in the bucket for a lifetime of
losses,'' says John Boyd, the president of the National Black
Farmers Association and a point man in negotiations with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   How inadequate is the payout? According to Vernon Breckenridge
of Hennessey, Okla., one of the 400 farmers who jammed Judge
Friedman's courtroom in protest on March 2, ``It won't even buy a
mid-sized tractor, much less the equipment to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more satisfied. J.L. Chesnut, a prominent
civil-rights lawyer from Alabama who represented the farmers,
argued that the deal, while certainly not perfect, was a
``watershed for justice'' which would quickly pump cash into a
large number of farms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawsuit has been about discrimination as much as about
sums of money, and other plaintiff lawyers say it does nothing to
erase racism inside the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd is attempting to highlight the problems of racism with a
$10 million lawsuit, filed a week before the hearing in Judge
Friedman's courtroom, which alleges that a top aide in the USDA
called him a ``nigger.'' The official denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   There is little Judge Friedman can do at this point. He can
formally reject or approve the deal, to which he gave his
preliminary blessing in January, but he cannot sweeten it. The
settlement includes a proviso allowing some farmers to argue for
bigger damage payments before an independent arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers may derive some solace, however, from Judge
Friedman's strong criticism of the USDA. ``We ought,'' he said,
``to be ashamed.'' &QL;

BORDER _ A customs officer sent to check a pre-dawn border alarm at
a remote desert crossing this week found himself ducking gunfire
from a Mexican military unit he says had crossed into Arizona. Rob
Daniels, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, said
U.S. law enforcement agencies increasingly suspect that some of the
crossings occur not because traffickers are being chased, but
because they are being protected. By DENNIS WAGNER. Story will move

DOLE (PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz.) _ Elizabeth Dole accomplished what
she set out to do in Arizona on Thursday: glad-hand a few politicos
and make important contacts but avoid answering any real questions

   SAN DIEGO, CALIF. _ Three years ago, it seemed that opponents of
huge sports stadiums had won. Such stadiums, they argued, did not
bring economic salvation to cities. The taxpayers believed them,
and in city after city referendums proposing new stadiums were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tide has turned. Voters in San Diego, Denver and, most
recently, Pittsburgh have all approved new stadiums, to be paid for
largely with public money.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change of heart? After all, even the smoothest
politician hesitates to justify handouts to profitable sports
monopolies owned by millionaires. And nobody has refuted the
blizzard of studies showing that such stadiums have considerably
less economic impact than their supporters suggest.
</P>
<P>
   One such study, by Andrew Zimbalist and Roger Noll, economists
at Smith College and Stanford respectively, in the 1997 ``Brookings
Review,'' showed that Baltimore got only $3 million a year net, in
new jobs and extra tax revenues, from its $200 million Camden Yards
baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the promoters' patter has got better. In the past, the
critics argued that, at the very least, stadium projects needed to
include more than stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   If they did not offer broader benefits to city-dwellers, they
were doing no more, in effect, than transferring wealth from
taxpayers to sports-franchise owners. Enterprising stadium backers
have taken this criticism to heart. Now they promise to spread the
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problems remain. Take the new $411 million ballpark for
the San Diego Padres, which was approved in a referendum in
November. The project's promoters _ chief among them the city's
mayor, Susan Golding _ argue that the ballpark is merely one piece
of a billion-dollar downtown rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 26 blocks of the city's core will be refurbished
with 600,000 square feet of office space, 150,000 square feet of
retail space and 850 new hotel rooms, as well as the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   This is a complex project, one that requires cooperation among
lots of private and public organizations, and it has already missed
some of its early deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Understandable, no doubt; but at least some of the financing
comes from revenues that are projected to pour into the city's
coffers from a tax on new hotel rooms. These hotels, of course, are
not yet built.
</P>
<P>
   The city also estimates that hotel-room tax revenues will grow
by 8 percent a year, a level reached only in the present boom.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seems to be expecting an office-space bonanza of
the sort that caused many American cities to come a cropper in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   More problems are on display in the Pittsburgh project. In
January Pennsylvania's legislature approved a $650 million increase
in the state's debt ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   This is enough to float a bond issue from which $320 million is
earmarked to subsidize four new professional sports stadiums; the
rest is aimed at a hodgepodge of other projects, such as building
an aquarium in Erie and a convention center in Altoona.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters maintain that there are tight financial controls on
project overruns, and call the additional expenditures in
Pittsburgh the economic link that has been missing in past
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the financial controls are lax, and call the
extra money pork-barrel politics _ obvious (and successful)
attempts to buy votes for initiatives that were otherwise unpopular
with Pennsylvania's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College, a frequent critic of stadium
subsidies, draws an analogy between the complex, interlocking
Pittsburgh projects and omnibus trade bills, and suggests that
voters need what many presidents covet, a line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   In all these projects, a fundamental question remains. Will the
net revenues be positive? In other words, will success hurt the
city's existing retailers, or will people come from elsewhere to
swell the total number of money-spenders?
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 paper by Mark Rosentraub, an economist at Indiana
University, argued that stadium-driven downtown developments, such
as one he studied in Indianapolis, had little economic benefit _ so
little, in fact, that Indianapolis would probably have done better
to spend its money on something else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest variations on the stadium game have managed to
divide the opposition. Back in 1996, George Will, a conservative
columnist, wrote a scathing column criticizing stadium subsidies as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, there was Will in the pages of San Diego's Union
Tribune making an exception for the San Diego Padres (of which he
is a director).
</P>
<P>
   Even economists have been caught in the cross fire. Rosentraub
has written a consulting report that supports the
stadium-cum-downtown-development project in San Diego, despite his
earlier study arguing that such developments did no good.
</P>
<P>
   Team owners in Pittsburgh, Denver and San Diego are
understandably elated. After all, despite the cities' claims of
tight budgets, wealthy owners have still gained access to the
public purse while other needy institutions go wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the critics should have been more careful in saying what
they wished for. Having been asked to make more wide-ranging
economic promises, stadium supporters have obligingly delivered _
with riskier projects and even more nebulous benefits. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ It is hard to believe that the streets of San'ya, a
Tokyo neighborhood of liquor shops and cheap hotels, could once be
controlled only by riot police.
</P>
<P>
   The police are still there, holed up in the ``Mammoth,'' a
multi-story police box that overlooks the biggest of San'ya's
flophouses. But they get no trouble these days.
</P>
<P>
   San'ya has aged with its residents, old men with creased faces
and missing teeth who squat and smoke on the pavements, drift from
bar to bar, or sleep it off in the winter sun on cardboard and
plastic matting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will spend the night on the street, too. San'ya has
more than 1,500 homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness is rising fast in Japan's big cities. Most Japanese
blame the recession. Everyone has a story to tell about the
white-collar ``sarariman'' who lost his job and then his family,
and who now lives in a cardboard box on the station concourse,
still reading the financial pages every day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of Japan's homeless have never set foot inside an
office, let alone read the Nikkei newspaper. However, the recession
has played its part in the recent surge in vagrancy in Japanese
cities, especially with the collapse in demand for day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   San'ya is one of Japan's biggest ``yoseba,'' a neighborhood
where day laborers gather early in the morning to pick up work on
construction sites. At its most prosperous, during the construction
boom in the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, San'ya was home to
15,000 day laborers. There are now only about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The state pension begins at 65, but after a day laborer turns
55, says Takao Yamauchi, who runs a local welfare center, his
chances of picking up work are slim. The average age of San'ya's
day laborers is 56.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have exhausted their savings, says Yamauchi, they are
out on the street. Some have stayed in the neighborhood. Others
live in train stations and under the blue-sheet tents that are
spreading through Tokyo's public parks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the Tokyo city government, 60
percent of the city's homeless say their last job was as a day
laborer.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s San'ya was enjoying a second construction
boom, thanks to soaring land and stock prices. The most skilled
workers, the athletic ``tobi'' who handle the scaffolding for
high-rise buildings, were then able to earn several hundred dollars
a day.
</P>
<P>
   But like the economy, it was a bubble that only masked the
long-term decline of this way of life.
</P>
<P>
   More and more construction companies are now hiring cheaper
foreign workers, both legitimate and illegal, who come from
Southeast Asia and the Asian subcontinent. They are also
mechanizing more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As the day laborers bear the brunt of the job cuts, San'ya's
community has collapsed. Yamauchi says that only a couple of
hundred workers turn up for the morning labor markets, compared
with several thousand a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing a bit of food, temporary shelter and medical
care, the Tokyo government has started a new job scheme for
San'ya's workers, employing them to clean government property, weed
the parks and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this, some of the homeless earn enough to sleep in a
flophouse at least one night a week, though not enough to qualify
for unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   When they were younger, these men took to the streets to fight
their exploitation by the ``yakuza,'' the organized crime
syndicates which still run the local labor-broking and gambling
rackets. But the old men of San'ya have no fight left in them. &QL;

   When they were younger, these men took to the streets to fight
their exploitation by the ``yakuza,'' the organized crime
syndicates which still run the local labor-broking and gambling
rackets. But the old men of San'ya have no fight left in them. &QL;

DOLE MEETS ARIZONA JET SET, AVOIDS QUESTIONS ON ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. _ Elizabeth Dole accomplished what she
set out to do in Arizona on Thursday: glad-hand a few politicos and
make important contacts but avoid answering any real questions
about her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dole attended an event at a Paradise Valley home hosted by
former Attorney General Grant Woods and designed to raise her
profile in an important early primary state.
</P>
<P>
   When she did briefly speak with reporters, Dole made it clear
she will contest Arizona. She has already planned return visits in
April and May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think Arizona is looking real good, based on the
wonderful outpouring today,'' said Dole, who formed an exploratory
committee Wednesday in Iowa and who heads Friday to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most telling part of the event was the effort
made by Dole's aides to keep her at arm's length from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   If she runs, Dole will join Texas Gov. George W. Bush at the
head of a growing list of GOP candidates. However, she has yet to
define for what she stands or to where she would like to lead the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized the former cabinet secretary for relying
too heavily on canned speeches and scripted events, and Thursday's
appearance did little to change those perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Before she arrived, Dole's traveling press secretary asked
journalists to ``pre-position'' themselves away from the driveway
to the home, where Dole got out of a sport-utility vehicle. The
press secretary repeatedly barked at reporters to back away from
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, reporters were ushered into the home in groups of three
to observe Dole meeting with guests. They were allowed to take
pictures but not ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the press aide, Joyce Campbell, tried to move
Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza out of a doorway so she could herd
reporters away from a table where Dole was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you all get what you need?'' asked another press aide
after the tour. Reporters responded with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to control what they want me to control,'' the
aide later said, apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell later added that the event was intended as a photo
opportunity, not a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dole later took reporters' questions for less than two minutes.
She emphasized that the goal of the event was to meet people and
get their ideas for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who attended said Dole went from table to table,
looking at issues like national defense and education that guests
had written on 4-by-6 notecards. She then discussed the issues with
those at each table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a people-to-people effort,'' Dole said. ``I've been
listening to their interests and their concerns. . . . It's
extremely helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many in attendance were the well-connected set usually
seen at society gatherings in the Valley. Political consultant
Jason Rose, Channel 15 anchor Robin Sewell, Phoenix Coyotes
President Shawn Hunter, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless and a
smattering of lobbyists attended the event. Valet parking was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who would be the first woman to be elected president, also
praised Arizona voters for electing five women to statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful, the five women who are leading this
state,'' Dole said. ``You are really showing the rest of the nation
something very interesting and very impressive, in terms of the
leadership of women.'' &QL;

STARR'S SPOKESMAN RESIGNS ABRUPTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 4th graf) (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief spokesman for Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who has been investigating President Clinton,
abruptly resigned on Thursday, as Starr asked the Justice
Department to look into unauthorized disclosures of confidential
material from his own office.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Charles Bakaly, has resigned effective June 1,
but will cease his duties immediately and go on paid administrative
leave until then, Starr said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr said he accepted the resignation ``with regret,''
there was no doubt that Bakaly's departure and the unauthorized
disclosures were linked. Disclosure of confidential material
related to an investigation cna lead to criminal charges, or result
in professional sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly has retained a lawyer, Howard Shapiro, who issued a
statement that his client would cooperate fully with the Justice
Department inquiry and was ``confident that he will be found not to
have violated any statute, regulation or court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he had referred to the Justice Department the results
of his office's internal inquiry into possible unauthorized
disclosures that led to a front-page article in The New York Times
on Jan. 31. The Times reported on that day that Starr had concluded
that he had the constitutional authority to seek an indictment of
Clinton before Clinton left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's new Washington spokeswoman, Elizabeth Ray, did not
return a telephone call seeking comment on Thursday's developments.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of Clinton's attempts to conceal his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky led to Clinton's impeachment. He
was acquitted in the Senate of obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article said that Starr had concluded, after
conferring with two constitutional-law scholars in his office, that
he had the authority to seek an indictment of a sitting president,
but that he had not yet decided whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The article cited ``several associates'' of Starr as sources of
information and quoted Bakaly as saying: ``We will not discuss the
plans of this office or the plans of the grand jury in any way,
shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   The article prompted Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, to accuse
the independent counsel's office of leaking information on Starr's
thinking _ an accusation that Bakaly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he had no comment on Bakaly's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oreskes, The Times' Washington bureau chief, said, ``We
do not discuss the sources of our stories.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, confirmed that
Starr had notified the department that he would forward the results
of his internal inquiry. Marlin said the department had not
received the data pertaining to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we receive it,'' Marlin said, ``we will determine how
best to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement on Bakaly's behalf, Shapiro said that, with the
``high-profile phase'' of Starr's investigation largely completed,
this was ``a logical time for Bakaly to make the transition back to
the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, a lawyer from Los Angeles, joined Starr's office last
May. Before that, he was a spokesman for another independent
counsel, Donald Smaltz, who unsuccessfully prosecuted Clinton's
former agriculture secretary, Mike Espy.

ANDERSON PART OF ANGELS TRADE TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Talk around the Cactus League is that the Angels
may be nearing a deal that involves outfielder Garret Anderson for
a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   For what pitcher and to what team remain to be seen, but it is
believed the Angels are becoming more and more convinced that
keeping four outfielders won't work.
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson is traded, that would free up the DH spot for Todd
Greene, whose ailing shoulder is still preventing him from
catching. Hitting, though, hasn't bothered Greene. Greene is
hitting .333 (5 for 15) with a homer and two RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays are shopping pitcher Pat Hentgen, but Blue
Jays general manager Gord Ash has implied that Anderson would not
be enough for Hentgen.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, though, could be packaged with minor-leaguers, like
pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, who started Thursday's game against the
Oakland A's. Schoeneweis was impressive, giving up two runs and
four hits in three innings against the A's major-league lineup. He
struck out Matt Stairs and Ben Grieve in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who is used to trade rumors, said it doesn't bother
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' Anderson said. ``There's nothing to
comment on. It's hard to talk about something that hasn't happened.
You just wait and see.... It's not like I have one year in the
majors, so I'm not worried about anything. I've established myself
at this level. They (front office) control the business. I control
what I do on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley update: Pitcher Chuck Finley (muscle strain upper
back/neck) threw Thursday and is expected to throw off the mound
for the first time on Saturday. He's scheduled to make his first
Cactus League start Tuesday against the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Third-base battle: Troy Glaus had a good day Thursday in his bid
to win the starting job at third base. Vying for the spot with Dave
Hollins, Glaus made a nice play on a chopper hit by the A's Ryan
Christenson, fielding the ball on an in-between hop and throwing
out Christenson with the bases loaded and two out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Glaus ripped a double to the fence in right-center
field to drive in Matt Luke and Tim Salmon, giving the Angels a 6-2
lead on their way to a 16-15 win at Tempe Diablo Stadium. In the
fourth, Glaus drove in two more runs with a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing good,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``He's
swinging the bat good.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hollins will start the next three games at third.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of offense: Glaus, though, wasn't the only hitter to have
a big day. The two teams combined for 37 hits in what Collins and
others termed an ``ugly game.'' It got so bad that at one point,
three Angels pitchers _ Reid Cornelius, Darrin Winston and Geoff
Edsell _ combined for 100 pitches in 11/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels nearly blew a 16-3 lead, as the A's scored four in
the seventh and eight in the eighth before the Angels finally
closed it out. Luke threw out the A's Mike Neill at the plate from
right field in the ninth to keep the game from going longer than
the three hours and 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A's manager Art Howe came out to argue the call, and wasn't the
only person to believe that Neill was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked safe to me,'' Luke said. ``But I was a mile away.
The ump (Derryl Cousins) called him out. That's all that matters.''

VALENZUELA'S LAWYER CLAIMS MISTAKEN IDENTITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPLE CITY -- A simple case of mistaken identity landed jockey
Pat Valenzuela in jail on charges he robbed a cabbie at gunpoint,
Valenzuela's attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 36, once one of the nation's top jockeys, was
arrested Feb. 26 in Rosemead, outside a Garvey Avenue bar on
suspicion of armed robbery. He is being held at Men's Central Jail
in lieu of $75,000 bail. He is due in court Monday for a
preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty doggone clear that this is a case of mistaken
identification,'' said Valenzuela's attorney, Don Calabria. ``It's
a real tragedy that he's been arrested in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Valenzuela could be sentenced to four years
in state prison. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment March 2.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, Jose Valdez, a driver with the
Green Valley Cab Company, was dispatched Feb. 24 to an undisclosed
address in Rosemead where he picked up a male passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man outside the residence gets in the cab and robs it at
gunpoint,'' Sheriff's Lt. Stuart Heller said. ``The cab driver
calls the police and gave description of a small statured man,
wearing a baseball cap and jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Late the next evening, Valdez was dispatched to Spikes Bar and
Restaurant on Garvey Avenue in Rosemead, Heller said. The location
is a few blocks from where the robbery occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the bar, he's approached by this small guy who asks, `Are
you the taxi cab driver? I want to go El Monte and I'll give you a
$1 to take me there,''' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the conversation, Valdez began to believe
he was talking to the same man took his money the night before,
Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point (Valdez) phoned the Sheriff's Department and
identified (Valenzuela) as the guy who robbed him,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   It is what then happened that leads Calabria to believe
Valenzuela is not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, the victim was not able to pick (Valenzuela) out
of a photo line up,'' Calabria said. `'Also there was no gun found
in (Valenzuela's) possession.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Calabria said Valenzuela has an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of (the robbery) he was at a friend's house and
they watched the Emmys or something of that nature,'' Calabria
said. ``They watched it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend was not identified. The Grammy Awards were on
television the night of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Heller said the Sheriff's Department is still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be more than happy to find out that (Valenzuela's)
innocent,'' Heller said. ``We are continuing to look into this.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem Valenzuela will have to overcome is public
perception. He won the 1989 Kentucky Derby and was one of the top
riders in the nation. But the jockey has had several highly
publicized bouts with drug abuse. Two years ago he was accused of
spousal assault.
</P>
<P>
   Calabria acknowledged Valenzuela's past drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope he's got that under control at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary hearing is scheduled to get under way at 9 a.m.
it will likely be postponed until Wednesday, Calabria said.
</P>
<P>
   `` He didn't do this,'' the attorney said. ``I know I'm going to
win this case.''

 &HT;    Nothing finer than ... Weber
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Weber State ended the first day of the NCAA Tournament
Thursday with a stunning upset that might be remembered as one of
the biggest surprises ever in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, the No. 14 seed in the West Regional, shocked
third-seeded North Carolina 76-74 in Seattle. It was only the sixth
NCAA Tournament victory in school history for Weber State, the Big
Sky Conference champion, while the loss ended an remarkable
postseason streak for the Tar Heels, who had advanced to the Final
Four the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina had not lost a first-round game since the
tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 and it was the first time
since 1980 that the Tar Heels had not won at least one tournament
game.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina was the only high seed to lose on opening day.
Auburn, the top seed in the South Regional, routed Winthrop 80-41
in Indianapolis, extending the streak of victories by No. 1 seeds
against No. 16 seeds in the tournament. Since the tournament
expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the No. 1 seed has won 57 consecutive
games in the 1-16 matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The South's top four seeds cruised on opening day as Maryland,
St. John's and Ohio State joined Auburn with victories. Maryland
eliminated Valparaiso, last season's Cinderella which advanced to
the Sweet 16, while St. John's routed Samford and Ohio State downed
Murray State.
</P>
<P>
   There were two games in the South Regional in which
higher-seeded teams lost as No. 9 Oklahoma State edged No. 8
Syracuse and No. 10 Creighton upset No. 7 Louisville.

DODGERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ The big pieces are in place for the Dodgers: The
pitching rotation, the starting shortstop, the backup catcher.
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks into spring training, and with three weeks
remaining, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson has questions that need to
be answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy is sore, I want to know who is going to play where,''
Johnson said. ``And I want them to know what their role is.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Johnson's questions:
</P>
<P>
   Who's the backup first baseman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that (Scott) Livingstone and (Dave) Hansen could play
over there,'' Johnson said. ``But could Todd (Hollandsworth) play
over there?''
</P>
<P>
   Who's the best long-term backup outfielder?
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to any one of my outfielders, who's my
best left fielder, center fielder, right fielder?'' Johnson said.
``My contingency plans... what's my backup plan?''
</P>
<P>
   When will the bullpen work itself out?
</P>
<P>
   ``By next week I want to know who's going to be doing what so I
can get that going,'' Johnson said. ``Then I can begin setting that
up.''
</P>
<P>
   No thanks, still: Montreal manager Felipe Alou and Johnson, also
known as choices No.1 and No.2 for the Dodgers manager's job, met
behind the batting cage and talked before Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Alou took a few moments to state he had no regrets
about turning down the offer to manager the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over 60. When you make a decision at this age, it's a
decision you're sure of,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Alou also said he wanted to remain in Montreal until the
ownership squabble concludes. There is speculation Expos president
and general partner Claude Brochu will move the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see this storm brewing many, many years ago,'' Alou
said. ``I always said I didn't want to see this from a distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's spring training: Kevin Brown pitched four innings,
yielding one run on five hits against the Expos. A good
performance, but not anything to get excited about, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is getting innings in, pitches in, and walking out
healthy,'' Brown said. ``I don't put too much emphasis on (spring
training starts).''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna update: Johnson said right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna,
who had elbow surgery in September, is still a week away from
pitching in a game. Osuna has thrown off the mound a few times but
will need a few more outings on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still plenty of time,'' Johnson said. ``I may not get him
stretched out like I want to get him stretched out, but he should
be able to get his arm strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hitters... and pitchers: Shortstop Jose Vizcaino was
scheduled to make the trip to Jupiter but needed another day to
rest the bruised back of his knee.... Closer Jeff Shaw is scheduled
to return to Dodgertown today and could pitch in a spring training
game as early as Sunday, Johnson said.... Outfielder Hiram
Bocachica was the right fielder against the Expos, his first action
since colliding with Trenidad Hubbard on Monday. Hubbard, whose
right thumb remains swollen, said he's hoping to return Sunday or
Monday.

KNICKS DEFEAT WIZARDS, 98-86

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks turned over the couch cushions,
emptied the ashtrays and found some loose change for Marcus Camby
on Thursday. It was not big money, not the $70 million maximums his
1996 draft peers have received over the last few weeks. But it was
a contract extension nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   He was set. Camby had financial security after signing a
six-year deal that guaranteed him $40 million and another $8
million in incentives. Instead of reclining on his newfound wealth,
Camby leaped off the bench and delivered the kind of effort that
left him looking like a bargain for a night.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was more than a valuable plug-in for the injured Patrick
Ewing as the Knicks pulled away for an easy 98-86 victory over the
Washington Wizards on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   With grace that left him appearing more fluid than frail, Camby
was able to dribble and drive for finger rolls, as well as slip
back-door and spring up for dunks on his way to a season-high 19
points. With uncharacteristic aggression, he tore away loose balls
as he collected a season-high 12 rebounds in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Season-high night. Season-high feeling.
</P>
<P>
   `'I think it was just a coincidence that I had a good game after
signing my contract,'' said Camby, who can opt out of his deal
after five years. `'I haven't been going out and trying to play for
a contract. I just love to play. Now, I just have to stay focused.
I am not going to go out there and get lazy. You can't be lazy in
this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby had the crowd calling for his name when he was resting on
the bench. He has come a long way from the newcomer who had his
work ethic questioned by Coach Jeff Van Gundy in training camp. He
has come far, but the Wizards are not exactly the measuring stick
for Camby or the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks moved the ball well and leaned on Larry Johnson (17
points) and Allan Houston (19 points) just as they did last season,
when Ewing missed 56 games with a wrist injury. But the impact of
Ewing's absence _ which could extend another week or longer because
of tendinitis in his Achilles' tendon _ was not felt that much
against the center-less Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the injured Rod Strickland was not around to toy
with the Knicks and that the Wizards' undersized center, Terry
Davis, left the game after he was kicked in the jaw early in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks have made easy nights difficult this season.
After losing three 1-point games in the last week _ and losing five
of their last seven games before last night _ the Knicks were
thrilled to build a 17-point lead in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Third quarters had been their undoing this season. But with
uncanny efficiency _ 29 assists to 10 turnovers on the night _ the
Knicks savored their chance to assemble a rare double-digit lead.
They also enjoyed an infrequent night of out-rebounding an
opponent, 44-34.
</P>
<P>
   `'It was a good, solid win,'' Van Gundy said. `'This is a
totally different group'' _ than the Knick team that survived
without Ewing last season _ ``but we had the balance and
determination that are going to be critical as we try to get
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby had that edge, as did Kurt Thomas. After not scoring in
the Knicks' loss to Milwaukee Tuesday, Thomas found his game again
and tied his season high of 17 points. Suddenly, the maligned front
court of the Knicks was doing exactly what the forwards were paid
to do: take over.
</P>
<P>
   Camby did his part. He made himself look like a bargain at $48
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well,'' Van Gundy said. ``He kept the ball alive on
the offensive boards and he defensive rebounded better than he has
been, which is good. I thought he guarded Juwan Howard well in
concert with Larry Johnson and then Chris Dudley. We needed all the
scoring we could get. So to get 19, that's great.''

CUSTOMS SERVICE SAYS MEXICAN TROOPS FIRED FROM U.S. SOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A customs officer sent to check a pre-dawn border alarm at a
remote desert crossing this week found himself ducking gunfire from
a Mexican military unit he says had crossed into Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadowy world of the border, where it's sometimes
impossible to tell the drug smugglers from the good guys, the
customs officer didn't assume it was accidental fire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to the Customs Service, he retreated about a
mile from the border south of Sells, linked up with more customs
officers and returned to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican troops then told customs officers that they had been
in Mexico when they fired warning shots while chasing two
drug-laden vehicles. They denied entering the United States at the
border crossing southwest of Tucson on the Tohono O'odham
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican consular official in Nogales, Sonora, backed his
military's description of events. But customs officials, in a
carefully worded statement, suggested the Mexican soldiers had
crossed the border.
</P>
<P>
   Customs spokesman Roger Maier in El Paso declined to elaborate
on the investigation or speculate on motives for the alleged
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Daniels, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's Tucson sector,
said such border crossings are a recurring problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Daniels said U.S. law enforcement agencies increasingly suspect
that some of the crossings occur not because traffickers are being
chased, but because they are being protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had situations occur in Nogales, in Naco and in
Douglas,'' Daniels said. ``More times than not, it's Mexican
military, but it can be police, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Burgos, spokesman for Mexican consul Roberto Rodriguez
in Nogales, called those suggestions ``very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They must be ready to prove it,'' he said. ``People shouldn't
base these statements on suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject is a sensitive one in the wake of President
Clinton's decision late last month to recertify Mexico as ``fully
cooperating'' in the U.S. fight against trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did so despite some opposition in Congress, and even
among members of his own administration. The Drug Enforcement
Administration has publicly said that deep corruption riddles
Mexico's anti-narcotics corps.
</P>
<P>
   According to the customs statement, an unidentified officer
responded about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday to reports of an unlawful
crossing at the San Miguel gate on the border south of Sells.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed an embankment and saw headlights ``of what appeared
to be a military Humvee north of the border and a man in an olive
drab uniform walking near a dirt road'' on the U.S. side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   A Humvee is a rugged, all-terrain vehicle designed for military
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer heard a rifle shot and then a bullet strike the
embankment,'' the customs statement said. ``The officer heard two
additional bullets pass above his head.''
</P>
<P>
   He took cover and heard a vehicle cross the metal cattle guard
at the gate on the border. He retreated about one mile north of the
border and linked up with other customs officers. They returned to
the San Miguel gate, where they met up with one Mexican military
officer and four soldiers, all of whom were on the Mexican side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican army officer told customs officials that the
Mexican army Humvee had chased two vehicles north and caught one at
the gate,'' the customs statement said. The military group showed
U.S. officers a pickup full of marijuana and two prisoners, and
explained the shooting as warning shots fired into the air. They
denied crossing into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Burgos said the lack of clear border markings in the rural area
could have led to confusion about where the military was.
</P>
<P>
   However, the customs statement said its officers saw apparent
Humvee tracks and fresh boot tracks leading about a quarter-mile
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials in Washington, D.C., were unaware of
the incident, as was Jane Gray, principal U.S. consular officer in
Nogales, Sonora. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE HAS EVERYONE'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ USA Today interviewed them, along with
newspapers in San Jose, Denver and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was interested in the Cal State Northridge story. The
same questions women's coach Frozena Jerro answered four months ago
were being asked again.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, Jerro had more than a drug arrest to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, (CSUN player) Edniesha Curry and I were on the
phone for at least an hour (giving interviews),'' said Jerro.
``Before, we knew what it was about. It's good to finally talk
about our accomplishments and not something negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of former CSUN head coach Michael Abraham for drug
trafficking just a week before the season began in November had
been a dead issue with the Matadors by February. After all, they
were winning games and bonding as a group after the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But when CSUN won the Big Sky Conference regular season title,
then the conference tournament, Jerro knew she was going to have to
talk about it again.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (21-7) is here to play in the NCAA Women's Tournament for
the first time in school history. The Matadors, seeded No.15, play
second-seeded Colorado State (31-2) tonight at 9:07 p.m. on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through Thursday's press conference, after she and
players Jamilah Jones and Lynda Amari were asked about the
controversial start to the season, Jerro showed a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once things kind of fell into place and we knew what our
situation was going to be, it was a little easier to comment on
it,'' Jerro said. ``It's (funny) the way we keep saying `it' and
`what.' That's what makes this an intriguing story.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Matadors' season has been ``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' she said. ``It's an amazement to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing is Jones talking about the team preparing for ``a fourth
season,'' meaning the NCAA Tournament. Forget the Abraham arrest.
This program was among the worst in the nation from 1994-97,
winning a combined 10 games, including just one in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN hasn't had this much attention for women's basketball
since, well, November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is not downplay the fact that we're
here but not allowing it to be a distraction,'' Jerro said. ``Not
getting so excited and so amazed that it's distracting to us. It's
just another big game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the biggest in school history against an opponent hungry
for a trip to San Jose for the women's Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State is ranked No.7 in the country and features
All-American guard Becky Hammon, a senior averaging 22.6 points per
game. The Rams were eliminated in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament last year at Purdue, 77-63.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon was asked to recall the scene in the locker room after
last year's season-ending loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of tears,'' she said. ``I remember this
feeling of saying `It's not going to happen next year, it's not
going to happen next year.'''
</P>
<P>
   CSU head coach Tom Collen, who has led the Rams to a 55-8 record
in two seasons, anticipates CSUN to put on a full-court press and
not shy away from an up-tempo game.

$8.3 MILLION FOR MCCAW'S PARADISE VALLEY ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 and CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of living large just went up _ by nearly $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   At $8.3 million, last week's sale of an 8,000-square-foot
mansion on Camelback Mountain is the priciest home deal ever
recorded in Arizona, topping billionaire Bennett Dorrance's $5.5
million home sale last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rambling estate _ in Paradise Valley, of course _ comes with
a six-car garage and parking for 50 close friends, a private movie
theater, floor-to-ceiling windows facing Mummy Mountain, a guest
house and a bathroom to bedroom ratio of 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly owned by Seattle sports mogul John E. McCaw, the
house's new inhabitants are somewhat mysterious. Paperwork lists
the purchaser as a corporate entity formed for a family trust.
</P>
<P>
   The sale continues a trend in home-buying in metro Phoenix,
where prices have surged in the past five years. The number of
homes selling for seven-digit prices has tripled since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, almost 170 homes sold for at least $1 million, which
set a record for million-dollar deals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those were in Paradise Valley, where the land alone can
command a seven-figure price if it's nestled against one of the
town's landmark mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sale price for the 10-acre McCaw estate was a
record in Arizona for a single-family resale home, it isn't the
most expensive listed in Paradise Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction goes to one of the former homes of the Queen of
Mean, hotel diva Leona Helmsley, who has had her 10-acre estate on
Mummy Mountain listed for $25 million for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hassett of Russ Lyon Realty, who handled the sale of the
McCaw estate for the buyer, said he has been ``sworn to secrecy''
about the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   The seller's name was found in public documents. McCaw is a
publicity-shy sports enthusiast who owns part of Major League
Baseball's Seattle Mariners and the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of one of the country's richest families, the son
of John Elroy McCaw, radio and cable TV pioneer, and brother of
cellular phone guru Craig McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Store, a company that collects real estate sales
data, lists the buyer as MICI, a Phoenix company. Public records
say MICI is managed by Garth Price, and that the Regency Family
Trust plays a role in the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear who will be living in the home. Efforts to reach
Price for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Shapiro of Coldwell Banker Success Realty, who represented
the seller, also declined to identify the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Hassett would not reveal his commission on the $8.3 million
sale, but said, ``It's a real nice feeling to sell something like
this.``
</P>
<P>
   The former McCaw property has fountains and pools set amid lush
vegetation. Electric security gates bar intruders. An entertainment
room with a projection screen hidden in the ceiling keeps residents
and visitors entertained. And a wet bar along with a heated pool
and spa has the potential to keep them wet. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Who said it was all over? President Clinton may have
survived his impeachment ordeal and the love interest who
precipitated it, Monica Lewinsky, may have left the shores for
England, if only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, Hillary has decided enough is enough with all this
infidelity and is ready to leave the president...perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment Thursday it seemed as if the big puzzle of
the First Couple's marriage had been resolved. One tabloid
newspaper, one television cable channel and one well-known Internet
sleuth were all reporting it: the First Lady had finally read the
riot act to her husband. She could not stand to be with him.
</P>
<P>
   The details were compelling. Remember how last week the First
Couple returned from a skiing weekend in Utah a day early? That was
because of a huge row that ended with Hillary storming out of their
vacation accommodation demanding that her staff pack her bags for
the return journey to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And remember the excuse given for her deciding to forego
accompanying her husband on his trip this week to Central America _
the back strain that was exacerbated by skiing? Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   The truth now: Hillary had at last done what most wives would
have done eons ago: she had blown her stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHILLARY,'' exclaimed the front page of yesterday's New York
Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The bust-up, it informed readers, was precipitated by the
post-Monica claims from Juanita Broaddrick. An Arkansas
businesswoman, she says she was raped by then-Attorney General
Clinton in Arkansas 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the Post offered this irresistible quote, direct from the
First Lady herself: ``I don't want to be in the same room with him,
let alone the same bed.'' It then attributed the quote to a ``TV
news report.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody yesterday could sensibly judge the veracity of the story.
The White House trashed it, but, possibly it is true. But there
were reasons why no other news organizations touched it, including
the sourcing of the information. There wasn't any.
</P>
<P>
   The TV news report said those seemingly explosive words from the
lips of the First Lady had in fact been relayed by others _
``sources close'' to her, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The TV station in question, meanwhile, turned out to be Fox News
Channel, the fledging all-news-all-of-the-time endeavor launched by
Rupert Murdoch. He happens to own the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet sleuth is Matt Drudge, who also offers a version of
the story on his now infamous Internet web page. And where does
Drudge appear regularly as a commentator? The Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Lying behind this story is a furious battle being fought by the
three 24-hour news channels, Fox, MSNBC, owned jointly by NBC and
Microsoft, and CNN. All have seen their ratings nosedive since the
end of the Monicagate scandal and the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, however, is seen by some as best placed to regain its
footing and for one reason _ political attitude. It is unabashedly
conservative and anti-Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Fox unveiled a $4 million promotion campaign for
its news channel. On Monday, meanwhile, it received heartening
news. For the first time, it had overtaken MSNBC in the daily
viewership figures.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox sees the chance to slip past MSNBC in the battle for
households what better story than this one to give it a
turbo-boost? And who, after all, will be able to prove them wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and Bill Deeply in Love Again.'' Now that would be a
story. &QL;

TEXAS' MUONEKE STILL PAYING PRICE FOR MISTAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Texas forward Gabe Muoneke fully expects CBS television
commentators working today's NCAA Tournament game against Purdue to
rehash the history of the volatile nature that led to his one-game
suspension in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commentators are still saying something about it,'' Muoneke
said, shaking his head. ``That's their business and they'll do what
they want regardless of what anyone else tells them. But I'm going
to keep playing basketball regardless and just let things roll.''
</P>
<P>
   As observers use terms like ``war'' to describe today's East
Region battle between No. 7 seed Texas (19-12) and 10th-seeded
Purdue (19-12), it would be natural that the fiery all-Big 12
inside force be mentioned. Especially when the Boilermakers have a
6-foot-8 counterpart in forward Brian Cardinal, whose fearless
manner of play resulted in the moniker, ``Citizen Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   UT's Kris Clack has seen tape of Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two very emotional players,'' Clack said of Muoneke and
Purdue's leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. ``Hopefully,
there won't be any sparks flying and everyone will keep his cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know the type person Gabe is. I knew once he just
started playing and quit worrying about the refs, he was going to
be/Rtough/S to guard and he has been. It's been tough on him, but
Gabe's a good person and I can see the adjustments he's made.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke and Cardinal appear to have mutual admiration. Their
descriptions of each other's ability are similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see how we go at each other,'' said
Cardinal, who, like Muoneke, plays off the glass or can step out
and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe had a terrific year. I know he goes out and plays very
hard, similar to me. He's a hard worker who does what it takes for
his team to win. He does a lot of little things people don't see. I
know our coaches think he's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke was perhaps most impressed by something he didn't see
while watching tape on Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never see him slack off,'' Muoneke said. ``He plays a big
part on their team. He's tough. He doesn't do anything to hurt them
and sometimes that's the best way to help your team, by not doing
anything to hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies part of Muoneke's lasting value to the Longhorns.
By focusing his energy after being suspended for throwing a couple
of punches during the Kansas game on Jan.19, he's ceased being a
distraction. That, even though he has been the focus of some verbal
abuse from opposition fans and has on occasion been baited by
opposition players.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who questioned whether Muoneke would still be a
part of this team at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have admiration for what he's done,'' UT coach Rick
Barnes said. ``We've been on the road a lot and I hear what people
have said to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say it's not fair, but I told him it's something he
brought on himself, that he had to deal with it and he has. It
hasn't been easy, but he's been able to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke said that when he realized he was embarrassing his
family, his attitude changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's reaction was all it took,'' Muoneke said. ``From
then on, I had the mindset that I'd rather play bad and make them
proud than play good and disappoint them.''

FLORIDA A&AMP;M HAVE FUN LAUGHING AT ITSELF AND FATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ If you think you're having a bad day, week,
month or year, consider Florida A&AMP;M. The Rattlers' misfortune goes
way beyond being a mammoth underdog to king-of-the-hill Duke in
today's first-round East Region game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we're going to get beat by the largest margin in
NCAA history,'' Florida A&AMP;M coach Mickey Clayton said. ``We don't
have time for me to tell you about all this team has been through.
We look at it like this: We've already faced all the adversity a
team can face.''
</P>
<P>
   Just coach speak? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, 7-foot-2 shot blocking center Jerome James
left a year early for the NBA. Then two starters suffered
season-ending injuries _ in the same preseason pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this season, the wrong game times were printed in the
local paper. There were 12 people in the stands when one of those
games started and because the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference
office had the wrong game time, officials didn't show up for the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Florida A&AMP;M played 12 of its first 14 games on the road. During
one of those road trips, the basketball training room was
burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying that all we could do is leave the bad times
in 1998 and hope for better things in 1999,'' senior guard and
leading scorer Monroe Pippins said, recalling a New Year's
resolution/wish/prayer.
</P>
<P>
   During a January road trip, sports information director Alvin
Hollins slipped on ice and tore up his knee.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, the bus scheduled to carry the team to the airport
for the MEAC tournament didn't show. On his way to the airport,
Clayton's car was broadsided. The coach and student trainer Thomas
Ray walked away, but Ray had to be cut out of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   And Ray can't practice. Oh, yes, by the way _ the Rattlers have
nine healthy players and Ray can't serve as the 10th. Around
Tallahassee, this A&AMP;M team will be forever known as the Noble Nine.
</P>
<P>
   After going through all this, Florida A&AMP;M's reward is Duke. A
No. 16 seed has never defeated a No. 1 seed in 58 NCAA games. And,
the Rattlers are the 15th team to make the NCAA Tournament field
with a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have no problems motivating ourselves for this game,''
said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose team probably will be
without injured senior guard Trajan Langdon. ``We prepare the same
for every opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke has the nation's longest winning streak (27 games) and is
the only team to go 16-0 in Atlantic Coast Conference (19-0
counting three ACC tourney wins). Florida A&AMP;M's 0-10 start was the
worst in school history and the Rattlers became the lowest-seeded
(seventh) Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference to win the conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a true-life David and Goliath story,'' Clayton said. ``We
spent most of the week searching for rocks big enough to hit 'em
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke has seven McDonald's All-Americans. Florida A&AMP;M's favorite
restaurants on road trips feature the golden arches. Duke is
winning by an average margin of 25 points. The Rattlers are
45-point underdogs. No hope, no chance, no way.
</P>
<P>
   At yesterday's news conference, Pippins, Morris Scott, Kevin
George and Jamaal Rhodes met the media. (Pippins' name card was
spelled Pippens). The foursome was asked if they have dreamed the
dream. What happens if they beat Duke. Four hands shot in the air,
anxious to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure if we win, we'll be on Jay Leno, Oprah,'' Scott said.
``We'd be getting the big hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, do we have to play another game,'' Pippins said.
``I'm really hoping they'll give us those 45 points to start.''
</P>
<P>
   For condemned men, the Rattlers are taking their sentence with
smiles and good humor. It starts with the coach. Clayton's three
daughters all survived difficult, life-threatening births. Playing
Duke? After all that and the travails of this season? Bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we do is easy,'' said Clayton, whose 15 minutes of
good-natured humor earned him applause from the usually stoic
media. ``We got to the airport to fly here, I didn't have a ticket.
I had to buy a ticket. Don't laugh, that's true. We tell people and
they say that didn't happen. We got to Charlotte, we didn't have a
bus. I'm just glad to be here.

STARS CROSS DOOMSAYERS WITH SENSATIONAL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excuse the radical and outrageous opinion, but somebody needed
to finally say it, and I've bravely nominated myself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you read it here first:
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are having a sensational NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   By taking this dramatic personal plunge, it goes against about
seven months of learned hockey wisdom involving some local, some
national, and some Canadian precincts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past baseball season, the Yankees played at a .700
percent clip, stirring many to declare, or at least compare, this
to the greatest clubs of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In this hockey season, the Stars are playing at a .770 percent
clip, and what's the reaction? Mainly, that it's a team facing the
eve of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, it has been repeatedly reported since October
that a disaster in Dallas is waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   So, where is that locker-room rebellion by the players against
mean ol' coach Hitch? This fairy tale hit national print at least
twice. And the angry star who was going to slug Ken Hitchcock _
what happened to Mr. Ali?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the left-handed shot at left winger the Stars
absolutely had to have to round out the top two lines. Bob Gainey
sitting on his front-office butt, not pulling the trigger on that
deal _ just wait 'til March. Yes, the Stars were supposed to be
suffering about now without a southpaw in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   It's March, the Stars are 11-2-2 in their past 15 games, even
with the injured Brett Hull missing the past seven.
</P>
<P>
   And Eddie Belfour _ when does The Eagle start choking? And Roman
Turek _ trade him right now for that left winger. Why have the
luxury of two good goaltenders?
</P>
<P>
   Plus, don't forget that bad slab of ice at Reunion. Nobody can
win playing on that mush.
</P>
<P>
   On and on and on, the bogus information and opinions have piled
up around the Stars. All they've done thus far is establish
themselves as the NHL's very best. And there isn't even a close
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of a time when I was part of a pretty good
team,'' said Gainey, the general manager who was a Hall of Fame
winger in Montreal's dynasty days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were beaten at home one night,'' Gainey continued, ``and
the next morning, the team received great admonishment in the
newspapers for that performance. We had a lead over the rest of the
league that was very substantial, but at practice that morning, the
coach told us he wanted to have a team meeting there on the ice to
address a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The shocked Montreal players gathered around Scotty Bowman,
expecting a verbal wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired,'' Bowman began, ``of the way you guys keep
blowing out the hair driers in the locker room. Those things cost
the club sixteen bucks apiece, and I want this to stop right now.''
Pausing, Bowman then finished with, ``Other than that, our team
doesn't have any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the Stars. Not now. The playoffs, of course, are
coming, and if there's no Stanley Cup being paraded through
downtown Dallas streets in June, then all the criticism will come
back home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   But first had to come the regular season. Based on everything
the Stars have accomplished to date, there is no team better
prepared to tackle the Stanley Cup grind. In fact, late April can't
get here fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey admits to being irked at times over how the Stars are
portrayed in the media, and particularly the early season stories
on locker room rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do realize it's part of the territory,'' he said. ``We want
to be on top, but with that comes more attention. And with that
comes an attitude among some media of how can I look at it
differently, or what do I see with this team that others don't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have difficulty with a little controversy. And when
you take the strong personalities on this team, there are going to
be conflicting opinions and clashes. That is part of the process
when you put a group of talented people together for nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   But in digging through both media reality and fabrication,
Gainey attempts to keep the ice level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take it for what it's worth,'' he said, ``as long as
you remain confident in who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Hitchcock drives this club hard. But who
says too hard? If it's certain players, so what? Players are always
the first to complain. And nobody is perfect. Like Gainey and the
front office making an apparent preseason mistake by not re-signing
left-handed winger Juha Lind, who returned to Finland in a money
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But overall? Let both the record and a season of misinformation
speak to that.

ARKANSAS' HOOD MAY MISS GAME WITH IOWA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Derek Hood, Arkansas' leading rebounder, aggravated a
recurring lower back strain during the team's 94-80 victory against
Siena and is questionable for tomorrow's second-round game against
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, a 6-foot-8 forward, left the court in pain three times
during the second half and sat out the final five minutes. He took
heat and ice treatments after the contest, which ended with Hood
grabbing three rebounds, well below his average of 10.5.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers list him as questionable for the Iowa game, but coach
Nolan Richardson said he expects Hood to see at least limited
action against a Hawkeyes' team that is taller and more physical
than the Razorbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be full-strength, but he'll be ready to play at
least a little bit,'' Richardson said. ``We need him. When he's
out, we have trouble getting any rebounds. Without him, our chances
of winning become very questionable a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hood hobbled, Siena outrebounded Arkansas, 41-35.
OLIVER'S GUTSY EFFORT
</P>
<P>
   Iowa omitted point guard Dean Oliver from its starting lineup
for the first time in 56 games, but the sophomore came off the
bench to score 15 points in 19 minutes in a 77-64 victory against
Alabama-Birmingham. Oliver made 5 of 7 shots, including both of his
3-point attempts, despite battling a respiratory infection that
made him doubtful until pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a courageous, courageous effort. Dean told me
\RWednesday\S that he'd play, but the way he looked, I wasn't so
sure,'' said Iowa coach Tom Davis, who gave Ryan Luehsman his first
start of the season at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Luehsman contributed five points and two assists in 22 minutes,
allowing Oliver ample time to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get out on the court, you forget about being sick,''
Oliver said. ``I thought coach did a good job limiting my minutes
and keeping me fresh.''
PASSING MAYBERRY
</P>
<P>
   By dishing out 10 assists against Siena, Arkansas point guard
Kareem Reid surpassed Lee Mayberry as the school's career record
holder. Reid, a senior, has 737 assists. Mayberry, who played from
1988-92, had 729.
</P>
<P>
   The record is especially meaningful, Reid said, because he is a
member of the only senior class in Nolan Richardson's 14 seasons at
Arkansas that has not won at least a division championship in the
Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk about how we haven't won any rings, so
it's nice to have the record. This is a great accomplishment,''
Reid said. ``Lee Mayberry was a great player. But he had eight or
nine people he could pass it to. Most of mine have come from
getting the ball to Pat Bradley.''

LONG'S LATE JUMPER LIFTS LOBOS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Finally, there has been a Kenny Thomas sighting during
crunch time of a New Mexico game in the NCAA men's basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And there is now evidence that the Lobos, who joined the 64-team
field despite the worst Ratings Percentage Index of any at-large
invitee in tournament history, may be worthy of the faith shown in
them by members of the NCAA selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   But neither would have been a topic of second-round discussion
among college basketball fans if not for a driving, pull-up jumper
that Lobos' guard Lamont Long sank with six seconds remaining last
night to give New Mexico a 61-59 victory over Missouri at McNichols
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Long's shot, which he lofted over two Missouri defenders, sent
the Lobos (25-8) on to tomorrow's second-round matchup against the
winner of last night's late game between Connecticut and UT-San
Antonio. Missouri, runner-up in the Big 12 during the regular
season, ends its year at 20-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get fouled,'' said Long, who drove left
against Tigers' guard John Woods, then floated the ball over the
outstretched arms of 6-foot-11 center Monte Hardge , who stepped up
to form a double-team. ``I didn't get fouled, so I threw it up
there and it just fell for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was identical to the one the Lobos ran to defeat Rice,
51-49, with 10.2 seconds remaining in the opening game of last
week's WAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good play,'' said New Mexico coach Dave Bliss. ``So we
thought we'd run it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Long's game-winner allowed the Lobos to survive an implosion
down the stretch. Up by 59-54 with 2:01 remaining, New Mexico
suffered two turnovers and failed to score again until Long's
basket. The momentum appeared to swing to Missouri when Thomas (20
points, 10 rebounds) fouled out with 1:31 remaining and guard Keyon
Dooling tied the game, 59-59, with a pair of free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, however, missed their final four shots, including a
breakaway layup by Dooling and a follow-up dunk attempt by Albert
White at the 1:13 mark. Long eventually landed the telling blow as
a means of vindication for the Lobos, who entered the game with an
RPI of 74, and for Thomas, an All-America center who had averaged
just 9.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in six previous NCAA tournament
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about time I was able to step it up in an NCAA game,''
said Thomas, who had almost as many fouls (nine) as points (15)
during the 1998 tournament, hastening the Lobos' second-round exit.
``I wanted to show people I could stay in the game and not foul out
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Long (17 points, 12 rebounds) answered most of them.
But that did not prevent a controversial ending.

MAVERICKS RISE UP TO CUT DOWN MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After 20 previous attempts, the Mavericks finally
racked up a victory against a quality team.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, what a convincing win it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks totally outhustled Orlando and played with a lot
of energy en route to whipping the Magic, 93-76, before 14,553 last
night at Reunion Arena. The win snapped a four-game losing streak
and pushed the Mavericks' record to 7-14.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, among the top four teams in the Eastern Conference,
dropped to 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have led at halftime seven times this season, and
have come away winners on six occasions. That statistic didn't go
unnoticed by Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley said Nelson challenged his team at halftime to
maintain the slim 46-44 lead they mounted at intermission. The
Mavericks heeded Nelson's words and went out and ripped apart one
of the best teams in the NBA with a solid all-around effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and we competed for 48 minutes and I think because
of that we had the outcome that we had,'' said Finley, who scored
18 points. ``I think the guys took it upon themselves to go out
there and just try to destroy Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the most part, guys just went out there and put
all they had and the results were a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were aggressive at both ends of the floor and the
76 points were the fewest they have allowed in a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the second time this season, the Mavericks had three
players post double-doubles. Gary Trent led the parade with 21
points and 10 rebounds, A.C. Green contributed 13 points and 11
rebounds, and Shawn Bradley collected 10 points and 10 boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any offensive rhythm we got into tonight was a deep second to
the way we played defense tonight,'' said Steve Nash, who just
missed a double-double with 9 points and 11 assists. ``For the most
part, defense is the key to our success.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-4 run at the outset of the fourth quarter provided the
Mavericks with a comfortable 84-65 lead with 5:20 remaining in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pack was back in the lineup to help energize the
Mavericks with his mercurial speed. Pack, who refused to play in
Tuesday's game against Phoenix because he deemed the playing
surface too slippery, jump started a second-half rally and got back
on the fans' good side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot has been made out it,'' Pack said of Tuesday's
game. ``I've moved on from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack slipped once during the second half and came up with a
slight limp. His teammates were having fun with that piece of
irony.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that the 12-rebound advantage the Mavericks enjoyed
_ not to mention limiting Orlando to .388 shooting from the field _
was the type of stuff he'd like to see on a game-by-game basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played like a real team tonight,'' Nelson said. ``I
was very proud of the guys; they just beat \Rone of\S the best
teams in the East and beat them handily.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic coach Chuck Daly was ejected with 1:34 remaining in the
third period when he ran onto the court to protest a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody tried to do whatever they could do to
scratch a win out, and we did it,'' Nelson said.

SIENA FAILS TRYING TO MIMIC ARKANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Siena basketball coach Paul Hewitt admits he borrowed
the blueprint that carried his team to its first NCAA Tournament
berth in a decade from Arkansas counterpart Nolan Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt learned yesterday that he remains a long way from
duplicating the original.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on its pressure defense and an early salvo of
3-point shots, Arkansas built a 21-point lead in the first eight
minutes and breezed to a 94-80 victory in the first round of the
West Region at McNichols Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks scored 18 of their first 20 points from beyond
the 3-point arc and led, 29-8, with 11:30 remaining in the first
half. Arkansas (23-10), the No. 4 seed in the West Region, never
let the lead dip below double-digits the rest of the way in setting
up tomorrow's second round matchup against Iowa (19-9), a 77-64
winner over Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Siena (25-6), the No. 13 seed, was one-and-done in its first
NCAA appearance since 1989. Hewitt said he learned plenty from his
first up-close-and-personal encounter with the Razorbacks, who
showed no ill-effects from playing on three consecutive nights in
last week's Southeastern Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people put a 3-point barrage like that on you, there's
nothing you can do,'' said Hewitt, who watched Arkansas hit 50
percent from 3-point range (15-of-30) and force 24 turnovers. ``To
be honest, I didn't think Arkansas could shoot like that or keep up
the tempo they did. I thought they might show some tired legs from
having a long week at the \RSEC\S tournament. But they never did.
They're in great shape.'' nn

AGENT SAYS ISMAIL PLANS TO MAKE DECISION SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail is expected to make a
decision Sunday night about whether he will sign a contract to play
wide receiver with the Cowboys, Ismail's agent said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to let me know on Sunday and then we'll let the
world know,'' Jack Mula, Ismail's representative, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have already offered Ismail a contract, said Mula,
who would not give the specifics of the terms. Ismail, 29, is also
considering a return to play with the Carolina Panthers, where he
enjoyed his best season as a pro in 1998 with 69 receptions for
1,074 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail visited with Cowboys officials last week. The Cowboys
have said they would like to add a receiver with Ismail's speed to
the lineup. They wouldn't comment specifically on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are waiting on Ismail's decision before making other
moves. Restricted free-agent wide receiver Pat Jeffers has drawn
interest from the St. Louis Rams, making a visit earlier this week.
The Rams would have to give up a fifth-round draft choice to sign
Jeffers, although Jeffers' agent, Brad Blank, said the Rams told
him they may try to trade for Jeffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, though, the Rams are just waiting to see what the
Cowboys do with \RIsmail\S,'' Blank said. ``If they sign him, that
will leave them without a whole lot of money under the salary cap
to match any offer the Rams might make toward Jeffers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys must also decide if they are going to sign
free-agent linebacker Quentin Coryatt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys re-signed yesterday linebacker Nate
Hemsley, quarterback Mike Quinn and linebacker Brandon Tolbert.
None played much last season.

WHEN IT COMES TO RANGERS, CLEMENS, IT'S BAD KARMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Surveying the night's marquee, you had Roger
Clemens _ old No. 12 _ pitching for the team in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   You had flowers being laid at the Joe DiMaggio monument outside
of the ballpark. You had 10,382 fans, standing in silence for a
thank-you message from the cancer-stricken manager, Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   You had, in other words, enough bad karma for the Rangers last
night to make them think they were the Washington Generals.
</P>
<P>
   Four innings of air balls against Clemens completed the scene.
Roger, the mighty morphing almost-Ranger, looked much the same in a
New York uniform as he did in Boston or Toronto duds.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared unhittable. The scoreboard, clogged with
Clemens-crafted zeroes, supported as much.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens started and pitched four innings, silencing the Rangers
without a hit. He walked one, struck out three, lathered himself
into a sweaty, post-workout froth, and then returned to the
clubhouse to assess what otherwise could be considered a spring
training masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a ton of work to do,'' Clemens announced.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd around Roger's locker stall blinked at the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitch I did leave over the middle they hit hard,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I doublechecked my scorecard. The only thing faulty about
Clemens' showing last night appeared to be his eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw all of his pitches for strikes,'' said Rangers left
fielder Rusty Greer, who struck out against Clemens in the first
inning but did manage to line out hard to center in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked normal to me. I don't know how he feels, but from a
hitter's standpoint he looks pretty sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another reminder of how larcenous the February trade
was that brought Clemens to the Yanks. The New York clubhouse was
already lined with stars _ from Bernie Williams to Derek Jeter to
David Cone to even the backup left fielders.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees prevailed because of tradition, wealth, power and
pin-striped persuasion. Did the Rangers ever really have a chance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there definitely was some consideration there,'' Clemens
said last night.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to be helpful, recounting the saga that led him from
Toronto to George Steinbrenner's roost. But Clemens' agents, the
Hendricks brothers, Alan and Randy, apparently have the whole
sequence reduced to a series of they-said-he-saids, and Roger just
parrots it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, out of nowhere, I got the call about the deal with New
York,'' Clemens said, delivering the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   So was he almost a Texas Ranger or not, inquiring minds wanted
to know?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I have a lot of family there,'' Clemens answered.
``My wife was born there. I know a lot of their guys. I love the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``And eventually, when the boys are grown, I might find myself
up in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, great. At age 50 or thereabouts, Clemens will move to
Arlington. Buy your season tickets now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team would want Roger Clemens,'' the Rangers' Greer
continued. ``He's a guy who is going to help every ball club that
he's on. He's almost a guaranteed 20 wins, and he gives
everything's he's got.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to have him on our team, but ... we didn't
get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens suggested that ``at the 12th hour,'' the Rangers upped
the ante _ ``offered that Mateo kid,'' he said _ but by then it was
already too late.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket was asked about reports that Rangers owner _ and
fellow Texas alum _ Tom Hicks nearly made an orange-laced power
play to secure Clemens' services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a chance to meet him one time,'' Clemens said.
``It was pretty cordial. We have a good relationship. I heard all
about him and what he had been doing with the hockey team. My
agents spoke highly of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we had a chance to visit, maybe, 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   (Rangers fans may insert sighs here).
</P>
<P>
   On a night when foul karma abounded and when manager Johnny
Oates even trotted out the first-string lineup, the Rangers were
overwhelmed by Clemens and the Yankee machine again.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part is that Clemens says he's just getting started in
this first spring in Yankeeland. He's not nearly in as fit shape,
he said, as he eventually wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all, not at all,'' Clemens protested. ``I've got quite
a bit of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to power-pitch a little more and to drive
the ball a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   I doublechecked my scorecard. Bad eyesight.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ Early on, they were hanging close and feeling good about
things. The score stayed close longer than anyone expected. For a
moment or two, they could even dream a little.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then, with 15 minutes left, the Texas-San Antonio Roadrunners
were hitting both the wall and the oxygen bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the latter was telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got a little tired,'' Connecticut's Richard
Hamilton said. ``We might have worn them out a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' 91-66 victory in the first round of the West
Regional certainly attests to that, but UTSA had some fun before
the evening went sour. The game was tied at 19 with just over 11
minutes left in the first half, in fact, before UConn went on a
33-8 run to make it 52-27 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were outmanned, especially inside,'' Roadrunners coach Tim
Carter said. ``But I was proud of our guys. They gave it all they
had.''
</P>
<P>
   As first-round NCAA games go, this one was such an apparent
mismatch that the coach of the top seed could afford to take the
night off. Connecticut's Jim Calhoun stayed back at the team hotel
after coming down with virus-like symptoms earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out about 20 minutes before the game coach
Calhoun would not be with the team, I was happy because I knew that
meant the food I sent over to his hotel got to him,'' Carter joked.
``I was hoping it would get to about five or six of his players,
but it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who also missed an early season game against Hartford
with an intestinal bug, probably didn't see much on television to
make him feel any worse _ at least not after those few queasy
moments at the start. By halftime, Hamilton already had 17 points,
while Kevin Freeman added 10. UConn had recovered to make 20 of 38
shots (52.6 percent) while forcing 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With associate head coach Dave Leitao taking over for Calhoun,
the top-seeded Huskies never looked back, and the rest was pretty
much a formality, though the beauty of that clearly was in the eye
of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we had 39 and they had 39,'' Carter said.
``If it hadn't been for that big run, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton finished with 28 points, while Freeman had 16. Steve
Meyer led UTSA with 18, but the Roadrunners made only 41 percent of
their shots (to UConn's 55.2).
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our game plan was that we could wear them out with
numbers,'' Leitao said. ``We got a little winded, too, but over the
course of the game, it was to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   So UConn (29-2) goes on to Saturday's second round against New
Mexico, while UTSA (18-11) goes home.

IN A VOTE CLINTON SOUGHT TO AVOID, HOUSE BACKS A FORCE FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted narrowly on Thursday night to
support President Clinton's plan to send American troops to Kosovo
should a peace settlement be reached, after a passionate and bitter
debate on U.S. policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The 219-to-191 vote reflected a House deeply divided over
Clinton's efforts to commit troops to another peace settlement in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the president argued that the United States has a
moral obligation to stop a genocidal war that could ignite a
broader conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents _ including the House majority leader and the House
Republican whip _ argued that Kosovo would prove to be a quagmire,
and that Europe should police any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House action was not binding, the debate was held
at a crucial juncture in the faltering peace effort for Kosovo, as
a new round of negotiations was scheduled to resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine House members voted present on Thursday night, because they
had reservations but did not want to cast a vote that would
discourage the talks between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Serbian troops have harshly opposed the
Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, congressional officials from both parties
called the outcome of the vote too close to call. Both the White
House and the State Department said any such debate would interfere
with their diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The president's victory was not signaled until the early evening
when the House rejected an amendment by Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla.,
that would have put the House on record in opposition to any
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Thursday night, Clinton said the House action
showed bipartisan support for his Kosovo policy and ``sends a clear
message'' to both sides in the conflict ``that it's time now to
sign an agreement that stops the fighting in Kosovo and creates
real self-government for the Kosovar people.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four Republicans joined 174 Democrats and one independent
to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed included 173 Republicans and 18 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution authorizes the president to deploy American
troops with a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo if a peace
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   It instructs Clinton to explain to Congress an ``exit strategy''
from the province and to certify that U.S. forces would answer only
to American commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of the president's foreign policy team _ many of
them overseas _ placed calls to lawmakers throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   And during his visit to Guatemala, Clinton said, ``I do not
believe that Congress should take any action that will in effect
pre-empt the peace process or encourage either side to say no to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Secretary of State Madeleine Albright implored the
House to hold off its debate, saying a vote against troops at a
delicate moment of diplomacy would be seen as ``a green light to
resume fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   She was backed by Bob Dole, the former Republican presidential
candidate and Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But in an aggressive assertion of Congress' role in foreign
policy, the new Republican speaker, Dennis Hastert, refused to
delay the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to be direct and honest with the president and
his secretary of state,'' Hastert, of Illinois, said in a speech on
the House floor. ``I told them that I believed it was my duty as
speaker to insure that members of the House of Representatives,
Republican and Democrat, have the opportunity to fairly and openly
debate this important issue before troops are sent into a
potentially dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was a test of how Hastert would compare with Newt
Gingrich, who was a confirmed internationalist. Although he refused
to tip his hand in advance and did not vote on the Fowler
amendment, in the end he supported Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we send our sons and daughters into harm's way, it is
a tough decision,'' he said in a statement after the vote. ``But I
do believe America has a vested interest in supporting NATO and in
keeping peace in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   His stand put him at odds with the two senior members of his
team.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Dick Armey, and the Republican whip,
Tom DeLay, opposed deploying troops. DeLay called the plan a ``big
dangerous quagmire'' and ``another bad idea in a foreign policy
with no focus.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Clinton administration had become too dependent on
air strikes and the threats of air strikes, referring to bombings
in Iraq, strikes against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan and the
threat of strikes in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing sovereign nations for ill-defined reasons with vague
objectives undermines American stature in the world,'' DeLay said.
``The international respect and trust for America is diminished
every time we casually let the bombs fly. We must stop giving the
appearance that our foreign policy is formulated by the
Unabomber.''
</P>
<P>
   Through hours of debate into the night, members clashed over the
role of the United States after the cold war, as well as over the
American leadership role in NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The members argued whether outsiders could ever end the strife
in the Balkans, and expressed misgivings about the length of the
U.S. mission in Bosnia, which Clinton had once promised would be
limited in time.
</P>
<P>
   The debate split the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats spoke out in support of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall Bosnia, my friends,'' Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.,
said. ``The president told us our troops would be back home, I
believe, by December of 1996. But when I last checked, December
1996 has come and long gone, and our troops are still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to portray myself as an isolationist. But to
suggest that Bosnia and Kosovo are European problems that should be
resolved by Europeans hardly constitutes isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   In disagreeing, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``There really is
a moral obligation for those who have the resources to intercede.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats spoke forcefully for deployment and questioned
why the Republican leadership had scheduled such a debate when a
new round of diplomacy was beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the height of irresponsibility,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt,
the House minority leader, said. ``This should not be about
politics. It should not be about giving the administration a black
eye. This is about ending a humanitarian catastrophe.''  &QL;

CAT FINDS A SWEETHEART DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily
News 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's take a pit bull break and catch up on the
life of Riley now being enjoyed in Simi Valley by the most faithful
feline in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Sweetheart, and you might remember her from a couple
of columns I wrote back in November 1996 that got a lot of national
attention.
</P>
<P>
   She's the cat who refused to believe that her owners would not
return to their earthquake-ravaged Sylmar condo after the big 1994
Northridge shaker, which sent her running away for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned, no one was there. So, for almost three years,
this cat camped out on the front porch of the red-tagged condo,
patiently waiting for a reunion that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   People walking and driving by the Foothill Boulevard complex
began noticing the cat's daily vigil and a few of them began
throwing some cat food over the fence to her because she was
getting pretty skinny scrounging around for food on her own.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Bill Marrujo, living down the block, even tried to
give her a home, but the cat would have no part of it, running away
after one day _ back to the red-tagged condo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hits you hard, just watching her sitting out there, waiting
for them to come home, day after day,'' said Marrujo, who nicknamed
the cat Sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   After I wrote about the cat's dedication, the red-tagged condo
turned into a shrine. Hundreds of cat lovers showed up trying to
coax Sweetheart to come home with them.
</P>
<P>
   They all failed, but, by then, it was too late. Sweetheart was a
local celebrity. Dozens of people stopped by every day to feed her.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, skinny Sweetheart looked like a prime candidate for
Jenny Craig. The only thing missing from her contented smile was a
toothpick.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day about a week later, Sweetheart was gone. Just
disappeared into thin air. All the neighbors were hoping she had
finally found a good home.
</P>
<P>
   And, she had. At least that's what the handwritten sign that
appeared one morning a few days later in front of the red-tagged
condo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about Sweetheart, she now has a good home,'' it
read.
</P>
<P>
   Who wrote it, and where the cat was taken has been a mystery for
more than 2 years now, until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetheart's humanitarian catnapper finally made contact.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Jennifer Dowdall, and she lives with her widowed
father, Owen, in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the hundreds of people who initially tried
coaxing Sweetheart to come home with them. But Jennifer was more
diligent. She and her dad went back after the crowds died down and
``catnapped'' the cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt so bad for it,'' she said Thursday. ``One night, we
went back and my dad pulled the fence down while I grabbed
Sweetheart and put her in a cat cage I had in the back seat of our
car. She didn't put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first week or so after we brought her home she was
very frightened,'' Jennifer said. ``She got out the screen door
after about the fifth day, and I thought she was gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after about an hour, she came back in our back yard and
has been with us every since,'' Jennifer said. ``I think she was
finally tired of waiting for her old owners to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after taking Sweetheart, the Dowdalls realized a lot
of people were probably wondering what happened to the cat, so they
returned and put up the sign saying she was fine and in a good
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been doing wonderful,'' Jennifer said, adding she
finally came forward after running across the 1996 columns and
figured I might want to know whatever happened to the country's
most faithful feline.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's treated like a queen around here. She sleeps on my bed
all the time and knows that's her room, too. She goes to the vet
for checkups, and to get all her shots. And she loves to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave the back screen door unlatched and she pushes it open
when she wants to go out and lay in the grass or on the patio for
an hour or so. When she wants to come back in, she pulls the door
open with her paw and comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have squirrels and birds that come in our back yard
everyday to be fed, but Sweetheart never bothers them. She just
lays on the grass and watches them, but never tries to chase or
hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I call a wonderful cat,'' Jennifer said.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to reach Bill Marrujo Thursday to give him the good
news, but he wasn't around. Hopefully he'll read the column today
and smile.
</P>
<P>
   The country's most faithful feline has made out just fine. She's
living the life of Riley in Simi Valley.

BOSTON _ He sat by himself on the top row at Hofheinz Pavilion, by
all appearances a lonely, disconsolate figure. He spurned at least
one offer to join the party in a private suite behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, DeLoss Dodds didn't feel like having fun. The
University of Texas basketball team, in its first game under a new,
young coach to whom Dodds had paid a lot of money, was in a
disheveled state and would, in fact, lose to a bad University of
Houston team that was being coached by a local folk hero working
practically for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Drexler's Cougars would not have a better evening all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Barnes' Longhorns would not have a worse one, although a
couple of games in the weeks ahead would definitely be in the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for Dodds, of course, was a lingering
sentiment among some UT fanatics that the athletic director had
unfairly, even cruelly, railroaded previous coach Tom Penders out
of a job he had done rather well, a most recent down season and
controversial offseason notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Penders had not gone gently into the good night. He was
ripping Dodds to pieces at every turn, and he continues to do so. A
few exes probably still believe Penders has every right to spew
invective and point to his making the NCAA Tournament field in his
first season at George Washington as proof of his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dodds can comfortably occupy his seat at Fleet
Center tonight for the Longhorns' game against Purdue and feel
quite OK about his decision to change coaches. It was the right
move. Absolutely. Without a doubt. No question about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat amazing development considering the season's early
tough sledding, Texas won the Big 12 regular-season title and
earned a No. 7 seed in the East Regional. Surely the AD feels fully
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gotten into vindication,'' he says, and the
conversation about Penders stops right there. Barnes he will talk
about, however. With delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick's better than I thought he would be,'' Dodds insists,
``and I thought he was really good. He's been able to step in and
pull the team together, and the kids seem to be enjoying what
they're doing. They're playing as a team, and with some success. He
has done a better job than I thought possible in the first year, so
I'm pleased with it. I think we have one of the best young coaches
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is the anti-Penders in terms of basketball philosophy,
personal style and ingrained work ethic. While Penders was himself
a godsend for the Horns when he arrived on the Forty Acres in 1988,
taking a program in ruins to a modest level of national prominence
almost on the strength of his fast-talking, glad-handing and
high-profile scheduling, he had suffered a precipitous loss of
momentum lately.
</P>
<P>
   The fault was his, no one else's. He got lazy. And he got fat.
</P>
<P>
   So did his team. Barnes' first workout with the surviving
Longhorns, a 6 a.m. ordeal designed to test the players'
conditioning, came the day after he signed on last April. He was
mortified by the physical shape they were in. These were the
Runnin' Horns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, my, my, my,''' Barnes recalls. ``I thought
about calling (Clemson athletic director) Bobby Robinson and
asking, `Did you fill my job yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   With the defections of guards Luke Axtell and Bernard Smith,
there weren't enough players to scrimmage five-on-five. Also, the
core of the team was split in half. Kris Clack and Chico Vazquez,
strong Penders-backers, held lingering grudges about the role Chris
Mihm and Gabe Muoneke played in turning Dodds against the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes couldn't have walked into more convoluted circumstances.
At $700,000, more money than any of his Big 12 peers was making, he
probably felt underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   At 3-8, he also felt rather unloved. But because he was teaching
fundamentals and preaching togetherness _ and because the X's and
O's upon which any revival would ultimately rest were solid _ the
Longhorns won 16 of their next 19 games before finally hiccuping in
the Big 12 tournament semifinals against Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   They were tired. They still aren't deep enough, and Barnes
drives them hard. No one is complaining, though. Definitely not the
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see lots of individual improvement,'' Dodds said after the
regular-season title was secured. ``He's made a team out of them.
From what it was when he walked in to what it is today, it's just a
remarkable transformation. It's a different feeling altogether.
Never in my wildest dreams did I expect this.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes didn't just succeed. He made himself a legitimate
coach-of-the-year candidate, although Auburn's Cliff Ellis, Miami's
Leonard Hamilton or Michigan State's Tom Izzo is likely to finish
ahead of him in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The AD may not be into the vindication thing, but
vindicated he is. Whatever happens in Beantown over the weekend,
Dodds is free and clear. He needn't feel like a lonely guy anymore.

CELTICS LOSE, BUT HELP IS ON THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trading deadline has passed and the Celtics now
have Vitaly Potapenko. He's a 285-pound center, so he will help
them. But it would have been even better if the team in green had
extracted a center named Russell, Chamberlain, O'Neal, or Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   That must have been obvious to the 8,518 people who watched the
Hawks dismiss the lighter Celtics, 99-85, Thursday &UR;  &LR; night at
Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Most of the fans who watched from New
England already know about the Celtic deficiencies, which seem
worse now that the team is 7-10 and on a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, Potapenko is coming. He'll be in Auburn Hills, Mich.,
Friday night when the Celtics play the Pistons. That's fine with
his new teammates. But they're probably wondering, ``Hey, V, got
anybody with you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's ready to work,'' Antoine Walker said, ``because we
sure need some help here.'' Walker was asked if the trade for
Potapenko would affect him personally. ``They can bring in the Pope
and it wouldn't affect me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope? He wouldn't be a bad addition to the Celtics, either.
He could certainly offer some prayers for them, something they
could use if they still want to slide into the Eastern Conference
playoffs. But we're not sure how much he could help the Celtics'
sagging rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the Hawks had a 55-37 rebounding edge. As you
might have guessed, Dikembe Mutombo led all rebounders with 15. But
when you have an 18-rebound advantage on a team, it usually means
that big guys, medium guys, and small guys all are retrieving
missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened. Mookie Blaylock, a 6-foot-2-inch
``little'' guy, had 11 assists. He also had six rebounds. Steve
Smith, a 6-8 ``medium'' guy added four rebounds. So the Hawks got
10 rebounds from their starting backcourt _ where little guys roam
_ while the Celtics got 11 rebounds from their starting frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not why we lost,'' Kenny Anderson said. ``We lost
because all of us are not playing good defense. Until we do that,
we're going to keep talking about games like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one person in the starting lineup who is committed
to being a great defensive player,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino
said. ``And that's a sign of inexperience and youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Hawk starter scored in double figures for the first time
all season. Mutombo and Alan Henderson led Atlanta with 18 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have way too much talent to be losing like this,'' said
Walker, who had a game-high 19 points. ``We're trying hard, but
trying hard isn't enough. We need to execute.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ It wasn't exactly the second coming of Tyus Edney, but for
the Missouri Tigers, it was eerily familiar just the same.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once more, Norm Stewart's team exits the NCAA Tournament under
peculiar circumstances, and this time, the officials even got into
the act.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Tigers had no quarrel with Lamont Long's lean-in
jumper with six seconds left _ the winning points in New Mexico's
61-59 first-round victory in the West Regional on Thursday night.
What happened next, however, left confusion and a bitter
aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   After a made basket in the final minute, the clock is supposed
to stop until the ball is put back into play. Instead, it kept
running as the Tigers inbounded quickly and pushed the ball
upcourt.
</P>
<P>
   How much a lost second or two mattered after Brian Grawer's
desperation 35-footer was deflected with a little more than a
second left is open to debate. Stewart admitted that he didn't want
a timeout after Long's basket, so that was not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Tigers, the No. 8 seed, clearly lost time that might
have allowed for a better shot. Just as clearly, the bizarre ending
heightened Missouri's frustration in its first NCAA game since
UCLA's Edney beat the Tigers with that length-of-the-floor drive at
Boise, Idaho, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the rules and what we can say, so I can't
answer that for you,'' Stewart said, alluding to NCAA regulations
prohibiting comments on officiating. ``If we keep going, we'll get
to where you can ask me my name and I can give it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was quick to note that his team had contributed
significantly to its own demise. Long's winning shot came after the
Tigers missed three chances to break the tie _ two on drives by
freshman guard Keyon Dooling, the other on a missed follow-up dunk
by Albert White on Dooling's first miss.
</P>
<P>
   Long then dribbled into the left side of the lane, went up in
traffic and nailed the jumper. Missouri got the ball in so quickly
that no one noticed that the clock kept running.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake is correctable, but not after the officials leave
the floor. Later, referee Frank Scagliotta issued a statement
regarding the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't correct it unless we have definite knowledge (there
is an error). No official noticed it, no one noticed it hadn't
stopped because the ball came in so quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we leave the floor, the game is over. There is no way to
correct anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened,'' Stewart said. ``I'm sure that won't happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Missouri, that came as little consolation.

SKY'S THE LIMIT AS INDEX IGNITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- U.S. stocks will likely reach and breach the
10,000 barrier in the Dow Jones industrial average in the near
future despite warning cries that the market is overvalued,
analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria that reverberated around Wall Street Thursday as
the large-cap Dow came within 65 points of 10,000 before falling
back is the latest sign of the strongest bull market run in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market may continue to trend somewhat higher,'' said
Harvey Hirschhorn, chief economist and investment strategist at
Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham mutual funds in Chicago. ``The direction right
now seems to be on the upside.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.60, or 1.3 percent,
Thursday to close at a record 9897.44. It rose above 9900 earlier
in the trading day, but gave up its gains as some profit-taking
ensued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, a broader market indicator, rose
10.84 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1297.68, while the Nasdaq
Composite went up 6.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2412.25.
</P>
<P>
   The market was fueled by a rebound in oil stocks, reduced
concerns about interest rate hikes, a strong U.S. economy, consumer
optimism, healthy retail sales gains and new policies that will
help patch overseas economies, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Absent a damaging external event or a catalyst that will lead to
higher inflation, slower growth or higher interest rates, the
market should continue moving up, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10,000 barrier is a psychological barrier. When we break
through that, the market might run,'' said Jan Holman, vice
president of investment services at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ``This is the type of boost long-term
investors should enjoy. They should approach it with glee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jef Schwartz, an online investor in Glendale, believes the Dow
could hit 10,000 early next week. ``It's momentum,'' said Schwartz,
who admitting to selling a few of his holdings -- eBay and Xoom --
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most market indicators point to the bullish trend
continuing for a while, with a few breathers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Intelligence reported this week that its Bearish
Sentiment Index still reflects a bull market. The percentage of
bullish investors stands at 50 percent while bears top 32 percent.
The remainder are long-term bulls who are looking for opportunities
to buy at market dips.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based newsletter said that in a bull market, its
index is usually 45 percent bulls and 35 percent bears -- close to
the reading this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the October 1987 correction, it registered 61
percent bulls and 19 percent bears. The rationale behind the index
is investors tend to jump on the bandwagon a little too late; it
becomes overly optimistic just before a bull run is petering out
and it hits a pessimistic low when the market is about to turn.
</P>
<P>
   So a 61 percent bull reading in 1987 rightly signaled an
imminent downturn.
</P>
<P>
   While the index now is nowhere near 1987 levels, other signs
point to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago, the index reached its highest level of
bullishness in 12 years -- a sign that a major downturn could be
coming -- before dropping back. Compare that to the end of 1994,
when the Dow was around 3,700. The index showed the largest
percentage of bears in 12.5 years. Sure enough, the market took off
the following year and hasn't yet abated.
</P>
<P>
   Leading indicators also show that a pullback may be coming. Late
last year, the Dow Jones bond average, Dow Jones utility average
and Dow Jones transportation average all peaked but have since
weakened. These are leading indicators, pinpointing future market
direction by about two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is vulnerable,'' said newsletter editor Michael
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sign of trouble is the reading from the model used
by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to gauge the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to the model, the market is overvalued by 30 percent,
said Don Wellenreiter, a commodity trading adviser at Defined Risk
Asset Management in Westlake Village. Right before the October 1987
crash, it read 33.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an investing market. You have to be very careful,''
he said.

UCLA UPSET BY DETROIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For five months, the UCLA Bruins talked of new
blood and a better attitude. They had a refreshing, tenacious
style. They wore bold, black uniforms and splattered the cover of
their media guide with the phrase, ``There's a New Dawn in
Westwood.''
</P>
<P>
   But when dusk fell Thursday and their season disappeared into
the frigid Midwestern night, what remained looked eerily familiar _
like Tulsa, like Princeton, like all the other early exits and
underachieving finishes the program has produced this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Bruins lost to No. 12 Detroit Mercy 56-53
Thursday night in the RCA Dome, and in so doing proved why this was
the most popular upset pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA wasted leads of nine and six points in the second half. It
lost star guard Baron Davis to fouls, and it scored just five
points in the last six minutes, failing to execute against a zone
defense just as it failed against Stanford two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The end came on Daniel Whye's difficult 18-foot jumper with 12
seconds left, which gave the Titans a 53-50 lead and sealed defeat
for the Bruins in the same building they lost to Princeton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was their third first-round loss in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (22-9) were the most popular upset pick in the first
round _ a sentiment based in part on UCLA's youth and
inconsistency, in part of Detroit's reputation and style. The
Titans, who beat St. John's in the first round last year, play a
grinding tempo the Bruins detest.
</P>
<P>
   In his pregame comments, UCLA coach Steve Lavin seemed to be
preparing his team and fans for defeat. Lavin bemoaned the Bruins'
inconsistency, he called Detroit ``the most dangerous team in the
tournament.'' Lastly, he said the Bruins _ with 11 national titles
and four McDonald's All-Americans _ felt like the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (25-5) had UCLA well-scouted and played the only way
they could to survive: by slowing the tempo to a crawl. They used a
deliberate attack that forced UCLA to play defense for extended
periods. They did not take bad shots, which limited UCLA's fast
break opportunities. And they handled the ball like a newborn
against UCLA's full-court pressure, which also prevented the
Bruins' break from revving.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Detroit played a compact zone that shut off the
penetration and passing lanes into the low post. This forced the
Bruins to rely on the weakest aspect of their game _ perimeter
jumpers. Of UCLA's 50 shots, 27 were 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only way Detroit could play _ the way Princeton
played, the way Miami played last year, the obvious way.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were precise and productive _ for four minutes. Davis
and Earl Watson connected on 3-pointers to give UCLA a 9-3 lead,
but then Detroit switched to its zone and the Bruins' offense shut
down. Four scoreless UCLA possessions later, Detroit had pulled
even.
</P>
<P>
   Defense dominated the middle portion of the half. The Bruins
secured their defense and held Detroit without a field goal for
nearly seven minutes, but they made little progress offensively.
Davis missed a long 3-pointer, Watson missed two free throws, and
Matt Barnes clanked a 3-pointer he should never have attempted.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush finally converted for UCLA, hitting a 3-pointer from
the left wing. The teams exchanged baskets in the last two minutes
_ a rare display of offense that ended with UCLA leading 32-30.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins emerged from halftime appearing more comfortable with
the tempo and their plan. Watson found Davis for a 3-pointer,
converted a Davis miss and then deflected a loose ball downcourt to
Ray Young for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   With a 40-31 lead, UCLA was in control _ or so it seemed. Rashad
Phillips steadied Detroit with a 3-pointer, then Davis committed
his third and fourth fouls in a 30-second span. The fourth, a
charge on the fast break, was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit the bench for two minutes _ two scoreless minutes for
UCLA _ and that was all Detroit needed. Jermaine Jackson made four
free throws and Phillips hit a mid-range jumper with 9:28 left to
erase the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used a wild sequence to grab a 48-42 lead with 6:12
left, but Detroit tightened its defense in the stretch and claimed
a 49-48 lead with 1:53 left.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:19 remaining, Davis fouled out, and UCLA bowed out.

SOWARD'S FUTURE IN DOUBT AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward has been AWOL from
the Trojans football program for several weeks, and his future for
next season remains in doubt, according to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, a potential All-American who just two months ago
declared he would return for his senior season, has not attended
USC winter practices since early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I just don't know. That's the situation. It's
kind of out of my hands,'' said his father, Rodney Soward. ``Let's
just wait and see. He's all right. I don't really want to talk
about it. It should come to light in the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett refused comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Soward was told by coaches he could be
kicked off the team if he did not start attending practices, but he
still skipped Thursday's team meeting and practice, which was the
final official gathering before the Trojans disbanded for next
week's spring break.
</P>
<P>
   USC coaches had not spoken to Soward for two weeks until an
assistant coach showed up at one of his classes Wednesday. Soward
said he would come to Thursday's team meeting, but did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Soward will return to USC next season, his father said:
``I guess he'll be there. We're going to have to wait and see. It's
just unfortunate right now. It's bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, Soward has mentioned to friends the
possibility of applying for the NFL's supplemental draft, which
usually takes place in June or July. An NFL spokesperson said
Thursday that players are not expected to submit applications until
at least two month's after April's regular draft.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has also sporadically attended classes during USC's
spring semester and there is some question over whether he will be
able to retain his eligibility, even if he does intend to play for
the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Hackett suspended Soward from the season opener
against Purdue because of poor academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Soward could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   He and Hackett have had some turbulent times the past 12 months.
Soward was not happy over his role in the offense last season. When
he announced he was staying for his senior season in January,
Soward alluded to his frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and coach, we're going to sit down and have a lot of
planning to make things a lot better,'' Soward said. ``We're going
to come up with different ways to get me the ball. I'm going to be
a big part of this offense. I'm probably the biggest part of this
offense coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   USC tight end Antoine Harris saw Soward on Wednesday, but the
pair never discussed Soward's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same old R. Jay,'' Harris said. ``We didn't even talk
about it. We went bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Hackett has interviewed former Washington assistant Steve

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ORLANDO, Fla. _ As they like to say up the road at Walt Disney's
Magic Kingdom, it's a small world after all.
</P>
<P>
   So tiny when a team such as George Washington can have its
offense run by a point guard named Shawnta Rogers who stands all of
5 feet, 4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   So very small when Colonials coach Tom Penders can spend most of
his first season on the job seizing every opportunity to take
another cheap shot at his ex-boss at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe we should call this DeLoss Dodds' revenge as Penders
team came up positively miniature in a 108-88 first-round NCAA
Tournament loss to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   It was Penders who spent the last half of his 10-year tenure at
Texas sitting around fat and happy on his reputation. But to hear
it now, it was somehow Dodds' fault that the Longhorns' program was
running in place.
</P>
<P>
   It was Penders who alienated a large part of last year's Texas
team, resulting in a mutiny that eventually produced his
resignation. But the revised version sold all of this season to a
new audience is that Dodds lit the fuse that blew the whole thing
up.
</P>
<P>
   Penders spouted his vitriol to any open notebook or live
microphone, and Dodds never once responded. Now, the silence is
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   For no matter what happens to the Longhorns in their first-round
meeting with Purdue in the East Regional tonight, thanks at least
to the Big Dance schedule-makers, Texas will be waltzing at least
one day longer than Penders.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been billed as the bombast matchup of the South
Regional. To get a couple of objects more full of hot air than Bob
Knight and Penders going head-to-head in the first round, the NCAA
would have had to stage a blimp race inside the Orlando Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, as usual, hit the ground running his mouth with nonstop
complaints, most of them having to do with the late (10:05 p.m.
EST) starting time of the game. He took his usual shots at NCAA
officials, the media, bus drivers, anybody at all who could provide
a target and deflect attention from the fact that the Hoosiers had
been bounced from the Dance in the first round three times in the
past four years and hadn't won as many as two Tournament games
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Penders, meanwhile, took a team that went 24-9 last year under
Mike Jarvis, guided the Colonials to a 20-9 record and into the
Tournament, and convinced the gullible nation's capital that it was
a remarkable turnaround. Travelin' Tommy has spent the season
telling anybody who will listen that he's so glad to be out of
Texas and back on the East Coast, where everybody knows the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to draw up diagrams for people anymore,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe a few plays would help.
</P>
<P>
   Now when he isn't at the tanning salon or preening like a
peacock on the sidelines, Penders is blaming everything except the
fall of the Japanese economy on Dodds, the Texas athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that we were able to accomplish everything that
we did in our time there,'' Penders moaned. ``That guy undermined
practically everything we did for the last seven years. When I
think of all the wins and television appearances, and it's a wonder
we were able to accomplish any of that with him there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a wonder that Penders has been able to peddle this
same offensive show as something that is cutting-edge rather than
simply undisciplined for all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Penders ran a team out onto the floor that looked like the
General Assembly of the United Nations. He had two players from
Belarus, two from Spain and one each from Israel, Portugal, Brazil,
Central African Republic, Canada and the Netherlands, and, as
usual, the concept of playing defense or taking anything other than
the first jump shot was a foreign concept.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, same old Tom.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the Hoosiers play, one would not have thought that
Indiana was only a mediocre 5-8 against ranked teams this season or
that its last outing was an 82-66 thumping by last-place Illinois
in the Big Ten tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers were sloppy with the ball, turning it over six
times in the first four minutes. But the Colonials were even more
of a mess. They were one quick jumper after another that clanked
off the rim, and they were a defense with no ability to stop on the
interior, allowing Indiana's Kirk Haston to carve them for 27
points and Luke Recker for 20.
</P>
<P>
   GW put up 90 shots to only 56 for Indiana but still made four
fewer field goals. Rogers took 31 shots and made only 10. The
Colonials shot 37.8 percent. The Hoosiers made them pay. Somehow,
Dodds will get the blame.
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Penders, it's always a small, small world.

make art; museums select some of that art for their collections,
where it is preserved, elevated and, most of all, displayed. Once
on view, it offers other artists inspiration, helping them unlock

THEATER OWNERS EYE SNACK-SELLING PLOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- In a few months, while buying your tickets to
``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' you'll also be able to
buy popcorn, soda and a hot dog at the ticket window.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the ploys the nation's top-grossing
megaplexes are cooking up to entice customers to open their wallets
even wider despite the sky-high prices for snack-bar food.
</P>
<P>
   John King Jr., manager of the year-old Winnetka 20 in Los
Angeles, told attendees Thursday at the ShoWest convention in Las
Vegas that parent Pacific Theatres is actively considering
launching such a plan, which would offer three or four of the most
popular snack combinations.
</P>
<P>
   The option would give customers the convenience of reaching for
their pocketbook only once rather than twice. Patrons who pay for
snacks in advance would receive a separate ticket to turn in at the
concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get a popcorn and Coke into the hands of every
customer,'' King told about 300 executives and managers during a
panel on the working of the nation's leading megaplex theaters.
``This could cut down on sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   King said Pacific likely would start the program at the Winnetka
20 or the Beach Cities megaplex in Redondo Beach, adding he hopes
to launch prior to the May 19 opening of ``Episode I.''
</P>
<P>
   King also indicated the food option would be available for
advance tickets purchased through the ETM Entertainment Network,
which has started selling tickets at its kiosks in malls and
supermarkets. ``We think there are going to be a lot of people who
want to avoid the lines at the box office when `Star Wars' comes
out,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive to the audience, however, was King's disclosure
that the Winnetka 20 had sold 89,000 pounds of popcorn, 22,000
gallons of soda and 175,000 Pink's premium hot dogs since it opened
in February 1998. The frankfurters, the first sold outside Pink's
stand in Hollywood, comprised a surprising 10 percent of concession
revenues, well above industry averages.
</P>
<P>
   Other panelists strongly endorsed the concept of broadening
snack-bar menus with items such as chicken strips, pizza, espresso
and buffalo wings. Valerie Baty, manager of a 20-screen megaplex in
Plano, Texas, said customers have been highly enthused about her
theater's policy of allowing them to take food from the lobby's
restaurant, such as chicken-fried steak, into theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people to forget about everything and have fun,''
she said. ``We want them to have a `wow' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Snack bars are a powerful profit engine that drives. Theaters
make profits of more than 80 percent on concession revenues,
compared with less than 50 percent on box office revenues.
Megaplexes have become popular among chains because the massive
concession stands and staggered start times boost spending by
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe per-patron food spending is around $2 per
customer at megaplexes but high-profile destinations with
out-of-the-ordinary items such as the Universal City 18-screen
megaplex can take in as much as $3 per patron. Operators stressed
the industry needs to overcome its resistance to change in order to
continue competing for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Urrutia, manager of a 20-plex in Southfield, Mich., that
offers extensive auto-themed promotions, declared, ``The heart and
soul of our business is movies and popcorn but we must look outside
the box.''

ZAGS RELISH PAYBACK, DESPITE CIRCUMSTANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SEATTLE _ They waited 365 days for this game.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was going to keep Gonzaga from relishing it, not after
the Bulldogs were snubbed by the NCAA selection committee in 1998;
not after they sat home last March at their Spokane outpost and
watched as teams from the bigger, more prestigious athletic
conferences were awarded at-large bids _ bids these Bulldogs knew
they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   So, with all that in mind, you expected sympathy?
</P>
<P>
   You expected nice, little Gonzaga to think twice about the
problems the big, ol' University of Minnesota basketball team
apparently heaped upon itself, when four current players were
implicated in allegations of academic fraud?
</P>
<P>
   No chance in hell, which, if you recall, was just about the same
odds the NCAA selection committee gave Gonzaga one year ago, when
they did not invite the Bulldogs to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Snubbed once, Gonzaga was hardened against any proposition that
their first-round victory Thursday at KeyArena was anything less
than deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room to mess up. No one ever offered to write a
paper for me,'' Gonzaga 3-point specialist Richie Frahm said, just
moments after Gonzaga escaped with a 75-63 win. The resurrection of
Frahm's deadly outside shooting, just in the nick of time, was one
of the keys to the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I said (before the game when the Gopher
suspensions were announced) was that I didn't want to talk about it
at all,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to beat Minnesota in the NCAA tournament by
40 points, regardless of who they have on the floor. We'll take the
12-point win.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from the intense Gonzaga coach? All is fair in love
and war and single-elimination basketball. There is no gray area
when it comes to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Win, you keep going. Lose, you go home. No quibbling. The
no-haggle rule is definitely in effect.
</P>
<P>
   By these pressurized, March madness standards, of course Gonzaga
earned it _ the Bulldogs' first NCAA tournament victory ever. No
apologies. No talk of a tainted win, even if their first-round
opponents, the Gophers, were anything less than golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming in that (Minnesota) coach (Clem) Haskins would
have his team ready to go,'' Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had had five guys to suit up, they would have been
ready, so no, it did not change our approach.''
</P>
<P>
   With this homework-cheating scandal hanging over them, it was
correct that Minnesota university officials suspended the four
Gophers allegedly involved. The university's risk of forfeit later
was too great. So, too, was the risk of having to hand back a nice
chunk of CBS money, should the allegations prove true.
</P>
<P>
   One question, though: If the players could not play in case
wrongdoing is later verified, what about the coach?
</P>
<P>
   You begrudgingly understand a big-time football coach making
excuses that he can't possibly keep track of 80 or more
``student-athletes'' and all their business when allegations of
NCAA cheating occur. But a dozen players on a basketball squad?
That is harder to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   That was the atmosphere surrounding this game, one that even
diehard Gopher fans said was embarrassing to the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing to hear about something like this,''
said one Twin Cities resident who flew in with 80 other Gopher
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have two sets of standards, one that says regular
students have do to one thing and athletes get to do something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Gopher basketball program is finding out there is no
way someone else can write your term papers and take your tests for
you, as alleged by a former university employee, the Bulldogs had
their moment of reckoning, too _ something they will no doubt keep
in mind tomorrow, when their next opponent is Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone's knowledge, the Cardinal players have all done
their homework.
</P>
<P>
   What the Bulldogs learned, though, is that it doesn't matter how
much of a lead you have at half-time _ no one is going to make your
jump shots. No one is going to make your threes. No one is going to
come in and give you a boost of confidence to make sure you pass
this NCAA tournament test.
</P>
<P>
   After reeling off a first-half barrage of jumpers and treys by
shooting 55.6 percent, Gonzaga opened the second half and found out
just what March madness is all about.
</P>
<P>
   The Gophers closed to within four, 58-54, with less than seven
minutes to play. They made it 65-63 with just over two minutes
left. It was tough not to imagine just what would have happened if
starters Miles Tarver and Kevin Clark had not been suspended
because the `Zags reeled under the pressure _ at least until Frahm
hit a huge three to make it 68-63, after he missed three shots
before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first appearance in the big dance and we were a
little tentative,'' Santangelo said. ``I'm probably the most
guilty. I got tentative. When our shots stop falling, we got a
little timid and started wondering, `What the heck is going on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the basketball gods had started off with a script
that called for the forces of good prevailing easily over the
forces of not-so-good, they almost ran out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, in the end, snuck out its first NCAA win as the
underdog in a game loaded with extenuating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bulldogs gave it a second thought.

NO BULL: SONICS SURVIVE MISTAKES TO BEAT CHICAGO

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Some may believe it was simply being in the right
place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   You are supposed to beat this version of the Chicago Bulls,
right? But nothing has been promised to the Sonics lately. And the
past 10 days have been anything but easy.
</P>
<P>
   So beating the Bulls, 92-83, Thursday night at United Center was
actually, well, sort of a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The victory finally gave the Sonics (10-9) something to relish
after drudging through a five-game losing streak. Although the
Sonics finished 1-2 on the road trip, which had them playing three
games in three nights, they were relieved to end their worst skid
since the 1990-91 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we've been finding ways to lose, it feels good just to
get a win,'' forward Detlef Schrempf said. ``It hasn't been a
pleasant 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sonics coach Paul Westphal: ``We've been having some
heart-breaking losses. We just needed a win.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting 6-0, the Sonics had lost nine of their past 12
games. Thursday night was the third time in the past four games the
Sonics were battling for the win in the fourth quarter. They lost
three of those in the final moments. This time, the Sonics
concentrated down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls (5-14) were coming off an impressive 103-87 victory
against New Jersey on Tuesday night. It was just the second home
win for Chicago, but the struggling Sonics got all they could
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to an 85-82 lead with a minute left in the game, Gary
Payton sealed the win by calmly connecting on his fifth 3-pointer
with 44.7 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored eight of his team-high 25 points in the fourth
quarter. He made 9 of 17 shots, including 5 of 10 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to get back home and fine-tune our whole game,''
Payton said. ``We're still not clicking on all cylinders. We're
struggling in all areas _ offense, defense and attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Sonics recovered some of what they lacked most
during their skid: confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good team,'' forward Vin Baker said. ``Now we have
the schedule to get right back into it. We're not out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The week ahead is comfortable for the Sonics. They play the Los
Angeles Clippers at KeyArena on Sunday. Then the Sonics face
Vancouver, Golden State and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expected to win a lot of ball games. So this isn't a
celebration,'' guard Dale Ellis said. ``But when you lose five
games in a row, it's getting the monkey off your back. . . . Nobody
was really down. Everybody was just disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one was more devastated by the team's fall than
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   After being held out of the fourth quarter the past two games
because of his poor play, Baker began to show his frustrations. He
vented displeasure with his late-game benching after Wednesday's
loss at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   However, Baker changed his tune and attitude Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some intensity and a lot more enthusiasm,'' Baker said.
``It wasn't a personal thing. I knew I had to come out and play
well. I had to just put aside the thoughts of my bad play and do
what I could to help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker finished with 18 points on 7-of-17 shooting. But his
biggest contribution came on defense. He switched defensive
assignments and guarded Toni Kukoc after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc mostly kept Chicago afloat with 21 points by halftime. He
finished with 28 points, and the Bulls managed just one point in
the last 2:27 of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us play small ball for a good part of the game,''
Westphal said. ``Vin accepted the challenge to play Kukoc. The way
he played tonight, I'd say he is back. He made some clutch shots
and his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out and covered Kukoc. He gave up some quickness, but
he denied him the ball and stopped him from going left. That
defense plus Gary and Detlef playing well tonight was the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Sonics were in the same position as many of the
Bulls' opponents. Chicago has played hard despite its record. The
Bulls have been particularly scrappy at the beginning of games and
led 52-49 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics dominated the offensive glass, 9-2, and used the
extra shots to stay in the game. The team benefited greatly from
Schrempf's 18 points and 10 rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf ignited a second-half surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we just have to put another streak together,'' Schrempf
said. ``If we win five or six games in a row, all of this will be
forgotten _ all of the problems, the meetings, everything.''

UCONN TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Connecticut's destination may be the Final Four, but to
get there, the top-seeded Huskies must take care of pesky matters
like their first-round game against 16th-seeded Texas-San Antonio.
Every long and magical journey starts with a first, sometimes
perfunctory, step and that is what on Thursday night's 91-66
victory was for UConn.
</P>
<P>
   With their head coach, Jim Calhoun, watching the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament game from his hotel room
because of an intestinal virus, the Huskies overcame a lethargic
start to frustrate and annihilate the Roadrunners in the West
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The game stopped being competitive when Connecticut ended the
first half with 15 straight points to construct a 25-point lead,
52-27, at McNichols Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun missed his second game this season with a virus, but
even the demanding coach could not scream at the television after
Connecticut (29-2) used its pressure defense to tame Texas-San
Antonio (18-11) and create numerous opportunities on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton, one of several Huskies who shaved his head
before the game, paced Connecticut with 28 points, and Kevin
Freeman added 16.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a blowout, as expected, so UConn's trip through
March will continue, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're peaking at the right time,'' Freeman had said on
Wednesday. ``We're confident coming into this game. We want to play
well. We got a lot of challenges ahead of us. This is the first
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Before UConn's rout, Lamont Long made an 8-foot jumper in
traffic with six seconds left to lift ninth-seeded New Mexico past
eighth-seeded Missouri, 61-59; fourth-seeded Arkansas nailed 15
3-pointers in silencing 13th-seeded Siena, 94-80, and Iowa kept Tom
Davis' coaching career with the Hawkeyes alive for at least one
more game with a 77-64 victory over Alabama-Birmingham. Davis is
being pushed out after 13 seasons, but he is enjoying his last,
bittersweet ride.
</P>
<P>
   UConn will oppose New Mexico (25-8) and Arkansas (23-10) will
play Iowa (19-9) in the second round on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun was replaced for the second time this season by his
associate head coach, Dave Leitao. Leitao also filled in for the
Huskies' 95-58 victory over Hartford on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just spoke to Coach Calhoun and he's feeling a little
better,'' Leitao said. ``He's happy that we played the way we
played and did the things that we talked about doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin, who had a career-high 10 assists for
Connecticut, said: ``Coach's spirit was there and Coach Leitao did
a great job. It seemed like Coach Calhoun wasn't even missing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a knowing nod, Calhoun acknowledged on Wednesday that the
first 10 minutes of Thursday night's game would be critical.
Connecticut needed to show Texas-San Antonio why its defense is so
suffocating, why its transition game stifles teams and why it is
seeded first in the regional.
</P>
<P>
   Why was this so important? Because the worst thing a heavily
favored team can do in the tournament is give the underdog reasons
to believe an upset is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the score,'' Calhoun had explained, ``but the way you
play.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Leitao closely monitored how Connecticut reacted
against the 16th-seeded Roadrunners for the first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were sluggish at the outset, playing just well
enough to stay ahead of Texas-San Antonio. That is exactly what
Calhoun was worried about. Hamilton had 9 points as the Huskies
snagged a 15-14 lead, but Ricky Reed hit a 3-pointer to put the
underdogs up by 19-17 with 11:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   In his hotel room, Calhoun was probably squirming. But El-Amin
made a 3-pointer and had a steal and a layup to key an 11-0 spurt
that gave the Huskies the lead at 28-19. There were just under 10
minutes left and Calhoun's critical test period was over. Had
Connecticut left enough of an imprint to sink the Roadrunners?
Maybe not, but that damaging punch came soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies kept antagonizing Texas-San Antonio (14 turnovers)
and used their pressure defense to ignite their transition game
while scoring 22 of the last 25 points in the half. Hamilton, who
had 17 points, drilled a runner at the buzzer to enable the Huskies
to trot to the locker room with a 52-27 bulge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never think about losing,'' Hamilton had said on Wednesday.
``Every time we step on the court, we think we're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, as expected, UConn did.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon session, reality slapped Siena in the face
early and often. Because the Razorbacks hung out beyond the 3-point
arc, because Siena tried to sprint with Arkansas and stumbled to 24
turnovers and because the Razorbacks were too athletic and too
deep, Arkansas cruised.
</P>
<P>
   Siena's chances for an upset started to fizzle as five
Razorbacks hit 3-pointers in the first six minutes and Arkansas
rumbled to a 21-point lead nine minutes into the game.

STUNNING FOR CAROLINA, SIMPLE FOR ST. JOHN'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It began with two air balls on free throws. And
then things got really unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Samford's case of first-time tournament
jitters, St. John's cruised to a 69-43 victory over the Bulldogs in
the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm, seeded third in the South Regional, scored the
first 13 points while 14th-seeded Samford flailed away fruitlessly
from behind the 3-point arc, unable to run the intricate backdoor
cuts that are the backbone of the Princeton offense it showcases.
</P>
<P>
   Samford, from the Trans America Athletic Conference, went
scoreless for 8 minutes 26 seconds to start the game as the
Bulldogs missed their first eight shots, seven of which were
3-pointers. Samford made just 7 of 33 3-point attempts over all.
The drought's signature moment came less than two minutes into the
game, when Boyd Kaiser was fouled by Bootsy Thornton and headed to
the free-throw line. Disaster struck Kaiser as he missed the rim
entirely on both shots and the boisterous Samford contingent, which
stood for the entire first half, groaned. Samford shot just 25
percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of this game is not Kafkaesque,'' Samford Coach
Jimmy Tillette said. ``It's not a good idea to let the opponent
score the first 13 points and you not score 12. We were nervous
from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Samford guard Mario Lopez said: ``We were very nervous and we
were completely out of sync. I've never seen us shoot like that.
When we got open looks, we didn't make shots, and the times we did
get backdoor we didn't finish around the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The only suspense of this game _ other than when the broadcast
would switch to another region _ was whether the Bulldogs would
break the 20-point barrier before halftime. They did, at 33-20,
when Reed Rawlings (14 points), Samford's best player, grabbed a
long offensive rebound and lofted a jumper as the halftime buzzer
sounded. It was Samford's only non-3-point field goal of the half.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's defense made a complex offense seem ridiculously
simple. With its ability to switch on defense to avoid mismatches,
the Red Storm (26-8) denied Samford any opportunity to try layups.
</P>
<P>
   Samford did not attempt one for the entire first half and had
just two in the game. Nerves took care of the rest until late in
the first half, when Samford finally settled into a rhythm behind
Marc Sal-yers (11 points), who hit the 3-pointer that ended the
shutout. St. John's players credited the scouting tape the coaches
had prepared, saying it showed them who would try to make the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do to this team what Connecticut did to us,''
Erick Barkley said, referring to the bludgeoning St. John's took
from the Huskies in the final of the Big East tournament last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As lopsided as the score was, it could have been much worse if
St. John's had been able to finish even a handful of its dozens of
scoring opportunities close to the basket _ and that could be a
cause for concern going into a second-round game Saturday with
Indiana, which beat George Washington in the second game on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's shot just 42.3 percent from the field in the first
half and 48 percent for the game. Although four players finished in
double figures _ Ron Artest (17 points), Lavor Postell (14), Bootsy
Thornton (13) and Barkley (11) _ Coach Mike Jarvis conceded that he
and his team were disappointed when, during an early timeout, their
lead was not bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very glad to be up and yet you realize when you're
playing against a team as dangerous and proficient at the 3 as they
are, 11 is nice, but it's not much,'' Jarvis said. ``I really felt,
because we had missed good opportunities, it could have been
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   That type of sloppy game _ the Red Storm also committed 18
turnovers _ will not get the team much further in this tournament,
as the talent level increases exponentially with each round.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said the misses were merely the result of the players'
needing to get used to their new surroundings, to the feel of the
ball and the angle of the backboards. But Indiana is far superior
in talent and experience to Samford and will be more capable of
exploiting the Red Storm's lack of sharpness if it reappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you go on, the games get harder,'' Artest said. ``Saturday
is going to be a war because people want to be in the Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA 108, GWU 88: In the highest-scoring game in their
storied post-season history, the sixth-seeded Hoosiers showed off
unselfish offense and tough man-to-man defense to beat George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman Kirk Haston scored 27 points despite playing with a
broken left hand, and A.J. Guyton _ with help all over the court _
slowed down 5-foot-4-inch Shawnta Rogers, the Atlantic 10 player of
the year. Rogers scored 28 points, though he shot 10 for 31 to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers (23-10) had lost five of their last six tournament
games, but this performance brought back memories of better days
when Coach Bobby Knight led them to three NCAA championships.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this was even better than usual for them. Indiana broke
the school scoring record in the tournament, set in a 107-90
victory over Auburn on its way to the 1987 title.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which had not played George Washington since 1941, won
despite losing the starting center Larry Richardson to back spasms
early in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers are 42-20 over all under Knight in the tournament.

UTSA BEST MEDICINE FOR UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
 ANTONIO-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As the Connecticut Huskies drove to McNichols Arena
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, associate coach Dave Leitao couldn't help but
wonder to himself, ``Why now, why me?'' Leitao was left to lead the
top-seeded Huskies into their NCAA Tournament West regional
first-round game after head coach Jim Calhoun developed a
gastro-intestinal virus so severe it prevented him from attending.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. Calhoun had so well prepared his team for the
worst in the days leading up to Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's contest, he made
Leitao's job virtually worry free. Scrappy, 16th-seeded Texas-San
Antonio initially frustrated UConn with its 3-2 zone defense and
reckless up-tempo attack. But UConn (29-2) responded with pressure
defense to outscore the opposition, 33-8, over the last 11:18 of
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, it was evident which coach had brought his
squad to town three days in advance to adjust to the mile-high
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's presence wasn't necessary Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. His team
was a living testament to the Boy Scout motto, and its preparation
led to a 91-66 Huskies' triumph that could have served as a sleep
aid to their coach, who watched from his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Leitao said he spoke to Calhoun immediately following the game
and Calhoun was pleased with what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit of a different circumstance with him not
being here. We just hope to have him back for (Saturday's) game,''
said Leitao, who used 10 players Thursday &UR;  &LR; night (with six playing
at least 24 minutes) to wear down the Roadrunners (18-12).
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players in the locker room that we are the best
defensive team in the country,'' he added. ``We can stop you in a
lot of different ways with a lot of different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way for the Huskies was forward Richard Hamilton (28
points), who scored 17 in the first half. Forward Kevin Freeman
added 16 points and had a team-high eight boards, and Khalid
El-Amin added 7 points and 10 assists for the Huskies, which scored
at will over the last 10 minutes of the first half. Jake Voskuhl
led UConn's interior defense with four of the team's 10 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept the pressure on them, they got tired and later on
in the first half we showed we had spurtability,'' said El-Amin,
whose terminology prompted laughter from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But he was correct in that UTSA (18-11) did suffer from fatigue
trying to keep up with UConn. With 15:51 left, UTSA's Reggie
Minniweather, Jerome Riley, and Ricky Reed all required oxygen
during a timeout, with the Huskies leading, 54-35. It didn't get
much better when play resumed _ the fresh Huskies staged a 7-2 run
for a 61-37 advantage with 13:46 left.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hamilton, ``The thing that helped us was that we practiced
at the Air Force Academy where it was about 2,000 feet higher than
it was here (at McNichols, which is 5,280 feet above sea level).
And we pushed ourselves, so we didn't get fatigued.''
</P>
<P>
   UTSA coach Tim Carter praised his team for continuing to play
hard even when it appeared so bothered by fatigue it didn't score a
field goal over the last 6:24 of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take away their run late in the first half, and who knows
what could have happened,'' said Carter, whose team trailed by as
many as 67-40 with 11:25 left before taking advantage of UConn's
sloppiness to cut the lead to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Carter joked that when he was told Calhoun wouldn't attend the
game, ``I was happy because I knew the food I sent over to his
hotel had gotten to him. I was hoping a few of his players would
have eaten some, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Meyer led UTSA with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   As for Calhoun's status for Saturday's second-round contest
against No. 9 New Mexico (25-8), trainer Jeff Anderson said he gave
the coach a shot to relieve his symptoms and said Calhoun usually
is back on his feet after 24 hours.

FAMILIAR END FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For five months, the UCLA Bruins talked of new
blood and a better attitude. They had a refreshing, tenacious
style. They wore bold, black uniforms and splattered the cover of
their media guide with the phrase, ``There's a New Dawn in
Westwood.''
</P>
<P>
   But when dusk fell and their season disappeared into the frigid
Midwestern night, what remained looked eerily familiar _ like
Tulsa, like Princeton, like all the other early exits and
underachieving ends the program has produced this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Bruins lost to the 12th-seeded Detroit 56-53
Thursday night before 27,959 in the RCA Dome _ their third
first-round defeat in six years.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, they proved why this was the most popular upset
pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't complain, they just stopped us,'' UCLA guard Baron
Davis said. ``All year, we were inconsistent. We took some teams
lightly and we didn't prepare right for the good teams. Tonight, it
caught up with us.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA lost despite taking a nine-point lead with 15 minutes left
and holding the Titans to 24 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins lost Davis to fouls, failed to grab crucial
rebounds, missed free throws, committed silly fouls and scored just
five points in the last six minutes _ all the things they've done
before.
</P>
<P>
   When it mattered most, the Bruins made two of their last 11
shots and failed to execute against a zone defense, just as they
failed against Stanford two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst feeling I've ever felt in my entire life,''
forward Sean Farnham said. ``We competed the whole game, but there
were a couple situations in regards to rebounds, loose balls and
being more solid on offense that cost us the game. We should have
gotten better shots. Our defense was phenomenal. When you hold a
team to 32 percent shooting, you should win.''
</P>
<P>
   The end came on Daniel Whye's difficult 18-foot jumper with 12
seconds left, giving the Titans a 53-50 lead and sealing defeat for
the Bruins in the same building they lost to Princeton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The finish substantiated the belief that without Davis on the
floor, the Bruins lack the experience, patience and structure to
win big games. His departure with 1:19 left _ on a non-shooting
foul 15 feet from the basket _ was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really drained us emotionally, because he's our floor
leader,'' forward JaRon Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (25-5) had UCLA well-scouted and played the only way
they could to survive: by slowing the tempo to a crawl. They used a
deliberate attack that forced UCLA to play defense for extended
periods.
</P>
<P>
   They did not take bad shots, which limited UCLA's fast-break
opportunities. And they handled the ball like a newborn against
UCLA's full-court pressure, which also prevented the Bruins' break
from revving.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Detroit played a compact zone that shut off the
penetration and passing lanes into the low post. This forced the
Bruins to rely on the weakest aspect of their game _ perimeter
jumpers. Of UCLA's 50 shots, 27 were 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Bruins committed 17 turnovers _ the equivalent
of 30 turnovers in a game of normal pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense prevailed,'' Titans forward Bacari Alexander said.
``We were able to keep them below their scoring average and keep
their percentages low. That's our type of game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only way Detroit could play. It was the way Princeton
played, the way Miami played last year, the obvious way. And it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mystery in terms of why we lost,'' coach Steve
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins emerged from halftime appearing more comfortable with
the tempo and their plan. Earl Watson found Davis for a 3-pointer,
converted a Davis miss and then deflected a loose ball downcourt to
Ray Young for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   With a 40-31 lead, UCLA was in control _ or so it seemed. Rashad
Phillips steadied Detroit with a 3-pointer, then Davis committed
his third and fourth fouls in a 30-second span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, if we could just execute a couple times, we've
got them,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the bench for two minutes _ two scoreless minutes for
UCLA _ and that was all Detroit needed. Jermaine Jackson made four
free throws and Phillips hit a mid-range jumper with 9:28 left to
erase the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used a wild sequence to grab a 48-42 lead with 6:12
left, but Detroit tightened its defense in the stretch and claimed
a 49-48 margin lead with 1:53 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then Davis fouled out in what was probably his last game. And
UCLA bowed out.!end!

DAVIS LIKELY TO TURN PRO

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sophomore guard Baron Davis has played his last
game for UCLA and will enter the NBA draft, according to a non-UCLA
source close to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the family and friends are hoping the Lakers get him,''
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is expected to be one of the top players selected,
hinted at his plans when he waved to the crowd and hugged his
teammates in the final seconds of the regular-season finale Feb. 27
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a 56-53 loss to Detroit on Thursday, Davis had 16 points and
four assists before fouling out. Afterward, he hugged teammates and
proffered advice, but refused to confirm his plans.
</P>
<P>
   He has said a decision will come soon after the season, but the
Bruins consider the issue closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone, and he probably would have left last year if he
hadn't gotten hurt,'' a UCLA source said, referring to the knee
injury Davis suffered in the 1998 second-round game against
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bruins have evaluated several high school
seniors, including Compton's Tito Maddox and Verbum Dei's Marlon
Parmer, but probably will not sign a point guard this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they'll use Earl Watson and Ryan Bailey next season
while pursuing several top prep players _ the current juniors _ for
the 2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we dance? The Bruins waited (and waited) for their 10 p.m.
(EST) tipoff. The Ohio State-Murray State game ran late, then a
malfunctioning shot clock delayed tipoff an additional 10 minutes _
to 10:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   To get the blood flowing, the Bruins had a brief practice at the
RCA Dome and then held a short walk-through in the hotel ballroom _
a practice made popular by Indiana coach Bob Knight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic change from last year, when the Bruins passed
on the practice, sat around for 10 hours and played lethargically
against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Making a point: Some of the nation's best point guards have
gathered in the RCA Dome, and several of them have Southern
California connections.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's Jason Hart played at Inglewood High School and signed
with the Orangemen when UCLA didn't offer a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State's Doug Gottlieb is a Tustin native who originally
enrolled at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   There's UCLA's Baron Davis, who played Pop Warner football with
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. Auburn's Doc Robinson, Murray State's Aubrey
Reese and Detroit's Jermaine Jackson are among the best in their
conferences. And don't forget Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, who
transferred from Boston College and was named Big Ten co-Player of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Dome doings: The RCA Dome has been the site of several memorable
tournament games this decade, with UCLA contributing twice.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1991, Duke stunned unbeaten UNLV 79-77 in the national
semifinals and then beat Kansas to win the first of its
back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, Princeton shocked defending national champ UCLA 43-41
in legendary coach Pete Carril's last NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, underdog Arizona slayed No. 1 seeds North Carolina
and Kentucky in the Final Four to win its first championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ And, now, UCLA's loss to No.12 seed Detroit on Thursday night.

COMMENTARY: A SMALL TOWN AND ITS IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are worse things than being from Beverly Hills. It was
thus disconcerting to learn that Monica Lewinsky regards my
hometown as the source of her anguish and our long national
nightmare. In ``Monica's Story,'' Andrew Morton blames Beverly
Hills' ``obsession'' with status, money and thinness for Ms.
Lewinsky's eating compulsions and self-destructive behavior. In
third grade, it seems, she was devastated not to be invited to Tori
Spelling's birthday party, featuring Michael Jackson and the
world's smallest pony.
</P>
<P>
   Of course this episode tells less about the snubber than the
snubbed. But Beverly Hills has always been a world unto itself.
When I was growing up in the 1950s and early 60s, it had many
features of other affluent suburbs along with a make-believe
quality that set it apart.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, it was largely a town of lawyers, doctors and
business people like my father who moved there after the war
because of its school system. The many people in the entertainment
business put on coats and ties in the morning, like everyone else,
and went to the studio to work, even as the studio system was
collapsing. Rodeo Drive had a bridle path down the middle, a relic
of a sleepier time, and the commercial center featured modest
stores like Newberry's, a five-and-dime, and Uncle Bernie's Toy
Menagerie, with a tree that dispensed lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   We all knew that our town was not normal, however. My
recollections include banal pleasures like seeing Jack Benny being
driven past my house each day, to and from Hillcrest Country Club.
As a kid, I used to sneak with my pals into the abandoned hilltop
estate of Harold Lloyd, the silent-movie star, for elaborate war
games amid the palatial terraces, fountains and crumbling statuary.
Oscar season? No big deal, but when the father of a school friend
won for best screenplay, I remember another friend joking that ``my
dad produced your dad's picture.'' Like many a high school, mine
had a Career Day, except that it had a comedy workshop with Joey
Bishop, Groucho Marx, Carl Reiner and Steve Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills, like everywhere else, changed forever when it
became engulfed by drugs and rebelliousness in the late 1960s. Then
came the California taxpayer revolt that dried up resources for the
school district. The financial squeeze led a few years ago to
alumni being asked for money to repair the high school ``swim
gym,'' memorably featured in ``It's a Wonderful Life,''when the
floor opens up and Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed fall into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   But while these changes were occurring, Beverly Hills' status
went from famous to mythic. The entertainment industry became
consumed with itself, the public was eager to go along, and Beverly
Hills followed suit. Today the average American high school student
knows about the weekend film grosses, and Hollywood's
self-referential path has gone from ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' to
``Beverly Hills Cop'' to ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' a television hit
created by Aaron Spelling, of the 56,500-square-foot mansion (in
nearby Holmby Hills), and featuring his grown-up daughter, Tori.
</P>
<P>
   The town is now in what Charles Rosin, a Beverly Hills High
School graduate and former executive producer of ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' refers to as the post-Rodeo-Drive era. The center is still
headquarters to lots of show-business companies, but the population
has changed with the influx of wealthy Iranian immigrants. Indeed,
30 percent of the city speaks Farsi. Most residents do not shop
downtown, and they are less interested in the glamour than in the
fact that the police force takes only three minutes to respond to
emergencies. March Schwartz, longtime publisher of The Beverly
Hills Courier, feels that Monica Lewinsky's scathing attack on
Beverly Hills is a smear against a town that has had to endure more
than its share. ``We have always had errant students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is interesting to speculate whether the events of the
last year would have occurred had Ms. Lewinsky grown up on the West
Side of Manhattan rather than in Los Angeles. Rosin, the television
producer, notes that the success of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' partly
derives from its portrayal of ``a serene external image of glamour
that covers up the inner turmoil and insecurities of the
characters.'' You can envy their lives and still see that they are
a mess. He said Ms. Lewinsky was ``a vintage Beverly Hills story''
and that ``she could have easily been a character on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   That actually sounds like a great sequel. Monica and Tori,
together at last. Did someone mention closure?

CLIPPERS AVOID BREAKING RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Clippers win, so help us. Clippers win.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry; it means the same thing in English.
</P>
<P>
   Now call your bookie about Charley Brown pitching that
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In defeating the Sacramento Kings 106-92 Thursday night in front
of 7,884 at the Sports Arena, the Clippers proved that some records
aren't meant to be broken, just tied.
</P>
<P>
   In a grim departure from 1999 tradition, their game faces didn't
end up covered with pie. Coach Chris Ford, the former Celtic, can
exhale, because he claimed a Clippers win before St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   And for those of you living in treehouses or on billboard
runways, it was the Clippers' very first victory in 18 dates this
season. In winning, they failed to break a deadlock with the
1988-'89 Miami expansion team that previously held the league
record for consecutive defeats to begin a season (ahem, 17).
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for a unification bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys have faced a lot of adversity,'' Ford said, ``but the
streak is over and hopefully it's the beginning of something new
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. At press time, ``The Tonight Show'' was attempting to
book the entire team for today's taping. Other than the NBA draft
lottery show, it would be their only NBC appearance this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clippers got what they deserved tonight,'' Kings coach
Rick Adelman said, ``and we got what we deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   In freezing history by becoming the only team to lose to the
Clippers so far this season, the 9-11 Kings caught Lorenzen Wright
on the rebound. Wright, who reclaimed the starting center role when
rookie Michael Olowokandi sprained his left ankle two weeks ago, is
one of those guys the Clippers didn't unload before Thursday's
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   All he did against Sacramento _ in the Clippers' third game in
as many nights _ was squeeze 20 rebounds... in the first half. He
completed the rebounding masterpiece with 26, the league's top mark
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to go out and get every rebound,'' said Wright,
who only tracked down 30 percent of the missed shots available.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings provided juice for the crowd through the relentless
razzle-dazzle of rookie point guard Jason ``White Chocolate''
Williams. Williams captured many imaginations and stuffed the stat
sheet with nine points (he missed 10 of 14 field-goal attempts) and
four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Clipperville, seven players scored in double figures.
Lamond Murray (15 points) and starter Tyrone Nesby (13) combined
for 28 points at small forward. Eric Piatkowski came off the bench
for eight points in each half. The Clippers' bench scored 50
points; the Kings' subs went for 35.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers point guard Darrick Martin led the Clippers with 18
points, 11 assists and one measly turnover. He demonstrated that _
at this stage of his career _ the offensively gifted Williams might
have difficulty guarding a mime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player and he's going to have a great career in
this league,'' Martin said of Williams, adding that the rookie's
attendant hype was no motivation. ``I just play as hard as I can no
matter if it's Jason Williams or Stephon Marbury.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are adopting a similar attitude. To extend their
current streak on Saturday, they'll have to defeat the Portland
Trail Blazers, who have the league's best record.

`PEANUTS' GANG WILL NO LONGER BE MET LIFE'S MAIN REPRESENTATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company prepares
to go public, the insurance giant is starting to portray itself in
a very different way, playing down cartoon faces in favor of human
ones.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 15 years, campaigns by Young &AMP; Rubicam New York for
Met Life, as the company is often called, have featured Snoopy, the
anthropomorphic beagle, and other characters from the popular
``Peanuts'' comic strip. But in a revamped campaign that begins on
Sunday, they are being reduced to cameo roles as the agents and
customers of Met Life get top billing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the initial series of commercials, Snoopy
appears just briefly, glimpsed on a television or computer screen
or smiling at the end. In a print ad, Snoopy turns up only in the
lower right-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is indicative of the efforts necessary to freshen
long-running campaigns to avert consumer boredom and stay abreast
of important corporate events. Met Life announced in November that
it would take the first steps in a one-to-two-year process of
reorganizing into a stock-based corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Met Life is about to undergo a change that is perhaps more
significant than any in its 130-year history, becoming a public
company,'' said Bill Green, executive vice president at Y.&AMP; R. New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without totally abandoning the high recognition that Snoopy
and the `Peanuts' characters have given us,'' he added, ``we want
to marry the past, present and future of this company, if you will,
to announce we're changing and to build the Met Life brand as
strongly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Conway, executive vice president and executive creative
director at Y.&AMP; R. New York, said: ``Believe me, when you've got
icons like the `Peanuts' characters working for you, you think very
carefully before stepping away from that. On the other hand, we
felt the need to talk about the history, because consumers like
hearing a part of the Met Life story they've not heard before,
especially with the changes Bob Benmosche is planning.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to Robert H. Benmosche, chairman, president
and chief executive at Met Life in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was too much Snoopy,'' Benmosche said of previous
campaigns, adding: ``When you talk about Met Life, you say, `That's
Snoopy's company,' and that's important. But we also want the ads
to begin to remind people why to do business with Met Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Results from consumers in focus groups were ``very clear,'' he
said, in revealing that the previous campaigns ``did a wonderful
job of getting people to think about Met Life when they saw
Snoopy.'' He added, ``What they didn't do was tell you what the
company did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you come to Met Life and get paid is because it's a
strong company,'' he said. ``When things get tough, we have staying
power, and we can live up to guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   So gone are whimsical ``Peanuts'' tales centered on a Snoopy
treasure hunt, symbolizing the search for retirement income, or a
dive into Snoopy's water bowl by the diminutive bird Woodstock,
symbolizing the need for financial planning ``when you take the
plunge into'' major life changes like home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   While the longtime theme ``Get Met. It pays.'' continues, the
slogan now follows vignettes reminiscing about the company's
heritage. They are interwoven with contemporary tales about agents'
sales of products like insurance and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Benmosche traced his interest in Met Life's history to his
``joining the company three and a half years ago'' from Paine
Webber and before that Chase Manhattan; he is not a career
insurance executive like his predecessor, Harry P. Kamen, who
worked for Met Life for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   As he studied his new company, Benmosche recalled: ``I was
amazed how many things Met Life had done. I would go around telling
people, `Did you realize the Plaza Hotel was built with Met Life
money? Or that in 1897 the company built a gym for its employees?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the country today remembers what people knew
years ago,'' he added, ``how substantial a company Met Life is.''
</P>
<P>
   Green agreed that Benmosche's being ``intensely interested in
the history of Met Life'' played a role in the campaign's new
direction. But, he added, ``because of the millennium, consumers
out there are more interested in the past than they were 10 or 15
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the new campaign concentrates on recounting the Met
Life role in founding an Immigrant Service and Citizenship Bureau,
helping save farms during the Depression and buying bonds during
World War II. Those stories are told by actors of diverse
backgrounds portraying Met Life agents in three disparate cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one big happy family, so you love the differences,''
says the actor playing a Met Life agent in Brooklyn, who mingles
with immigrants from around the world and describes himself as ``a
quarter Italian, a quarter Portuguese and an eighth Spanish.'' An
Asian-American actress playing a Met Life agent working in a
Chinatown neighborhood asserts: ``America still has a frontier. San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my town,'' an African-American actor declares in a third
commercial as he drives through Rock Falls, Ill., 114 miles west of
Chicago, visiting farmer customers.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call on Thursday to the Met Life office nearest to
Rock Falls, in Sterling, Ill., was answered by a woman who said
that the office there had two agents, neither black; Benmosche said
the spots were meant to be ``illustrative'' in imparting the
``message this is an incredibly diverse company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're strongest in people who just came to this country,''
Benmosche said, adding that in 1997-98, ``30 percent of our sales
to individuals were to people who are in this country but not born
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots will first appear during a rebroadcast of the film
``Schindler's List'' on NBC, which will be sponsored by Met Life
and the online company Snap. The first print ad will run on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign extends through April with a budget of $7 million;
Met Life typically spends $20 million to $25 million a year on
advertising. The spots will return at least two more times in 1999,
Green said.

BRUINS LET THEIR GUARD DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Bruins knew Detroit was good. They knew
Detroit's guards were good. But not this good, no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guards were way better than I expected,'' UCLA forward
Travis Reed said. ``I mean, I knew they were good, but man, I
didn't think they were that good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had the best guards on the floor Thursday night in
their 56-53 upset of No. 5 seed UCLA, before 27,959 at the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers confirm it: Jermaine Jackson and Rashad Phillips
combined for 33 points, six assists and seven turnovers. UCLA's
Baron Davis and Earl Watson combined for 25 points, 11 assists and
eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, Jermaine and I told each other
that every time we go out on the court, we'll go after the other
backcourt,'' Phillips said. ``That's what we came to do to Davis
and Watson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' tandem outrebounded their counterparts 10-9. They
hit 10 of 12 free throws, and they stayed in the game. The Bruins'
backcourt was 0 of 4 from the line _ as a team UCLA was 5 of 12 _
and Davis fouled out with 1:19 remaining, taking UCLA's hope to the
bench with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us fouling and them going to the line kept them in the game,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a senior and the Midwestern Collegiate Conference MVP,
led all scorers with 17 points. Each time the Titans needed a
basket _ or a free throw _ he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, I smelled blood for whoever was guarding
me,'' he said. ``I had to go to my strength, and that's driving to
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't feel we had to prove anything. Rashad and I can
play with any backcourt in the nation. I guess everybody has seen
the results. We're not saying we're better than anybody, but we can
play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half proved it.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans made just five field goals but 14 of 16 free throws.
They shot 24 percent from the field, trailed by nine and six points
on separate occasions, but they never panicked, not once.
</P>
<P>
   Foul shooting and defense were the difference. The Titans
tightened their zone and smothered center Jerome Moiso, UCLA's only
accomplished low-post scorer. In the second half, he took one shot
_ an errant (and difficult) turnaround in the final minute _ and
made zero impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job inside,'' Moiso said. ``They were
swarming us, and I couldn't get the ball. It was hard going
inside.''

   Similarly, trust a crowd to fight the wrong wars. Almost
everywhere I look I find people worrying about what both the
political left and right call the culture wars, which are being
fought over abortion, homosexuality, public morality, church-state
separation, coarsened entertainment, multiculturalism, pornography,
divorce, profanity, euthanasia, cohabitation and on and on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Pat Buchanan announced his candidacy for president
recently, he was direct about his desire to lead the charge against
``all that pollutes our culture.'' To Buchanan, ``ultimately, our
culture war is about one question: Is God dead or is God king?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His very wording puts him at odds with people who might, on one
level, agree with his faith-based assessment but who no longer are
willing to use exclusively masculine words to refer to the deity
because they find it doesn't reflect the full scriptural witness
and doing so is at least subtly hostile to more than half the
population. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, as I say, despite the terrific heat these culture wars
generate over such matters, they are, in the end, the wrong fight.
I'm not saying they are unimportant. Or that there's nothing to
fight about. Many of the issues I've listed (and others) deserve
our best thinking and debating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they are secondary to the real and serious damage being done
to our culture by the increasingly widespread fiction that all of
us are, at base, economic creatures whose highest and best role is
that of consumer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This deception turns all segments of the media into little more
than magnets to attract an audience to which advertisers may pitch
their wares. It is, in fact, easy to make a case that many segments
of the media rarely rise above that role. Television is the most
obvious culprit, but the Internet _ with its misinformation,
pornography and mere silliness packaged as vehicles for commercial
messages _ is often an equally ignoble enterprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people fighting these peripheral culture wars are,
at the same time, pledging allegiance to the very economic system
whose abuse leads to this culture of consumerism. That is, they
defend capitalism almost without qualification. And even though
it's true that an open market is, at least in its ideal, the least
oppressive economic system yet devised, it is imperfect everywhere
it's used and it seems to seduce some of its proponents into
imagining that it's divinely ordained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that what our consumerist culture does, in the end,
is ignore the reality that we are both material and spiritual
beings who have higher callings than owning the latest sports car
or fastest modem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we are created not for consumption but for relationship.
And the failure to understand that leads to an inability to grasp
that there are rules about relationships that must be observed. If
those rules are flouted _ as they clearly were in the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair (between two people with dark vacuums where
their moral centers should be) _ people are damaged, diminished,
even destroyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can be persuaded that, reworded, Buchanan's culture wars
question _ Is God dead or is God sovereign? _ is the right one
because, properly understood, it can point us toward the culture
battle that should engage us. Which is the one about whether we are
created first for relationship _ both horizontal (with other
people) and vertical (with God) _ or for consumption. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the battle cry heard on Buchanan's side of the other culture
wars too often leads people to imagine that they know precisely
where God stands on all issues. Armed with the arrogance of that
false certainty, helmets on, pitchforks in hand, they have ridden
off to slay the wrong dragons and, thus, are unavailable to fight
the more sinister and insidious one. &QL;

   Aerospace engineer, author (``The Case for Mars'') and
controversial planetary visionary Robert Zubrin convened the
founding convention of the Mars Society in Boulder, Colo. His
mission? To tell the world that Mars exploration is scientifically
vital and technologically feasible. But the membership, united in
their ideal of a frontier utopia on the Red Planet, is fiercely
divided on the nature of a Martian society they would create.
Oliver Morton writes about science and technology and their effects
for The New Yorker, Science, Nature, and the Financial Times. He is
currently working on a book about Mars.

   Exciting new evidence suggests that the first humans in the New

Who, when, where and how the first North Americans came to the

museum laboratory outside Carson City, Nev., offer startling clues
as to the origins of mankind. Karen Wright is a free-lance writer

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over a weekend last August some 700 enthusiasts arrived for the
society's founding convention held at the University Memorial
Center. They are passionate about getting to Mars. And for many,
paradoxically, the very attraction of Mars is that it is distant
and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Zubrin is working himself up to the climax
of his opening address to the conference. He has told the assembled
throng how to get to Mars; now he's telling them why to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind, says Zubrin, has always grown through adversity. Only
with a new frontier to conquer will we rise to greater
technological and human heights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience knows this stuff. It's been reiterated in
Zubrin's many speeches over the past decade. It's in his book,
``The Case for Mars,'' the response to which inspired him to start
the Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, while working at Martin Marietta in Denver,
Zubrin came up with a new way to get people to Mars that looked
remarkably cheap. The key lay in tackling Mars as two separate
problems _ getting there and getting back.
</P>
<P>
   The first could be solved with existing technology; the second
could be managed with a crewless mission that could make fuel for
the return journey on the Martian surface before the first
explorers even left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin and his colleague David Baker called this plan ``Mars
Direct'' because the spacecraft involved would be small enough to
be launched to Mars straight from Cape Canaveral. And Zubrin set
out to get it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional'' plans for crewed Mars missions involved huge
spacecraft built in orbit. These, to Zubrin, are the Death Stars _
too big, too slow to develop, and too expensive ever to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Death Stars were NASA's Mars missions of
choice. Now, in large part thanks to Zubrin's efforts, NASA talks
of a much more feasible mission, ``Mars semi-direct,'' but it's
just talk. NASA has no active plans for putting people on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So, having made the case to aerospace engineers that we can get
to Mars, Zubrin wants to convince the rest of the world that we
should. That's where the Mars Society comes in. It's a lobby, a
scientific network, maybe something of a cult. Its members in
Boulder are predominantly male, mostly American and overwhelmingly
white. Some are scientists devoted to Mars, others are aerospace
engineers, artists, priests and many are just believers who have
read Zubrin's book and want to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zubrin is neutral on the question of government on
Mars, there's a fair amount of antigovernment rhetoric during the
convention weekend. Edward Hudgins, a libertarian from the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., gave a paper on a Martian utopia
with no central government. Most of the antigovernment views stem
not from a deeply felt ideological view like Hudgins' but from
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of Mars is not just that it is attainable, it is
that many people think it should already have been attained. The
literature of their youth told them so. And yet since the successes
of Apollo there has been not just stasis in space exploration but
retreat. Feeling let down by government, many would-be Martians
turn to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. One is that no private company
will put up the funds to go to Mars without cheaper, more reliable
space technology and the promise of real profit. The second is that
for quite a few of the convention participants, a lot of this stuff
is simply not fitting. Do you really want to go to Mars as a TV
show? Sponsored by Tang?
</P>
<P>
   In the original Mars underground, in much of science fiction and
in the Mars Society, the idea of Mars having once fostered life has
become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

<P>
   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over a weekend last August some 700 enthusiasts arrived for the
society's founding convention held at the University Memorial
Center. They are passionate about getting to Mars. And for many,
paradoxically, the very attraction of Mars is that it is distant
and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Zubrin is working himself up to the climax
of his opening address to the conference. He has told the assembled
throng how to get to Mars; now he's telling them why to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind, says Zubrin, has always grown through adversity. Only
with a new frontier to conquer will we rise to greater
technological and human heights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience knows this stuff. It's been reiterated in
Zubrin's many speeches over the past decade. It's in his book,
``The Case for Mars,'' the response to which inspired him to start
the Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, while working at Martin Marietta in Denver,
Zubrin came up with a new way to get people to Mars that looked
remarkably cheap. The key lay in tackling Mars as two separate
problems _ getting there and getting back.
</P>
<P>
   The first could be solved with existing technology; the second
could be managed with a crewless mission that could make fuel for
the return journey on the Martian surface before the first
explorers even left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin and his colleague David Baker called this plan ``Mars
Direct'' because the spacecraft involved would be small enough to
be launched to Mars straight from Cape Canaveral. And Zubrin set
out to get it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional'' plans for crewed Mars missions involved huge
spacecraft built in orbit. These, to Zubrin, are the Death Stars _
too big, too slow to develop, and too expensive ever to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Death Stars were NASA's Mars missions of
choice. Now, in large part thanks to Zubrin's efforts, NASA talks
of a much more feasible mission, ``Mars semi-direct,'' but it's
just talk. NASA has no active plans for putting people on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So, having made the case to aerospace engineers that we can get
to Mars, Zubrin wants to convince the rest of the world that we
should. That's where the Mars Society comes in. It's a lobby, a
scientific network, maybe something of a cult. Its members in
Boulder are predominantly male, mostly American and overwhelmingly
white. Some are scientists devoted to Mars, others are aerospace
engineers, artists, priests and many are just believers who have
read Zubrin's book and want to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zubrin is neutral on the question of government on
Mars, there's a fair amount of antigovernment rhetoric during the
convention weekend. Edward Hudgins, a libertarian from the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., gave a paper on a Martian utopia
with no central government. Most of the antigovernment views stem
not from a deeply felt ideological view like Hudgins' but from
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of Mars is not just that it is attainable, it is
that many people think it should already have been attained. The
literature of their youth told them so. And yet since the successes
of Apollo there has been not just stasis in space exploration but
retreat. Feeling let down by government, many would-be Martians
turn to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. One is that no private company
will put up the funds to go to Mars without cheaper, more reliable
space technology and the promise of real profit. The second is that
for quite a few of the convention participants, a lot of this stuff
is simply not fitting. Do you really want to go to Mars as a TV
show? Sponsored by Tang?
</P>
<P>
   In the original Mars underground, in much of science fiction and
in the Mars Society, the idea of Mars having once fostered life has
become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

<P>
   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over a weekend last August some 700 enthusiasts arrived for the
society's founding convention held at the University Memorial
Center. They are passionate about getting to Mars. And for many,
paradoxically, the very attraction of Mars is that it is distant
and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Zubrin is working himself up to the climax
of his opening address to the conference. He has told the assembled
throng how to get to Mars; now he's telling them why to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind, says Zubrin, has always grown through adversity. Only
with a new frontier to conquer will we rise to greater
technological and human heights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience knows this stuff. It's been reiterated in
Zubrin's many speeches over the past decade. It's in his book,
``The Case for Mars,'' the response to which inspired him to start
the Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, while working at Martin Marietta in Denver,
Zubrin came up with a new way to get people to Mars that looked
remarkably cheap. The key lay in tackling Mars as two separate
problems _ getting there and getting back.
</P>
<P>
   The first could be solved with existing technology; the second
could be managed with a crewless mission that could make fuel for
the return journey on the Martian surface before the first
explorers even left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin and his colleague David Baker called this plan ``Mars
Direct'' because the spacecraft involved would be small enough to
be launched to Mars straight from Cape Canaveral. And Zubrin set
out to get it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional'' plans for crewed Mars missions involved huge
spacecraft built in orbit. These, to Zubrin, are the Death Stars _
too big, too slow to develop, and too expensive ever to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Death Stars were NASA's Mars missions of
choice. Now, in large part thanks to Zubrin's efforts, NASA talks
of a much more feasible mission, ``Mars semi-direct,'' but it's
just talk. NASA has no active plans for putting people on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So, having made the case to aerospace engineers that we can get
to Mars, Zubrin wants to convince the rest of the world that we
should. That's where the Mars Society comes in. It's a lobby, a
scientific network, maybe something of a cult. Its members in
Boulder are predominantly male, mostly American and overwhelmingly
white. Some are scientists devoted to Mars, others are aerospace
engineers, artists, priests and many are just believers who have
read Zubrin's book and want to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zubrin is neutral on the question of government on
Mars, there's a fair amount of antigovernment rhetoric during the
convention weekend. Edward Hudgins, a libertarian from the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., gave a paper on a Martian utopia
with no central government. Most of the antigovernment views stem
not from a deeply felt ideological view like Hudgins' but from
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of Mars is not just that it is attainable, it is
that many people think it should already have been attained. The
literature of their youth told them so. And yet since the successes
of Apollo there has been not just stasis in space exploration but
retreat. Feeling let down by government, many would-be Martians
turn to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. One is that no private company
will put up the funds to go to Mars without cheaper, more reliable
space technology and the promise of real profit. The second is that
for quite a few of the convention participants, a lot of this stuff
is simply not fitting. Do you really want to go to Mars as a TV
show? Sponsored by Tang?
</P>
<P>
   In the original Mars underground, in much of science fiction and
in the Mars Society, the idea of Mars having once fostered life has
become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

 &HT;    The gospel according to Grapetree
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it's
hard to say which of the ways he works with Grapetree Records is
the most mysterious:
</P>
<P>
   That there would even be such thing as a Christian gangsta rap
record label. That there would be a Christian gangsta rap label,
and it would gross about $2 million in 1998. That there would be a
Christian gangsta rap label, and its owner and CEO would dress in
cowboy boots, hat and Wranglers, and have a handlebar mustache. Or
that there would be a Christian gangsta rap label, and it would be
based in Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   These are the odd circumstances surrounding Grapetree Records, a
label specializing in CDs by former street thugs who are pushing
Jesus these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were in jail, some of them were shot _ whatever
it was, the Lord touched them deeply,'' explained Knolly Williams,
the 28-year-old president, founder and cowboy wannabe of Grapetree,
which just signed a distribution deal with industry giant EMI
Records that could make it the best-selling label of Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No, seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating a market for this kind of music,'' Williams
said. ``And maybe, just maybe, we're putting Round Rock on the map.
That's the thing in rap these days. You've got Master P from Baton
Rouge, and Too Short from Atlanta. It's cool to be from some place
other than New York or Los Angeles. We could make it so that it's
cool to be from Round Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool or not, the label's offices are out there on Texas 79, on
the easternmost edge of town. Past all the new chain restaurants.
Past the old churches, and the farmer's field where the new
baseball stadium is being built. Up a gravel road. Near a pond. In
a sprawling, two-story ranch house that could have belonged to a
neighbor of J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The home actually belongs to Williams and his wife, Josie, and
the ground floor is where their seven full-time employees work. The
couple bought the house two years ago with the intention of making
it Grapetree Central and, just a few months ago, they purchased
another house that will be a state-of-the-art recording studio.
It's in Round Rock, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually like it out here,'' said Grapetree publicist Vivian
Pascu-Neirth, who commutes from Austin. ``It's quiet and isolated,
which helps us focus on (the label).''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his staff _ whose voice-mail greetings all start
with a music sound-bite and end with ``Thank you, and God bless'' _
are proud to say they run the No. 1 Christian gangsta-rap label in
the country out of their Round Rock offices. They're not too proud,
though, to answer one of two questions that always follow such a
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there really any other Christian gangsta-rap labels?''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, ``Why Round Rock?''
</P>
<P>
   Grapetree actually started at Williams' old home in Austin,
where he moved at age 18 to get away from the evils of his native
Los Angeles. A rapper himself who performs under the name Rubadub,
he was releasing his own cassettes and CDs by age 22 _ recordings
that loudly and proudly featured the Christian beliefs he said
touched him after he almost went to jail. When he started Grapetree
in 1992, Williams really didn't know if there were many other
Jesus-led rappers, but he found out after simultaneously starting a
fanzine called Heaven's Hip-Hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys who were also doing Christian rap started
calling me up,'' Williams said. ``It was clear there were other
people as serious about this music as I was, but they all said,
`Man, if we only had a record label.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 26, Rubadub had a bona fide record company
with more than a dozen artists and plenty of overhead. That's when
he decided to buy a house and combine it with his offices to save
on rent. Round Rock gave him the best real-estate deal, and the
setting fit his self-described ``Texan-ized'' image.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago rapper Prime Minister, one of the 22 performers on the
Grapetree label, remembers his first taste of that image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Man, this guy really must have money, because only
a rich rancher would dress like that,''' he said. ``Eventually, I
realized it was just part of his trademark.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams and almost every performer on the Grapetree
roster, Prime Minister has a story about being fed up with the
gangsta life and turning to the Bible for help. He said he was
jailed for stabbing a rival gang member in the mid-'80s, and
eventually wound up with ties to the Chicago mob. ``I was bad
off,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   As with mainstream rappers, it's hard to establish whether any
Grapetree artists may have fabricated their gangsta backgrounds.
The difference, though, is that with most of these rappers, such a
story wouldn't necessarily help their careers. Until now, those
careers have involved modest to good CD sales, but mostly in
Christian book stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grapetree definitely makes up most of our rap section,'' said
John Parker, music buyer at the Shepherd's Shoppe in North Austin.
``I don't think a lot of our customers know what to make of it,
except for the ones who know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole gangsta thing can really turn a lot of people off,''
said Diamante Music representative Mark Cummings, whose Newport
Beach, Calif.-based company distributes Grapetree's CDs to
Christian stores.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings should be excited about Grapetree's output. Last year,
Grapetree became Diamante's best-selling label out of some 30 other
companies, averaging 10,000 to 25,000 copies per disc. Those sales
figures helped the label earn four of the six rap/hip-hop
nominations in the 1999 Dove Awards, the Grammys of Christian
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grapetree has cornered the Christian rap market,'' Cummings
said. ``There are bigger labels that might dabble in it, but
there's nothing like Grapetree. (Williams) is certainly the only
one who makes sure his product is on par with mainstream rap
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Grapetree fashions itself after the big boys by using a
lot of the same recording equipment and CD artwork, with album
covers that resemble those done by the Master P-favored Pen &AMP; Pixel
Graphics in Houston. And like Master P's No Limit Records, the
rappers on Grapetree come from all over, offering all kinds of
names, including Houston's Lil' Raskull, Denver's Preachas In Tha
Hood and the Miami-based D.C.P. (Demon Cap Peela). There are even
two offshoot labels now, the R&AMP;B-based Phat Boy Records and the
Hispanic-geared GT Latin, both Christian-oriented. Said Williams:
``I believe that our artists and our CDs can compete with any of
the CDs on the market, if given the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The distribution deal with EMI is that chance. EMI Christian
Music Group president Bill Hearn praised Grapetree for
``communicating the gospel to a music buyer that the Christian
music industry has not previously addressed,'' and promised them
distribution across the United States and in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Williams, Grapetree's CDs will be available in ``the
Wal-Marts, the Kmarts, and 4,500 music stores nationwide.'' The
question is, of course, whether anyone will buy them once they're
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are fed up with (mainstream gangsta rap),''
said Prime Minister, who used to be a rapper of that ilk. ``It was
a complete fluke that this music that's about degrading women and
killing people has survived for so long. It's over, done.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who plans to release 30 CDs this year, is banking on
the idea that people are more than just sick of all the curse
words, sexist lyrics and violent overtones in popular gangsta rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want more,'' he said. ``Most of the rap music out
there now is about portraying the problems of the ghettos and
inner-city life. Well, that's easy to do. How about providing the
solutions in addition to the problems?''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. Inner-city solutions from the gospel
according to Round Rock, Texas.

 &HT;    Blessed memories
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excerpted from Jim Minter's book, ``Some Things I Wish We
Wouldn't Forget'':
</P>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Along with the general store and the train
depot, the church was a center of community life in the rural
South. It was either Baptist or Methodist. Except for Baptists
having to be pushed all the way under in somebody's pond while
Methodists could be saved by a sprinkling of well water, nobody
could tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   When the Inman Methodist Church, already in adolescence when the
Civil War began, had a homecoming, J.C. Lovett, one of the
faithful, asked me to write a piece recalling my memories of
growing up in the congregation. I have quite a few.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Harp playing the piano and leading us in ``Bringing in the
Sheaves,'' and how it made me feel good and worthy although I had
no idea what sheaves were. ... The warmth of the potbellied stove,
and how it put Uncle Walter to sleep before the sermon was over.
... The little lapel pins earned for making it throughout the year
without missing Sunday school. Andy McLucas collected 12 in a row,
a record that still stands. ... Dropping my penny into the
collection plate. ... Arthur Burch all dressed up in a new suit and
forgetting to shine his shoes. ... Brother Garrett's sermon on the
valley of the dry bones, preached at least three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon Griffith, who if he had been Catholic might have been
made a saint, and whose name is on the Fellowship Hall. ... Too
many funerals, but always coming away feeling that everything was
going to be all right. ... Willie Mae Tarpley teaching us to sing
``Jesus Loves Me.''... My daddy wishing Brother Conway would come
back and be our preacher again because his wife tapped her heel to
make him stop when his sermons headed into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Fried chicken and egg custard pie when the preacher came to
Sunday dinner. ... Fried chicken, potato salad, tomato sandwiches,
pimento cheese sandwiches, chocolate cake, lemon cheesecake,
caramel cake, fried peach pies and banana pudding at quarterly
meetings, with dinner on the grounds. ... Wondering why the food
was on tables instead of on the ground, if that was what we called
it. ... Watching the ladies lay out their dishes so I'd know where
my favorite cooks put theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Helping my mother fill the communion cups, hoping there would be
some grape juice left over in the Welch's bottle for me to drink.
... How the preachers apologized for Jesus changing the water into
wine. ... Frank Reeves giving the financial report, which he still
does. ... Brother Garrett helping hoe cotton the year it rained all
spring and the grass got ahead of us. ... The annual Christmas
play, and how I envied my cousin John M., who was a few years older
and always got to be Joseph while I had to settle for the third
wise man.
</P>
<P>
   The year Abb Burch and I won the janitorial contract at 50 cents
a week and saved up enough to buy a tent from Sears, Roebuck. ...
Being relieved when the preacher didn't call on me to pray. ... The
owl that took up residence in the belfry and beat me to the draw
when I climbed up under his roost and tried to dispatch him with my
.22 rifle. ... The summer my mother let me skip the last two nights
of revival when a visiting evangelist convinced me the devil was
hot on my case.
</P>
<P>
   Helping my Uncle John Harp collect a washtub of honey when bees
made a hive in the weatherboarding. ... The annual Christmas cedar
tree, and how good it smelled. ... Slipping inside to admire the
new electric lights when the government sent rural electrification,
but didn't quite make it down the road to our house. ... Sundays
when we got to sing out of the Cokesbury Hymnal instead of the big
songbook. ... The 23rd Psalm. ... Being shocked to learn that some
churches had preaching every Sunday and not just once a month as we
did, sharing a pastor with Brooks, Union Chapel and New Hope over
the river in Clayton County.
</P>
<P>
   For going on two centuries the good folks of the Inman Methodist
Church have done the Lord's work about as well as imperfect mortals
can. I believe ``salt of the Earth'' is how you say it.
</P>
<P>
   As the church grows and keeps up with the times, I hope it hangs
on to some of its past.
</P>
<P>
   Methodists, like everyone else, are being asked to accept new
ideas. We had to get rid of our old song books because all the old
hymns were in English. I guess I understand why we need new
languages, although most Methodists around here, including some
from Ohio and New Jersey, speak fairly good English. You can never
tell when a visitor from Hungnam might drop in and be offended.
</P>
<P>
   The old hymns referred to God as he, and that had to be fixed.
We were thankful to get past Easter without having to sing ``Up
From the Grave She Arose.'' Personally, I don't think gender
changes are necessary or accurate. Even my wife agrees God can't
possibly be female because the Bible itself says right there in
Psalm 103, Verse 3, that the Lord is merciful, and slow to anger.

 &HT;    More on making a bookcase
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We'll assume we now have all the pieces cut for our
adjustable shelf bookcase, and we've routed the slots in the
uprights to hold the strips for the shelf supports.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to cut the rabbets for the 1/4-inch plywood
back. You can best do this with a router, on a table if you do it
before assembly, freehand if you do it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute _ you say you don't know what a rabbet is?
Obviously, it is neither a cuddly furry creature nor the call of an
amorous bullfrog. Rabbet is a word coined by people who evidently
had a hard time saying rebate, and is now commonly used in the
trade to indicate the edge of a plank that has been cut back into
an L-shape.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably you've already drawn out a rough picture of your
bookcase, and decided whether you want the top fixed shelf to be
flush with the top of the uprights, or a few inches below the top.
I prefer the latter for two reasons _ it makes for a somewhat more
secure joint in general, but more importantly, it gives you a
perfectly useful shelf. You need to make that decision now, because
you don't want to run the rabbets on the uprights higher than the
top shelf. Since we're putting a toe kick under the bottom shelf,
you can go ahead and rabbet all the way to the bottom; it won't be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   So, select the uprights, mark the outside face on each of them,
and pick your top shelf. Mark the ``up'' side of it clearly.
</P>
<P>
   If you're putting the top shelf below the top of the uprights,
mark the spot where the shelf will go on each upright. I would
probably go ahead and cut the rabbets _ 1/4-inch wide and 1/4-inch
deep _ before joining the top and bottom shelves.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no good reason not to wait until the case is
assembled and the glue is dry, and then run the rabbets around the
inside of the back using the router fence.
</P>
<P>
   That choice out of the way _ now or later _ it's a good time to
attach the solid oak trim. One hopes that you carefully selected
this wood for straightness and for thickness as close as possible
to the 3/4-inch thickness of the plywood. A hair thicker is okay;
thinner is a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   You need two pieces as long as the uprights, and one piece for
each of the shelves. An inch to 3/4-inch is sufficient width.
</P>
<P>
   Take the plank and joint one edge with a jointer/planer. If you
don't have one of these, and you don't have a jointer, you can set
up your router with a straight bit and a dependable metal
straightedge to get the edge straight. Using this nice square and
flat edge against the tablesaw fence, cut the first strip. If the
cut was good, you won't need to joint again before you cut the
second. Keep on cutting until you've got enough strips to do the
job, then cut them to length.
</P>
<P>
   The upright edges really need to be the same thickness as the
uprights themselves; otherwise things are going to get caught on
the protruding edge. If the edging is too thick, plane it or
carefully rip it to size. Very slightly oversize edging is OK on
the shelves as long as you make sure the overhang is at the bottom,
and not the upper surface, of the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Using plenty of clamps, glue the edging to the front edge of all
the plywood pieces. Don't forget to use pads under the clamp jaws,
and wipe up glue squeeze-out with a damp cloth. Once the glue is
dry _ give it at least 16 hours _ soften all the edges to taste,
either a little bit with a block plane or a lot with a round-over
bit in the router.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PUEBLO, Mexico _ Among the many books in the governor's mansion
in this state east of Mexico City, Manuel Bartlett Diaz kept a copy
of ``The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an amusing choice of reading for a man struggling to
overcome an image as one of Mexico's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett -- who wants to be Mexico's next president -- has a
reputation for being one of the country's crustiest ``dinosaurs,''
the nickname for the authoritarian faction that used to control the
Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which celebrated its 70th year in power this month,
has dominated the Mexican presidency and nearly every other aspect
of political life here since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   However, the PRI has been losing ground in recent years, and in
July 2000 could face Mexico's most competitive presidential
election yet. Hoping to energize its grassroots supporters, it has
decided to establish a more democratic internal process to select
its nominee for the election. Ironically, Bartlett -- considered by
many to be the consummate anti-democrat -- is benefiting most from
more party democracy and emerging as a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where rumors substitute for solid information,
Bartlett is haunted by unproved allegations that he masterminded
electoral fraud for the PRI a decade ago and has consorted with
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the favorite of President Ernesto Zedillo, a PRI
reformist and one of the 'technocrats' or free-market proponents
now dominating the party. But Bartlett is a shrewd politician who
is popular in Puebla, the state he governed for six years until
last month, and surveys show he is a top choice among the party's
rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   That support is significant because later this year, for the
first time in the PRI's history, the rank-and-file will be allowed
a voice in selecting the party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a candidate for the presidency of the republic in a
totally new process,'' said Bartlett, beaming with confidence in a
recent interview with Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the PRI's candidate has always been hand-picked by
the sitting president of the republic in secret machinations known
as the ``dedazo,'' the ``big finger.'' But this May the party is
expected to devise a new system for holding primaries to select a
candidate either by direct votes or through delegates at a national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect is delicious to Bartlett, who exudes the enthusiasm
of a born-again democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six decades the decision as to who would be the
presidential candidate was made behind-the-scenes by people on
high,'' Bartlett said. ``This process was useful and worked for
many years. But now it doesn't work because the country has changed
and we have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, following a speech by Zedillo endorsing the concept
of rank-and-file voting, Bartlett wasted no time in kicking his
campaign into gear.
</P>
<P>
   He made political history here by becoming the first PRI hopeful
to start airing television commercials explicitly depicting himself
as the best choice for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He is challenging potential rivals serving in the federal
government to give up their jobs and declare themselves candidates,
too, so the fight can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett has set up campaign headquarters in Mexico City and
other cities, and is making rounds to shore up his support among
PRI-affiliated labor unions and other party associations.
</P>
<P>
   At a speech last month before the Revolutionary Confederation of
Workers and Farmers, a PRI-controlled union, Bartlett gave the
crowd what it wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bases resent the loss of vigor in our party, resent its
separation from popular concerns,'' he said to cheers and
backslapping. ``They demand that the party be rescued.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bartlett tried to drum up support at a Mexico City
university recently students mocked him with signs calling him
``Manuel Barney,'' a play on the stuffed purple dinosaur toy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts too find Bartlett's embrace of democracy surprising,
given his strong-man image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thought he'd get the 'dedazo,' he'd never be in favor of
democracy now,'' said Luis Miguel Rionda, a political scientist at
Mexico's University of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Licona Ygaldi, director of Market Research, a polling
firm in Mexico City, said that Bartlett's chances at the nomination
are very good if hard-core PRI activists are allowed to vote
without interference by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militants want Bartlett because he would protect them.
He's a true PRIista(CQ). He's totally different than the
technocrats,'' said Licona. ``His message is he's strong, firm,
capable of governing. And he's confronted the president by
criticizing his neo-liberal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He also inspires fear,'' Licona added. ``Some people think,
'He'll get rid of crime, but he might get rid of me, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Free-market changes pushed by Zedillo and other technocrats --
including the sale of state-owned industries and reduced tariffs on
imports -- have left some PRI members disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   Many blame the policies for deepening poverty and driving people
away from the PRI, which no longer controls the Congress nor all
state governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's populist rhetoric is aimed at the disaffected, who
long to revive a paternalistic system that exchanges votes for the
PRI with special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Mexico has to make social needs a top
priority,'' said Bartlett. ``We can't maintain social peace in the
country if we don't make sure the country is employed and that
poverty doesn't get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett believes the PRI must attend to the poor, and he isn't
shy about claiming personal responsibility for providing basic
services like water and sewage systems to his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   He has softened his opposition to free trade, noting that during
his term as governor Puebla's giant Volkswagen plant expanded,
producing more automobiles for export and attracting more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that we don't think globalization has its
serious problems, not just for Mexico but for the world,'' Bartlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who inherited his last name from an English
grandfather, has a long history in public life in Mexico. Even
those who would never vote for him regard him as intelligent,
quick-witted and an able administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The fit 61-year-old bears a striking resemblance to CNN's
popular talk show host Larry King. He's held several powerful jobs,
including secretary of public education and secretary of the
interior.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the latter post that Bartlett, in charge of the
nation's elections, was widely denounced as the mastermind of
alleged fraud during the 1988 presidential race -- which put the
PRI's Carlos Salinas de Gortari into office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That claim is absurd,'' Bartlett said, arguing that several
investigations have absolved him.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett is equally upset by persistent allegations that have
cast him in an evil light in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An informant told United States authorities that Bartlett was
present at a torture session of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was murdered in Mexico in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Camarena case is another false statement that's used to
attack me politically,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was forced to hire a law firm in the United States to
represent him and has provided evidence showing that the
informant's story was fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities requested that Bartlett testify before a grand
jury in the United States, but he declined to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not submit to any grand jury or any justice system of
another country,'' he said, ``because I have not been (formally)
accused of anything. I am the victim, and it's the responsibility
of the United States government to clarify this. I've done my
part.''

FIGHTING THE WRONG CULTURE WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trust a crowd, says author Kurt Vonnegut, to look at the wrong
end of a miracle every time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, trust a crowd to fight the wrong wars. Almost
everywhere I look I find people worrying about what both the
political left and right call the culture wars, which are being
fought over abortion, homosexuality, public morality, church-state
separation, coarsened entertainment, multiculturalism, pornography,
divorce, profanity, euthanasia, cohabitation and on and on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Pat Buchanan announced his candidacy for president
recently, he was direct about his desire to lead the charge against
``all that pollutes our culture.'' To Buchanan, ``ultimately, our
culture war is about one question: Is God dead or is God king?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His very wording puts him at odds with people who might, on one
level, agree with his faith-based assessment but who no longer are
willing to use exclusively masculine words to refer to the deity
because they find it doesn't reflect the full scriptural witness
and doing so is at least subtly hostile to more than half the
population. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, as I say, despite the terrific heat these culture wars
generate over such matters, they are, in the end, the wrong fight.
I'm not saying they are unimportant. Or that there's nothing to
fight about. Many of the issues I've listed (and others) deserve
our best thinking and debating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they are secondary to the real and serious damage being done
to our culture by the increasingly widespread fiction that all of
us are, at base, economic creatures whose highest and best role is
that of consumer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This deception turns all segments of the media into little more
than magnets to attract an audience to which advertisers may pitch
their wares. It is, in fact, easy to make a case that many segments
of the media rarely rise above that role. Television is the most
obvious culprit, but the Internet _ with its misinformation,
pornography and mere silliness packaged as vehicles for commercial
messages _ is often an equally ignoble enterprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people fighting these peripheral culture wars are,
at the same time, pledging allegiance to the very economic system
whose abuse leads to this culture of consumerism. That is, they
defend capitalism almost without qualification. And even though
it's true that an open market is, at least in its ideal, the least
oppressive economic system yet devised, it is imperfect everywhere
it's used and it seems to seduce some of its proponents into
imagining that it's divinely ordained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that what our consumerist culture does, in the end,
is ignore the reality that we are both material and spiritual
beings who have higher callings than owning the latest sports car
or fastest modem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we are created not for consumption but for relationship.
And the failure to understand that leads to an inability to grasp
that there are rules about relationships that must be observed. If
those rules are flouted _ as they clearly were in the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair (between two people with dark vacuums where
their moral centers should be) _ people are damaged, diminished,
even destroyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can be persuaded that, reworded, Buchanan's culture wars
question _ Is God dead or is God sovereign? _ is the right one
because, properly understood, it can point us toward the culture
battle that should engage us. Which is the one about whether we are
created first for relationship _ both horizontal (with other
people) and vertical (with God) _ or for consumption. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the battle cry heard on Buchanan's side of the other culture
wars too often leads people to imagine that they know precisely
where God stands on all issues. Armed with the arrogance of that
false certainty, helmets on, pitchforks in hand, they have ridden
off to slay the wrong dragons and, thus, are unavailable to fight
the more sinister and insidious one. &QL;

now retired orthopedic surgeon, committed malpractice when he
declined to perform shoulder-replacement surgery nearly two years
ago. By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ.

   AIRLINE-SCOLDS (San Francisco) _ Perhaps you've heard of
commercial aviation's new no-guff policy. After too many cases of

overhead bins, the airlines are getting tough. Exactly how tough

workout in ``The Corruptor,'' a convoluted shoot-'em-up in which
everyone fires piles of weapons but only the bad guys die. On the

standard filmmaking, slick, gimmicky and powered by numbing action.

   TV-REVIEW-CLEOPATRA (Undated) _ The Discovery Channel doesn't

shout. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>

   FILM-REVIEW-WING (Undated) _ While it may be true that in space

<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-OCEAN (Undated) _ Adapted from Jacquelyn Mitchard's
novel about the miraculous reappearance of a boy who wandered away

the Ocean'' is a vexing simplification of an extremely ornate
ethical and moral situation. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-LOCK (Undated) _ I doubt that next March, the
creators of ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' will be
standing on the podium at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Flawed but
scrappy, confusing yet exhilarating, the Brit-made film is far from
a perfect movie. And it's not for anyone squeamish about violence.
By JANE GANAHL.
</P>
<P>
   CINERAMA (Dayton, Ohio) _ At first glance, and second, New Neon
Movies would hardly seem to be the site for the first screenings of
Cinerama in the United States in more than 30 years. Yet, yet here

projector, curved screen and stereophonic glory. By MARK SOMMER.

   BKC-ARKANSAS-COACH (Denver) _ A federal court ruling nullifying
NCAA rules that require a minimum score on the SAT for incoming

voice taking on an evangelical flavor. ``I'm walking around on
Cloud Nine, and I haven't played a game yet.'' By STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Half the crowd across from SS
Peter and Paul's Church were reporters or cameramen interviewing
the other half of the crowd. Yet for one day we were living in the
1940s, not the culture of celebrity, and even those with press
cards joined in applause with DiMaggio's friends as the hearse
drove away from North Beach. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The case of Jermaine Henderson, a
college basketball star who was arrested at a pub and ended up at
the police station more banged up than when he left the bar, has
been a classic study in incompetence, venality, petty political
bickering and sheer, unadulterated stupidity. It's time for
somebody to do something sensible. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-NAZIS (San Francisco) _ Couch potatoes kind of like it
when a fitness advocate comes to an untimely end _ it gives them an
argument to use against those who preach at them to start jogging
and renounce hamburgers, smoking and beer. They aren't totally
wrong. These days, almost everyone knows of an athlete who never
smoked, ate a vegetarian diet, spent hours biking or running,
looked great and now is dying of cancer. By EVE PELL.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paul Edwards, a retired Marine and business
executive, has time these days to peruse things such as the fine
print on his monthly cable bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's not pleasant reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas, resident estimates that over the last two
years his cable rates have soared 21 percent and his channel-box
rental has increased 16 percent. What's more, he pays local fees
and franchise charges _ plus 8.25 percent sales tax on top of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gets my blood pressure up,'' says Edwards, who
complains every year to his cable provider, Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his bill is $49.52 a month. And he doesn't see it going
down.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of cable customers nationwide, Edwards feels the
pinch of telecommunications deregulation without the promised
benefits. Washington lawmakers and regulators had assumed cable
companies would face competition in local markets by now, naturally
forcing rates downward. But that hasn't happened. Instead, prices
have soared.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal government oversight of nearly all cable
pricing will expire March 31. That means cable companies will be
free to hike prices for the most popular level of service without
fear of government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Federal Communications Commission has the power to
investigate consumer complaints and order cable companies to rebate
what it considers outrageous charges on the most popular services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of the business of cable-rate regulation at the end
of the month,'' says Morgan Broman, the FCC's Cable Services Bureau
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for Edwards' plea to control price hikes,
according to Consumers Union, a national advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Since passage of the Telecommunications Act in 1996, overall
cable rates have risen about 21 percent, or nearly four times the
rate of inflation, according to the group's February study. Average
rates on expanded basic service, the most popular category, have
gone from $23.07 a month in 1995 to $27.43 a month in 1998,
according to Paul Kagan Associates Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under the March 31 change, basic service will continue to be
policed by local governments. Expanded basic service _ which
usually includes news, sports and entertainment channels-- will
unregulated. Premium service, such as pay-for-view shows, has never
been regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years are a good indication of what we're going
to see,'' says Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumer Union's
Washington office. ``The only way to hold prices down is to slap a
lid on them.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, advocates don't expect sudden price spikes.
Instead they anticipate cable operators will continue to raise
expanded and premium plans by as much as 5 percent a year. Basic
rates likely will remain stagnant at between $8 and $12 per month
because they remain regulated.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FCC has policed basic and expanded rates by
investigating consumer complaints. Since 1993, for example, the FCC
has looked into thousands of complaints nationwide, and has ordered
rebates of as much as $100 million to consumers .
</P>
<P>
   Consumers would have paid between $3 billion and $5 billion more
in cable fees since 1992, if the federal government had not had
watchdog authority, according to some telecom analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Cable industry executives say they are forced to charge
consumers higher prices because they are offering more services and
channels. In addition, industry leaders such as Time Warner, Media
One and Cox Communications are investing billions of dollars in
two-way interactive cable networks to provide high-speed Internet
access and interactive digital television.
</P>
<P>
   In this advanced data services market, cable operators are
competing head-to-head with other telecom giants such as AT&AMP;T,
which bought Tele-Communications Inc. for its cable lines and its
interest in the (at)Home Network.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, for example, Time Warner has spent $50 million in the
last five years to upgrade its two-way interactive network. Later
this year, the company will roll out its Road Runner Internet and
digital television service.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carey, president of Time Warner's Austin, Texas, division,
says his company doesn't plan to jack up unregulated prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to appear irresponsible, or we will invite
unwanted regulation,'' Carey says. ``And we especially don't want
to irritate customers, or we will lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable lobbyists stress that their industry is much more
competitive today than five years ago. So consumers have choices if
they are not satisfied with their cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable companies know that if they don't deliver a strong
value, customers will sign on with one of their competitors,'' says
Scott Broyles, spokesman for the National Cable Television
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 13 million customers nationwide now have satellite
television service, for example. In 1998, though, two of every
three new subscribers chose satellite service, he says.
</P>
<P>
   An FCC analysis, however, shows that most cable markets
nationwide remain monopolies. What's more, in roughly 200 small
communities nationwide with competition, prices are roughly 10
percent lower than in other markets with no competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are urging the cable companies to act responsibly,'' says
Deborah Lathen, chief of the FCC's Cable Services Bureau. ``But we
can not regulate the industry further unless Congress gives us the
authority to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely to happen. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have
been reluctant to jump back into the regulation of telecom sectors
that they are turning over to free markets. Instead, Sen. John
McCain (R-Az.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, intends
to unveil legislation this year aimed at easing burdens on cable
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to move to re-regulation unless we absolutely
have to,'' says Lauren Belvin, the committee's majority senior
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But for residents such as Bill Long, another Austin, Texas,
resident, that strategy is not likely to impact his cable bill.
</P>
<P>
   Long, a self-employed Internet consultant, has considered
cutting cable service. But his wife, Josie, uses educational
programming to school the couple's three teenagers at home. So the
Longs pay about $40 a month for cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at cutting our household expenses, this comes
up,'' Long says. ``It's frustrating. This is one bill that won't go
down.''

   LONDON _ A prime candidate has surfaced in the six-month search

with the company to assume the position, according to the The
Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The London office of Reed Elsevier declined to respond to
questions about the search for a chief executive, and said in a
statement only that the search was ``at an advanced stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the position was fueled by the company's
report Wednesday that net profits fell 5 percent last year to $918
million dollars, along with a warning that a flat performance can
be expected this year. The results are consistent with a forecast
published in December.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have not regarded the absence of a new chief executive
as fundamentally harming the media giant's performance to date, but
concern is expected to increase if the position isn't filled within
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The search has taken longer than expected because of the
difficulties of defining the job for the first time, the newspaper
said. The search began last August when the company decided to
discard its two-headed chief executive structure in favor of a
single CEO. Neither of the two chairmen, Herman Bruggink of
Dutch-based Elsevier or Nigel Stapleton of the British-based Reed
are candidates for the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview with journalists, Stapleton said he
recognized that there has been some ``disappointment'' in the
market that no announcement has been made today on the appointment
of a new chief executive for Reed Elsevier.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton said the search process is now ``extremely focused''
but declined to say if a final short list has been drawn up or when
an announcement can be expected. ``We have a perfectly tenable
interim structure working very effectively,'' he said. ``We are not
in a situation faced by other companies where we've been left in a
void when a chief executive leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From a Reed Elsevier perspective we haven't raised any
expectations that there will be an announcement of a new CEO at
this stage,'' he said. ``The whole process is at an advanced stage
and we are expecting good results from the chief executive
search.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement issued with the profits report, the
co-chairmen said the conditions causing reduced profits are likely
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our development program and the unfavorable economic situation
on some markets, does not suggest that profits will grow
significantly in 1999,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed-Elsevier is one of the biggest publishing groups in the
world, employing 27,000 people. Its main markets are in Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have cited four key factors bearing on the company's
performance:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Competition in the legal division intensified in the second
half of the year, especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Advertising markets in Britain deteriorated in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reed Elsevier invested heavily in electronic products,
particularly those on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Profits also were hurt by the acquisition of Matthew Bender to
complement Lexis Nexis, an investment not expected to generate much
in the way of short term sales.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the trade publication Extel Examiner,
Bruggink said he expects a tough battle in 1999 between Lexis-Nexis
and Thomson Corp.'s Westlaw in the U.S. online legal publishing
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be equally strong pressure (in the U.S. legal
market) in 1999 as in 1998,'' he said. ``Competition will be
fierce.''

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Drivers caught in a snarl of freeway traffic leading into Dallas
looked up last week at that tall skyline and saw a huge new black
billboard with a few stark words in white:
 &HT;    ``Keep Using My Name In Vain, I'll Make Rush Hour Longer. GOD''
 &HT;    Those driving in from different directions saw other billboards
with equally arresting messages from the Creator:
 &HT;    ``Don't Make Me Come Down There. GOD''
 &HT;    ``What Part of `Thou Shalt Not...' Didn't You Understand? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Will the Road You Are on Get You to My Place? GOD''
 &HT;    The God Ad Campaign is being donated by local billboard
companies as a public service. There will soon be 10,000 billboards
like these all across America as billboard firms donate the space.
 &HT;    ''It is a gift to the community,'' says Nancy Fletcher,
president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. ''It
is a positive way to get people thinking about spirituality, and
increasing the numbers who are going to church. It makes you
believe in divine intervention!''
 &HT;    The campaign began in Broward County, Florida, in and around
Fort Lauderdale last fall. It was football season, of course. So
two of the first billboards to go up tartly said:
 &HT;    ``Let's Meet at My House Sunday Before the Game. GOD''
 &HT;    ``C'mon Over and Bring the Kids. GOD''
 &HT;    The ads were developed by The Smith Agency after an anonymous
client came in one day and told owner Andy Smith, ''I have one
goal. I need to have people start thinking about God. Things are
getting out of control. People are not obeying the rules any more.
Every day you read about murder, robbery, adultery everything that
God said, `Don't do.'
 &HT;    ''If we can get to one person before he robs a bank, to think
about God first, maybe we can stop him. If so, it will be worth
it.''
 &HT;    I tried to find out who the anonymous benefactor was even to
learn whether he was a pastor or businessman, but could learn
nothing. Oprah Winfrey offered to put the guy on her show, but he
declined: ''If people focus on me or the money I spent, they will
forget the message of the ads. Forget about me. I am looking for
nothing. The message is much more important than who I am.''
 &HT;    So let's go back to the message. This summer you may be driving
along some hot day and look up to see these billboard that ought to
get your attention:
 &HT;    ``You Think It's Hot Here? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Need a Marriage Counselor? I'm Available. GOD''
 &HT;    Some of the messages were written by the anonymous donor. They
are more gentle:
 &HT;    ``I Love You...I Love You...I Love You. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Tell the Kids That I Love Them. GOD''
 &HT;    But most were written by Charlie Robb, who describes himself as
''being in the target audience of people who used to go to church,
but who don't any more.''
 &HT;    ``I'm a former altar boy,'' he told me. To reach such people,
Scripture would not work, he says. ''We had to make the message
contemporary, slightly irreverent, reminding people that they are
dealing with the ultimate CEO.''
 &HT;    ``Need Directions? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Do You Have Any Idea Where You're Going? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Follow Me. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Have You Read My Number 1 Bestseller? There Will Be a Test. --
GOD''
 &HT;    How has the God Ad Campaign worked? The Miami Herald surveyed
churches in he area and reported that attendance rates were up.
Even Charlie has been to church a few times. A woman in Fort
Lauderdale sent an E-mail to the Smith Agency, thanking it for the
ads which are ''such a breath of fresh air.'' She said her niece
was married to a man who would never go to church with her. While
driving along, they both saw this ad:
 &HT;    ``I Loved the Wedding. Invite Me To The Marriage. GOD''
 &HT;    The man went to church with his wife for the first time the next
Sunday, and has been going ever since.
 &HT;    ``We Need To Talk. GOD''

'BIRTH SISTERS' MAY HELP WOMEN DELIVER WITH LESS PAIN

 c.1999 Medical Tribune News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Shirley'' was 16, she delivered her son after a long,
savagely painful labor, concluding in a caesarean section. Haunted
by memories of a labor punctuated by an arsenal of surgical
devices, Shirley's anxiety manifested itself as post-traumatic
stress disorder. Thirteen years later Shirley is working as an
office manager for a Boston computer company and married. She is
also _ to her horror and delight _ pregnant with her second child.
But this time Shirley wants to feel in control of her own labor.
</P>
<P>
   Expectant mothers like Shirley are candidates for a program at
Boston Medical Center that recognizes that women who do not feel in
control of their labor are more prone to anxiety and a high level
of pain, and are also more likely to require intervention such as
forceps and C-section.
</P>
<P>
   More radically, perhaps, the program also recognizes that a
woman's husband or partner is not always the best source of support
during labor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The program involves pairing an expectant mother with a ``birth
sister,'' a woman who provides advice and support during labor and
in the first few months after delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Birth sisters are more commonly known as doulas, a Greek word
sometimes translated as ``servant'' or ``slave.'' It's a name the
center prefers not to use.
</P>
<P>
   The program was started last fall thanks in part to a grant from
the March of Dimes, the voluntary health agency aimed at improving
the health of babies, which is based in White Plains, N.Y. So far,
the program has recruited 57 women to become birth sisters after
completing a 50-hour training course covering the basics in labor,
delivery, relaxation techniques and breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Walker is a nurse-midwife at the center whose job
includes referring women to the program. Birth sisters, she says,
are a godsend in an era when the realities of healthcare mean that
midwives can no longer provide ongoing care to women in labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman in labor is very anxious, her uterus stops
contracting and the birth becomes more painful. Having someone
there to assure her she is doing well and the pain will subside has
been shown to reduce the odds of C-section and forceps delivery as
well as decrease the need for oxytocin [a drug given to make the
uterus contract more forcefully] and epidural [anesthesia to block
pain],'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a less stressful, less painful birth experience is not
only advantageous to the new mother, according to Walker, it also
provides lasting benefits to the infant.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mothers are more likely to bond with their babies and
have less problems breast-feeding. Breast-fed babies receive
protection against anything from diarrhea to middle-ear
infections,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is not opposed to a woman's husband or partner being in
the delivery room but believes that a birth sister can provide
unique assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about providing empathetic support. Traditionally women
have always supported women during labor and delivery. There comes
a time during the procedure when the father takes a step back, and
this is usually when the birth sister jumps in and plays a primary
role in taking care of the mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hopes that HMOs will recognize the financial benefits of
birth sisters and cover their costs. The Boston Medical Center's
program costs about $400 per pregnancy and covers two pre-labor
consultations and about eight hours of post-partum care.
</P>
<P>
   Studies reinforce Walker's assertion that women whose labors are
assisted by a doula, or birth sister, are likely to have better
birth experiences. This is especially the case with younger,
socially disadvantaged women, where a number of studies have
demonstrated a significant drop in the incidence of C-section,
forceps delivery and use of oxytocin, painkillers and anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDITORS: THE STORY MAY END HERE, OR YOU MAY INCLUDE THE
FOLLOWING OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Older, better-educated women also reap the rewards of having
doula-assisted labors, but the differences may not be so striking.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in the current issue of Obstetrics &AMP;
Gynecology, the effects of hospital-based doulas were evaluated
among 478 pregnant patients in a private hospital. The mean age of
the mothers was 29 and more than half were college graduates.
Approximately one-half of the women were assigned to a
doula-assisted program and the remainder received standard care
with their labor and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Lead researcher Nancy P. Gordon from the Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center in Oakland, Calif., and colleagues found that 54
percent of the mothers who had had doula-assisted labors had
received an epidural. Among women who did not have a doula, the
rate was 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers asked the new mothers how they rated their
birth experience, 82 percent of those with doula-assisted labors
said it was good, compared with 67 percent with non-doula-assisted
labors. No significant differences were found between the two
groups' incidence of C-section, forceps delivery, use of oxytocin,
breast-feeding and post-partum depression.
</P>
<P>
   But less notable advantages should not mean that doulas should
be reserved for socially disadvantaged women, according to Dr. Alan
S. Cadesky, a family physician at the department of family medicine
at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Cadesky is an advocate of doulas, as well as being the husband
of one. His youngest child was born with the two older siblings
present together with a doula who supported them during their
mother's labor.
</P>
<P>
   Cadesky said he recommends doulas in all cases. ``There are no
side-effects with having doulas present,'' he said, adding that
they bring ``a positive energy'' to the delivery room, which
facilitates labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doulas are not there to supplant the role of anyone else or to
lobby for medication. They are there to support the couple and that
can only be a good thing,'' he said.

&HT;        HOMEGROWN INVENTION GETS SMITHSONIAN SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 11 -- Plants may no longer have to pay the
ultimate price for their owners' vacations.
</P>
<P>
   A group of five Drexel University engineering students have
invented an automatic watering system designed to keep house plants
alive while their owners are away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible feeling to come back from vacation to find a
house full of dead plants,'' said Paula Bielski, 22, of Delaware
County. ``This invention is good for vacationers or people who are
just busy.''
</P>
<P>
   At a one-day exhibit yesterday at the Smithsonian American
History Museum's Lemelson Center, student inventors from around the
country showed off their work.
</P>
<P>
   Bielski and her colleagues, Duc Nguyen, Phillip Nguyen, Vadim
Pavolotsky and Ilya Rakhman, worked for six months to design and
build the system.
</P>
<P>
   Their invention senses the soil moisture levels in each plant
and decides when to add water. It can water up to five plants for
two weeks. The device has a six-and-a-half gallon refillable tank
and can be used in any home or office.
</P>
<P>
   Systems now on the market are mostly geared toward greenhouses,
not homes, Bielski said. Also, the systems currently available give
the same amount of water to all plants, even though different
plants have different moisture needs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The students want to market their product in the future. It cost
$500 for the students to make the system, but they hope to get the
price down, so customers would only have to pay $200, Bielski said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit was part of the National Collegiate Inventors and
Innovators Alliance's third annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Other Pennsylvania student inventions included a machine that
simulated wear and tear on ankle joint replacement parts and an
electronic measuring and transmitting device for monitoring
hospital patients' vital signs, both from the University of
Pittsburgh.

DID ANDOVER VIOLATE FEDERAL DISABILITIES ACT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American education is on trial today, more than ever before. But
not just public school education is under assault. Consider this
lawsuit now pending against Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, 18-year-old Nicholas Panagopoulos of Sudbury,
Mass., enrolled in the exclusive private school in 1995. He is now
midway through his senior year _ or would be, if the Phillips
faculty did not vote, 168-2, to expel him last December.
</P>
<P>
   This young man was not ousted for disciplinary issues.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained a cumulative C average, although he did fail four
classes in his first three years. His problem does not seem to be a
lack of intelligence. Nicholas scored 770 on his English SAT exam
and 640 on the mathematics portion of the test. He also received a
1999 National Merit Scholarship commendation as a finalist in that
competition.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Marc Redlich, contends that Nicholas was expelled
for a simple reason: He has attention deficit disorder, also known
as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Seaver, the lawyer who represents Phillips, says the
school's position is equally simple: ``This student did not
successfully perform his work, did not put in the amount of effort
the school expected, in compliance with school policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Redlich argues that the fancy private school _ or
``independent,'' as such institutions prefer to be called _
collected more than $90,000 in tuition, then failed to adequately
accommodate this student's special learning needs.
</P>
<P>
   All that, contends Redlich, violates the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on account of
disabilities. The law also requires ``reasonable accommodation'' of
handicapped students by educational institutions, public and
private. The school argues that Nicholas was provided with, or at
least offered, ``numerous accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, US District Judge Edward F. Harrington ordered the
school to readmit Nicholas, pending resolution of the matter on the
merits. A trial is scheduled to begin Monday in federal district
court.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver, the school's lawyer, says it is ``incredibly important''
for an institution like Phillips to maintain its academic
standards. And with teachers ``already quite busy'' and under a lot
of pressure regarding grades and college recommendations, the
school doesn't want or need the burden of justifying decisions such
as this student's expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Redlich, representing the plaintiff, says that this is all about
arrogance _ ``the arrogance of a school to collect over $90,000
from a family and then throw him out before his last semester,
knowing he has a disability, knowing this would ruin his chances
for getting into a good college.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? It likely lies somewhere beyond the bare legal
pleadings in this case, and it is tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Phillips faculty sincerely believes Nicholas
Panagopoulos and their hallowed institution are not a good fit and
both are better off without each other. Schools like this are not
remedial in any sense of their mission.
</P>
<P>
   But, if a school, public or private, knows about an ADD
diagnosis, under federal law, it is responsible for communicating
that knowledge and providing _ not remediation _ but some
``accommodation.'' That is where the legal test will lie: Did
Phillips do enough to accommodate, or did the school just want to
be rid of a problem student?
</P>
<P>
   Given the level of anger directed at public schools for their
highly publicized failures, it is worth noting exactly how private
schools like Phillips maintain their highly publicized success.
</P>
<P>
   First, these top independents accept only the brightest _ and
for the most part, only the brightest who can afford their
tuitions. Once they have assembled this elite student corps, it is
basically sink or swim. There's some tutoring and hand-holding, but
there is little incentive to accommodate special needs _ especially
the kind that will ultimately drag down a school's track record for
placing its students in top-ranked colleges.
</P>
<P>
   And, that is the underlying name of the private school game _
encouraging parents to pay huge tuition bills in the expectation it
will land their little genius in Harvard or Yale. Students like
Nicholas Panagopoulos are an obstacle to the college placement game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wealthy and well-endowed private school like Phillips is no
more entitled to shirk its statutory responsibility to disabled
students like Nicholas than local public schools are,'' writes
Nicholas's lawyer, in his complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips will beg loudly to differ.
</P>

BACK TO THE CULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has been just over a decade since the Blue Oyster
Cult _ the original thinking person's heavy metal band _ has
released an album of new material or played on a Boston area stage.
Has the band been hibernating?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, says singer-guitarist-songwriter Eric Bloom, who
shares the Cult spotlight with Don ``Buck Dharma'' Roeser. They've
been on the road _ playing state fairs, biker fests, and clubs _
and they just got back, Bloom says, from a three-week
midwest-northwest tour played to soldout clubs. Their abscence in
Boston, Bloom says, has had to do with no appropriate place to play
since the Channel shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Oyster Cult rectifies that situation next Thursday when
they play the Middle East Downstairs. And they finally have an
album out, ``Heaven Forbid,'' which Bloom says, ``has done well in
Europe.'' What it signifies, he adds, is ``that we're not just an
oldies band. On top of that, it's a really good record.'' On the
album, they collaborate with cyber-horror writer John Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of Bloom's fond memories of the tour: ``We're playing
a show in California and I go out to leave after the show and
there's a couple of guys there, 17, 18-years-old with green and
orange hair _ and that's not your typical Blue Oyster Cult fan.
They go, `Hey, man, Blue Oyster Cult, you're so cool. We're so
proud of ourselves. We got thrown out for moshing.' And I said, `We
need more guys with green and oragne hair at our shows who are
thrilled to meet us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Point being, in this day and age, rock 'n' roll tends to be
age-specific. And the guys in Blue Oyster Cult _ keyboardist Allen
Lanier is the remaining co-founder, bassist Danny Miranda and
drummer Bobby Rondinelli the new guys _ tend to attract fans in
their own post-40s age group. Which is fine. But if, say, Metallica
fans are paying attention, they may want to come to the gig, too.
Metallica released the covers-only double-CD ``Garage, Inc.'' last
year, a tribute to their influences, and did a faithful version of
BOC's ``Astronony.'' Mike Watt, ex-of the Minutemen and fIREHOSE,
now on his own, has long covered BOC's ``The Red and the Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades ago, Blue Oyster Cult formed in Long Island
as Soft White Underbelly, an unlikely hybrid formed by five members
of frat and garage rock bands. During the early-mid 1970s, they
made their bones: With irony and wit, with moody guitar phrases and
blistering metal attacks, with turn-on-a-dime tempo changes, they
took heavy metal into another realm. They wrote melodic rockers,
about bikers (``Transmaniacon MC''), warfare (``ME 262''),
fetishism (``She's As Beautiful As A Foot'') about dominance and
submission (uh, ``Dominance &AMP; Submission'') and the star-making
machinery (``Stairway to the Stars'').
</P>
<P>
   Overdue commercial success came calling in 1976 with the
Byrds-like ``(Don't Fear) The Reaper.'' Then, BOC scored with FM
radio favorites such as ``Godzilla,'' ``Burnin' For You'' and
``Joan Crawford.'' Bloom and Roeser had contrasting writing styles.
``I like crunchy heavier stuff,'' says Bloom, ``and Buck writes
more melodic stuff. What you get is an interesting chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   In their heyday _ 1976 to 1981 _ they played arenas and carried
around three semi-trucks worth of equipment and a 27-member crew.
They played with KISS and Aerosmith; they co-headlined a ``Black
and Blue'' tour with Black Sabbath. ``We were incredibly lucky,''
says Bloom. ``It seemed like a normal progression at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their star began to wane in the mid-1989s. ``Well, eventually,
gravity set it,'' says Bloom. A case could be made that when
writer-drummer Albert Bouchard left/was sacked (1981) and his
brother bassist Joe left (1985) the songwriting took a step back.
Bloom doesn't care for that notion.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Blue Oyster Cult lives, and this is a good thing.
They can draw from a catalog of songs that can produce an A-level
set. On Thursday, they'll play a couple from the new album and the
cream of the rest of the crop. It's pretty heavy cream.

WING COMMANDER

Ginny Holder, Jurgen Prochnow, Tchecky Karyoall 
At: Copley Place, suburbs

   Video games should not be made into feature-length films.
</P>
<P>
   Video games aren't about watching, they're about doing. Gamers,
you see, derive their pleasure from having their finger on the
trigger and picking off the baddies themselves. The joy is in the
joystick. But Hollywood doesn't understand this, even though the
failures of such dismal fare as ``Super Mario Bros.'' and ``Mortal
Combat'' should have made this abundantly clear to all future
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Such lessons apparently weren't absorbed by the makers of ``Wing
Commander,'' a tired trifle of a movie based on the popular
computer game of the same name. So cheesy it could be served on
crackers, ``Wing Commander'' takes place in a future where
Earthlings are at war with alien ``pilgrims,'' and decent actors
are in very short-supply. Freddie Prinze Jr. brings what's quickly
becoming his trademark blandness to his character, Chris Blair, a
hotshot good guy fighter pilot. Chris is supposed to be half-human,
half-pilgrim, and is therefore considered somewhat suspect by some
of his compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   While Chris is pretty enough to be a pin-up, his only trace
alien genes are some sort of grand navigational skills. At least
that's what he's told by his tough-guy superior Taggert (Tchecky
Karyo). So Chris is a handy guy to have around. Less necessary is
his best pal, the aptly named Maniac (Matthew Lillard), who likes
nothing more than executing risky manuevers in his spaceship and
endangering the lives everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   There's the typical ragtag gang of hard-drinking, well-armed men
and women, all pretty indistinguishable expect for the
blonde-haired Rosie (Ginny Holder) who looks like model Alek Wek,
and flies a plane like Chuck Yaeger. Overseeing this lot is
Devereaux (Saffron Burrows), who for reasons never made clear
constantly refers to her crew as ``ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the battle scenes are rarely more than mildly distracting.
It's mostly air combat with big explosions and such, and that's
gets old fast. ``Wing Commander'' is the kind of piffle where
sparks fly, fires flare, people run a lot and yell things like
``Brace for impact!'' and ``We've locked onto one of the
destroyers, sir!'' It's a movie filled with exclamation-point
dialogue, although there's really very little point to anything on
screen.

 NEW YORK: ... missles fly.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If he fights properly, with good balance and a hard jab, he'll
win. He's one of the most dangerous men in the world if he doesn't
get off his mental pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if he does? Or what if hesitation and timidity are, by
nature, his true ``mental pattern,'' as his staunchest critics
believe?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't use a solid, authoritative jab then it won't
matter,'' Steward admitted. ``That's what gives this fight so much
mystique. I think he's ready to shine but even I don't know which
Lennox will show up.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a dangerous way to be going into the most important
fight of your life, especially when the guy waiting for you is most
assuredly 215 pounds of fire and ferocity. Yet Lewis has seemed
calm all week. He has never once trained in front of the public, as
Holyfield willingly has done, but other than that he has been
steadfast in his position that he is too big and too strong for
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking for this fight for a long time,'' Lewis
said. ``This is an opportunity to actually show the reason why all
the other boxers have been ducking me. Now I'm going to get the
opportunity to go out and try to prove all the people wrong. I know
this is a fight where I need to go out and assert myself. I realize
how important a fight it is for me. This kind of fight has been
eluding me for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield knows I am a true threat to him. I'm the one who is
going to take away all the glory he's built up with all those other
big fights. People have asked why I think he's saying bad things
about me. Well, I don't believe he should have a good feeling about
me. We both fought Ray Mercer and Mercer is picking me. He should
know. He's a true warrior who looked at our fight as a war. I think
Evander will look at it the same way, maybe to his detriment.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so because there is no question that Lewis's right hand is
as dangerous as any tool in boxing. When it lands it does damage.
When it lands flush, it closes the show. Holyfield certainly
understands this yet continues to predict a third-round knockout,
saying ``sometimes a guy's best weapon can become his downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   What Holyfield is suggesting is that his superior hand speed
will allow him to counter Lewis's right, as McCall did the night he
knocked Lewis out, and his superior boxing ability, which is not in
dispute, will create such an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox always said I was ducking him,'' Holyfield said
confidently this week. ``But this fight is real now. It's here and
he's got to face it. Now's his chance to prove he's the great man
he's supposed to be. He brought all this upon himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those do not sound like the words of someone terribly fearful of
what Lewis has to offer and few would expect Holyfield would be
fearful knowing his nature. But to Lewis there is a lack of respect
in those words that he finds irksome, a respect he says he intends
to win by fighting the way he _ and few others _ believe he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the magnitude of this but I won't have time to think
of 20,000 people in Madison Square Garden,'' Lewis said. ``When I
step in that 20-by-20-foot ring, I won't be looking out of it until
the end comes. I am going to go in that ring with one belt and come
out with three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield is a great warrior. He will bring out things
in me the public hasn't seen yet. This is the defining fight for
Lennox Lewis. People's problem with me is they haven't seen me
against someone they thought was a great boxer. Those fights seemed
to elude me until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every time I went to train for this fight I would look at
a film of Holyfield first, to get into the mind-set to fight. He's
got a big heart. He won't go in and be easy to knock out, but on
the night I know I'm going to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, Lewis will become the most powerful economic force
in boxing, an undisputed heavyweight champion. But he insists this
fight is not about the money he will make, even though it is
considerable. Rather it is about what he first fought for as a boy
seeking to win trophies to put in his sparsely furnished room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make a lot of money for this fight ($9 million to
Holyfield's $20 million) but I don't think about the money,'' Lewis
said. ``I fight for the glory. This is a stage for me. There's
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no one to depend on. It's
dangerous. That's the thing I like about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will face danger like he has never known before in this
fight. He will risk everything he has won in boxing against the
most dangerous man he has ever faced. He will fight to unify the
heavyweight title but he will be fighting for much more than that,
much more than even Holyfield has on the line.
</P>
<P>
   He will, as he said, fight for glory and fight to clear his name
at last. That's an awful lot for one man to have to fight over but
he has been preparing for this moment for 21 years, preparing for
it since the first time he threw his hands at a kid who made fun of
him on a schoolyard in Kitchener.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he won't be that far from those days when he walks
down the aisle at Madison Square Garden and enters an arena full of
skeptics for he knows this night, at last, he will get to prove who
he is . . . for better or for worse.

ALEXANDER MAKES SENSE FOR THE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ol' Lamar is just plain Alexander now.
</P>
<P>
   His first time around the presidential racecourse, the Tennessee
walking horse, a former governor and secretary of education, was
all duded out in plaid shirt, playing piano tunes, scolding
Congress (``cut their pay and send them home'') and trying to dent
your consciousness with roadside signs stuck in snowbanks: ``Lamar
walked here!'' He's no longer making a big deal about walking. But
he is running.
</P>
<P>
   And I think the same thing I thought four years ago: he's got a
real shot at winning the nomination of the Republican Party, and
he'd be a tough guy for the Democrats to beat. For four years now,
a lot of my pals have been ribbing me about my penchant for
predicting big things for Alexander. I haven't changed my opinion
much at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He came closer than most people understand last time _ third
in Iowa, and if he had come in second in New Hampshire (he finished
third, behind Patrick Buchanan and Bob Dole), Alexander would have
been the alternative to the incendiary Buchanan, a party-wrecker on
the make who is back for his third fling.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is still way down in the polls; Texas Governor George
W. Bush and Elizabeth ``I am Woman'' Dole have lapped the rest of
the field of seven lesser-knowns. But Alexander has the best
on-the-ground organizations in Iowa's caucus format (47 weeks and
counting). And he's deep in New Hampshire as well, though if
Senator Judd Gregg falls to Bush, that gives Bush a ready-made
statewide framework. Both Bush and Dole candidacies are top-heavy.
Bush won his first election five years ago; Dole has never won an
election anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   These are the favorites? In a royalist party, which only once
since World War II has crowned as nominee a candidate who had not
run for president before? And that was Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's Republicans do their thing. And New Hampshire's love to
do theirs _ often the opposite. Alexander's theory is that only
three Republicans survive Iowa, and that gets winnowed to two after
New Hampshire. That leaves a frantic dash to St. Patrick's Day. It
is likely that the races in both parties will be over by late
March.
</P>
<P>
   So why do I persist in suggesting that a fellow languishing in
the single-digits in most places can cop the nomination? First,
only a ``big tent'' Republican can win, and the GOP governors know
that, even if the party's impeachment-tarnished congressional
leaders still don't get it. By this criterion, only a Bush, Dole,
Alexander, McCain, or Kasich qualifies; the righter-than-right
wingers (Forbes, Quayle, Buchanan, Bauer) would take the party over
the cliff and hand the Senate as well as the House to the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine, only Buchanan, Alexander, and Forbes have run
before. Bush has to be deemed un-vetted. We have to see if he has
any skeletons. Dole is 62, totally untested; her issues profile is
a total blank slate. Bush has a phenomenal advantage in that more
than half the GOP governors are slobbering over his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander has been to Iowa 60 times while Bush has been in
Austin. Terry Branstad, who was governor of Iowa for 16 years, is
running Alexander's caucus effort. There are 2,500 separate caucus
meetings across Iowa next Febuary. They voted for George Bush Sr.
over Ronald Reagan the year Reagan won the presidency, and for Bob
Dole over Bush the year Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see Alexander finishing in the top two in Iowa
and New Hampshire, and then anything could happen in the ensuing
three weeks. But there is something else. No one has run harder,
longer, or more seriously for this office. He has devoted the last
six years to the task, with a focus that is positively
Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Alexander, to me, if not to a lot of my friends, looks
like a president. He talks like a president. He is deadly serious,
the way Jimmy Carter was. He is a border state moderate, in GOP
terms. He has already lofted a signal flare on abortion: He opposes
it, but he'd be willing to pick a running mate who is pro choice.
Alexander's big deal is education. His tax and social policies spin
around the education axis. His Achilles heel may prove to be a
series of obscure business deals that opponents have criticized as
too cozy and conflict-related. But Bush has to defend his business
deals (with baseball's Texas Rangers), and Dole her conduct of the
Red Cross and Cabinet assignments.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that the media is rabid, rapacious, and risque.
Alexander has more armor on these scores than the other two. There
is something of the Southern preacher in him, and the morality
issue in the wake of Clinton's problems may be the issue that tips
Campaign 2000. Being a strait-laced New Age Southerner with a solid
record as governor was all Carter needed to convince us he wasn't
another Nixon. And it may be enough for Alexander to persuade
Republican voters he's not another Clinton. I could see that
happening.

WHERE THE WOMEN'S TEAMS BEAT THE MEN EVERY TIME: GRADUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   P.J. O'Rourke and John Hughes wrote, ``After equality, wage
parity, liberation of body and soul, and the extension for the
ratification of the ERA, women still can't do the following: start
barbecue fires; hook up a stereo; shine shoes; anything on a roof;
decide where to hang a picture; investigate mysterious house noises
at night; kill and dispose of large insects or walk past a mirror
without stopping to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, girls, this is the time to throw O'Rourke back at the
men. It's March Madness. These are the three weeks when men
sacrifice marriage, mortgage, and metabolism the moment their alma
mater or their team in the office pool hits the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   These are the weeks where guys are inmates in a primordal
asylum, speaking in gutteral tongues that, if done at the airport
x-ray machine, would have federal agents whisking you away in
handcuffs and straitjacket: ``Yes!!! Awww!!! Baby!!! Ohmigod!!!
(expletive deleted) Shoot you idiot!!! (Burp) Don't shoot, you
idiot!!! You blind ref!!! Great move!!! (expletive deleted)
Unbelievable!!! Incredible!!! What an upset!!! (Burp) Oh, nooo!!!
How stupid can you be!!! (expletive deleted) How could you choke on
that free throw??! Fire the coach!!! (Burp)
</P>
<P>
   Noel Coward said in 1930 that certain women should be struck
regularly like gongs. We don't believe that mess anymore, but in
1999 the only thing certain men would understand is a rhetorical
bong to the cheek. So, women, during the next three weeks, stride
smoothly into the room, right when beer and corn chips fly into the
air because Jamal the Helicopter Sikorsky has dunked for the upset
at the buzzer. Calmly block the TV as high fives and chest thumping
reach a thunder known only by Zeus and King Kong. Then say:
</P>
<P>
   ``After inequality in fame, millions of dollars to the colleges,
the liberation of body and soul, and the extension of
basket-weaving courses, men still can't do the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Think.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after O'Rourke and Hughes's observations, women now
play as many college basketball games, practice just as long, and
are recruited almost as hard as men for scholarships. By and large,
they are still student athletes. In fact, with the women in mind,
it is criminal that the National Collegiate Basketball Association
even allows a men's Division 1 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 64 women's teams, 47 have graduation rates of 60 percent
and above. Of the 64 men's teams, only 15 have a rate of 60 percent
or more. Only eight women's teams have graduation rates under 50
percent, but 41 men's teams are under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation rates reflect how many scholarship athletes get their
degree in six years. The mass disregard for academics on men's
teams is evident among the top 16 seeded teams. The graduation rate
for the top 16 is 44 percent, one point over the national average.
But that is skewed by the handful of teams that actually graduate
players.
</P>
<P>
   Look what happens by removing just five of the 16 top seeds,
Duke (83 percent graduation rate), Stanford (100), St. John's (85),
North Carolina (77) and Michigan State (67). The graduation rate
for the other 11 teams plummets to 27 percent with African-American
graduation rates of 21 percent. The worst is Cincinnati, which
graduates no one.
</P>
<P>
   The top 16 women's seeds have a graduation rate of 60 percent.
That is skewed by a handful of teams that fail to graduate players.
Take out the five lowest teams and the average goes to 69 percent,
3 points above the national women's team average and 10 percentage
points above the national graduate rate for all women at Division 1
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Take out the five lowest teams in the top 16 for graduation
rates of African-American players and the rate soars from 55
percent to 65 percent, 22 percentage points above the national
graduation rate for all African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams once wrote that hysteria is a natural
phenomenon, the common denominator of the female nature. Well,
ahem, other than the Super Bowl, there is no greater example of how
men turn living rooms into an asylum (burp). Women, there is no
better time to slamdunk humility back into the male species.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the announcers faze you when they gush about 4.0
players. Don't let them sucker you with those tired,
saved-from-the-ghetto stories. Block the TV with the truth. We are
men screaming like idiots, cheering on dummies. Many of us proudly
wear the colors of schools that no longer even bother with the
pretense of basket weaving.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke can joke about women not shining shoes. Women have the
last laugh. In their increasing equality and liberation of body and
soul, they have not yet forgotten that a basketball team is a means
to an end.
</P>
<P>
   As for men, we must confront this sobering fact: We have had
decades of unequal advantage, billions of dollars of college and
pro inequity, and the extension of our privilege that keeps the
men's tournament on the networks while the women are consigned to
cable. Many of the men we cheer for during March Madness will be
lucky if all they can do, once their athletic eligibility is over,
is shine a shoe.

NEW SCHOOL CHEER: ONE STYLE FITS ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY AND DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELROSE, Mass. _ Unless local school parent councils vote
otherwise, every public school student in the state next year could
be wearing clothes to school most wouldn't be caught dead in once
they get home.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a calf-length red velveteen coat over a black
Amityville T-shirt, calf-high boots and with a casket-shaped purse
slung over her shoulder, Melrose High school senior Erica Muxie was
horrified at the thought of uniformity being imposed upon her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a public school, you should be able to express
yourself,'' said the spiked-collar sporting Muxie, who plans to
study forensic science in college.
</P>
<P>
   But Governor Paul Cellucci _ and dozens of school officials and
politicians across the country _ argue the opposite: if too much
attention is spent on looking sharp in school, learning suffers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci proposed legislation Thursday that would require all
schools to have uniforms unless their local parent councils opted
out. This would effectively force each school to at least debate
the uniform issue.
</P>
<P>
   That debate has already been resolved in New York, where the
city's 550,000 elementary school students will be required to wear
uniforms this fall, following a school uniform revival that began
in Long Beach, Calif. in 1994. About 10 states have some type of
school uniform regulation, in addition to scores of individual
cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, several cities, including Lawrence and
Springfield, have uniform policies, although they vary greatly.
Lawrence and Springfield require students to wear them, while
Boston allows its schools to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our proposal, Massachusetts will join a nationwide trend
that has seen parents, teachers, principals and school committees
work together to promote an atmosphere of safety and seriousness in
their classrooms by regulating what students wear to school each
day,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The school uniform issue is far from new in Massachusetts, but
still ignites enormous passion, no matter what the age of a
student, teacher or parent. It was an issue in the 1993 mayoral
race in Boston, and in the 1996 presidential campaign. In 1997,
Gov. William Weld filed legislation allowing schools to require
uniforms if they chose, but it died.
</P>
<P>
   The parent councils Cellucci mentioned also include school
principals, teachers, and, in some cases, community leaders and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lawrence began requiring in 1994 that students wear navy
blue pants or skirt and white shirt every day, ``I've seen immense
changes,'' said Denise McCarthy, principal of the Wetherbee
Saunders Elementary School. ``The children felt better about
themselves. It gave them a sense of belonging to both the school
district and the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents say the uniform both prevents violence over
clothes, and sets a tone of the classroom as a serious place for
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids fight over clothes, they steal clothes,'' said Carl
Askins a Jamaica Plain parent of two children in Boston public
schools, who sits on the city's Parent Council. He said he would
want more information before deciding on a mandatory policy, but
that the cost of being fashionable in public schools is an undue
burden on many parents.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, while largely negative on uniform policies, do admit they
can work. Dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie at the East Boston
Edwards School, where Cellucci made his announcement, Chris Hunt,
13, said ``everyone hates'' his school's uniform of khaki or blue
khaki pants and white or navy blue sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hunt said, ``you can't judge other kids by their
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Melrose High senior Muxie on the other hand said that if forced
to wear a uniform, ``I wouldn't feel like myself anymore. So I
would be less inclined to try to do well in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1960s, uniforms in public schools were commonplace,
then largely abandoned in that free-spirited decade. It was as
school violence and classroom disruptions increased across the
country in the '80s and early 1990s that uniforms caught on again.
</P>
<P>
   After Long Beach instituted its policy, it reported a reduction
in school crime and an increase in attendance. Chicago school
officials attribute a drop in gang violence to school uniform
policies in many of their schools.
</P>
<P>
   What courts may still have to decide in Massachusetts is whether
schools have the right to make uniforms mandatory. In Lawrence and
Boston, if parents protest the uniforms, their children can usually
wear what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is voluntary it is fine. When it becomes mandatory, it
becomes more problematic,'' said John Roberts, executive director
of the ACLU of Massachusetts. He said buying uniforms might provide
a financial hardship for parents and the argument that uniforms can
save parents' money isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just go home and get out of them and put something else
on,'' Roberts said.

THE DOW: THE SKY'S THE LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What can you say about a Dow Jones industrial average as it
approaches the 10,000 mark?
</P>
<P>
   That it reflects a nation full of relentlessly optimistic
people. Whether you measure consumer confidence or investor
sentiment, survey after survey turns up the same result: We are
upbeat and we expect the good times to continue. If confidence is
the fuel that powers stocks, then the current market is running on
a full tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow crossed the 9900 mark Thursday before falling back in
the afternoon. The market peaked at 9935.46 and closed for the day
at 9897.44. Thursday marked the first time the Dow passed 9800 and
9900.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the 10,000 barrier would represent a psychological
triumph. Big numbers _ Mark McGwire's 70 home runs, Titanic's 11
Oscars _ draw the attention of the public. On Wall Street, crossing
the 10,000 barrier could, in the short run, trigger a sell-off, say
analysts, as some investors use the event as an excuse to take
profits. But on Main Street, the number focuses talk on how good
things are _ and how long they might stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   Just how optimistic are we? When discount broker Quick &AMP; Reilly
did its quarterly poll of customers recently, it found that
investors were as bullish as they have ever been. Of those
interviewed, 62 percent categorized themselves as bulls; only 8
percent listed themselves as bears. In 1993, the bulls outnumbered
the bears by only a narrow margin, 31 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in Fidelity Investment's 401(k) plans are also
feeling chipper these days. Fidelity Thursday said its own survey
of investor confidence showed a rise in optimism since last fall.
Of those surveyed in February, 35 percent said they were planning
to increase the amount they contribute to their retirement
accounts; 61 percent said they would maintain their investment
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps trying to keep expectations in check, Peter Smail,
Fidelity's head of retirement services, pointed out that investors
have enjoyed an unprecedented four straight years of returns of
more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ``should keep in mind that stocks historically have
returned about 11 percent annually,'' he said. Smail didn't say
investors were driven by ``irrational exuberance,'' Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan's famous phrase, but others have suggested
expectations have gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are also in a good mood. In February Americans were
more positive about their economic situation than at any time since
the Conference Board began its well-known survey in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence is translating into more spending. The
government Thursday reported that retail sales rose a robust 0.9
percent in February as consumers went shopping for cars, clothing,
and furniture. In response to those numbers, the nation's biggest
car makers Thursday said they were raising their sales forecasts
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Why is everyone so gosh-darn happy? It's the economy, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has performed brilliantly,'' said Nancy Kimleman,
chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. Unemployment and
inflation are as low as they have been in 30 years. The federal
government is running a budget surplus. Technological progress,
especially the rise of the Internet, has given people a sense that
anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on the economy has made investors more bullish and
the strong performance of the stock market, in turn, helps the
economy by making consumers more willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The optimism feeds on itself and becomes self-reinforcing,''
said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates,
a Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But what goes up can come down. Virtually all market watchers
say investor sentiment could turn on a dime if some bad news rears
its ugly head. That scenario played itself out in the summer of
1997 when the Asian financial crisis first hit. The percentage of
bulls in Quick &AMP; Reilly's survey fell from 58 percent to 39 percent
in one quarter. Something similar happened last summer when the
Russian economy collapsed, touching off a decline in stock prices
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would take much to puncture sentiment,'' said
Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   What could that something be? Weak earnings reports from
technology companies could do the trick, say analysts. Other
possibilities include more trouble overseas or a hike in interest
rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a Fed tightening could be a stake in the market's
heart,'' said Zandi.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, investors see only blue skies ahead.
As long as that is the case it's a good bet the bulls will continue
the assault on the 10,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Street Corp.'s latest proxy statement is expected to show,
among other things, how much it paid chief executive Marshall
Carter last year. Whatever the number is, shareholders are not
likely to complain much. State Street stock Thursday closed at a
record high of 88 1/4, up 3 13/16 for the day. During last
October's market turmoil the stock traded as low as 50. Over the
past three years, State Street's stock price has nearly quadrupled.
Numbers like that make multimillion-dollar paychecks a lot easier
to swallow.

RACE COLORS OUTPOURING FOR JOLTIN' JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all respect due to a man of phenomenal ability and
achievement, isn't it apparent that much of the public mourning for
Joe DiMaggio is really keening for the bygone era of the white
athlete? I had my ear cocked to the radio on Tuesday and Wednesday,
and I couldn't help hearing racial code words pouring out of the
ether. Caller after caller decried today's greedy, money-grubbing
athlete, who immodestly brags about his or her accomplishments and
publicly taunts opponents, talks trash, etc. Inevitably, callers
and commentators alike contrasted today's unsportsmanlike behavior
with the quiet dignity of DiMaggio, who supposedly never squawked
about contracts (he did), or poor-mouthed his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. But aren't we really talking about stereotypical
``white'' behavior, contrasted with stereotypical ``black''
behavior? Is it wrong for today's athletes, most of them black, to
want a bigger share of the white billionaire owners' revenues?
(Yes, if the fans' reaction to the recent NBA lockout is any
indicator.) And when fans complain about the extravagant behavior
of the Denver Broncos' touchdown salute, or Reggie Miller and Spike
Lee woofing at courtside, don't we hear the unspoken comment: White
players wouldn't act like this.
</P>
<P>
   Why have several writers already mangled DiMaggio's famous
response to columnist Jimmy Cannon, who asked why Joe hustled so
much? ``Because there's someone out there who's never seen me play
before,'' DiMaggio replied. (It's in Cannon's collected columns;
you can look it up.) But George Will and others have already
changed the quote to ``Because there's some child out there who's
never seen me play before,'' as if DiMaggio was selfessly hustling
for children, and not for himself. Why do we read of DiMaggio's
``fierce pride'' in insisting that he be introduced as ``the
greatest living ballplayer,'' when a similar gambit by, say, Bill
Russell, would have been deemed ``arrogant''?
</P>
<P>
   A necktied Joe DiMaggio hangs out with showgirls at Toots Shor's
and it's classy. A tattooed Dennis Rodman hangs out with Carmen
Electra in Las Vegas and it's vulgar. And what's this about Joe's
``matchless grace'' in ``patrolling'' center field? The year
DiMaggio retired, a black man named Willie Mays came on the scene
and defined defensive center-fielding for all time _ or at least
until Ken Griffey Jr. showed up. Most of DiMaggio's impressive
statistics, including his 1941 hitting streak, came before baseball
admitted black players into the league.
</P>
<P>
   I think what white sports fans really miss in the passing of a
DiMaggio or a Mickey Mantle is the presence of white athletes we
can admire. Mark McGwire? He can hit a home run, and then what? I'm
racking my brains to think of a white basketball player I find
remotely interesting. Football? Football still has a tenuous hold
on fan interest because a healthy percentage of the stars, like
John Elway and Brett Favre, are white.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed in the three decades since I went to sleep
with Mantle's biography on my bedside table. Like millions of
suburban American children, my own son sleeps underneath a poster
of Michael Jordan. The post-DiMaggio world isn't a worse place. In
fact, it's probably a better place. But it is a different place, as
worthy of celebration as DiMaggio's own glory years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Because they don't take . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine had to buy some American Express gift
certificates for some charity hoo-ha. She was directed to the AmEx
office at 1 Court St., where she learned that . . . they don't take
American Express! Disbelieving, I retraced her steps the other day,
and asked if I could charge some gift certificates to my AmEx card.
I was politely informed that no, a personal or corporate AmEx card
would not do. (Reason: the AmEx card is for charging merchandise,
and the gift certificates would be considered cash advances. But
they would take cash, checks, or . . . Visa.
</P>
<P>
   I'm writing the ad copy right now: ``In Boston, when buying
American Express gift certificates, make sure you have your Visa
card . . . ''

GETTING PAINT OFF CERAMIC TILE SHOULD BE EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In a condo I bought, someone painted the wall tile in the
bathroom, yellow, of all things, over perfectly acceptable light
blue tiles. Now I am trying to remove the paint. Is there an easy
way to remove the paint, which is peeling badly? How about putting
new tile over the old? The old tile was installed in mud.
</P>
<P>
   DON YOVICSIN, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no easy way, but chemical paint remover will take
off the paint quite well; and for your purposes, try a less toxic
remover such as Cistristrip. When the stripper softens the paint,
you can scrape most of it off with a putty knife. Apply more
stripper and remove remaining paint by rubbing with fine steel
wool. Wear skin and eye protection when working with stripper, and
provide lots of ventilation. The paint will be difficult to remove
from grout, but you can scrape it off physically. But before you do
all this, take the paint off a few tiles and check for any sanding
marks. Tile should be power sanded before painting, and if you find
any sanding marks, then the tiles are beyond help. Since the paint
is peeling badly, chances are fair that no sanding was done.
</P>
<P>
   If stripping sounds like too much work, you can set new tiles on
the old, using thin-set mortar. The old finish must be power sanded
so the thin-set will stick. When you come to the top of the tile,
the doubled tiles will provide a half-inch shelf. Cover this with
half-inch-wide border tiles or cut regular tile to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   For fixtures such as towel racks, soap holders, and others, you
can butt the new tiles against them and fill the gap with grout
when you grout the rest of the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way you can remove tiles in a mud job without
tearing out the whole wall and starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Having written all this, it occurs to me that removing the paint
is easier, and if the tiles have not been sanded, the result can be
pretty good for a lot less work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a puzzle. I get animals down my fireplace flue, they
never come into the fireplace and they always leave. But what if
one goes down the furnace flue and gets killed by the fumes, then
blocks the flue? That could be a big hazard. What can I do about
it?
</P>
<P>
   ED BOOTH, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have a good point, but animals often stay in flues even
with the burner on, and somehow can back away from the gaseous
stream, or get out in time to continue dear old life. But you can
have peace of mind by having stainless steel chimney caps
installed, covering all flues. These caps, generally installed by
chimney sweeps, keep out animals and water. Just make sure the
critters are out when the caps go on. It's funny; there are
thousands of old and new uncapped chimneys, some with flue liners,
some not, that have never had any animals in them. I don't know
why, but those who do not have critters are just lucky.

   When I.H. of Belmont, Mass. asked if old-fashioned wood storms
were still made and where to get them, the handyman suggested
salvage yards and other dealers in old house things. Such storms
are the type that hang on the outside casing from hooks at the top
of the casing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what John Miley of Belmont (I hope I got the name right)
wrote: I feel compelled to share some information with you and the
reader from Belmont. Traditional storm screens and windows are
available from: Midwest Architectural Wood Products Ltd., 300
Trails Road, Eldridge, IA 52748, phone: 319-285-8000.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, John Miley, for taking the time to write with some
valuable information. That information is going into the handyman's
vast electronic file, even as we speak.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The above was good news for I.H., and the handyman has good news
for ``Looking a Long Time'' in Dorchester, Mass., who asked if
there were any toilet seats available with enlarged openings. The
handyman didn't know, so asked, and here's what he found:
</P>
<P>
   Paul MacInnes, who heads up Standard of Lynn, specialists in
bathrooms and kitchens, wrote: ``Church is coming out later this
year with a seat they call the Jumbo, (no euphemistic approach with
this name). However, it has been designed with larger folks in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only larger than standard, but has a
larger-than-standard opening. And, MacInnes said, it will fit on a
standard toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It will be introduced in April at the National Kitchen and Bath
Industry Show; after that it should be in plumbing supply shops.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Paul MacInnes. ``Looking a Long Time'' will thank you as
well.

MAIER'S RUN SPOILED BY FELLOW AUSTRIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   March Madness on the slopes: All over the world, from Sunday
River, Maine, to Sierra Nevada, Spain, the competitive ski season
is wrapping up this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alpine World Cup finale, the question is how much of the
winners' circle Austria will cede to the two great Norwegian
skiers, Lasse Kjus and Andre Kjetil Aamodt.
</P>
<P>
   In the hills of western Maine, meanwhile, a pitched battle
between east and west NCAA rivals intensified Thursday as the
action swung to cross-country freestyle at Black Mountain in
Rumford.
</P>
<P>
   In World Cup, Austria's Hermann ``The Herminator'' Maier, has
all but conceded his overall World Cup title to Kjus, who cllected
enough points (50) with a fourth place finish in Thursday's Super-G
to hang onto a 102-point lead over Austria's team leader and most
colorful racer, Maier.
</P>
<P>
   The race is not officially over, but with just two technical
races left _ giant slalom and slalom _ Maier has said he will not
race the slalom, and thus can win only 100 points if he wins the
giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kjus is a much better technical skier, Maier had clearly
seen the writing on the wall when he said bitterly that he would
not race in the slalom.
</P>
<P>
   Since that would simply hand the overall title to Kjus without a
fight, great unhappiness settled into the camp of the all-world
Dream Team, and conferences were convened, one of them between
Maier and the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Maier had agreed to race in the slalom but
made it clear that his heart is no longer in this season. Even
though his team remains dominant in the standings nearly
everywhere, Maier's image of invincibility _ which even more than
the comparison with his friend Arnold Schwarzenager made ``The
Herminator'' title such a perfect fit _ has worn thin this year.
</P>
<P>
   What really took Maier out of the overall race, which he
captured last season, was some substandard (for Maier) ski racing.
Despite some stong racing this season, which he finished with four
straight Super-G wins and a shared gold medal with Kjus at the
Alpine Worlds in Vail, Maier skied a disappointing seventh
Thursday, and was victimized by his own teammates who had been
gunning for him as hard as rivals from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has been tough or me,'' Maier told reporters after
the race, adding ``I need time to regenerate my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Maier also complained of the soft snow, and made the mystifying
claim that a strong tailwind blowing down the course helped the
skiers who stood upright, whereas he almost always skis in a tuck.
</P>
<P>
   But another Austrian, Chris Mayer, who by virtue of his victory
over Maier Thursday all but gave the overall title away to the
Norwegian, was gleeful. His comments after the race give a glimpse
into the competitive heart of the Austrian team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could beat Hermann today because he is tired. Since
Christmas, I knew Hermann was not unbeatable in Super-G.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maier is no washout, either. Though he slumped at the
end, he had a dominant year in Super-G, winning the last four races
and clinching the title in the discipline a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayer's jubilation at winning Thursday adds another insight
into the psyche behind Austria's juggernaut. Last month at Vail,
Maier was abruptly taken off the Super-G team the day before the
race because coaches thought that Hans Knaus was on a hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   Embittered but quiet about it, Mayer waited until Thursday to
unload his own negative glee: ``This is my revenge on the coaches
taking me out of the Super-G team for Vail.''
</P>
<P>
   So the irony of Thursday's result is that, despite a season of
dominance in almost every discipline and in both genders, the
overall title probably goes to two Norwegians _ Kjus who stands
with 1,409 points and Kjetil Aamodt with 1,317. Maier collected
1,307.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Norwegians were rocking the world of college ski
racing Thursday. Twin brothers Rune and Frode Kollerud, who ski
cross-country for the University of Utah, finished 7 seconds apart
to take the top two spots in men's freestyle cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   The victory knocks Colorado from the slim lead it held after
placing first and third in Wednesday's GS and moves Dartmouth out
of second, which it held after the first day of competition.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, the University of Vermont's Ekaterina
Ivanova continued her winning ways in the 5K, beating Steffi Kindt
from Alaska-Anchorage by 13 seconds, and third place Britta Wieand
of Denver by 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanova, a star Nordic skier on the Russian national biathlon
team, has won her last 18 races.
</P>
<P>
   Action continues for both Alpine and Nordic skiers. The title
will be decided Saturday.

BECK'S NEW VISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another Beck is hitting the road these days _ not the avant-pop
Beck who had the lo-fi hit ``Loser,'' but Jeff Beck, the legendary
Rock Hall of Famer who has played with Rod Stewart, Mick Jagger,
the post-Eric Clapton Yardbirds, Stevie Wonder, and just about
anyone else who has needed a little guitar flash on their records.
</P>
<P>
   Beck releases a new album on Tuesday with the wry title of ``Who
Else!'' It's a return to form for the enigmatic Brit, who for the
past decade has churned out some offbeat albums in ``Crazy Legs''
(a tribute to rockabilly god Gene Vincent) and ``Frankie's House,''
a soundtrack for a BBC documentary on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The new album _ preceding a tour that has already sold out the
Orpheum March 20 _ finds Beck exploding in many directions,
befitting his versatile skills. He offers deep-fried blues, funky R
&AMP; B, flat-out rock, an Irish air, Middle Eastern riffs, and his
newest offshoot _ techno music _ which he employs with hard-hitting
results on such tracks as ``THX 138,'' ``Psycho Sam,'' and ``What
Mama Said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's a little twisted insanity in there,'' Beck says
of his techno forays. ``I've been listening to some pretty out
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   What has most impressed him is the British techno group Prodigy.
``I tried to use some of the energy from Prodigy records,'' Beck
says in a recent phone chat. ``They're so bad boy/wicked. The guy
comes on with green spikes sticking out of the side of his head.
They're wild, but they know how to make a record. I really took to
their sound.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the album is instrumental, the showcase song is
``Space for the Poppa,'' with Beck adding piercing guitar riffs to
some spacy talking snippets from Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted her somewhere on my record,'' says Beck. ``Seeing
that I did a favor by playing a solo on her next record, I asked
her to be on this track. I wanted a really nice, sexy voice, and
she came along and did it in one take. We were originally going to
keep her presence a secret, but it became annoyingly mysterious and
now most people know that it's Chrissie Hynde.''
</P>
<P>
   Another showpiece is ``Psycho Sam,'' which sounds like a ``Peter
Gunn'' for the '90s with its visceral guitar boogie over a
world-music, Bulgarian-influenced motif, written by longtime
collaborator (and keyboardist) Tony Hymas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony said, `I'll write you a Bulgarian-type chant that will go
over that.' And he put this fantastic sequence in the beginning _
it's almost like a Larry Graham bass-funk sequence that starts it
off. And then you've got the Bulgarian, raving-house-party-type
thing, which is just two overdubbed guitars.''
</P>
<P>
   After Beck's induction into the Rock Hall of Fame in 1992 with
the Yardbirds, he told the Globe: ``I just want to keep exploring
new sounds. That's what I do.'' He did it in the '60s with a
fuzztone-and-feedback guitar sound that made him a pioneer to be
mentioned in the same breath as Jimi Hendrix. And he's still doing
it on his new album, which is all over the map by today's
commercial standards but serves as another example of Beck's
unrestrained sonic genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make sure that people don't think I've gone off the rails,
I also stuck a real blues on there,'' he says of ``Brush with the
Blues,'' which sounds like something off his epic ``Beck-Ola''
album from 1969.
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of the blues, Beck's tour set will include a
rendition of the Beatles' ``A Day in the Life,'' which he has
transformed into a blues, backed by a computer sample of an
orchestra. The version appeared on a double-CD, multi-artist
compilation that Beatles producer Sir George Martin released last
year as Martin's farewell to the business. (Martin played a pivotal
role in Beck's career, producing Beck's famed jazz-rock fusion
album, ``Blow by Blow,'' in 1975.)
</P>
<P>
   Beck now has the challenge of reproducing some of his
pyrotechnic guitar work in concert. ``It's an unpleasant task, but
for my own part, my playing is not really tricked up or anything.
The guitar is exactly what you hear,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His new group includes drummer Steve Alexander, bassist Randy
Hope-Taylor, and guitarist Jennifer Batten, the blond dynamo who
was Michael Jackson's touring guitarist for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits in beautifully. She adopted the role of supporting
MIDI guitar. That means she can almost mimic any sound on any
record I had, just by working with samples,'' Beck says. ``It's
becoming high art, that form of guitar playing. So if I want a
Hammond organ, that's not an organ, that's a guitar. She's on the
MIDI frontier. And also, when needed, she can plug in the old
guitar and we can trade off solos. Whenever I need a riff and a
heavy chord, she's just going to flick a switch and we're all
right. It's also nice to have another guitarist who isn't trying to
blow me off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck is refocused on his career _ and he's no longer interested
in guest roles on albums by big-name artists, as he's done in the
past with Stewart and Jagger. ``Without any disrespect, it's only
because I didn't have much going on for myself,'' he says of such
projects. ``There were great areas of flatness where I wasn't
really doing much. That's why the Jagger project came along.
Although I did enjoy it, I don't want to get involved with any
other major album projects right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to catch up with my own projects and just keep the
train rolling,'' he adds. ``I feel like we just got the brakes off
and are getting this thing up to steam. I want to let people know
that I'm still around, although Prince _ if you're listening _ I
could do with a couple of guest spots on your records someday. I
think he's the most talented guy on the planet. And he's a bloody
good guitarist himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck is also happy to be back in intimate theaters like the
Orpheum. Previous tours found him sharing an arena bill with Stevie
Ray Vaughan, then sharing a summer amphitheater bill with Santana
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's fault!'' he says of the
industry's fixation on bigger shows. ``Emerson, Lake, and Palmer
were the first people who boasted five semi-trucks and played the
enormodomes,'' he adds of that '70s band.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I prefer an old-fashioned theater, where you can really
feel the sound.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 'N Sync, the quintet of camera-ready, harmonizing heartthrobs
from Florida, inspires the sort of time-honored and ear-shattering
passion in young girls that moves CDs by the millions, lands the
band's biography on bestseller lists, and sells out concerts in a
flash. Tickets went in less than an hour for 'N Sync's show Tuesday
night at the FleetCenter. The bill also includes BWitched and
Tatyana Ali.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with 22-year-old JC Chasez _ also known as Mr.
Sleepy and the Perfectionist _ in Greenville, N.C., the day after
'N Sync's first show headlining an arena.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the best thing about being in 'N Sync?
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, being with your best friends. Second of all,
reaching out to people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the worst thing about being in 'N Sync?
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably the lack of sleep. It's just a crazy schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything that you always take on the road with you,
something you can't live without?
</P>
<P>
   A. I usually take a guitar or keyboard, some sort of instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your most prized possession?
</P>
<P>
   A. Um, um, I would say my family.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your first big splurge after 'N Sync hit it big?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, there wasn't one. The only thing I bought was a
keyboard, the one I take on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It didn't cross your mind to buy a Porsche?
</P>
<P>
   A. There's really no need for a Porsche, because I'm never home
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have a girlfriend?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not right now. I'm definitely talking to a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sounds like you're conducting interviews. . .
</P>
<P>
   A. At this point, where we are now, you've got to get to know
people real well, you know, because you don't know what their
motives are before you date them. I'm just trying to check them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Describe your dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   A. Somebody patient. I don't know. Somebody who's really
outgoing, but patient, who's going to accept me for all my faults.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are your faults?
</P>
<P>
   A. They're gonna have to deal with me being on the road so much.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you were a Beatle, which one would you be?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would say McCartney or Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you were a Backstreet Boy, which one would you be?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can stick me on any of them, I don`t care.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the reports of bad blood between you and the Backstreet
Boys are a nasty rumor?
</P>
<P>
   A. They don't bother me none.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the wildest and craziest thing a fan has ever done?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have a few stories. My favorite is the one about the fan
who jumped onto the luggage belt at the airport and then tried to
get through security riding on the luggage racks.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the wildest and craziest thing you've ever done?
</P>
<P>
   A. I jumped off a two-story building just to get down. I started
down the drainpipe, and just dropped down. I hurt my ankle pretty
bad. For some reason my eye said I could make it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now that you're famous, is security a drag?
</P>
<P>
   A. We like our security guys. We like everybody we hang out
with. You barely notice they're there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You guys toured with Janet Jackson. Did you all pal around?
</P>
<P>
   A. We talked to her a few times. We both had busy schedules.
She's a really, really cool woman. A special person, period. She
makes you feel so comfortable, and gets everything done in a nice
way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's on your CD player?
</P>
<P>
   A. I just pulled out my Lenny Kravitz CD. I think it's one of
the coolest records this year. If it's got a good vibe, regardless
of style, I like it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you do for fun?
</P>
<P>
   A. I sleep. That's my favorite thing to do. I catch a flick from
time to time, too. The ``Star Wars'' trilogy is my favorite of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you all as squeaky clean as you seem?
</P>
<P>
   A. I take a shower sometimes. I mean, people say we're good. But
I don't know what people think we are.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think people see you as extremely wholesome, clean-living
fellows, who never do anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A. We just carry on like your next-door neighbor. We have our
good days and our bad days. But I wouldn't try to do something on
stage that my mom couldn't watch.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any strategically placed tattoos?
</P>
<P>
   A. No tattoos. I'm terrified of needles.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Don't you ever feel like sneaking out of your hotel room in
disguise and carousing a bit?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, because I want to be asleep at night. If we want to go
out, we go out. If I'm with my parents at dinner, and they're
having wine, I might have some. But we don't drink stupidly. We're
very goal-oriented. You don't need stuff like that beating you up.
We want to keep it on the up and up.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Critics are pretty harsh on you. Are you more talented than
you're given credit for?
</P>
<P>
   A. Critics can say what they want. Some of what they write is
good and some is bad. I'm just happy the fans like us. The Beatles
were looked at as a crazy rocker phenomenon. People bash things
that are supposed to be a phenomeonon. So be it. Like I said, I'm
not worried about the critics.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will there be any surprises on the new record?
</P>
<P>
   A. We've only done a few songs for the new record. We'll do the
bulk of it in June. There will be more songs by us. All of us are
contributing to the writing. We had one song on the last record.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whom do you most admire?
</P>
<P>
   A. I look up to my family. They've had to deal with a lot of
stuff, running a family with my sister and brother and dealing with
me. Musically, I look up to Sting and Seal, who are both melody-
and story-driven writers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your most embarrassing moment on stage?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, boy. I've had times when my fly's been down for one or
two songs before I noticed it. Thankfully it wasn't in front of
20,000 people. Just 5,000. We stay pretty cool now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You all wear WWJD bracelets. When's the last time you asked
yourself, ``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, it was Wednesday. The guys called at 10 p.m. and
asked me to go to a movie, and I had to decide if I should go out
and be tired the next day, or get some sleep. We wear the bracelets
as a reminder. You want to make good decisions every time.

PFEIFFER'S RAW NERVES PROPEL `DEEP END' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN 
Directed by: Ulu Grosbard 
Screenplay by: Stephen Schiff (novel: Jacquelyn Mitchard) 
Starring: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg,
Jonathan Jackson, Ryan Merriman, John Kapelos 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language and thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' is interesting for the very things
that make it a chancy commercial prospect. Although it smooths away
a lot of the rough edges in Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel about a
mother whose 3-year-old son is kidnapped, then, against the odds,
returned nine years later, it's more unruly in more ways than the
average studio film wants to know about. At its center is Michelle
Pfeiffer's jangly mom, torn with anguish and guilt after the boy is
spirited away from a crowded Chicago hotel lobby where she
momentarily left him in his older brother's care while she went to
check in.
</P>
<P>
   As she proved in ``A Thousand Clowns,'' Pfeiffer is willing to
play characters who do not immediately engage an audience's
sympathy. As Beth Cappadoro, juggling motherhood with a
photographer's career, Pfeiffer does not handle crisis well. Her
husband, played by Treat Williams, is the steadier of the two. He
perseveres, continuing to do the daily things that must be done,
while she takes to her bed, bereft and depressed, when she isn't
going over the case with Whoopi Goldberg's investigating detective,
Candy Bliss. It's a name she makes clear she realizes must be
accompanied by an explanation and a joke, and also a declaration of
her sexuality (gay).
</P>
<P>
   As if deliberately playing against her beauty, Pfeiffer makes
sure her eyes are the eyes of a woman who cries a lot. She's tense,
taut, an emotional tripwire whose pain is sometimes expressed by
verbally jeering her husband's steadiness, which she sometimes
interprets as a reproach. She's far from being a basket case, but
she's not easy to live with, either. Then this bifurcated film
stops and picks up nine years later. If not exactly cheery, Beth
has recovered somewhat and made her peace with her family. At least
her older son no longer has to torture his younger sister so their
parents will interrupt their fighting to see why the baby is
crying.
</P>
<P>
   While not quite brandished as a badge of integrity, discomfort
(in star and audience alike) does at least tip us off that this
film is willing to go a few places that conventional films aren't.
The thing that turns ``Deep End of the Ocean'' into more than just
another overextended TV movie is its willingness to play out the
likelihood that when the boy is reunited with his family nine years
later after turning up at the door and offering to mow the lawn,
the family isn't exchanging sadness for a happy ending. Rather,
it's only trading one set of problems for another set.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Ryan Merriman's 12-year-old misses the man he
regards as his father, who lives only a few blocks away and is
innocent of the kidnapping. The boy is not sure about taking up a
new life with his biological family, and Pfeiffer's Beth is forced
to ask herself what the best way might be to ensure his happiness.
Or, rather, what the best guess might be, since Stephen Schiff's
refreshingly intelligent screenplay recognizes the problematic
nature of the situation, respects it, and doesn't insist on
wrapping everything up conclusively. It leans toward resolution,
yet leaves things open-ended. While it often seems a merely neat
and efficient exercise in motivation-supplying, it's certainly a
healthy cut above most.
</P>
<P>
   The film is jagged in its pacing and sometimes flat in its tone,
and yet Ulu Grosbard reminds us why he's celebrated as an actor's
director. Pfeiffer's clenched, antiglamorous Beth is one of her
best characterizations. It's a thing of intensity and integrity,
almost all raw nerves, serious to the point of dourness. Never does
Pfeiffer trade on her looks or resort to histrionics. She just goes
with the emotion. Williams's husband is smoothed into near
blandness, but the young actors playing her sons are affecting.
Merriman, as the unwitting prodigal returned, persuades us he's
just trying to be a good kid and not make anyone feel worse. As the
guilt-ridden older brother, Jonathan Jackson impressively projects
sensitivity and idealism. ``Deep End of the Ocean'' is not without
its compromises, but it's still above Hollywood's average.

`CORRUPTOR' IS PREDICTABLE COP EXCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kiss-kiss bang-bang gets a workout in ``The Corruptor,'' a
dizzyingly convoluted shoot-'em-up in which everyone fires piles of
weapons but only the bad guys die.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, everyone's a bad guy even the good guys, who
rub elbows and other parts with a variety of corrupt forces
(gangsters, smugglers, prostitutes) before mowing them all down in
a hail of bullets. It's that sort of movie.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by James Foley (``At Close Range,'' ``The Chamber''),
``The Corruptor'' stars Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg, which is to
say one of them keeps his clothes on and the other one doesn't.
Both wreak havoc on animate and inanimate objects, including the
requisite cars, trucks, scummy sub-basement lairs and, in the
film's forcibly noisy climax, one large ship.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse for all this destruction is Robert Pucci's
screenplay, which knits together one of the snarlier plots to
attach itself to an action film. Chow plays Nick Chen, a veteran
New York cop whose shady connections with a Chinese mob have helped
him rise through the ranks. Then Danny (Wahlberg), a clean young
idealist, is transferred to Nick's Chinatown precinct,
discombobulating both Nick and his web of criminal chums among them
Henry Lee (Ric Young) and Uncle Benny (Kim Chan), currently in the
middle of a turf war with Bobby Vu (Byron Mann).
</P>
<P>
   Bobby's the head thug of a violent gang called the Fukienese
Dragons, which might or might not be part of a slavery ring
involving illegal immigrants. Complicating matters are a bunch of
inexplicably dead prostitutes who keep turning up in Dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   Will Danny stay clean? Will Henry corrupt him? Will Danny
disrobe for a nude scene with prostitutes? Will Nick and Danny
overcome their differences and forge mutual respect? Or will Nick
continue to say things like ``You don't change Chinatown, boy it
changes you!'' and ``You wanna be a Chinese, you gotta eat the
nasty stuff!''? (Danny, for the record, is the one who says ``I
don't care if you pick a raisin out of Sammy Davis' eye socket.''
Umm, OK.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese gangsters are the supposed crux of the movie, but
their internecine squabbles never make much sense all we know is
that Bobby hates Benny and Henry, who's using Nick to get back at
Bobby (or is it Benny?) while simultaneously using Danny to jerk
around Nick. For what it's worth, most of this makes more sense at
the end than it does when you're sloshing around in the middle of
it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the film features a few genuine plot twists
and one eye-popping, hair-raising six-minute car chase. The
bloodshed, while witless, incessant and absurd, is limited mainly
to gun battles choreographed to cartoonish excess.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, the broody Hong Kong action star who made his American
debut with the equally rat-a-tat ``Replacement Killers,'' does a
fine job of offing people while remaining fashionably groomed.
Wahlberg gives his green kid a good shot of ambiguity: In the tug
between right and wrong, he's ripped right down the middle. Juan
Ruiz-Anchia's black-and-blue photography looks appropriately
bruised, while his antsy camerawork may remind TV viewers of a few
prime-time cop shows.
</P>
<P>
   The end sum is skillful but standard filmmaking, slick, gimmicky
and powered by numbing action.

DARK SIDE OF FAME HAUNTS SILVERCHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surreal: That's how Silverchair singer-guitarist Daniel Johns
describes his past year. His band had become a kind of Australian,
teenage Pearl Jam, blasting its way around the globe. But the
contrast with his world at home, where Johns had not finished high
school, took an alarming toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from playing in front of thousands of people who said
they loved me, to coming home to see gangs waiting to beat me up
outside of school just because I was different,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Johns, who is 19, finished high school in 1997. By that time,
silverchair had released two hit albums, ``Frogstomp'' and ``Freak
Show.'' On Tuesday, the group issues a third disc, ``Neon
Ballroom,'' which reflects the many tensions in Johns's young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to write songs about being a tortured artist. I
didn't want to glamorize depression. I just wanted to be honest and
open,'' says Johns, who admits to many anxiety problems leading up
to the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I locked myself in my house for three months and had family
and friends deliver food. I suffered from paranoia,'' he says. The
upshot is a turbulent, but arrestingly varied, album. ``Neon
Ballroom'' has some cathartic rock numbers, but also more pensive,
personal tunes such as ``Emotion Sickness,'' a strikingly mature,
6-minute song that opens the album and features an appearance by
David Helfgott, the pianist whose mental breakdown and comeback was
portrayed in the film, ``Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt a connection because he started young and was
Australian. We both have a lot of nervous energy. You can hear it
in his track,'' says Johns. ``But it was amazing working with him.
He's very affectionate and . . . needs to touch and kiss people all
the time. I'm not sure what it's all about, but it's not a sad
thing. He left everybody very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative song features some sweeping power chords on
guitar, countered by Helfgott's manic, but economic, piano inserts.
The lyrics describe the mental anguish of ``distorted eyes'' and
the appeal of antidepressant medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I wrote the song, I was trying to avoid being a
cliche of the rock singer on antidepressants,'' says Johns. ``But
later on the album, on the song `Paint Pastel Princess,' is when I
gave in to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns, whose bandmates include drummer Ben Gillies and bassist
Chris Joannou, says antidepressants have helped him cope with
crowds. Hence, his consent to another worldwide tour, which stops
at the Paradise March 23. ``I'm fine in front of crowds as long as
I'm not in among them,'' he says. ``Throughout all this, I've been
lucky to have a stable family life. That means so much.''
</P>
<P>

   Hey Jude: Former Bostonian Jude, a fast-talking wordsmith in the
Dylan tradition, has caught on with his new album, ``No One Is
Really Beautiful.'' It's done well nationally and been nominated
for a Boston Music Award for debut album of the year. Released on
Maverick Records (owned by Madonna), the disc is an acoustic-pop
gem. Sporting a wise-guy sensibility, Jude spits out lines like
``Charlie says no one is really beautiful, they're just mediocre
men of the hour'' and ``the words of the prophets are no longer
written on the subway walls.'' Cocky and sensitive at the same
time, Jude grew up in Jamaica Plain and Needham and is now living
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up reading a lot of poetry, a lot of anthologies,''
says Jude, who was more conversant as a youth with T. S. Eliot than
with Dylan or other folk poets. He moved to LA five years ago,
because he wanted to fight his way into the record biz and also
``sit up front at Laker games wearing Celtic green.'' Soon came the
Maverick deal and such smarty-pants tunes as ``Rick James,'' now an
alternative rock hit.
</P>
<P>
   Jude's current plans are to ``tour, tour, tour and play, play,
play'' with his five-piece band. But he also hopes to release an
indie record of piano ballads in the next year. ``Maverick lets me
put out stuff on small pressings. The label has been real cool. I
waited a long time and said no to a lot of other (labels). I wanted
to be able to sit with a record company president and have him like
what I do, which is what happened.''

Other Ones _ the band anchored by Grateful Dead alumni _ will tour

TIME TO CORRECT A BUNGLED ABUSE CASE AGAINST THE POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's hard to believe that so many people with so
much experience could screw up anything so badly for so long. But
this Jermaine Henderson case has been just one boneheaded blunder
after another.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a chance to get it right. That's possible only if
District Attorney Sol Greenberg finally starts using his head. As
distasteful as it might be, the DA needs to back off his refusal to
grant the Henderson kid immunity and get his testimony against the
two cops accused of beating him up while he was in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. I was one of the people urging the vigorous
prosecution of both Henderson and the cops. Ideally, that would
still be my preference. But the situation is hardly ideal. Instead,
it's a horror show.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Greenberg has to do with Jermaine Henderson what
the feds did with Sammy ``The Bull'' Gravano when they needed his
testimony for an honest prosecution of John Gotti. Gravano, a
ruthless hit man who'd single-handedly filled up cemeteries all
around New York, got immunity for his truthful testimony in the
Gotti case. Now Gotti is in the slammer, and murderous Sammy the
Bull is lolling in the sun somewhere, courtesy of the witness
protection program.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so these cops aren't John Gotti. But Henderson isn't Sammy
the Bull, either. Prosecutors are forced into these tough decisions
all the time. The good ones bite the bullet and make those
decisions with an eye toward what's best for the community.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Henderson might have done, and there are indications
that he did plenty, he represents only himself. The two cops in the
case represent this entire community and its essential sense of
fairness. They represent the system of which Greenberg is an
integral part.
</P>
<P>
   They're also the pivotal figures in a case that has come to
reflect horribly on the quality of law enforcement and basic
political decency in Albany. I mean, just look at the mistakes that
have been made here:
</P>
<P>
   _ Blunder number one came the night two off-duty cops busted
Henderson in a bar, claiming that the College of St. Rose
Basketball star had punched one of them and then resisted arrest.
If that's what he did, that blunder was Henderson's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blunder number two was made by whatever supervising officer
permitted the two off-duty cops to take Henderson in for booking
that night. He apparently showed up at booking vastly more banged
up than when he'd been dragged off in the wagon, and he was
claiming that the cops had kicked him around in a parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what they did, then that blunder was the cops'.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blunder number three was Greenberg's decision that his office
shouldn't prosecute the cops. Instead, he would get a judge to
appoint a special prosecutor for them while his office would take
care of Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   That was the key blunder. Why shouldn't the DA prosecute cops _
especially when the cops are white and the complainant is black?
After all, two out of three people busted in this town are
non-whites. Doesn't the minority community have a right to see that
the DA's office will treat white cops the same way it treats
non-white street criminals?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that an essential ingredient in ensuring that the
population most intensely policed maintains at least some semblance
of faith in the system's even-handedness? Sure, the DA works with
the police every day. But DAs in other jurisdictions prosecute
police officers all the time in cases like this. They do it because
they need to demonstrate to the minority community that they're
fair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blunder number four was Judge Tom Breslin appointing John
Dorfman as special prosecutor. It's widely believed that the
judge's brothers, Albany County Executive Mike Breslin and State
Sen. Neil Breslin, would like to see Dorfman run for DA when the
current term for Greenberg, who's pushing 80, expires. Since
Greenberg's office is jammed with would-be successors, this was a
prescription for disaster. From the start, Dorfman was doomed to
bitter, disastrous conflict with the DA and his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blunder number five was a series of complicated legal
maneuvers by both Dorfman and Greenberg in prosecuting the two
cases _ the assault charge against Henderson and the separate
assault case against the cops _ that led to the charges against
everybody being thrown out and then effectively reinstated against
the cops alone on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blunder number six was the city's decision to settle a civil
suit by Henderson before the criminal cases were resolved.
Henderson has $60,000 in his pocket. As he said the other day, he
has no incentive to testify in the criminal case against the cops _
not when he could face new criminal charges for minimizing his role
in the bar fight that started all this, which he apparently did in
his initial statement to the police and later as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue is how to resolve this mess. And Greenberg has
committed yet another blunder by denying Henderson immunity for
anything he might say in the cops' trial. That leaves Dorfman with
no complainant to put on the stand _ unless he wants the jury to
hear his star witness invoke the Fifth Amendment, which he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the cops is going on right now. Ultimately, the
case against the cops is vastly more important than the conduct of
any obnoxious, smart-ass college kid in a bar fight, even if he
lied about it later. The behavior of the cops relates directly to
the credibility of the Albany Police Department and the criminal
justice system in general.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council already has passed a resolution begging the
feds to come in and prosecute this as a civil rights violation _ as
though Albany, N.Y., in 1999 were Selma, Ala., in 1956. If that
happens, it'll be a monumental humiliation for this town, the state
capital. That's because the handling of this case from the start
has been a classic study in incompetence, venality, petty political
bickering and sheer, unadulterated stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for somebody, finally, to do something sensible. Grant
the kid immunity and get his butt on the stand. It's Albany's last
chance to get this right.
</P>

GOOD TIME FOR MOVE TO MORE FIXED-INCOME HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I enclose lists of my investments and the on-going
contributions to the accounts. I am now 57 1/2 years old, and I
estimate that in retirement I will receive about $21,500 a year
from two pension plans and $15,600 from Social Security. I would
like to bring my total income up to the $50,000 to $55,000 annual
level. How much income can I expect from my investments at ages 63
and 65? All my contributions to my current 401(k) plan are going
into Fidelity's Magellan. Although I am happy with the performance
of this fund, I am concerned about having too much of my money in
any single fund. Should I change, perhaps to Fidelity Low-Priced
Stock or Fidelity Growth and Income? Should I reallocate the money
in my inactive 401(k)? Finally, I am a little nervous about the
market and would like to move toward safer investments. What do you
suggest?
</P>
<P>
   D.C., West Boylston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree that you might do well to move toward a more
conservative portfolio. I calculate that you have only about 18
percent of the portfolio on the fixed-income side, a tally which
involved guessing that the balanced fund in the old 401(k) account
has a 50/50 breakdown between stock and bond holdings. Both because
of the market and the relatively short time period before you
retire, I would suggest something in the neighborhood of 33.33
percent of the portfolio in fixed-income issues, and modifying your
ongoing investment pattern so that by the time you retire the
portfolio balance will be about 50/50 stocks to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this is that I calculate your portfolio should be
able to deliver just about what you want in retirement if you rely
on half the accumulation to deliver your income stream and left the
other half alone, to grow and provide you protection against the
effects of inflation in the later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I calculate. If we presume average portfolio growth
of 8 percent for the next 66 months, until you reach age 63, with
your ongoing contributions you should have a $510,392 nest egg.
Half of that amount invested on the fixed-income side and yielding
6.5 percent would bring you $16,587 a year, which would combine
with your pensions and Social Security to give you $53,687 a year _
with no invasion of principal and half your savings left in growth
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At age 65, the pool would amount to $664,605, using the same
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The stake in Magellan represents a little more than 49 percent
of the entire portfolio, which wouldn't be a problem if that
represented the so-called core holding of a diversified portfolio.
But when you combine it with your other investments, which also
concentrate on large-cap domestic issues, it does indeed represent
a problem. It would be less of a problem if you follow my advice
below about changes in the older 401(k) portfolio, but I agree it
would create a nicer balance if about $25,000 were moved to
Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, an excellent offering available through
your 401(k) although closed to most new investors. Diversifying
further by moving money to Fidelity Growth and Income probably
wouldn't hurt, but although it's also an excellent fund it probably
wouldn't help much either, given the fact that its portfolio
represents the same kind of large-cap blend Magellan has.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how do we reallocate ongoing contributions, both to reduce
risk and to move the portfolio toward a more appropriate
stock-to-bond balance?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly you don't want to stop buying your company's stock,
given the handsome 50 cents on the dollar your company is matching.
So the way to move to a more conservative portfolio is to change
the allocation of your other investments. You are putting $300 a
month into taxable accounts in Janus and Janus Mercury funds. I
suggest that you leave these holdings as they are but direct $500 a
month into Janus Balanced and the other $100 go into Janus Venture.
Then I would move all of the contributions to the current 401(k)
account to Fidelity Intermediate Bond, in another move designed to
reduce risk. The upshot of these moves is that you would be putting
a bit more than 60 percent of your ongoing contributions on the
fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   You could then achieve that target 33 percent current allocation
on the fixed-income side by moving the entire balance of the assets
in the inactive 401(k) account to the fixed-income side. I think I
would put the largest concentration, perhaps 75 percent, in the
Diversified Bond, with the rest in the Government Securities fund
offered on that 401(k) menu.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are retired and living on a monthly income of
$2,100. My wife is 66 and I am 67. We would like to do more travel
in the near future and are looking for additional funds from our
investments. We are planning to invest $40,000 in Vanguard's Total
Stock Market Index, $30,000 in its Wellesley Income, and $10,000 in
its U.S. Treasury Money Market. However, we hope to derive the bulk
of our supplemental income from my wife's traditional IRA, which
has a $105,000 balance. Which fixed-income investments would
produce a minimum of $500 per month for us?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since your minimum requirement represents an average return
of only 5.7 percent, you should be able to put together a
conservative portfolio that easily exceeds that $500 target.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to transfer the IRA to Vanguard, putting
$25,000 in Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund, $20,000 in its
Short-Term Corporate Bond fund, $40,000 in its GNMA fund, and
$20,000 in its Corporate High-Yield Bond fund. These funds are
listed in the order of their riskiness, and their current yields,
in the same order, are 4.69 percent, 5.94 percent, 6.79 percent,
and 8.31 percent. Such a portfolio would bring you $6,738.50 a year
at current rates, or a 6.42 portfolio average. Since all of these
but the money market fund will fluctuate in value from day to day,
you might decide to withdraw only $500 a month, letting any
additional income build up in the account, thus creating a buffer
so that even when the bond markets are jumpy, the chances are the
principal in the account would not be invaded over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm wrong and you feel that you'd be willing to shoulder a
bit more risk in return for a slightly higher yield, you could
simply put half the money in the GNMA fund and divide the remainder
between the Short-Term Corporate Bond and High-Yield Corporate Bond
funds.

NOT YOUR AVERAGE JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the end, Joe DiMaggio confounded the press
with characteristic elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Half the crowd across from the SS Peter and Paul's Church were
reporters or cameramen interviewing the other half of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for one day we were living in the 1940s, not the culture of
celebrity, and even those with press cards joined in applause with
DiMaggio's friends as the hearse drove away from the North Beach
section of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the standing ovation, as the hearse started to move,
a few older people in the crowd said quietly, ``There he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   They knew him. They grew up with him. They proudly carried
pictures of him.
</P>
<P>
   Nino Cresci carried a picture of DiMaggio and his two
baseball-playing brothers, Vince and Dom, who was a star outfielder
for the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother told me he was a strong little kid, who could run
and play ball. He wasn't a show-off,'' Cresci said of Joe. ``We
were so proud he went to the Yankees from San Francisco. All those
aspects of him, the way he crossed the plate, tipped his hat, they
meant so much.''
</P>
<P>
   These are people who lived through the Depression and war years
that transformed America, and they saw how their quiet friend
symbolized that transformation.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian-American kid from the neighborhood, the son of a
fisherman, became the nation's greatest sports hero, the very model
of a man, and married the most beautiful woman imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   There he goes.
</P>
<P>
   He's still here, though, even in the hearts of the young. No
wonder he was disturbed by that Paul Simon song.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers in their 20s, Nelson and Larry Yee, stood across
from the church wearing Yankee caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and grandfather worked in his restaurant,'' Nelson
Yee said. ``My father remembers going out to pick up some fish and
meat with him and Marilyn Monroe.''
</P>
<P>
   Yee said DiMaggio was his hero and model as a ballplayer. I
asked him if he thought it would be possible to have a DiMaggio in
baseball today. He said it might be possible at the high school or
college level, but not in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought an assurance to the game, a style to the game, that
is not compatible with today,'' Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   As the cortege pulled away to touch all the DiMaggio bases in
San Francisco, a single seagull circled the steeples of the church,
set in an improbably blue sky. This was North Beach, though, and
soon everyone took shelter from the sun in the neighborhood's
restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Pisa Restaurant, owner Dante Benedetti held court and
impromptu press briefings under a collection of pictures of his
friend Joe DiMaggio. He managed to come up with story after story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Williams came in one day and said, `The greatest hitter I
ever saw was Joe DiMaggio.''' Benedetti said. ``Williams said he
asked Joe what kind of pitch he likes to look for. Joe said,
`Anything in the strike zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the bar of the New Pisa, Roger Boschetti was showing friends
a photograph of himself with DiMaggio and a few other North Beach
ballplayers. It was taken in 1944 at Hickam Field in Hawaii, and
they were all in military uniforms just before playing a game
against a Navy team.
</P>
<P>
   How'd you like to be that Navy pitcher?
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fernandez and Melissa Metcalf were at the New Pisa
celebrating DiMaggio, even though they are thirtysomethings, far
too young to have seen him play. Metcalf, who works for the Giants'
catering department, said DiMaggio once signed a cast on her broken
leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a gentleman, a soft-spoken person, a man, a real
man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she spoke of him in the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   I sat at Ed Moose's restaurant with Boston Globe political
writer Marty Nolan. ``During DiMaggio's hitting streak in 1941, you
could go into any diner in East Lockjaw, Montana, and people would
say, `How'd he do today?''' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a time of dreadful prejudice against Italian-Americans,
and DiMaggio beat it. He even beat Red Sox fans' prejudice against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiMaggio was the only Yankee who was never booed at Fenway
Park,'' said Nolan, who went to every Red Sox-Yankees game he could
during the famous 1949 pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian kid from North Beach, a modest and elegant man,
became a hero to America as it grew to a maturity it doesn't have
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away. Our nation turns its
lonely eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   I never understood any of Paul Simon's lyrics until now.

TWO BARRELS OF MADCAP COCKNEY LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS 
Written and directed by: Guy Ritchie 
Starring: Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason
Statham, Steven Mackintosh, P.H. Moriarty, Lenny McLean, Vinnie
Jones, Sting 
Playing at: Nickelodeon; Harvard Square Cinema, Cambridge 
Running time: 106 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence, pervasive language, sexuality and drug
content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' is a Cockney crime farce
that hits the ground running and never stops. It tries a little too
hard to be hip, but it's pretty entertaining even if it doesn't
always achieve the heady lift it's after. Like so many gangster
capers from the British Isles, this one revels in the sheer
theatricality of its lowlifes. So do the lowlifes revel in their
own shtick. Half the time you feel they went into lawbreaking as an
entry into over-the-top show biz. The film is stolen, not by any of
its numerous leads, but by a pair of imposing athletes who play
hired muscle with such obvious enjoyment of their respective brands
of menace that it's hard not to share the fun you're convinced
they're having.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, big Lenny McLean, shaved head and all, died of
lung cancer shortly after the film was made. It's dedicated to the
former East End weightlifter and heavyweight bareknuckle boxing
champ. He plays a character whose way of dunking the heads of his
boss's debtors in water and not yanking them out until they're
almost drowned has earned him the nickname of Barry the Baptist.
You won't soon forget him, not so much because he's scary but
because he looks like a really nice bloke beneath all that beef.
Nor will you overlook footballer Vinny Jones as a scary-looking
enforcer named Big Chris whose specialty is digital removal _ he
takes off fingers until the debtor pays. He looks as tough and
unforgiving as the blade on a guillotine and takes his young son
along on collecting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The two enforcers work for a porn king and all-around sleaze
named Hatchet Harry (P.J. Moriarty), who's regarded as a target by
four young go-getters who ought to know better. ``Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels'' is a piece of whizbang clockwork set in
motion when Soap (Dexter Fletcher), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Tom
(Jason Flemyng) bankroll their pal Eddy (Nick Moran) and send him
in to run up their stake in a card game with Harry. But the game is
rigged. When he staggers out dazed, Nick is in hock for half a
million pounds and has only a week to raise it. Of course, Harry
has an ulterior motive. He wants to humiliate his old rival, Eddy's
dad (Sting in a nice turn), and he'll take the pub owned by the
latter in payment of Eddy's debt.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a lot of thieves stealing from thieves,
including a dimwit drug dealer, his lethal Jamaican supplier, and a
crooked fence. (Is there any other kind?). The two smoking barrels,
by the way, belong to an antique shotgun, which figures in a
burglary along the line. As it happens, greedy Harry also covets
the shotgun, which plants the seed for a full circle of mayhem,
which first-time director Guy Ritchie loses no time propelling
along. After a while the pace and complexity of the plot (Ritchie
directed his own screenplay _ good thing, since another director
might have had trouble untangling it) nudge characterization out of
the picture, diminishing our likelihood of involvement with the
four mates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't mean we can't enjoy them as the stakes and
danger escalate. Even they can see that they are less than criminal
masterminds, despite a history of successfully perpetrating a
string of petty scams. Increasingly, they rely on their youth,
improvisatory abilities and luck. Think of Damon Runyon on speed,
speaking with a thick Cockney accent, and you'll have the idea
here. After a while the convolutions become an end in themselves
and take over. But there's lots of hurtle, hustle, humor, and color
here. No British crime caper has ever been a wilder or more
high-velocity, high-energy ride.

NCAA RULING SENDS RAZORBACK COACH TO CLOUD NINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ Nolan Richardson got the news from a newspaper
reporter. Which should not, under any circumstances, be mistaken
for Richardson getting the news from reading a newspaper. We need
to be clear on this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't read nothing,'' Richardson said. ``I don't read the
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Richardson doesn't read or listen to what outsiders might
say about him or the Arkansas Razorbacks' basketball program. He
just finds out about any slights _ real or imagined _ by osmosis.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it was early Tuesday morning, and a reporter from
Arkansas was asking about something nearer to Richardson's heart
than a first-round West Regional game against the Siena Saints. A
federal judge had made a ruling on Monday nullifying NCAA rules
that require a minimum score of 820 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
for incoming athletes to be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 16, the judge decreed, violated civil rights laws
because they have ``an unjustified disparate impact against
African-Americans.'' Richardson has been saying the same thing _ in
saltier language _ for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old heart started pumping,'' Richardson said, his voice
taking on an evangelical flavor. ``I looked up at the Man upstairs
and said, `Thank you, Lord. Somebody up there woke up.' I'm walking
around on Cloud Nine, and I haven't played a game yet. My guys
don't know me today. I'm just a hound dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy right now, I don't know what the hell to do. I'm
as happy as happy can be. Now, write about that: Nolan's happy.
He's not an (expletive) this week.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994 NCAA Tournament, Richardson displayed a brand of
insufferability rarely witnessed on American soil. That was no
small feat, because the Razorbacks were on the way to winning the
national championship. By the time the Razorbacks cut down the
nets, Richardson had made the short list of coaches you'd least
like to run into without earplugs or an accessible exit.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 57, railed on and on about the injustice of it all,
with or without provocation. Even seemingly innocuous questions
about Arkansas players triggered bitter tirades about academic
standards designed to raise the bar for incoming freshmen.
Richardson was so relentless with his bully pulpit, he took away
from the attention that his players deserved for their performance
on the court.
</P>
<P>
   And what a team it was. The Razorbacks went 31-3 with their
``Forty Minutes of Hell'' mission. A team deeper than the musings
of Jack Handey wore down the opposition. Almost as much as
Richardson wore out anybody within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time in '94, I was angry personally,'' Richardson
said. ``I was angry, but I had a reason to be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson won three national coach of the year awards in '94.
The Razorbacks made it to the championship game in '95. Richardson
was still angry, still bitter, and he wore it on his sleeve. He
complained about not getting respect for his coaching ability. He
complained that black coaches never got enough credit for their
intelligence. He complained that a black coach's success invariably
was attributed to motivational skills, or recruiting great talent.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Richardson doesn't read newspapers or the
inscriptions on national coaching awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's perception of Nolan Richardson had changed,
because I was going through a national championship,'' Richardson
said. ``That wasn't the thing that was affecting me. It was
affecting me because you were taking opportunities from youngsters,
which is my livelihood. And particularly black kids. That's wrong.
That's why I was adamant about 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back over it now, to think what has happened with
one judge's ruling, it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Proposition 16 guidelines, students scoring less than
820 (out of 1,600) on the SAT or 66 (out of 120) on the American
College Test could not compete as freshmen. The national average in
the SAT is 1,017. The judge seems to be making a crusade for
watered-down standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love standards,'' Richardson said. ``But you've got to make
the standards fair. Education is always going to be _ hopefully _
for the poor also. If you don't fix what's broke at the bottom and
you try to fix it at the top, you're going to destroy what's at the
bottom. It must be fixed at the bottom: K through 12. Not the
colleges. If you fix up here and they don't fix it down there, then
what have you got?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I call, `Free at last.' I have told the NCAA,
`Rule out freshman. That solves all problems.' If they don't pass
it, you've given them the opportunity. Money? But look at what
you're making.' No, nobody wants to do that. That's all you have to
do. When I was in school, freshmen couldn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was a freshman in an era before shot clocks and
three-point lines and widespread integration. He graduated from
college in 1963 _ three years before his alma mater, Texas Western
(now the University of Texas at El Paso) defeated an all-white
Kentucky team in the NCAA title game. He began his coaching school
at the high school ranks in El Paso, where a middle school since
has been named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old-fashioned coach, I guess,'' Richardson said.
``Those days are ending, because everybody's leaving. The young
days, they pat 'em on the back, kiss 'em on the butt and tell 'em
how great they are. I don't do a whole lot of that. Not until the
season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten years of dues-paying at the high school level led to a gig
at Western Texas Junior College. He used seasons of 29-9, 35-5 and
37-0 as a spring board to Tulsa, Okla., which led him to the big
time. The only losing season of Richardson's college coaching
career was his first one at Arkansas (12-16 in 1985-86). Four years
later, he had the Razorbacks in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   His career Division I winning percentage of .734 (455-165) is
the seventh-highest among active coaches. He shouldn't be defensive
about his credentials as a coach, yet he still looks over his
shoulder as if a posse could be on the way any minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that I'm at the end of a mediocre career,''
Richardson said. ``I call the old guys `the cowboys.' They're all
dying out. Used to be, you'd shake a guy's hand, and it meant
something. You shake a guy's hand today and see how much it means.
In the old days, they'd walk up and say, `You've got a four-year
deal,' shake your hand, and nobody worried. You'd go about your
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to have a lawyer. We've got to have an agent.
We've got to have everything. Because let me tell you something:
They forget real soon. `I don't remember that. Did I say that?' All
they have to do with somebody is pull one of their chains, and
you're gone. Did you know that? You're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Richardson smiled. He's so happy, he doesn't know what to
do with himself. ``Can I go to practice?'' he asked. Oh, that's
right: The Razorbacks have an NCAA Tournament game to play.

ORBISON SPECIAL CAPTURES HIS SOULFUL GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ROY ORBISON ANTHOLOGY 
PBS documentary produced by Barbara Orbison Productions 
When: Sunday, March 14, 9-10 p.m. 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's arguable, of course, but a very good case can be made that
Roy Orbison had the most perfect male voice in pop music. And, that
in the songs he sang and co-wrote _ ``Crying,'' ``It's Over,''
``Only the Lonely'' among them _ he conveyed the depths of emotion
that few pop songs get near. You might consider Orbison the polar
opposite of the young Elvis Presley. Elvis was cocky,
self-possessed; he swaggered. Orbison stood immobile, seemingly
stoic, singing soulful songs of heartbreaking vulnerability and
pathos. Mid-tempo rockers like ``Oh Pretty Woman'' were fun, but
the dramatic ballads are where Orbison's talents really shined.
</P>
<P>
   Orbison's work was done too soon. He died at age 52 from a
massive heart attack on Dec. 6, 1988, just days after two sold-out
Boston gigs at the defunct Channel. Earlier that year, he'd seen a
career renaissance via his role in the Traveling Wilburys with Bob
Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne. Orbison's
comeback solo album, a stellar work called ``Mystery Girl,'' was
just about to be released. When it was put out, it became the
biggest-selling album of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at 9 p.m., WGBH-Ch. 2 airs the ``Roy Orbison Anthology,''
an hourlong special that features Orbison performances from 1960 to
1988 and many interviews with artists who loved and have been
influenced by him. The show is well put together, a satisfying mix
of rare black-and-white clips from the early days and takes from
his latter period. If the musicians who discuss Orbison sound as if
they're gushing, well, maybe they are, but their feelings are
genuine, not just the usual celebrity/tribute yak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made emotion fashionable. . . . It was all right for men to
sing about very emotional things,'' says the Bee Gees' Robin Gibb.
</P>
<P>
   U2's Bono echoes that theme, praising Orbison's luminous
falsetto, and noting that it ``leaves you wide open as a man.''
Orbison was born with the voice, Bono says, ``but in the end
there's another voice that has to overpower that, to touch the
human spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Yoakam speaks of Orbison's voice as a ``fingerprint,''
and that voice opened the door for the journey. Elton John's
musical collaborator, Bernie Taupin, says, ``To me, it was the
voice of God.'' K. d. lang, who dueted with Orbison on a remake of
``Crying,'' found an ``extrapolation of goodness'' in his music.
</P>
<P>
   Orbison hit his first creative and commercial peak in the late
1950s and early 1960s, and then again in the mid-late 1980s. He
dressed in black, wore dark sunglasses, and had a magical aura, as
if he possessed secrets that he was about to share with an
audience. He barely seemed to open his mouth when he sang, but when
he did a majestic, operatic sound came out. He knew heartbreak and
solitude, fear and yearning. He knew how to scale mountains. He
knew how to bond with an audience that spanned generations. He was
the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The producer of the PBS documentary is Orbison's widow, Barbara,
who met the singer in 1968 at one of his shows in Germany. Barbara
Wellhoener was 17, he 32. Age gap aside, they clicked and were
married within six months. She became his manager in 1985 and
helped steer his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is the curator of his legacy, running Barbara Orbison
Productions. In addition to working on the ``Roy Orbison
Anthology'' for PBS, she's planning a boxed set, an ``authorized
bootleg'' four-CD collection, and two live discs, one from the
``Austin City Limits'' show and the other ``Live at the BBC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my role was given to me by Roy,'' she says, from her
Nashville home. ``To look after the bodies of work he's left
behind. He was specific that I could hire anybody I wanted to help
me. I have a really fine staff around me and I stay involved by
checking in. We run it as a business that has its own integrity and
sense of quality. We get together and ask what projects we want to
do and should we do it. `Would Roy want it?' It's all about Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   Orbison had no premonition of his death. ``It came out of the
clear blue,'' his widow says. ``There were no signs. He was pretty
invincible.'' He always liked keeping things in order and saw to it
to advise her on both musical and business matters in case of his
death. This process began, she says, when they were first married.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really wise man,'' Barbara says. Roy Orbison knew how
capricious fate could be, how quickly tragedy could strike. His
first wife, Claudette, died in a 1966 motorcycle accident; two sons
died in a fire a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Was Orbison, the person, as lonely as Orbison the singer often
sounded?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess at times he must have known what it felt to be
alone,'' says Barbara. ``I don't know about lonely, because I never
saw him lonely. Or bored. He was his own best company in a way. He
always had something to do _ his workshop, reading, painting. Every
day he started basically like a kid. He was so polite and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was human and had human baggage to carry,'' adds Barbara.
``He had his dark side, but what was so wonderful about Roy was the
way he treated you. In those 20 years, from the first time he tried
to take me out _ and you know how guys can be really wonderful when
they want to take someone out _ to the last time he called me, nine
hours before he died, Roy treated me the same.'' She says she can
count the spats they had on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Orbison always sang his songs seriously. There wasn't a feeling
of wistful nostalgia. When he sang, Barbara says, he was always in
the moment. ``All of his songs,'' she says, ``he would have told
you, `I have to sing each song like it was the first time, and
that's good for me.' '' In his last interview, with the Globe a
week before his death, Orbison said that by having cowritten most
of the songs, he felt a deeper investment. ``The songs come from
deep within,'' he said, ``and then you treat them as an artist with
that much respect. I couldn't hardly cheat myself and not do the
best I could. . . . My voice is a gift; my talent is a gift; the
opportunity for the journey is a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Orbison says she doesn't feel cheated by her husband's
death and its cruel timing. She says she's grateful he completed
``Mystery Girl,'' that she and he talked at length hours before he
died. She says she feels Orbison, who was born again as a Christian
three years before his death, is in heaven: ``I'm at ease that Roy
is in the place he needs to be.''

DOW BUOYS THE BULLS AS BEARS AWAIT JUDGMENT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With trillions of dollars at stake, Wall Street
pros and investors are trying to divine how high the resilient Dow
will fly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Dow Jones industrial average has wobbled
like a drunkard. It fell below 8,000 in October but has bounced
back with a vengeance, edging toward the 10,000 mark on Thursday
and Friday before backing off.
</P>
<P>
   When will the index, which tracks the stocks of 30 blue-chip
companies, hit the 10,000 ... or 11,000 ... or 12,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling _ this market keeps powering ahead,'' said
Art Micheletti, chief investment strategist at Bailard, Biel &AMP;
Kaiser, an investment company in San Mateo, Calif. ``And the
momentum clearly favors the market going even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Acampora, a raging bull who is the director of technical
research at Prudential Securities, thinks the Dow will reach 11,500
by the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Barton Biggs, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, is less optimistic. He told CNBC Thursday that domestic
stocks are not poised ``for a new leg of this bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether bearish or bullish, the analysts say many key economic
signs still look good. Productivity and employment are up.
Inflation is down. And the Federal Reserve hasn't jacked up
interest rates, which would cool the economy and hurt stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the best of all worlds,'' Bellero said. ``As long we
have strong economic growth with no inflation, financial assets
will grow to extraordinary levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of telecommunications, the Internet and other
wireless technologies should keep the economy surging well into the
next century, Bellero predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't begun to tap the surface yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellero and others preached caution, though. Like a rabid beast,
the market could turn on investors any day and bloody their
favorite stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very nervous about this market _ it keeps defying
gravity,'' Micheletti said. ``Even if you believe we're in a new
era of technology, there have got to be some limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears warn the boom market is at the brink of a long-term
correction or a catastrophic crash.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is rampant, they argue. Stocks on the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index are dangerously overvalued, trading at 30 times
earnings. Worse, the market is too narrow and concentrated, with
investors pouring too much money into too few good stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing extremes here,'' said Joe Turner, a partner at
Pring Turner Capital Corp. in San Ramon, Calif. ``We're advising
our clients to be a little defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a longtime Wall Street veteran, recalled the hoopla when
the Dow flirted with 1,000 in 1968. It was not until Nov. 14, 1972
that it actually closed above 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the temperamental Dow could easily drop to the low-
or mid-8,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go from love to hatred of the market very quickly,'' he
said.

the left wing from Dorchester, Mass., back wearing No. 19 for the
US women's national ice hockey team in the Women's World
Championships. ``It's a new year. What happened in the past, I
can't change that. You've just got to look through the windshield
and not the rearview mirror in any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Any of this. A simple phrase, shorthand for more shock, more
sadness than most 27-year-olds see in twice that many years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, O'Sullivan's father, John, died of lymph cancer; two
years later her mother, Ann, was claimed by brain cancer. The 11
O'Sullivan children _ including middle child Stephanie and younger
brother Chris, who plays for the Calgary Flames of the NHL _ banded
together under the eldest, Shaun, to stay in the family home on
Elmer Road. But the sad fact remained: Before she was 20 years old,
O'Sullivan had lost both parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go through phases sometimes when I was angry,'' she
recalled late in 1997, chatting one night during the 28-game tour
that would end in the selection of the 1998 Olympic team. ``The
healing process never ends. You can't bottle it all up; you can't
stop living.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan had no idea she would soon be reliving those words,
retracing those emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Having graduated from Providence College in 1995 as the school's
all-time scorer and assist leader, ahead of even Olympic captain
Cammi Granato, O'Sullivan was considered a lock to make the Olympic
team. After all, she had notched 10 goals and 11 assists in 22
games of the tour, and had considerable international experience as
a veteran of four national teams.
</P>
<P>
   But when the final Olympic roster was announced Dec. 20,
O'Sullivan's name wasn't on it. One of the last three cuts, along
with fellow veterans Erin Whitten and Kelly O'Leary of Auburn,
Mass., she was stunned and confused. And angry.
</P>
<P>
   She just got beat out, coach Ben Smith told reporters that
night. It wasn't an easy decision. ``Some of the younger players
are pushing their way to the forefront,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of declining to talk publicly about her
disappointment, O'Sullivan finally agreed to be interviewed by
Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy on the eve of the Olympics.
O'Sullivan lashed out, saying her exclusion was a mystery that had
nothing to do with either her performance or her attitude and
declaring that Smith had put himself above the team and the country
in making his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can never be justified,'' she said before she left for an
extended vacation in Florida and the Caribbean, where she did not
watch the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Few denied O'Sullivan was entitled to her feelings _ she said
this week that trying to explain what it felt like to be cut from
the team is a lot like trying to explain what it felt like to lose
both parents as a teenager, how no one who hasn't been through
either experience can ever understand _ but some feared her
bluntness might destroy any chance of coming back to the national
team. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Smith this week. ``It kind of goes with the
territory; teachers and coaches get blamed for a lot of things. We
were obviously trying to make decisions in the best interest of our
team. Some individuals are not always going to see that right away,
maybe ever. But she's had time, and she's reflected upon it. It's a
credit to her tenacity that she's still going hard at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's reaction didn't surprise Shaun O'Sullivan. ``Coach Smith
has been through the ranks, too,'' said Stephanie's oldest brother,
34, who played hockey at Northeastern. ``He appreciates people who
have guts, who want to play, instead of just fading off into the
sunset. It tells a lot about people, what they go through and what
they conquer along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan says she doesn't regret speaking out, but says: ``You
can't blame others. Maybe I wasn't that articulate. Maybe it did
come out negative. (But) after everything I've gone through,
negativity doesn't play a part. A lot of people read it and said,
`You don't get along with Coach Smith.' I love Coach Smith. He's a
great coach and he's always been good to me, but he has a job to
do. It had to be somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she found out she was left off the Olympic team,
O'Sullivan said, she knew she would bury that grape tendril; it was
just a matter of how to go about it. Evaluating her life, she broke
things down like an outline for a book: What she could do to
improve on the ice, what she should work on off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the cancer unit at Children's Hospital was one step:
``It really puts life in perspective. I'm lucky to be happy and
healthy, and not a 5-year-old with my final days approaching me.
There are no limits. I can get better, I can do better, I can work
harder. I don't know if I knew I'd ever get the chance but I knew I
would work hard to get that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Actively heeding some advice from Smith was another step. Smith
had told her she needed to work on moving her feet, so O'Sullivan
practiced and scrimmaged four or five times a week with a men's
team of 18-to-20-year-olds, the Bay State Breakers, in Walpole. Not
only has it improved her footwork, she said she makes quicker
decisions at full speed on the ice. She said, ``I've got to be
skilled, crafty, smart'' to keep from getting flattened in the
men's games, where checking is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   So at this stage of the healing process, O'Sullivan is back
living the life of a national-team player, a life she first tasted
in 1994 and loves. ``It's great to be back with everybody,'' she
said. ``I just want to work hard, contribute, be a team player.''
As for the Olympic gold medal 11 of her teammates have, she added,
``I'm real happy for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If, in turn, any of her teammates harbor any discomfort with
her, it has not been apparent. Said Granato, a teammate of
O'Sullivan since their days at Providence, ``You worry, have you
lost a friend? (But) to Stephanie's credit, she really did a great
job from the beginning to say hi to everybody, make contact. That
barrier came down. I'm happy for her.''
</P>
<P>
   And, added Granato with a big grin, ``When she gets in front of
the net she just hunts that puck down.'' In the three games played
so far, O'Sullivan has a goal and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   When she returns to Boston next week, O'Sullivan will resume her
other life: playing with the Breakers; conducting year-round
clinics and a summer hockey camp with Chris; working 20 hours a
week with the Police Athletic League, helping put together youth
sports programs to help keep city kids out of trouble. She will
unpack her bags back on the family home on Elmer Road, virtually
empty now with just brothers Shaun, Peter, and David (the youngest,
now a senior at Thayer Academy who hopes to play baseball in
college) living there now as siblings Michael, Mark, Tom, Ann,
Chris, Denise, and Julie have left for either college or careers.
She will think about someday becoming a Boston police officer. (``I
love the action,'' she said. ``You're always on the go, especially
in the city.'') She will do her laundry, which has been piling up
on this journey from Lake Placid to Toronto to Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   And she will look ahead to 2002 and the Olympic Games. ``That's
what I'm aiming for,'' she said. ``It's never left my mind. But
there's a lot of hockey to be played between now and then.''

IT'S ALL ON THE LINE FOR LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lennox Lewis has boxed for 21 years, ever since he
was steered into a gym in Kitchener, Ontario, at age 12 by one of
his teachers shortly after the teacher, for the third time, had to
pry Lewis off a schoolmate who unwisely made fun of Lewis's harsh
cockney accent.
</P>
<P>
   In all those years he won nearly every significant amateur
title, including an Olympic gold medal in 1988, two world
heavyweight championships, and 34 of his 35 fights since turning
professional in 1989. He has rendered 27 of his 35 opponents
unconscious and has not lost a match in nearly five years. So what
has he got to prove?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, everything.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all he has done, Lennox Lewis has never done enough to
convince the boxing public that he is who he says he is, which
happens to be ``the best fighter on the planet.'' Normally, two
heavyweight titles and an Olympic gold medal would be enough to
inflate one's resume significantly but there have always been
lingering doubts about the massive Brit, doubts about his chin,
doubts about his ability, and, most of all, doubts that the enigma
he seems to be is just a sullen mask hiding the fact that he is
little more than a product of careful matchmaking and a down time
in the heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   None of that may be true, but in 10 years as a professional
Lewis has never faced the kind of competition that could dispel
those doubts and too often he has looked unimpressive enough
against lesser opponents to make even his staunchest supporters
wonder about him. Not once in all those years has he been in what
promoters like to call a super fight. But he will be when he climbs
into the ring at Madison Square Garden with a heavy burden on his
broad shoulders as he tries to unify the heavyweight title for the
first time since 1992 at the expense of Evander Holyfield, the
aging conquerer of Mike Tyson, Riddick Bowe, George Foreman,
Michael Moorer, and Ray Mercer, among others.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult enough to try to win the heavyweight title at
Holyfield's expense for he is a warrior of legendary proportions
whether he is winning a fight or losing it. Yet Lewis must face not
only that but the sure knowledge that if he cannot win this one
fight all his other victories will be dismissed and he will slip to
the outer fringes of his sport, joining a long list of British
heavyweights found wanting when their moment came.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years now Lewis has insisted all the top heavyweights have
ducked him out of fearful respect for his clubbing right hand. He
has apparently convinced himself this is true and, for a time, he
even included Holyfield on that list, an absurdity if judged by
Holyfield's track record of facing every top fighter of his day
that made Lewis's previous arguments about others seem equally
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night his moment will finally come. After a
lifetime of boxing, Lewis will find out what it means to be in a
fight. Even his trainer, the legendary Emanuel Steward, has made
clear for weeks now the significance of the voyage Lewis is about
to embark upon, stating that ``Lennox's whole career will be
defined by this one fight. He's going to have to live the rest of
his life on this performance.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an unfair burden for any man to carry into a boxing
ring, but Lewis must tote it because his resume is littered only
with heavyweight remnants such as Zeljko Mavrovic, Henry Akinwande,
Shannon Briggs (who nearly knocked him out in the first round last
year), Oliver McCall (who did so with one right hand to the chin in
1994), Tony Tucker, and a broken Razor Ruddock.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best fighter Lewis has faced is countryman Frank
Bruno, who was a longstanding member of Britain's Horizontal
Heavyweights Club himself before he had Lewis in significant
trouble only to be knocked senseless by one powerful Lewis right
hand in the seventh round of their 1993 outdoor encounter in the
rain at Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lewis faces the possibility of joining that 100-year-old
list of burly British bombers who have come to the United States
seeking the heavyweight championship and left broken men. England
has grown used to this, yet each time it produces a new
heavyweight, Englishmen pray fervently that he is what Holyfield
has long been called: ``The Real Deal.'' If Lewis is not a first
cousin to Joe Bugner and Brian London and Tommy Farr and Terry
Daniels and so many of their predecessors, he will have his chance
to prove it on the biggest and most storied stage in boxing, in the
same building where Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier fought their
titanic struggle in 1971 for the same title Lewis and Holyfield
will battle for.
</P>
<P>
   There is a mystique to this fight that is different than
Ali-Frazier however and Lewis is most responsible for it because
despite a 4- to 5-inch height advantage and 30-odd pound weight
advantage, nobody knows what he will do when he gets in against
Holyfield, even a Holyfield who may well be used up himself after
too many years of heavyweight wars against men far bigger than he
is.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steward, Lewis's loyal aide de camp, admitted, ``We may not
know how much Holyfield has left but we know he'll bring all he
has. We know he'll come to fight. Lennox hasn't been in a situation
like this so until he is you can't say for sure how he'll react.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to fight the fight of his life but it's
very frustrating for a trainer who's used to having a Thomas Hearns
or an Aaron Pryor, who you know is going to fight. Lennox is a
different kind of fighter. A strange kind of fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he fights up to his potential, he's too big and powerful
for this guy. I just hope he's not coming in there with his chess
board. I hate that crap. Too much thinking. You've got to be
instinctive in boxing. He can't hesitate and think, like a chess
player. Lennox has to let his missles fly.

TAKE REVENGE: SKIP THE `CARRIE' SEQUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE RAGE _ CARRIE 2 
Directed by: Katt Shea 
Screenplay by: Rafael Moreu 
Starring: Emily Bergl, Jason London, Amy Irving, Dylan Bruno, J.
Smith-Cameron, Zachary Ty Bryan, Justin Urich, Elijah Craig, Rachel
Blanchard, Charlotte Ayanna, Mena Suvari, Steven Ford 
Playing at: Copley Place; suburbs 
Running time: 104 minutes 
Rated: R (strong graphic horror violence and gore, brief strong
sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an awful lot of red in the ``Carrie'' sequel, ``The Rage
_ Carrie 2.'' Red paint on a brush, red paint on the walls, red
dress on the heroine, red in the name of the production company,
Red Bank Films. When Emily Bergl, as the new Carrie, checks her
makeup (red again) in the mirror before heading off to dish out
some good old telekinetic teen payback, you find yourself checking
the press notes to see if maybe you didn't misread the new film's
title. Are we in fact watching ``The Rouge _ Carrie 2'' and not
``The Rage _ Carrie 2''?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the people behind this new piece of campy
inanity deserve to have red faces. Teen horror movies depend
largely on teens being stupid. Slasher movies require teens to go
for midnight walks where they know serial killers lurk. And
``Carrie 2'' requires its teens to get the new Carrie angry, even
though they know Sissy Spacek's Carrie reduced their school, to say
nothing of most of her classmates, to rubble. Actually, Bergl's
character isn't called Carrie. Her name is Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   She's Carrie's sister, but she's made of sturdier stuff than
Carrie. She's tougher and has better defenses. But she also has the
same telekinetic genes. The only one who knows it is Amy Irving,
who made her film debut as the only survivor in the original and
now returns as a worrywart guidance counselor trying to head off a
repeat performance. She doesn't like it when Rachel is called to
her office and the coffee cup on her desk starts to move. One is
tempted to add she's being punished belatedly for being among the
original Carrie's tormentors, as we're reminded when Rachel flashes
back to the first film's less than immortal tampons-in-the-shower
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is a bunch of neanderthal jocks who turn dates
into rapes, then humiliate the girls by dumping them and letting
them know they're just pawns in an ongoing competitive game in
which the guys keep score in a well-thumbed notebook. There's one
exception to the football scuzzballs, Jason London's sensitive
receiver, who catches Rachel's attention by knowing what ``Romeo
and Juliet'' is actually about. Rachel is doubly wary because her
best friend just committed suicide after being used as a sex object
by one of the jocks.
</P>
<P>
   There's a strength in Bergl's Rachel that was lacking in
Spacek's Carrie. But that film, let's face it, was about Carrie's
revenge and this one is about Rachel's revenge, exacted at a
post-football-game party in the kind of glass house whose
inhabitants should know better than to throw stones, especially
psychic stones designed to hurt and humiliate Rachel, who had let
her guard down in the belief that the sensitive footballer could be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Bergl, making her film debut, is a strong presence. Like so many
girls stigmatized as weird in teen movies, she's bright-eyed, cute
as a button, and projects presence and authority, even when she's
mouthing stupid lines. Through sheer force of will, she
occasionally convinces us there's something going on inside Rachel.
I'm sure it won't be long before we'll have the pleasure of
watching her take on material that isn't so resolutely
self-defeating. ``The Rage _ Carrie 2'' isn't so much a sequel to
``Carrie'' as a labored attempt to simply do it all over again. It
remembers the blood, but not much else about the characterizations
that made the original what it was.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS FRET AS GORE LAGS REPUBLICANS IN POLLS
 &HT;    700&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, in his nearly unencumbered
dash to the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination, has some party
faithful worried about his weak showing in head-to-head polling
against leading Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll completed in recent weeks showed Gore
trailing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in a hypothetical matchup by
18 points, and trailing Elizabeth Dole by eight points. Several
other recent polls show the same pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and his top advisers have dismissed the
polling results as meaningless _ a reasonable assessment given that
the first presidential voting is still nearly a year away.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore prepares to make his first trips to New Hampshire
and Iowa as a candidate Monday, Democratic tongues are wagging.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``may not be the party's best choice,'' New York Democratic
Chair Judith Hope said last week on Northeast Public Radio. ``While
I have high regard for Vice President Gore, I think we do need to
be mindful that in the past (vice presidents running for president)
have not produced victories for the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll numbers also have given Bill Bradley, Gore's only
opponent for the nomination, an opportunity to present himself as
the candidate who can beat Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley, a former
senator from New Jersey, said during a trip to Missouri last week.
``I think I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, widely regarded as a long shot for the nomination, has
the luxury of not having been matched up against Bush in a trial
heat. Gore, on the other hand, has been paired against Bush since
the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, published Friday by the Wall Street Journal and
NBC News, showed Bush leading Gore 52 percent to 34 percent. More
important, among independent voters, who are likely to tip the
electoral scale in next year's general election, Bush led Gore 49
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls are simply predictions of the future, in this case of an
election that's years away,'' Gore told CNN last week. ``And you
know the old saying that six months is a lifetime in politics. That
means there are four lifetimes between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said Bush's strong showing against
Gore is due to ``the Eisenhower effect'' _ the fact that the Texas
governor has never had to ``call a ball or a strike on the federal
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore advisers compare the vice president's current standing
in the polls to former Vice President George Bush in 1988, noting
that Bush too trailed several Democratic contenders a year before
the primaries, but eventually won the nomination and the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Pew analysis, Gore's favorability ratings
today are significantly below those of Vice President Bush at the
comparable point in the Reagan administration _ 58 percent compared
to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore's poor polling performances are occurring in what
should be a favorable political environment: President Clinton has
a 64 percent approval rating and the Democratic Party has a better
national image than the Republicans, 58 to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's position ``may have more to do with his own image
problems,'' according to an analysis this month by the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore is unburdened by the character questions that have
haunted Clinton, he also lacks the president's charisma and
personal touch. And there is some sentiment that he is an
environmental extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists suggested the polling data could prod
Gore out of Clinton's shadow sooner than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice presidents are always in the shadow of a president,''
said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who is not part of the
Gore campaign. ``It takes some time for them to emerge in their own
image and strengthen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, a longtime political adviser to Clinton, said,
``Clinton is not going to be a plus for Gore, ... so Gore needs to
stop being vice president and be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Staying the course can win the nomination, Morris added, but not
necessarily a general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew analysis found that in six open Republican contests
since 1960, the early poll front-runner has held on to win the
nomination five times, while in six open Democratic contests, the
early leader has won the nomination just once _ and in that
instance, former Vice President Walter Mondale led the Democratic
Party to one of the biggest landslide defeats in history in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us that one of these guys is not going to be the
nominee of their party,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who
is working for a Bush rival, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.

</P>
<P>
   Bradley, widely regarded as a long shot for the nomination, has
the luxury of not having been matched up against Bush in a trial
heat. Gore, on the other hand, has been paired against Bush since
the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, published Friday by the Wall Street Journal and
NBC News, showed Bush leading Gore 52 percent to 34 percent. More
important, among independent voters, who are likely to tip the
electoral scale in next year's general election, Bush led Gore 49
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls are simply predictions of the future, in this case of an
election that's years away,'' Gore told CNN last week. ``And you
know the old saying that six months is a lifetime in politics. That
means there are four lifetimes between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said Bush's strong showing against
Gore is due to ``the Eisenhower effect'' _ the fact that the Texas
governor has never had to ``call a ball or a strike on the federal
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore advisers compare the vice president's current standing
in the polls to former Vice President George Bush in 1988, noting
that Bush too trailed several Democratic contenders a year before
the primaries, but eventually won the nomination and the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Pew analysis, Gore's favorability ratings
today are significantly below those of Vice President Bush at the
comparable point in the Reagan administration _ 58 percent compared
to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore's poor polling performances are occurring in what
should be a favorable political environment: President Clinton has
a 64 percent approval rating and the Democratic Party has a better
national image than the Republicans, 58 to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's position ``may have more to do with his own image
problems,'' according to an analysis this month by the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore is unburdened by the character questions that have
haunted Clinton, he also lacks the president's charisma and
personal touch. And there is some sentiment that he is an
environmental extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists suggested the polling data could prod
Gore out of Clinton's shadow sooner than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice presidents are always in the shadow of a president,''
said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who is not part of the
Gore campaign. ``It takes some time for them to emerge in their own
image and strengthen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, a longtime political adviser to Clinton, said,
``Clinton is not going to be a plus for Gore, ... so Gore needs to
stop being vice president and be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Staying the course can win the nomination, Morris added, but not
necessarily a general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew analysis found that in six open Republican contests
since 1960, the early poll front-runner has held on to win the
nomination five times, while in six open Democratic contests, the
early leader has won the nomination just once _ and in that
instance, former Vice President Walter Mondale led the Democratic
Party to one of the biggest landslide defeats in history in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us that one of these guys is not going to be the
nominee of their party,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who
is working for a Bush rival, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.

`TELLING YOU' NEVER FINDS ITS WAY 
</HEADLINE>

TELLING YOU 
Directed by: Robert DeFranco 
Written by: Robert DeFranco and Marc Palmieri 
Starring: Peter Facinelli, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Dash Minok, Robert
DeFranco, Andy Berman, Richard Libertini, Matthew Lillardall 
Running time: 94 minutes 
Rated: R (adult language and sitautions) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Fazzulo and Dennis Nolan are the executive chefs at
Lombardo's, a tony Italian restaurant that is all the rage in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's not exactly true. Phil and Dennis are really the
guys flipping the dough and keeping the napkin holders full at
Lombardo's, the local pizza joint in their hometown. There would be
nothing wrong with this, except that both are recent college grads
who have somehow gotten sidetracked on their path to success and
glory. How these high school buddies wound up selling slices _ are
they victims of a bad economy or bad judgment? _ is never explained
in ``Telling You,'' a wobbly first feature by Robert DeFranco, who
also co-wrote the script with Marc Palmieri. Both are Sudbury
natives.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been a comic examination of dreams deferred,
sort of ``The Little Chill'' for 20-something college grads
discovering what their elders have told them all along _ adulthood
just isn't all it's cracked up to be. But the writers don't know
what story they want to tell, and in the end, they don't say a
whole lot about anything.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though the main characters _ Peter Facinelli's
pretty-boy slug, Phil, and Dash Mihok's hangdog Dennis _ can't
still make something of themselves. These aren't really wasted
lives, although they could get there; these guys just seem
derailed. It's certainly an embarrassment for both of them. If a
familiar face _ such as the Phil-obssessed Deb (Jennifer Love
Hewitt) _ enters the restaurant, they'll duck behind the counter to
avoid explaining how two hotshots wound up working in a pizza
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis seems particularly troubled by this; his young life
already seems a series of missed opportunities, beginning with his
reluctance to hook up with the girl of his dreams, Kristen (Gina
Philips). He fantasizes about what he could have done differently,
but hey, maybe a better idea would be finding a real j-o-b.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Phil and Dennis hang out with their knucklehead buddies,
John (Gary Wolf), Howard (Andy Berman), and Steve (writer-director
DeFranco), whose lives are also in limbo. They sit around playing
video games, drinking beer, and waxing stupid about whether
Superman would be more effective on the offensive or defensive end
in football. It's the kind of mindless guyspeak that has been
written with more flair and spark in films from ``Tin Men'' to
``Stand by Me'' to ``Clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also two uninteresting subplots about missing
restaurant funds and a vagrant (Richard Libertini) who may have
life lessons for Dennis wrapped in a windy story about his
seafaring days. DeFranco and Palmieri would have served their
actors better if they had stuck with Phil and Dennis's dilemma, not
that they make much hay with it. They fail to flesh out these
characters beyond caricatures so there's never a deeper
understanding or compassion for the dreary state in which they
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The movie almost finds its way in a scene when the guys run into
an obnoxious former classmate (Matthew Lillard), who's doing a lot
better than they are. The friends grow quiet, looking away from
their own lives, as much as from this drunken braggart. But the
screenwriters simply don't trust themselves enough to stick with
and develop what is clearly the most genuine moment in their film.

HIT REVIVALS SEND A MESSAGE TO BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Serious American theater has made it back to Broadway
in a big way this year with three sizzling productions. That all of
them were written before 1949 shouldn't obscure the fact that they
have much to say about how we live our lives in 1999. Nor should
they obscure what has happened to Broadway in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,''
Tennessee Williams's ``Not About Nightingales,'' and Eugene
O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' (which begins previews March 29 and
opens April 8, but is already an enormous hit) recalls a golden age
of Broadway, but it isn't nostalgia that's driving the box office.
At least not in the sense that nostalgia is often used _ a yearning
for the safe and the comforting. These three plays are as safe as
shaving with a switchblade and as comforting as a nightmare. Brian
Dennehy's powerful performance in ``Salesman'' and Kevin Spacey's
superb stint in ``Iceman'' brought those two plays to Broadway, but
that's only part of the story. That ``Salesman'' and
``Nightingales'' are getting rousing ovations (and ``Iceman'' is
almost sure to follow) are a testament to something else.
</P>
<P>
   Accessibility has become as dirty a word as nostalgia in many
circles, but for all the existential sturm und drang of ``Iceman''
and the multilevel causes of Willy Loman's disintegration in
``Salesman,'' you don't have to be a weatherman to know which way
the authorial winds are blowing in these plays.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the March issue of Harper's, Miller raises
important issues about what has kept serious new drama off Broadway
_ the millions of dollars it takes to mount a play necessitates
that it prove itself somewhere else (London for ``Iceman'' and
``Nightingales,'' Chicago for ``Salesman''). He also mentions that
a play can't survive a negative review in The New York Times, the
high cost of advertising, and the stratospheric cost of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But the main subject of his essay is the primary reason serious
plays have such a difficult time making it to Broadway _ the
changing aesthetic that came to dominate American theater,
beginning in the 1950s and progressing from there, an aesthetic
that became as alienating to a mass audience as the ticket prices
to many theatergoers. Miller blames critics as much as if not more
than playwrights:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Realism' is now a put-down; `poetic' is praise.
`Experimental' is attractive; `traditional' is not. `Metaphorical'
is intriguing, though perhaps not so much as `lyrical,'
`non-linear,' `dreamlike,' and `surreal.' It is almost as if
`realism' can hardly be poetic, or as if the `poetic' is not, at
its best, more real then the merely `realistic' and, at its worst,
more conventional beneath its elusive, or unfathomable skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightingales'' is basically a ``realistic'' play and
``Salesman'' is often interpreted as belonging in that tradition,
while ``The Iceman'' cometh from the more ``poetic'' Irish and
Irish-American genre. When considered together, however, what is
most impressive about them is, first, that there is no artificial
distinction between the real and the poetic. Perhaps more
important, that there is no real barrier to understanding the
plays. They are all good yarns. The artistry of the playwrights
makes them more than that, but they are basically understandable to
anyone without a degree in history, philosophy, or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller said in a 1996 Globe interview, ``Tennessee and I felt
that we wanted to embrace the big audience, we didn't want simply
to creep into the art audience. Tennessee's plays and mine,
different as they are, are addressed to anybody. You don't have to
know anything in particular. You don't have to juggle philosophic
concepts. They're not in any way arcane or difficult to grasp. They
can lead you somewhere that's intellectually interesting, but they
insist on meeting you on your terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Which shouldn't imply that either Miller or Williams were
dumbing down. ``Macbeth'' is not difficult to grasp, either. The
more one knows, the more one understands, certainly, which is true
of these three plays as well. ``Salesman'' _ appropriately at the
Eugene O'Neill Theatre _ is a perfect case in point. One of the
more amazing things about it is how much of the language has
entered the vernacular _ attention must be paid; riding on a smile
and a shoeshine; we're free and clear; I am not a dime a dozen! I
am Willy Loman! And 50 years later it has even more resonance in
terms of corporate mentality toward the disposability of the
individual. That the issue has grown over 50 years rather than
receded, and that it plays as well in communist China as in
America, are testaments to the play's universality as well as
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't what makes it a great play, though. The mediocre Hal
Holbrook version that played in Boston three years ago dealt with
those issues, but _ to go back to Miller's point _ eliminated all
the poetry. It never got beyond the purely political or purely
realistic. The Broadway production, imported from the Goodman
Theatre in Chicago, beautifully captures the play within Willy's
mind. A revolving stage keeps Willy's mind constantly veering from
the terrors of his current, disintegrating condition to the glories
and disappointments of the past.
</P>
<P>
   I was not as taken with Dennehy as most others have been.
(Elizabeth Franz all but steals the show as Mrs. Loman.) The
opening scene makes it seem as if it's going to be a towering Lee
J. Cobb-ish performance, but Dennehy and director Robert Falls use
the actor's bulk against him. Placing his fingers to his mouth and
cowering at confrontations show how scared Willy is at what's
happening to him, but it's an interpretation that invites some of
the analysis in The New York Times, reducing Willy to someone in
need of Prozac or in the early stages of Alzheimer's. If you come
away from ``Death of a Salesman'' with a biochemical rather than
sociopolitical or psychological analysis, something is wrong. On
the other hand, perhaps it's the particular genius of this play
that there is so much to talk about when it's over that one
shouldn't be surprised at bringing Willy's angst down to earth.
Miller lets you be as analytical as you want.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams, at 27, had not attained that level of
playwriting when ``Not About Nightingales'' was written in 1938.
Vanessa Redgrave unearthed the play, although she isn't in it.
``Nightingales,'' which deals with fascistic conditions in an
American prison, was not produced in Williams's lifetime. This is a
case in which a play was too accessible, not because it's instantly
graspable but because Williams hadn't yet found the balance between
realism and poetry that Miller mentions in Harper's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what we have here is definitely not a failure to
communicate. Trevor Nunn's direction for the combined Royal
National Theatre-Alley Theatre (of Houston)-Moving Theatre
production is spectacular, with prisoners marched through the
audience and Corin Redgrave (Vanessa's brother) as the charismatic
dictator of a warden serving to make the violence palpable.
Williams hadn't quite learned how to layer a play to make the
analogies with fascism more organic or to make the plight of the
prisoners more metaphysical. The second-half prison riot borders on
the laughable. Nevertheless, one can hear a great playwright's
voice begin to develop with a poetry that already lifts it above
agitprop thanks to the loving detail that Nunn, who's now head of
the National Theatre, and the Redgraves bring to ``Not About
Nightingales.''
</P>
<P>
   It often seems that the British hold all our playwrights in
higher regard than we do, although Williams and Miller seem to
enjoy a special place in their hearts. Perhaps it's because the
British theaters attract a wider audience that doesn't sneer at the
idea of accessibility. You'd think that a four-hour production of
``The Iceman Cometh'' would have people running out of theaters
instead of into them, but not the Almeida Theatre Company
production that's coming to New York. It's not fair to review the
production based on what I saw in London, but I can say that Spacey
lives up to all the hype. For that matter, so does O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright did not covet a mass audience the way Williams
and Miller did, and make no mistake about it, ``The Iceman Cometh''
is not ``Chicago Hope'' or even ``Shakespeare in Love.'' But even
though O'Neill contemplates the abyss more profoundly and
terrifyingly than Miller and Williams, a production as good as this
takes the audience along on the ride rather than leaving them at
the station.
</P>
<P>
   One can see the Mamet-Shepard aesthetic arising from ``The
Iceman Cometh'' as well as the Miller-Williams aesthetic and, in
fact, Williams and Miller would venture into more abstract waters
themselves. But one doesn't negate the other. The richness of these
productions shows that it's many of today's playwrights and critics
who have failed Broadway instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' continues at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre
and ``Not About Nightingales'' at Circle in the Square. ``The
Iceman Cometh'' begins previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre
March 29, opens April 8, and runs through June.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night''
continues at Hartford Stage through April 1; Williams's ``Sweet
Bird of Youth'' continues through March 21 at the Boston Center for
the Arts in a Delvena Theatre Company production; Williams's ``The
Glass Menagerie,'' directed by Joseph Chaikin, begins previews at
the Yale Repertory Theatre March 18, opens March 23, and runs
through April 10.

SBC, AOL FORM INTERNET ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SANFORD NOLAN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ SBC Communications Inc. and America Online Inc.,
the nation's largest on-line service, have formed an alliance to
offer high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   SBC will offer the high-speed access over its phone lines to AOL
customers in its Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell
service areas using a technology called asynchronous digital
subscriber line, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio-based SBC, which announced in January that it would
introduce DSL in most of its markets, plans to make the high-speed
service available to more than 8 million homes and 1.5 million
businesses by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a partner like AOL, we can get the message out about our
product more quickly to a mass market,'' Steve Dimmitt, the vice
president of consumer marketing at SBC, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   DSL allows customers to access the Internet over copper phone
lines dozens of times faster than standard computer modems.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows customers to simultaneously access the Internet
while talking on the phone or sending a fax.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles, Va.-based AOL, facing growing demand for high-speed
access from its 16 million subscribers, is cutting the deal so it
won't lose customers to other service providers that offer
high-speed Net access, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL in January reached a similar alliance with Bell Atlantic
Corp., which serves the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The two alliances give AOL the ability to market high-speed
access in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will charge customers an additional $20 a month for SBC's
high-speed service. It charges $21.95 per month for its main
on-line service.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and businesses may buy high-speed Internet service
from SBC without subscribing to AOL, but the service costs $39 a
month and doesn't include the monthly fee they pay to an Internet
service provider. SBC offers Internet access to DSL customers for
an additional $10 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal could fuel consumer interest in SBC's DSL
service, while allowing to AOL to keep up with consumer demand for
faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really powerful alliance here,'' said Scott Wright,
a telecom analyst for Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``I think this
is really going to jump-start DSL for SBC. The phone companies need
to play a little catch-up with cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies such as Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc.
_ now owned by AT&AMP;T Corp. _ have aggressively deployed their own
high-speed Internet services using cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   So far, cable companies have a lead in the high-speed contest.
They have about 500,000 high-speed Internet customers across the
country, almost 10 times the number of subscribers to DSL services
provided telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies have charged more for DSL than cable
companies have for cable modem service, scaring some consumers
away, said Bruce Leichtman, an analyst with Yankee Group, a
Boston-based telecom research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is definitely more in line with cable modem
pricing,'' Leichtman said. ``They're not going to reach everybody
with this price, but it will be appealing to the high-end niche of
people that are on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimmitt declined to reveal specific terms of SBC's agreement
with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to say whether SBC would extend the deal to
cover Ameritech Corp.'s service area if SBC closes its $62 billion
acquisition of the Chicago- based Bell company.

TURBULENT SERVICE AT 40,000 FEET

   Commentary

 By AL McKEE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He was a nervous traveler seeking reassurance
from the agent at the departure gate that the boarding pass he had
been given in the lobby would actually get him onto the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But the agent was having none of it. She snatched the boarding
pass from his hand and held it up as an example to the assembled
crowd. ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' she said while the man squirmed,
``if you have one of these boarding passes, you don't need to check
in at this gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Her subtext was clear: Don't waste my time.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't seen this maneuver since Mrs. Harrison, my third-grade
teacher, held up Charley Pickens' homework to show our class how
not to do long division. Poor Charley's ears were like red neon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've heard of commercial aviation's new no-guff
policy.
</P>
<P>
   After too many cases of passengers taking a swing at the flight
attendant or exposing themselves at 40,000 feet or trying to stuff
moose antlers into the overhead bins, the airlines are getting
tough. Exactly how tough was demonstrated to me when my wife and I
flew from San Francisco to Denver. We were briskly scolded all
through the flight.
</P>
<P>
   As we stood in the aisles putting away our carry-on bags, a
flight attendant insisted everyone sit down so the airline could
get on with assigning spare seats to passengers it had overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, she was back with a threat: ``We're going to
come through and look under your seats and if any bags are sticking
out, they will be taken and checked.''
</P>
<P>
   While handing out headphones for the in-flight entertainment,
another attendant warned, ``If you don't take it now, you won't get
another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the captain turned off the seatbelt sign after takeoff
and an elderly woman got up to make her way down the aisle, a
clearly peeved stewardess announced to the cabin, ``We realize
people need to use the restrooms, but we have to get these carts to
the front. Please clear the aisles.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows there is no greater impediment to the efficient
conduct of business than the customer.
</P>
<P>
   But given the nature of commercial aviation and the fact that
its customers are held captive six miles in the air, surely a
measure of indulgence is not too much to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been possible, I would have walked out on this trip to
Denver. Particularly so late in the flight when the crew was
serving drinks and my wife had the temerity to ask for two cans of
tomato juice. The stewardess smacked the second can onto her tray
as Mrs. Harrison might have smacked a pencil onto Charley Pickens'
desk _ he having forgotten to bring one for the test on long
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, I haven't had anything to eat either,'' she sneered.
``I know it's hot. I know it's stuffy. You think you're dehydrated.
Sometimes I get nosebleeds!''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not old enough to remember the glory days of aviation, when
traveling by air was a luxury experience. But I do recall a time
when each flight was attended by a cordial spirit of adventure,
when a passenger had room to stretch his legs and when cabin crews
could be counted on to perform with good humor, with competence and
with sufficient stoicism to suffer their nosebleeds in silence.

 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So here's the setup: Woman is happily married. Or so she thinks.
Husband, a grade-school principal and a real slice o' slime, is
having an affair. With their daughter's fifth-grade teacher, no
less. Whole town seems to be in on the secret except you know who.
Woman's life is shattered when she finds out. Husband leaves her,
and now it's time to pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to get an accurate count of how often this
plot line has been used in a film. A hundred? A thousand? A few too
many?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the score, add ``Replacing Dad'' (CBS 9 p.m. Sunday) to
the list. But not the A list.
</P>
<P>
   And if it should happen to squeeze its way onto the B list, give
all credit to the extraordinarily talented Mary McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell (``Dances With Wolves,'' ``Passion Fish'') carries
this CBS film to the extent that it almost could be billed a
one-woman show. Not that the rest of the cast is invisible.
Goodness, no. Tippi Hedren, in fact, is happy to show that some
women in their 60s can still wear tight sweaters _ and tighter
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Hedren plays Dixie, the ebullient and aerobically healthy mother
of McDonnell's character, Linda Marsh. It falls to Dixie to lift
Linda's spirits after Linda's husband leaves her and their three
kids after 16 years of marriage. Hedren is, well, ebullient in the
role _ certainly not unconvincing as a mom living out the
beauty-queen dreams she once held for her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hedren's performance is a reliable and very
well-preserved Chevy, McDonnell's is a top-of-the-line Cadillac
with power to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The range of emotions she portrays is an entire curriculum of
Actors Studio seminars, and the truth in each emotion is as
unassailable as one of Honest Abe's oaths.
</P>
<P>
   From energy-sapping ennui to crushing heartbreak to tentative
exhilaration, McDonnell's face and voice perform a marvelous
expressionistic duet that takes the viewer's mind off the film's
shortcomings, one of which is a flat performance by William Russ as
Linda's sleazebag husband, George Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Another is an even flatter portrayal, by Jack Coleman, of the
``new man'' in Linda's life, a too-good-to-be-true physician. But
the biggest problem may be the rough edges on the performances of
the three children.
</P>
<P>
   It's not nice to criticize kids, but a script that builds a big
part of its story around them needs strong actors, and ``Replacing
Dad'' should have replaced the weak ones in its cast. Mary
McDonnell deserves the support.

BILL MAY PRIVATIZE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If some lawmakers get their way, the federal government will
turn over much of the enforcement of the nation's workplace health
and safety laws to private consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in Congress that would require the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to certify
consultants who would, in turn, be hired by companies to inspect
their work sites. If the companies fix the problems they'd be
exempt from routine OSHA inspections and penalties for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean OSHA deform,'' said Charles Jeffress with a
smile, when he was asked about the new OSHA ``reform'' legislation
known as the Safety Advancement for Employees, or SAFE, Act.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress, assistant secretary of OSHA, visited Houston recently
and, over lunch, discussed his concerns over what he views as a
relationship that would be a mite too close.
</P>
<P>
   If a consultant depends on a company for his livelihood, there
would be an incentive for the consultant to please the company by
providing a favorable report without rigorously inspecting the
workplace, he said. And employers may feel obligated to buy extra
services to curry favor.
</P>
<P>
   It creats a conflict of interest, which is not good public
policy, Jeffress said. There also may be a legal problem if the
government delegated its inspection authority to a private party,
he said, adding the Justice Department has concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the Harris County AFL-CIO,
was even more blunt when asked about the legislation sponsored by
Sen. Michael Enzi, R-Wyo., a former safety manager with an oil well
servicing company,
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically putting the fox in charge of guarding the
henhouse,'' the local union leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Worker safety would be compromised, Shaw said. Companies can't
be entrusted with ensuring the safety of workers without outside
inspectors and the threat of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hayes, founder and director of the Families in Grief Hold
Together Project in Fairhope, Ala., said he is concerned about how
OSHA would monitor the consultants because the agency has trouble
enough monitoring its own employees.
</P>
<P>
   But something needs to be done to improve safety and health
practices and a consultation program may be part of the answer,
said Hayes, who became an OSHA watchdog when his son was killed in
an industrial accident. In OSHA's 29-year history, the agency has
never really enforced the law because it doesn't have enough
inspectors, and when they find a problem, they let the companies
negotiate the fine and penalty classification down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayes doesn't like the idea of exempting employers from
penalties. Companies caught violating safety laws commonly promise
they won't do it again _ but they do, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce favors Enzi's bill because it
believes the incentives are strong enough _ avoidance of routine
OSHA inspections and fines _ to hire a safety consultant. That
would improve the health and safety of workplaces, especially in
small and medium-sized companies that typically can't afford to
have an expert on staff, said Peter Eide, manager of labor law
policy for the chamber in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eide said he's not worried the plan would make companies too
lax. OSHA would still be able to inspect a company if an employee
made a complaint or if there is a serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress testified against the SAFE bill recently before the
Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training. The bill is
a scaled-down version of a more comprehensive OSHA ``reform'' bill
introduced last year that never made it to the floor of the Senate.
It too was opposed by OSHA and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional insider predicted the SAFE Act won't have an
easy time of it. The Clinton administration has threatened a veto,
and it's unlikely there would be enough votes to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., plans another piece of OSHA
legislation in the next two weeks that would extend OSHA's coverage
to state and local government work sites. The legislation also
would allow OSHA to fine federal government offices for workplace
safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   When budgets are tight, the first thing government agencies put
off is maintenance, which increases safety hazards, Jeffress said.
And the hazards at government work sites are often similar to
hazards in the private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, Shaw said, adding that state and local
governments haven't paid much attention to fixing safety hazards
because they haven't had much of an incentive.

TURF BATTLES GET BLOOD BANK INDUSTRY BOILING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED:to become affiliates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hometown folks were skeptical, but in the eyes of Carter Blood
Center executives, such an arrangement was worth talking about,
said former chief executive Bill Miller, who now operates a blood
center in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested mainly in an arrangement where we would
preserve our relationships and work in a coordinated way with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it became clear that the Red Cross had something else in
mind, Miller said. Rigid management guidelines were surfacing in
the proposals. The upshot was that the Red Cross would essentially
call the shots from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to a hostile takeover attempt, Miller said, and he
felt misled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement turned out to be, at least on our terms,
offering dire circumstances,'' Miller said. ``The governance aspect
was so unpalatable that we just switched off. They wanted us to go
out of business and become part of the Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Miller contends, the Red Cross was applying
outside pressure by offering to provide some Carter clients with
blood more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because the Red Cross is laboring under a large debt,
the strategy was to go to a much larger market share, and once it's
achieved, to raise prices and enjoy wider margin,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox acknowledged that the Red Cross cut deals with some of
Carter's clients, but he said it did not want to take over the
entire blood service business. Blood pricing wasn't an issue, he
said, because the Red Cross matched the price of Carter products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our red-cell price was $75,'' he said. ``The Carter price,
when it was just Fort Worth, was $75. Dallas BloodCare's was $80.
So we didn't low-ball any prices. Our approach from the very start
was to add new donors but not to take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox contends that some of Carter's customers initiated contact
with the Red Cross to explore deals. The Red Cross was not trying
to conquer Carter's operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued was intensified battles for blood-supply bids that
helped trigger alliances among smaller North Texas nonprofits.
Carter Blood Center merged with Dallas BloodCare. The trade group
America's Blood Centers assisted them and other independents with
marketing approaches and other resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross opened a center last year in Farmers Branch with a
day of festivities that included a widely publicized appearance by
Dole. The Red Cross has secured some new business since then, but
it is paltry compared with Carter BloodCare's penetration in North
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter BloodCare facility in Bedford houses a
state-of-the-art laboratory in two buildings that it bought on 11
acres at Bedford Road and Texas 121. It will process as many as 1
million pints of blood each year, serving 200 health care
facilities in 22 North Texas counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, they are much stronger than individually,''
McPherson said of Carter Blood Center and Dallas BloodCare.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, a wake-up call hit the area blood industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Red Cross came in and started giving Carter a run for
its money, some customers said, `OK, what will it take to keep your
loyalty?' A new world emerged. A competitive world,'' McPherson
said.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the independents' new sophistication was beating
the Red Cross on a lucrative job of supplying blood to a chain of
Texas hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Red Cross' feeling was that the independents would
bid against each other,'' McPherson said. ``What happened was we
put together an umbrella organization and the Red Cross got shut
out. It showed what, collectively, the independents can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains is an industry chasm that, for the most part,
results from philosophical differences. One is having blood
agencies be more cooperative vs. having a free-for-all. Another is
local control vs. central authority in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board here is a community board and firmly believes it
should meet the community's interest,'' said Merlyn Sayers, Carter
BloodCare chief executive. ``It's community representation against
a blood program that is directed out of Washington, D.C. Basically,
our community decided that Washington, D.C., couldn't dictate our
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the battles, there's evidence that the industry
thermostat could be cooling, Miller said. Cox said the Red Cross
has a handful of successful affiliate ventures with regional blood
centers in Washington state and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross hasn't made money on blood services. So to
continue to buy market share with losses at some point becomes
nonviable,'' Miller said. ``At some point, it's not in the Red
Cross' interest to provoke fights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said it's difficult to get the taste of the Texas
battle out of his mouth. He wouldn't comment about Dole's role in
the area skirmishes, saying, ``She's a powerful lady, and I
wouldn't want to cross her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dealt with Red Cross people who were professional and
thoughtful, but for some this was a jihad, a holy war,'' he said.  &QL;

TURF BATTLES GET BLOOD BANK INDUSTRY BOILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since bottling its first drop of plasma 50 years ago, the blood
bank industry has cut an almost sanctified public profile. It's
disaster relief. Fuel for hospitals. Giver of life.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line, America's most wholesome nonprofit
enterprises became infected with politics and competitive fever.
</P>
<P>
   The big players _ regional blood banks and the American Red
Cross _ started acting more like big businesses as battles sprung
up nationwide over control of the blood supply. Some unleashed
aggressive pricing strategies or predatory marketing tactics. The
motives? To retire debts and guard turf.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more bruising battlegrounds was North Texas, where the
former Carter Blood Center and others have gone head to head with
the Red Cross, the industry's heavyweight, over a massive volunteer
donor base.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts cite that the new Carter BloodCare facility in
Bedford, halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth, which serves more
than 22 Texas counties. That center symbolizes a triumph of
regional blood centers in the face of advances by the
expansion-minded Red Cross, which aims to beef up blood collections
and snare new supplier contracts, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross stormed in and clearly said to Carter, `Align
with us or you'll die,' '' said Jim McPherson, executive director
of America's Blood Centers, a Washington-based trade group for the
nation's independent blood services. ``Everybody became angry.
Rather than align themselves with the Red Cross, it only made
people dig in their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Red Cross, which has been sharply criticized
across the nation for its aggressive maneuvering, acknowledge that
they have become more competitive. Still, they say, they have not
bullied anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're talking about hardball, I don't know what exactly
we did,'' said Richard Cox, regional director of the Red Cross. ``I
wasn't involved in meetings where there were ultimatums. We felt
there was an opportunity to come in and recruit more people. That's
what we tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross controls 45 percent of the U.S. blood supply and
is driving for more market share, partly to retire a $300 million
debt incurred to improve its blood safety programs. The safety
revamp was spearheaded by former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole, but the federal government sued to speed up changes.
</P>
<P>
   As it has launched initiatives, the Red Cross has become a
lightning rod for much of the blood industry's infighting. Disputes
with the $2 billion-a-year charity have spilled into courts,
regulatory agencies and political arenas.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, Tenn., an ailing blood bank says the Red Cross stole
one of its biggest donor clients, FedEx. In California, the Red
Cross is clashing in court with a blood center over trade secrets.
And in Washington, the Justice Department has started an antitrust
investigation of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Other skirmishes involving the Red Cross are unfolding in
Indiana and Kansas, trade experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the blood industry warfare, philanthropists
are re-evaluating how they should operate in a world where
competition is increasingly saturating nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the really big question of the day right now among
nonprofit groups,'' said Kate Conover, vice president of the
National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy. ``Many nonprofits
are finding themselves in a more competitive atmosphere. They're
wondering, `Should we stay nice and sweet or get more aggressive?'
''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, at least in the North Texas blood bank community,
was to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Cross burst on the scene three years ago with the
idea of serving what it considered an underserved market, it began
courting the main operators, Carter Blood Center and Dallas
BloodCare, with proposals to become affiliates. MORE &QL;

   Ask away: There are many sites on the World Wide Web where you
can ask an expert about a specific problem. These are usually
narrow _ you can talk to a computer expert about computers at one
site, but don't expect to get help for your love life there. Or,
you can get help restoring an antique car at another site, but that
same place will be useless if you are trying to help your daughter
with math homework. There simply aren't many places where you can
ask just about anything and expect to find someone who can help.
Now, there's a site that tries to be all things to all surfers _
Allexperts.com. As the name implies, Allexperts has assembled a
group of experts on a variety of topics. Here you can pose
questions ranging from how to install a hard drive to how to kiss
well. Ask questions related to relationships or entertainment;
current events or investing; religion or the arts; sports or the
law. Allexperts features a squadron of volunteers who purport to be
knowledgeable in specific fields. They're grouped by general topic,
and then by specifics. When you get to the area dealing with your
question, there's a brief statement by the volunteer for that topic
about his or her background and level of expertise. Click on the
name, and you can then send e-mail to the expert _ for free.

   _ Family ties: E-mail has done wonderful things for the American
family. Suddenly, people in the same family who haven't spoken to
each other in years are exchanging e-mail and getting closer. Given
that e-mail has been a boon, imagine what would happen if you put
the power of the Web into the collective hands of a family. At
www.MyFamily.com, you can set up your own, private family Web site
and use it to keep members of your clan updated. Post news
headlines on the main page that link to more detailed info, and
allow others to react to the news. You can have a joint calendar,
so you can tell at a glance who'll be where and when. There is a
secure chat area so you can gather and type messages at each other

   _ Ribbit: The last time we visited the Exploratorium, the San
Francisco science museum was offering an exhibit on the physics
behind baseball. Frankly, it probably was just an excuse for the
curators to catch a few choice Giants games. (See
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/09/11/online.html) Now, the
Exploratorium looks at a topic that's quite different _ frogs.
Begin with a history of frogs _ they pre-date the dinosaurs _ and a
look at their role in the environment. The site is filled with fun
frog facts, such as this one: ``Frogs' eyes have a surprising
auxiliary function: They help in swallowing. As a frog swallows its
prey, the eyes sink through openings in the skull and help force
the food down the throat. This is why frogs seem to blink as they
eat.'' Pay a visit to Rayne, La., which bills itself as the frog
capital of the world. And learn about the myths surrounding frogs
and toads _ can they really give you warts?

   _ Up and at 'em: Need a wakeup call? Schedule one from the Web!
Mr. Wakeup at www.mrwakeup.com/ is still in the testing stage, but
it's still incredibly useful. Fill out a basic form, and then tell
Mr. Wakeup when to call you, and at what phone number. Your phone
will ring at the appointed time, and you'll be prompted with
information you've typed into the Web site. You'll also have to
listen to a 15- to 20-second ad, which is why the service is free.
Eventually, Mr. Wakeup will offer information services, with news,
sports scores, even your horoscope via a phone call that you
schedule.

BILL MAY PRIVATIZE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If some lawmakers get their way, the federal government will
turn over much of the enforcement of the nation's workplace health
and safety laws to private consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in Congress that would require the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to certify
consultants who would, in turn, be hired by companies to inspect
their work sites. If the companies fix the problems they'd be
exempt from routine OSHA inspections and penalties for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean OSHA deform,'' said Charles Jeffress with a
smile, when he was asked about the new OSHA ``reform'' legislation
known as the Safety Advancement for Employees, or SAFE, Act.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress, assistant secretary of OSHA, visited Houston recently
and, over lunch, discussed his concerns over what he views as a
relationship that would be a mite too close.
</P>
<P>
   If a consultant depends on a company for his livelihood, there
would be an incentive for the consultant to please the company by
providing a favorable report without rigorously inspecting the
workplace, he said. And employers may feel obligated to buy extra
services to curry favor.
</P>
<P>
   It creats a conflict of interest, which is not good public
policy, Jeffress said. There also may be a legal problem if the
government delegated its inspection authority to a private party,
he said, adding the Justice Department has concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the Harris County AFL-CIO,
was even more blunt when asked about the legislation sponsored by
Sen. Michael Enzi, R-Wyo., a former safety manager with an oil well
servicing company,
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically putting the fox in charge of guarding the
henhouse,'' the local union leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Worker safety would be compromised, Shaw said. Companies can't
be entrusted with ensuring the safety of workers without outside
inspectors and the threat of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hayes, founder and director of the Families in Grief Hold
Together Project in Fairhope, Ala., said he is concerned about how
OSHA would monitor the consultants because the agency has trouble
enough monitoring its own employees.
</P>
<P>
   But something needs to be done to improve safety and health
practices and a consultation program may be part of the answer,
said Hayes, who became an OSHA watchdog when his son was killed in
an industrial accident. In OSHA's 29-year history, the agency has
never really enforced the law because it doesn't have enough
inspectors, and when they find a problem, they let the companies
negotiate the fine and penalty classification down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayes doesn't like the idea of exempting employers from
penalties. Companies caught violating safety laws commonly promise
they won't do it again _ but they do, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce favors Enzi's bill because it
believes the incentives are strong enough _ avoidance of routine
OSHA inspections and fines _ to hire a safety consultant. That
would improve the health and safety of workplaces, especially in
small and medium-sized companies that typically can't afford to
have an expert on staff, said Peter Eide, manager of labor law
policy for the chamber in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eide said he's not worried the plan would make companies too
lax. OSHA would still be able to inspect a company if an employee
made a complaint or if there is a serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress testified against the SAFE bill recently before the
Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training. The bill is
a scaled-down version of a more comprehensive OSHA ``reform'' bill
introduced last year that never made it to the floor of the Senate.
It too was opposed by OSHA and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional insider predicted the SAFE Act won't have an
easy time of it. The Clinton administration has threatened a veto,
and it's unlikely there would be enough votes to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., plans another piece of OSHA
legislation in the next two weeks that would extend OSHA's coverage
to state and local government work sites. The legislation also
would allow OSHA to fine federal government offices for workplace
safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   When budgets are tight, the first thing government agencies put
off is maintenance, which increases safety hazards, Jeffress said.
And the hazards at government work sites are often similar to
hazards in the private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, Shaw said, adding that state and local
governments haven't paid much attention to fixing safety hazards
because they haven't had much of an incentive.

DEVICE MANAGER, SITES HELP KEEP DRIVERS UPDATED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Q: Where and how does one check to make sure one has
the latest drivers? If the latest drivers are found to be needed,
where does one locate them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both Windows 95 and 98 have a feature called the Device
Manager that lets you see what's connected to your system and what
resources it is using. You can also use the Device Manager to
upgrade and remove drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Device Manager also will tell you the date on your drivers, if
you know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Device Manager, right-click on the My Computer icon,
choose properties, then click on the Device Manager tab. You'll see
a list of components on your system.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, let's find the date on the driver for your video
card. Double-click on Display Adapter _ the item will open to show
you your particular brand and model. Double-click on it.
</P>
<P>
   At the dialog box that appears, click on the Driver tab. You'll
then see the date for the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Next, go to the Web site for the maker of that device. Let's say
you have a Viper V550 video card from Diamond Multimedia. You'd go
to Diamond's Web site (www.diamondmm.com), find the support area
where new drivers are listed and find the one for the Viper V550.
</P>
<P>
   Download it into your computer. If you're unsure about how to
download software, see the Web site mentioned in this week's Other
Voices column offered by CNet _ it's a step-by-step tutorial for
downloading software.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites also have instructions, or one may be included in
a README.TXT file that comes with the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've upgraded all your drivers, check the Web sites at
least once every 60 days to see if there are newer drivers. Video
drivers are upgraded frequently.
</P>
<P>
   You can also check at any of several Web sites that track
updates, including Frank's World o' Windows at
www.conitech.com/windows/, WinDrivers at www.windrivers.com and The
Driver Zone at www.driverzone.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the Feb. 5 Help Line in the Technology Section, you
supplied an answer to a question about why Windows reports a
6.4-gigabyte hard disk as 5.9 gigabytes. Your answer, I think,
misses the mark. Manufacturers use a factor of 1,000 when
converting bytes to kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes. If a
manufacturer builds a disk of 6,400,000,000 bytes, they report its
size as 6,400,000 kilobytes, or 6,400 megabytes, or 6.4 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Windows, on the other hand, uses a factor of 1,024 for each of
the conversion steps, so in Windows terminology, 6,400,000,000
bytes is equal to 6,250,000 kilobytes, or 6,103 megabytes, or 5.96
gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Although both expressions refer to exactly the same capacity _
in this case, 6.4 billion bytes _ the manufacturer's terminology
makes it sound bigger than Windows' terminology. Just more
marketing hype.
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, we are both right. However, you are more right than
I am. And it's not marketing hype, but a difference in the way they
are counted.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western Digital, the largest manufacturer of PC
hard drives, there are two ways to count bytes _ decimal, which is
what the drive and BIOS makers use, and binary, which Windows uses.
That accounts for most of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   However, as indicated by the frequently asked questions document
at www.westerndigital.com/service/FAQ/win98.html, some megabytes
indeed are lost to formatting overhead. In some cases, a computer
BIOS may also claim a cylinder _ a segment of drive space _ for its
own purposes.

REMOVABLE STORAGE HAS NO STANDARD, YET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Having some form of large, removable storage on a
personal computer is becoming more and more crucial. Though it
remains an important part of any PC, the standard 1.44-megabyte
floppy drive no longer has the capacity for the kinds of things
that many people are doing with their systems these days.
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting price of hardware has made removable storage much
more affordable, in many different forms. However, there's not yet
a defining standard that is as ubiquitous as the floppy, so you'll
have to choose based on what's best for your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three drives that illustrate two different
approaches to having megabytes to go:
</P>
<P>
   __ Zip 100 USB _ $150, Iomega Corp. The Zip drive is the closest
thing we have to a new standard as a ``super-floppy,'' but it's not
quite there. More and more new computers come with them, but
usually as an option. You just can't rely on everyone having a Zip
drive, as you can with a standard floppy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, if you wanted a portable Zip drive, you could move
from computer to computer, you had to rely on either the SCSI or
parallel-port models. The SCSI version required that a PC have a
SCSI card, which few do. (Not so for the Macintosh version _ all
Macs up until recently had SCSI connectors.) The parallel port,
which could be used on virtually every PC, was dog-slow. Copying
the contents of a nearly full, 100-MB Zip disk could take seemingly
forever.
</P>
<P>
   At long, long last, Iomega has introduced a USB-based version of
its 100-MB Zip. The company originally was not planning to move as
quickly as it did, but the popularity of Apple Computer's iMac _
which has no floppy disk but includes a USB port _ forced Iomega's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good thing. While the USB version is not as fast as
the internal model sold in many Windows-based PCs, it is
significantly peppier than the parallel port. It took only a few
seconds to transfer a 10-MB file via the USB port, compared with
nearly 90 seconds with one of the original parallel-port Zips.
</P>
<P>
   The USB model comes in a translucent green case, and to me, the
plastic felt a little flimsy. Treat this baby with care.
</P>
<P>
   __ Zip 250 Parallel _ $200, Iomega Corp. When I first heard that
Iomega was finally going to sell a Zip with a greater capacity of
250 MB, and that it could also read the original 100-MB disks, I
was overjoyed. Then I learned the awful truth.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two configurations _ SCSI and parallel. Where's
the USB model?
</P>
<P>
   In my dreams. Or, at the very least, somewhere in Iomega's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   I tried out the parallel port version, and while it wasn't as
sluggish as the original Zip, it is certainly no speed demon. It
seems to be about 30 percent faster, but much slower than the USB
model. It took a full minute to copy a 10-MB file.
</P>
<P>
   At least the case on this one was quite sturdy, with a nice
curved design that will look snazzy on anyone's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Having 250 MB of space, though, is quite a plus, and it's
necessary for Iomega to compete with Sony and other manufacturers,
who have introduced 200-MB-plus removable disks. The greater
capacity should be particularly helpful to anyone who works with
large graphics or video files, and with the boom in scanners and
digital cameras among home users, that's more and more of us.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-MB disks cost a little more than the 100-MB disks:
$17-$18 in multipacks, compared with about $12-$13.
</P>
<P>
   __ Backpack CD-ReWriter _ $449, MicroSolutions. If your need for
removable space goes way beyond 100 or even 250 megabytes, you'd do
well to look at a writeable CD-ROM drive. There are both internal
and external models. The internals are cheaper and somewhat faster,
but the external models have been used on multiple PCs.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at MicroSolutions' new external drive. It can handle
both kinds of writeable CDs _ CD-R, which lets you write to the
disk just once; and CD-RW, which lets you write to it over and over
again, just like a hard or floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   Each type has its benefits and best uses. CD-R disks are cheap _
about $2 to $3 in bulk _ and are faster. CD-RW disks are more
expensive _ about $17 to $20 each _ and are a little slower in the
writing process.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R is great for making duplicates of existing disks, or
storing programs or data you don't expect to change. This also is
the medium you'd use to make audio CDs to be used in any compact
disc player.
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW can be used for backing up crucial data, just like a tape
or removeable floppy. Unfortunately, it can't be read in all CD
drives _ only those that support the Multi-Read standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Backpack CD-ReWriter can write to a drive in 4X speed (four
times the speed of the first CD-ROM drives), and reads at 6X
speeds. It takes about 20 minutes to fill up a 650-MB disk. On
older computers, though, you may not be able to achieve these
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with an older version of Adaptec's excellent Easy CD
Creator software, which makes creating a CD in either format a
snap. I'd highly recommend upgrading to the newest version, Easy CD
Creator Deluxe 3.5, which comes with some very useful components.
For example, it has CD Spin Doctor, which lets you turn your vinyl
LP collection into CDs, and a module for putting video on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm enthusiastic about the Backpack, parallel ports can
be finicky. For example, I had some problems getting a
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 882C printer to co-exist on the parallel
port with this drive. I'd love to see MicroSolutions offer a USB
version of the Back CD-ReWriter.

DISCOVERY GOES DOWN UNDER IN SEARCH OF CLEOPATRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Discovery Channel doesn't mess around when
it has an exclusive. In these days of the History Channel and PBS
stations and legions of other television outlets for cultural
information, when you have something hot, you have to shout about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery has Cleopatra _ at least her old haunts _ and the
network is going to show the goods to 142 countries in 23 languages
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   That's a loud shout.
</P>
<P>
   The event is called ``Watch with the World.'' What we'll all be
watching, at least those interested in the Ptolemaic period, is a
show called ``Cleopatra's Palace: In Search of a Legend'' (Sunday,
Discovery Channel, check local listings). This is an hour-long show
that ultimately seeks to make Franck Goddio, a very wealthy French
businessman-turned-underwater explorer, into the next Jacques
Cousteau.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nature of the discovery and the size of this event, he
may well deserve the mantle. In a world where the Fox network can
claim it is taking its cameras into Egyptian tombs unseen by human
eyes, you get the real deal here, where extraordinary work since
1996 went into the major discovery of Cleopatra's Royal Quarters in
the water just off the coast of modern-day Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   There's a real payoff in ``Cleopatra's Palace,'' a sense of
scholarly discovery and a significant contribution to history.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype, however, ``Cleopatra's Palace'' will not leave
you on the edge of your seat. This is partly due to television's
dumbing-down effect, the fact that the medium always promises
something shocking and revealing and revolutionary, and we end up
with a big nothing at the end. Maybe in this studied production _
Discovery had cameras at the scene and slowly chronicles the
tedious way these artifacts were unearthed from the sea floor _
robs it of charisma.
</P>
<P>
   What Goddio has found is real and important and, in a historical
context, very fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday night, Discovery will follow the underwater
adventures with even more about the Egyptian queen in ``The Real
Cleopatra.''

THE MERCEDES-BENZ AMG E55 SEDAN IS ONE FAST MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend who took a ride with me in the new Mercedes-Benz AMG
E55 sedan summed up the experience this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the fanciest Mercedes I've seen, but I believe it's
the fastest car I've ever been in.''
</P>
<P>
   Well said.
</P>
<P>
   The E55, a special model re-engineered by Mercedes' German
performance partner, AMG, probably is the fastest
automatic-transmission sedan I have driven. And even under the
right conditions, the E55 probably would beat two rather speedy
sports cars _ the Dodge Viper and Chevrolet Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what prompted Mercedes to create this rocketship
version of its best-selling sedan line, the E-class, but my guess
is that Toyota's Lexus luxury division egged the German automaker
on.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lexus introduced the GS 400, billing it as ``the
fastest automatic sedan on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over, GS 400; the E55 is about to blow right by you.
</P>
<P>
   With a published zero-to-60 mph acceleration time of 5.4 seconds
(and I believe that's a bit conservative), the E55 is ready to take
on all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Its 5.5-liter V-8 engine, with 349 horsepower and 391
foot-pounds of torque, is more powerful than the 'Vette's 5.7-liter
engine, with 345 horsepower and 350 foot-pounds of torque. The E55
seems to handle better than the 'Vette, thanks to its more-refined
suspension system and its active handling system, which includes
automatic slip control and an electronic stability program. The
Viper's crude suspension system is no match for either the 'Vette
or the E55, both of which would easily pass the muscular Viper at
the first series of curves.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this power could get you in trouble with the
traffic cops pretty quickly. But you don't have to speed to have
fun with the E55.
</P>
<P>
   Goosing the gas pedal when the traffic light turns green, and
accelerating just up to the speed limit was enough of a thrill for
me. By the time I was up to the speed limit and nearly to the next
block, the other traffic was still trying to clear the
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   From a dead stop, with the gas pedal to the metal, this vehicle
pins you to the back of your seat like the supersonic transport
Concorde roaring down the runway toward take-off. With the possible
exception of the Texas Giant roller coaster going down the first
big hill, there's no feeling quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   So, is all that power worth the price tag? The Mercedes E-class
is the middle tier of the automaker's lineup, generally ranging in
price from $43,000 to $55,000. But this special edition, the E55,
lists for $69,100, and with the $865 CD changer, $1,000 gas guzzler
tax and $595 transportation charge, our test car topped out at
$71,560.
</P>
<P>
   As one of my colleagues pointed out, you could buy a house for
that. Not a very fancy one, though, and certainly not one in a
neighborhood where everyone has a Mercedes, Lexus or BMW.
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford to pay for that kind if driving thrill, then
why not? People are paying more than that for the Viper and the
Plymouth Prowler, two very impractical cars. At least the E55 is
also a practical, comfortable and roomy family sedan. Who says a
nice family sedan has to be boring?
</P>
<P>
   The E55's AMG engine has sequential multipoint fuel-injection,
two spark plugs per cylinder with computer-phased firing, and a
magnesium two-stage resonance intake manifold. All of that
contributes to the engine's extra power.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission is a five-speed automatic with computer
controls that allow it to adapt itself to each driver's particular
style of driving.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic slip control helps get all of that power to the rear
wheels during start-up without breaking traction. The computerized
system senses drive-wheel slip and automatically brakes the
slipping wheel and reduces excess engine power until control is
regained. Of course, you can turn off the slip control for quicker
acceleration on smooth, dry surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized electronic stability program enhances the
vehicle's handling by comparing the driver's intended course, via
steering and braking input, to the vehicle's response, then brakes
individual front or rear wheels and decreases excess engine power
as needed to help correct over- or understeer.
</P>
<P>
   The E55 has four-wheel independent suspension with a
double-wishbone front arrangement and a five-arm multilink rear
setup with solid stabilizer bars. Sport-tuned AMG-Bilstein
gas-pressurized shock absorbers and progressive-rate coil springs
round out the package.
</P>
<P>
   Rack-and-pinion steering has speed-sensitive power assist, which
keeps the steering stiff at higher speeds for more precise handling
in turns.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel, power disc brakes have both an antilock system
and Mercedes' brake-assist feature, which, when sensing emergency
braking by the driver, applies maximum available power boost to
reduce overall stopping distance. The system is designed to
overcome the driver's tendency not to brake hard enough, soon
enough, Mercedes says in its explanation of the system.
</P>
<P>
   AMG has put its own styling cues on the E55, including a
sculpted front air dam, side skirts and a rear apron. There are
xenon high-intensity headlights with heated washers, projector-beam
fog lights and a power tilt/slide tinted-glass sun roof.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is midsize and roomy enough for five adults. The trunk
is a roomy 15.3 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features include dual-zone automatic climate
control, one-touch express up/down power windows, remote control
power door locks, power mirrors, heated 10-way power front sport
seats, premium leather upholstery, black birds-eye maple interior
trim, an eight-speaker Bose premium sound system (AM/FM/weatherband
radio with concealed cassette player), automatic theft alarm, and
remote opening and closing of the windows and sun roof.
</P>
<P>
   The E55 is slapped with the gas-guzzler tax because of its EPA
fuel-economy ratings of 16 miles per gallon in the city and 23 mpg
on the highway. That's because of the government's ridiculous
policy that penalizes passenger cars but lets sport-utility
vehicles off the hook because they are classified as trucks. The
Dodge Durango SUV I drove last week doesn't have a gas-guzzler tax
with its 12 mpg in the city and 16 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 21.1 gallons of fuel, and premium unleaded is
recommended.
</P>

RESISTANCE IS FUTILE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The new Pentium III has a serial number that
has to be entered before it works. When it is entered, your
processor can communicate with ``headquarters,'' and Intel and
others can see exactly what is on your computer. Soon, the computer
programmers will have control of everything that we do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicken Little
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LITTLE: We already do, Einstein. Look, if you think Intel
is masterminding some international master plan that will let them
find out you downloaded all those pictures of Melissa Joan Hart,
I've got news for you: Everybody already knew about it long before
the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Things are getting blown way out of proportion. The chip ID is
intended to be an added layer of security for things like
e-commerce: You might steal my MasterCard number and my password,
but you're not using them to buy Viagra on the Web until you steal
my computer, too. Besides, anybody who knows me would know that I'd
never need Viagra. Stop laughing. It's true. Really.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of things have happened since the last time I wrote
about all the loons out there who think Intel has nothing better to
do than spy on them. First, Intel came up with a utility that
prevents anyone from obtaining your serial number. Second, some
hackers found a way around that. Big whoop. Like that's never
happened before.
</P>
<P>
   When you plug into the Internet, you might as well give up any
thoughts of privacy. Web sites have always been able to track you
and what you're doing, and any geek with a copy of ``Back Orifice''
and some free time can find his way inside your computer. How do
you think I found out about Melissa?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to get new equipment and move into the
21st century with everyone else, but how do I get rid of the old
stuff? Taking it for a ride to the dump just doesn't seem
environmentally friendly. Also, if I can actually find someone who
will take the computer off my hands, how do I purge the hard drive
so they can't reconstruct all those steamy letters I wrote when I
used to have a love life?
</P>
<P>
   _ Movin' On Up
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UP: Luckily, I never had that problem. With getting rid of
computers, I mean. No, really. Women send me steamy love letters
all the time. And underwear. I can prove it.
</P>
<P>
   My philosophy is to work a computer until it drops, because
you'll never get anybody to buy it. Sometimes, a computer gets
demoted to doing different things, like being a game machine or
someplace to experiment with Linux. Or I'll use parts out of the
old machine in the new one.
</P>
<P>
   The way technology doubles every three minutes doesn't help the
used-computer market. There will always be neophytes out there who
want the cheapest computer they can find, but when they can get a
new PC for under a thousand bucks or an iMac for not much more,
your 10-year-old doorstop isn't too attractive.
</P>
<P>
   If you do find a chump, though, don't worry too much about your
love letters. A simple file deletion or formatting the hard drive
is usually enough to stump most people. Anyway, I didn't find your
letters all that interesting. Well, certainly not as interesting as
mine. No, really. It's true.

`QUALITY' IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Sentinel'' built a loyal but exceptionally paltry
following after its 1996 debut, so it wasn't all that shocking when
UPN pulled the plug last season. Surprising was the number of
hearts the cancellation broke. Devoted fans deluged the network
with calls, letters, e-mails and general threats of mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   So, figuring ``The Sentinel'' had some life left, UPN scheduled
the drama as a midseason replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Most intriguing about this rare resurrection is this: When
viewers campaign to save endangered series, it's usually for shows
carrying the oft-used, but awfully nebulous label of ``Quality
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Relativity'' carried such a tag a few seasons back. ``Nothing
Sacred'' last year. ``Cupid'' this season.
</P>
<P>
   The rap on ``The Sentinel,'' about a police detective with
extraordinarily heightened senses, was that it didn't fall in the
``quality'' category and therefore wasn't worth saving, despite all
those viewers who thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Surfacing once again was the issue of ``Quality TV'' _ what it
is, what it isn't, who has the credentials to spot it, which
programs have the artistic elements to possess it. We've heard this
descriptive term tossed about quite freely by TV critics, media
pundits and other discerning couch voyeurs, figuring it quickly
constitutes both an aesthetic judgment ``and'' a generic style,
much the way film divides independents from big-budget studio
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Few who use the term can say exactly what it is, but they know
it when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' is quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nash Bridges'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' is quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   From what I can come up with, the term ``Quality TV'' started
regularly appearing in the 1970s, but really caught on after ``Hill
Street Blues'' caught our attention around 1981. Three years later,
a lobbying group protesting the cancellation of the female
buddy-cop show ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' began.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers for Quality Television (VQT), a nonprofit group made up
of discerning couch voyeurs, would make the term an acceptable part
of TV description. VQT is now an influential organization
attracting the attention of the industry's top producers, writers,
stars and network executives. Attendance is high at annual VQT
conventions, where they hand out awards for, of course,
``quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's monthly newsletter, in which members fire off
comments on series in general and episodes in particular, is a
must-read by industry insiders who want _ need _ to be part of the
organization's ``endorsed'' list. (There is no ``unendorsed'' list
because VQT doesn't commit space to stuff it doesn't care for.)
</P>
<P>
   To its founder and newsletter editor, Dorothy Swanson, there
truly is a set of ``quality TV'' criteria. Essentially, these
include breaking rules (''The Simpsons''); having a quality
pedigree (''The Practice''); undergoing a noble struggle against
profit-mongering networks (''Sports Night''); having a large
ensemble cast (''ER''); and creating new genres by mixing old ones
(''NYPD Blue''). They also tend to be writer-based (''Frasier''),
self-conscious (''Ally McBeal''), controversial (''Nothing
Sacred'') and realistic (''Law &AMP; Order'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't talk down to the viewer,'' but ``challenges them,''
she notes. ``And it appeals to the intellect and touches the
emotion. It provokes thought, and good characterization is
explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Manipulative writing is frowned upon, Swanson insists, and if it
focuses on the funny bone, it should do so by ``engaging the
intellect, the way ``Frasier'' does while illuminating the human
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   She's asked about the current talked-about drama ``Providence.''
``They call it a hit,'' says Swanson, ``but it's manipulative. I
don't respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is where the line blurs, because audiences have
responded well to that series. ``I'm sure it's entertaining,'' she
says. ``But you can't compare `Providence' to `The Practice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Being entertaining needn't be part of the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict on two recently canceled series: the long-running
``Melrose Place'' on Fox _ no. ``Cupid,'' the new series on ABC _ a
yes, barely. ``It was interesting and unique,'' Swanson says of
``Cupid.'' ``It's soft around some of the edges. But it takes
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the requirements can't possibly be absolutes, like, for
instance, controversy, which would make ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer'' quality TV. Same for big casts, which would
include the departed ``Mercy Point.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who consider VQT elitist snobs. Swanson has
heard the criticism. ``To me,'' she says, ``it's like picking up a
good book to read. It has to engage my attention. It has to be
worth my time. I have to be compelled to read it.''
</P>
<P>
   She understands that not everyone has similar requirements.
``And that's fine,'' she says. ``That's why we don't debate shows
that are not quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Which merely brings us back to what is.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to accept the term ``Quality TV'' on programs
sanctioned by critics or nonprofit organizations, yet harder to
admit that what's known as escapist TV _ the ``Melrose Places'' of
the world _ is just as integral a part of the tube's diverse menu.
</P>
<P>
   At times people crave catharsis, and at any intellectual price.
For that moment in time, perhaps, what they truly see is their
``quality.''

SHE'S PERFECT, BUT YOU GOTTA LOVE HER ANYWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember the first time I learned of Her. It was at a party
for a little girl, who was turning 1, or maybe 2. As the
distinguished invited guests squirmed and drooled in the laps of
their mothers, we watched the birthday girl's mom peel the colorful
wrappings off the gifts and then hold them up, one by one, for us
to ``oooooh'' over.
</P>
<P>
   A pink sweater. A little white bunny. A Tonka truck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no!'' a voice cried out from the crowd. ``That was for the
other party this weekend!'' The words hung on the air for a moment,
awkwardly, until someone said what everyone else had apparently
been thinking, which was this: ``Oh, I'm so relieved!''
</P>
<P>
   I was confused, but everyone else laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Because they knew that She, the mother who had made the mistake,
was none other than the Perfect Mom.
</P>
<P>
   You know her. She may have a different name in your
neighborhood, but she's there. And she's busy. She's creating the
Yellow Brick Road in her living room for her 4-year-old's birthday
party. She's stitching Teletubby costumes for Halloween after
designing her own pattern. On her bookshelf are 10 three-ring
binders filled with photographic memories of her children's lives,
one for each year and all decorated with colorful suns and flowers
and soccer balls cut lovingly with pinking shears.
</P>
<P>
   She's never settled for Pop Tarts for breakfast. She never lets
her kids watch the Power Puff Girls, and, worse, they don't seem to
care. She honestly doesn't understand what you mean when you say
you can't get your children to keep all their Legos and Power
Rangers in separate bins.
</P>
<P>
   She's wonderful. Completely admirable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we hate her.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years that have passed since I first saw Her, I've
glimpsed her from time to time, although I think she tries to hide.
Perhaps to protect herself from the inevitable wrath of the flawed
Every Mom, she has become the master of disguise. Sometimes She's
the blonde in the khakis selling school carnival tickets in the
car-pool line. Sometimes She's the redhead, who I hear reads to
groups in the school library on Fridays. Sometimes She's the one in
tennis shoes, on Sunday afternoon, pushing her child on the swing
as my kids and I drive by, munching burgers and fries from little
bags.
</P>
<P>
   I know She's out there, so I shouldn't have been surprised two
weeks ago, late on a school night, when a group of moms and I were
stuffing PTA raffle tickets into take-home envelopes, and suddenly
there She was, wearing the face of a woman I'd met several times
before.
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling came gradually, as our mom-chat turned to the
topic of books. She had read the latest Oprah selection. She had
read ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.'' As far as I could
tell, She had, in fact, read the New York Times bestseller list and
She even had interesting opinions on all the titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when,'' asked one mom brave enough to pose the question on
all of our minds, ``do you ever have time to read?''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, we should have understood the reply. She said
it simply. She went to bed ``by 8:30 every night.''
</P>
<P>
   All hands stopped stuffing, and we turned to her as one. She had
three children. She had a job teaching at a preschool. How could
this be? we wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could this be?'' my friend Beth asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said She, ``what is there to do after 8?''
</P>
<P>
   It made no sense. What was there to do? What about cleaning up
the kitchen? Taking care of the laundry? Running out for more milk?
Paying the bills?
</P>
<P>
   The questions came fast and furious, but She answered with
aplomb, giving us a glimpse into a family Shangri-La that we could
only hope to comprehend. She lived in a land where kids helped with
the dishes. Kids put away their clothes. Kids made their own
lunches. The very thought that this could be happening in our
neighborhood and that we were missing it filled us with wonder _
and shame. It was all so terrible.
</P>
<P>
   And then it got worse. It turns out that Her kids eat
home-cooked meals every night. She makes a veal spaghetti sauce
that takes three days to cook. She prepares all her dinners for the
week on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of something called ``democracy.'' It's when everyone
gets to vote. They vote on what they want for dinner at the
beginning of the week, and She even has a daughter who loves
chicken tetrazzini and would have it every day of the month, but
she only gets it about once a month or it wouldn't be ``fair.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all too much for Beth and me. We began shaking our heads
in unison. Our own horrible ineptitude lay exposed before us like a
gaping wound.
</P>
<P>
   Another mom was unusually quiet. Finally, she spoke. Quietly,
and staring straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask my kids every night, `What do you want to eat?' All they
say is macaroni and cheese or pasta or spaghetti ... like they're
three different things.''
</P>
<P>
   I turned to Beth to see if she was empathizing with the pasta
mom as much as I was, but she had an odd, dreamy look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder,'' she mused, ``if my Ragu would taste better if I
cooked it for three days?''
</P>
<P>
   We laughed, but the message was clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Perfect Mom had inspired us. She'd touched us with her
Martha magic.
</P>
<P>
   She'd given us hope that maybe we could do something, anything,
to make our lives a little more perfect.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, she'd inspired us, as she always does.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why, I guess, we love her.

ELLERBEE SPEAKS FROM THE HEART ABOUT ALCOHOLISM, CANCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past quarter-century, Linda Ellerbee has won just
about every award for TV journalism. Her candid descriptions of her
struggles with breast cancer and alcoholism have made Ellerbee one
of America's most in-demand public speakers. There is no way she
can satisfy all the demands on her time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ellerbee, currently serving as producer, writer and host of
``Nick News'' on cable TV's Nickelodeon network, said it was easy
to agree to speak at next month's 10th annual ``Stars in Recovery''
banquet in Fort Worth, benefiting the Tarrant Council on Alcoholism
&AMP; Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call came from Texas; I'm a Texan, and anytime an
invitation comes from Texas, that helps,'' Ellerbee said in a
recent phone interview. ``If other people want to say that's
showing favoritism, fine. It is.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any Ellerbee TV commentary, her address, dealing with
her alcohol problems, will be blunt and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly think that the stigma of being a woman
alcoholic is terrible in this country,'' Ellerbee said. ``Guys who
are alcoholics are often shown as sort of funny, but women with
drinking problems are always perceived as sad, awful things. So
women alcoholics are so often reluctant to speak out, to admit
their problem and seek help. When (former first lady) Betty Ford
spoke out, admitted what she faced and that she was brave enough to
face it, that gave me the courage some years later to go into
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ellerbee can't find humor in the most desperate
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I thought it was hilarious, wonderful, when `Murphy
Brown' _ you know, the sitcom _ had Murphy coming out of alcoholism
treatment,'' she said. ``I think there's a lot of truth in sitcoms,
though, unlike Dan Quayle, I do know the difference between sitcoms
and real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many celebrities moan about having their private lives endlessly
dissected in public, but Ellerbee has no regrets about everyone
knowing of her alcoholism and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a conscious choice to be open about these things,'' she
said. ``With the alcoholism, I had Betty Ford's example. With
breast cancer, I wanted some time to think how to discuss it, but
`USA Today' outed me. Fine. In both cases, I didn't feel like
public interest was an intrusion. Everybody gets moments in life
when they've dealt with something bad, when you stand in front of
the mirror and it's just you having to ask yourself, `How will I
handle it?' My decision both times was to use my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, Ellerbee said: ``I immediately began getting
messages, letters from so many women all over the country. They
would tell me their stories, how they had coped, and that gave me
strength. So you can certainly say the gifts I got back from others
far outweighed my loss of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Tarrant Council on Alcoholism &AMP; Drug Abuse are
glad that privacy was less important to Ellerbee than providing a
good public example. And those who attend, Ellerbee promises, will
hear honest words, not fluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that I'm showing any courage in talking about
alcoholism,'' she said. ``I'm coming because somebody feels I might
know what I'm talking about. Alcoholism is a daily struggle to keep
sober, and it's a struggle for me. It's always a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will talk about it, because silence is not my way.''

WHO APPOINTED THE APPOINTERS OF KENNETH STARR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In an earlier column, you said that a three-judge panel
appointed Kenneth Starr. Who appointed the three judges? _ A.R.,
Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The three judges on the panel, also called the Special
Division, were appointed by the chief justice of the United States,
William Rehnquist, in accordance with the terms of the Independent
Counsel Law.
</P>
<P>
   The law created the Special Division and made it part of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The chief
justice must choose current or retired federal appellate court
judges, and one must come from the D.C. Court of Appeals. They
serve two-year terms and can be reappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The judges who appointed Starr were presiding Judges David
Sentelle of the D.C. court, John Butzner Jr. of the 4th Circuit and
Joseph Sneed of the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Division, which meets privately, now has these
members: Sentelle, Peter Fay of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta and
Richard Cudahy of the 7th Circuit in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sentelle was criticized in 1994 for having lunch with Republican
Sens. Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth three weeks before Starr's
appointment. The judge said that ``to the best of my recollection''
the issue of an upcoming counsel appointment was not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for the computer game Hoyle Bridge &AMP; Euchre by
Sierra On-Line, but I can only find it in CD-ROM format. Where can
I find it on floppy disk? _ L.L., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: A Sierra representative said that the current version of the
game is only on CD.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen bridge programs are available from Baron
Barclay, a company that bills itself as ``the world's largest
bridge supply company.'' To request the company's 64-page catalog,
call (800) 274-2221 or write to Baron Barclay Bridge Supplies, 3600
Chamberlain Lane, No. 230, Louisville, KY 40241.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact Sierra by calling (800) 757-7707 or visiting the
World Wide Web site www.sierra.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Catherine Zeta-Jones? _ D.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the ``Mask of Zorro'' star in care of International
Creative Management, 8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones, 29, will be appearing with Sean Connery in the film
``Entrapment,'' due out April 30.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Swansea, Wales, Zeta-Jones had her first starring
role in the British TV series ``The Darling Buds of May'' in 1991.

UTILITY DISCIPLINES WORKERS OVER POWER OUTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has disciplined
employees blamed for a Dec. 8 incident that left parts of the San
Francisco area without electricity for up to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Len Anderson, a spokesman for the utility, confirmed Thursday
that the disciplinary process had begun. He declined to specify how
many workers were affected or whether any had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from non-utility sources say that PG&AMP;E suspended 14
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have cited two causes for the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   One was the failure of a PG&AMP;E crew to remove grounding wires it
had installed for its own protection while hooking up a new
transformer at a substation in suburban San Mateo. The other is
that an operator failed to switch on protective relays that would
have limited any problem with the new equipment to the substation.
</P>
<P>
   The oversights caused the San Mateo substation to shut down and
shut down two other regional substations, affecting business,
public transportation, hospitals and traffic signals.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the blackout has been estimated at up to $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said 4,400 customers have submitted damage claims and
that 3,000 have been paid by the utility.

IGNORE THE HEALTH NAZIS; LIVE FOR THE MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EVE PELL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Couch potatoes kind of like it when a fitness
advocate comes to an untimely end _ it gives them an argument to
use against those who preach at them to start jogging and renounce
hamburgers, smoking and beer.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't totally wrong. These days, many of us know of an
athlete who never smoked, ate a vegetarian diet, spent hours biking
or running, looked great and now is dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees,'' said my long-time running partner,
Margaret Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   She contracted lung cancer a year ago and has been given only a
few months to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy lifestyle gives you better odds, but the universe is
random. You can't count on anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret, 50, never smoked. Apart from an occasional splurge
with me at a burger joint, she is a vegetarian, has no family
history of cancer and no predisposing factors anyone has
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret and I met at 7 a.m. every weekday for 11 years to run
the trails of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County. Six years ago, she
married a professor, moved across to Berkeley and continued to
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In all her too-short life, she has spent as much of her time
outdoors as she could, immune to the ethos of accumulating
possessions and measuring success in dollars. She loves children,
poetry and photography. She earned a living by designing a catalog
of new-age classes and seminars. She took trips to Greece. She
traveled to Bosnia to help children orphaned by war.
</P>
<P>
   The actor George Burns smoked cigars every day of his adult life
and lived to be 100 _ twice her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life isn't fair,'' my stepfather always said. I never liked
that message, but I have come to understand it a little better.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the grasshoppers, besides having more fun, get more
rewards than the ants, who have diligently labored and stored up
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, I do not follow the advice of the health
Nazis. I exercise, yes, but that is because I take pleasure in
moving my body around.
</P>
<P>
   And, because I'm competitive and vain, I enjoy winning races and
looking slim. People who know that I run a lot assume that I
subsist on salads, vitamins and all-natural substances. They are
horrified when I ask for a hamburger or unwrap a Milky Way _ two of
life's more delectable foods.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, they disapprove of the estrogen-replacement
hormones that I have taken for years.
</P>
<P>
   One is supposed to get through menopause with green tea and
banish hot flashes with herbs, they say. Well, maybe tea and herbs
work for some women _ more power to them _ but, if Esterase and
Premarin do the trick, I think that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   The point, as I see it, is to live well. If living well also
helps to live longer, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret said she is glad that she indulged her love of nature
and beauty, that she followed her heart, that she pursued
adventures when they came her way. She wanted more of life,
especially more years with Frank, her beloved husband.
</P>
<P>
   But she has lived with passion for the moment _ admiring the
colors of a wildflower or jumping into a lake or camping out on a
summer night with a friend. That example, rather than one of
renouncing pleasure in the hope of longevity, makes the most sense
to me.

   PALM BEACH POST SMUGGLING SERIES
</P>
<P>
   EDs: The Palm Beach Post has a three-day package for Saturday,
March 13, Sunday, March 14, and Monday, March 15, on the business
of smuggling aliens; why the U.S. Border Patrol, the INS and the
federal court system cope poorly with it in Florida; and why
Florida employers are able to hire hundreds of thousands of illegal
workers each year. Here are the budget lines for the first day in
the series. Stories will move on the Cox wire Friday evening.
Graphics and photos will be available Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   PURSUIT _ WEST PALM, BEACH, Fla. _ Smuggling immigrants into
Florida is a money-making enterprise. It's becoming a booming
business as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers
equipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances
of reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40
Haitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last
weekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of
putting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector
has less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency
hasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that
period, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,
doubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.
Unfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of
agents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,
California, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector
has 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;
Tucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2
million; San Diego is $178 million. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) 60

<P>
   DAY _ Border Patrol Agent Larry Belotti works the graveyard
shift. He says he's the often the only Border Patrol agent working
from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Vermont. One recent night, he
rounded up 26 Cubans who came ashore in Miami Beach. This
effectively shuts down the Border Patrol station because Belotti
will spend the rest of the night processing these refugees. 30

</P>
<P>
   BRYOSTATIN _ WASHINGTON _ The presence of a group of
single-celled animals called bryozoans in underwater sand just off
Fort Pierce, Fla., didn't matter to anybody until concern about the
animals' future caused a federal judge last week to temporarily
halt Corps of Engineers work to renourish the beach. However, to
one of the world's largest drug companies and a group of
scientist-divers who scour the ocean floor for substances that
might be converted into useful medicines, the word bryozoans stirs
excitement. Bryostatin, a drug derived from relatives of Fort
Pierce's sandy creatures, is being tested on human volunteers as a
possible new class of cancer drug, one that seems to act on
particularly stubborn forms of the disease. Some drug industry
analysts say it may have a market worth $1 billion a year if it is
ultimately licensed. Environmentalists fighting the beach
renourishment project say it is typical of the treasures that could
be destroyed forever if such projects are not undertaken with great
care for the environment. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

<P>
   BORDER-TRAFFIC _ LAREDO _ Laredo and its sister cities along the
Texas-Mexico border are lobbying the Legislature for relief as
their roads become gridlocked as their own booming populations go
bumper-to-bumper with commercial traffic that has grown
dramatically since the North American Free Trade Agreement took
effect five years ago. But to get what they want, border counties
will have to convince lawmakers to either divert transportation
money from other parts of Texas or dip into a budget surplus that
state leaders have all but promised to use for tax cuts and
education. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   VIDEOPOKER _ HAMMOND, La. _ Because video poker was voted out of
almost half of Louisiana's parishes two years ago, the machines are
set to be unplugged this summer. But not without a fight. Some
small towns who see the machines as their lifeblood are fighting to
have a new vote. One parish is trying to annex some other town to
get its machines. This likely will be an issue in the legislature,
and already there is a court battle brewing with a May trial date
on whether the vote was legal in the first place. Real issue here
is, once you've let gambling in, how do you ask it to leave?

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My sister Jo and I were in a rather passionate debate recently
over the wisdom of sending a 14-year-old to boot camp for taking
alcohol to school.
</P>
<P>
   I said the punishment was too harsh. Jo said she got what she
deserved. I said she wouldn't feel that way if it were Jana or
Jasmine (her daughters).
</P>
<P>
   She was suddenly quiet. And I was left with the words of an old
blues song playing in my head: ``if the shoe was on the other
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Our conversation ended there; but last week, while following the
Jasper hate-crime trial with the rest of the country, it occurred
to me that this is the sort of debate that could have been going on
between the families of James Byrd Jr. and John William King. But
in the nine months since King was accused in the dragging death of
Byrd, the families have been trying on the other's shoes, feeling
the other's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to King's ailing father, Ronald King, just hours after
his son was convicted:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to save my boy's life,'' he was quoted as saying
in one news report. ``I can understand (the Byrds) not wanting to.
If I was in their shoes, I'm sure I'd feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   And this from Clara Taylor, one of James Byrd's six sisters,
after King was sentenced to die: ``I remember reading once that
empathy is feeling your pain in my heart. If everyone felt this
way, there would be no need for the death penalty or jail cells,
because there would be no crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple thought, but Taylor is right. Much of the
confusion, the horror we live with in this life could be avoided
simply by applying the golden rule: Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.
</P>
<P>
   And so I was struck by the Byrds' capacity to empathize with
Ronald King, knowing full well that his son was partly responsible
for James Byrd's death. (Two other defendants are awaiting trial.)
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that the Byrds aren't angry. They are. As a
son, father and brother, James Byrd Jr. left many grief-stricken
and confused relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should have to suffer and die the way my brother died,
but we have chosen not to let that anger control us,'' Taylor said
recently. ``That's why King did what he did. We don't want our
brother's legacy to be one of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, the family plans to start programs to
encourage and advance racial healing and education. In addition,
they will launch a campaign to heighten awareness of the
consequences of racial hatred, reduce the number of racially
motivated attacks and provide support to other victims of hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who preach racial healing, this is a good way to
help work for it. Donations to the effort may be made to the James
Byrd Jr. Foundation for Racial Healing by calling (888) 656-6414 or
by writing to the group in care of the First National Bank, Box
700, Jasper, TX 75951.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a community effort,'' said Taylor, ``with
political, religious and community leaders working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Diggles, executive director of the Deep East Texas
Council of Governments, is among those working with Taylor's
family. He said that if all goes according to plan, the foundation
will kick off the programs no later than June, the first
anniversary of James Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that every man, woman and child should know who her
brother was and what happened to him so that it doesn't happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   She's right. There is much to be learned from this tragedy, not
the least of which is taking the time to wear someone else's shoes.

LOST IN SPACE CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it may be true that in space no one can hear you scream,
groaning should be a perfectly audible way of saying the
intergalactic alien-buster ``Wing Commander'' stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between ``Starship Troopers'' and ``Top Gun'' sits
director Chris Roberts' feature, which has neither the ambition nor
the budget to take the highway to the danger zone. Instead, it
threatens to take your breath away with a level of blandness unseen
since that last late-night Sci-Fi channel binge.
</P>
<P>
   What a run-of-the-mill mediocre space flick lacks in characters,
plot, integrity, credibility, structure, intelligence, legitimately
diverting entertainment value, acting, substance or vision is
usually recouped in the technical scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' looks like it was put together by people who
couldn't agree on whether or not the year 2564 would be colored
with red bulbs and fluorescent cafeteria lights or costumed as if
Urban Oufitters had gone to Uranus. Though, it's hard to tell _
actually, the only thing dimmer than the movie is the lighting by
the otherwise inimitable and elegant Thierry Arbogast (``The Fifth
Element.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' is based on the popular series of eponymous
computer games, and it's a shame each ticket doesn't come with a
joystick or a keypad that allows you to control the actions of
space rookie Christopher Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Maniac
(Matthew Lillard), his hotdog co-pilot. You could make them hook-up
with the ladies sooner and more frequently than they do.
</P>
<P>
   You could create more inspired stunt-banter like the
double-entendre-laced babble between Blair and Devereux (Saffron
Burrows), his British wing commander.
</P>
<P>
   Were you to grow irritated watching Euro actors with
impenetrable accents _ apparently Prinze Jr. and Lillard are the
only Americans allowed in outer space, and even they sound foreign
_ you could pretend you're a lackey at any ad agency and overuse
that cool time-slicing special effect that freezes people and
objects in midair while the camera rotates around them. With the
press of a button you could make a subtitles request since the film
has a cast so deliberately international and grouchy you suspect
you've wandered into the United Nations before lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The aliens in question look like they've been designed by the
folks who created the goofy pests that irked the Power Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's saying a lot about a movie's lethargic atmosphere when
even Lillard looks sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   This latest youthquake hellbent on giving kids their own
``Dangerous Liaisons'' and their umpteenth ``Pygmalion'' has now
provided them with another knock-off they didn't know they wanted:
their very own ``Battlestar Galactica.''

 &HT;    WINTER AID ARRIVES FROM U.S. -- IN TIME FOR SPRING
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The first shipment of U.S. food aid
intended to help Russia through its long winter was unloaded Friday
at the port of St. Petersburg -- just in time for spring.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delays, the initial delivery of nearly $1
billion in food aid pledged by the United States landed as 48 cargo
containers full of crop seeds for Russian farmers were off-loaded
from a cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
   Better late than never, said Russian officials who insist the
aid still is badly needed. The American offer of food aid came
after the onset of Russia's economic crisis in August, followed by
its worst grain harvest in 40 years and predictions of an
exceptionally harsh winter.
</P>
<P>
   The months-long lag in delivery was the result of American
demands for assurances that the food assistance would not be
hijacked by corrupt Russian officials and criminal-infested
food-distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in coming months will supply Russia with more
than 3 million tons of food supplies, mainly wheat and other
grains. Another 100,000 tons of food will be provided to the Red
Cross and other private relief organizations working in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   American and Russian officials presided over the unloading at a
ceremony at the icy St. Petersburg port, nearly six months after
the U.S. government first offered its food assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman billed
the aid as ``good news for the Russian people who might otherwise
face the possibility of food shortages this winter and it is good
news for America's farmers and ranchers, who are facing economic
hardships related to large supplies and low prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedious negotiations followed as U.S. officials sought
assurances that the aid would not be misused in Russia's
notoriously corrupt market system. American officials also had to
convince the Russian government that it should not be charged
customs duties on the aid being donated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Russian government will sell the food
to regional wholesalers at prevailing market prices. Proceeds from
the sale must be deposited in Russia's state pension fund, which is
more than $1.5 billion in the red.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Russia, James Collins, downplayed the
late arrival of the aid. He said it would offer important support
for Russia just as their stocks of grain and other supplies are
running low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of helping Russia through its winter; it's
helping it through the agricultural year,'' Collins told reporters
Friday. ``The real issue is to make sure that adequate supplies are
available until the next harvest starts and that's in the fall or
the late summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say it will be virtually impossible for the U.S.
government, and the European Union, which will deliver its own $500
million food-aid package, to monitor the aid once it reaches Russia
and is distributed to the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   A previous American food-aid program in 1992 was tainted by
reports of widespread corruption among Russian food-trading
companies and government officials who profited from the sale of
donated grain. U.S. officials later said that problems were never
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am highly suspicious of this plan if the main purpose is to
get the food to the people who need it,'' said Peter Westin,
analyst with the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But both U.S. and Russian officials said distribution of the aid
would be closely monitored by a joint committee and all Russian
records must be readily available to American observers.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The United States can halt the aid shipments at any time should
problems arise. But Collins said he was confident that the aid will
reach the markets and people who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we've got a system in place that is pretty
straightforward and insures that this stuff goes where it is
intended. It is not rocket science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. deal, Russia will receive 1.7 million tons of
wheat and 30,000 tons of dried milk as outright aid and another 1.3
million tons of soybeans, corn, beef and poultry to be purchased by
Russia using a low-interest U.S. loan. American farmers will be
paid full market value for their goods, but Russia will only have
to pay back about one-quarter of the value under the terms of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment unloaded Friday of 1,000 tons of seeds for green
peas is part of 15,000 tons of corn and vegetable seeds to be given
to Russia. The seeds will be sold to farmers in the northern
Caucuses region, on Russia's southern border, which suffered
droughts last summer. Russian agriculture officials warned Friday
that the country faces a shortfall of as much as 1.3 million tons
of grain seeds needed for spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
   Westin and others contend that distribution of food, not
supplies, is Russia's biggest problem. While food shortages have
been reported in isolated Russian towns above the Arctic Circle and
in distant Siberia, Russia exported more than 2 million tons of
wheat last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking at a small and sporadic food-shortage
problem. It's more a transportation problem,'' Westin said.

GOING OFF `THE DEEP END' WITH SIMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer) does during the
nine-year absence of her missing son isn't living, it's an
``imitation of having a life,'' as she puts it. But Lana Turner
never had it this bad.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel about the miraculous
reappearance of the boy who wandered away from his brother and
mother one hectic afternoon, ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' is a
vexing simplification of an extremely ornate ethical and moral
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Beth leaves her younger son Ben under the watch of his older
brother so she can check into a hotel. She returns, and he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer plays it like he walked off with a piece of her soul.
When the son, now called Sam, shows up at her front door, Beth
encounters some primal scene as her serenity retreats behind the
fear and recognition that break across her face. It's not long
before Candy Bliss, Whoopi Goldberg's black lesbian detective, is
practically kicking down poor George Karras' (John Kapelos) front
door, wresting custody of Ben from him.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard's book was an even-handed, engrossing, journalistic
account of family deteriorating in the wake of an existential
nightmare. As adapted by former Vanity Fair film critic Stephen
Schiff, ``Deep End of the Ocean'' becomes one woman's struggle with
self-blame _ or a Lifetime movie.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial disagreements and unreconciled conflicts are resolved
with fade-outs and entire temporal abridgements while actual
psychology, and perhaps even the law, are afterthoughts to what
kind of mother Beth is.
</P>
<P>
   Movies still enjoy labeling a mother neglectful because she's
overworked or working at all _ like it's the '80s and every movie
mom harbors some secret wish to be called ``mommie dearest.''
</P>
<P>
   It's men _ husbands, fathers, detectives _ who try to reassemble
the shards of a family. Either they operate from an unassailable
righteousness or they suffer completely emotional impotence. It
makes you long for a yesteryear when Donald Sutherland made
daddy-anguish a haunting experience as he was harassed by his guilt
over dead children in movies like ``Don't Look Now'' and ``Ordinary
People.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocean'' just has Treat Williams exploding at Pfeiffer, telling
her he would never have lost that boy. Pfeiffer is one of those
actors who never strikes you as a mom, rather as a lady with kids.
But Pfeiffer packs the bags under Beth's eyes with a fatigue and
misery that easily convey Beth's guilty hibernations.
</P>
<P>
   What Schiff's dull script needed, in addition to Pfeiffer losing
herself in Beth's grief and a fine Jonathan Jackson as her
delinquent elder son, is a stylist to keep the film from turning
into the TV movie it feels like.
</P>
<P>
   Ulu Grosbard (``Straight Time,'' ``Georgia'') doesn't make
cinema per se; he creates showcases for actors. So much of what has
been done to Mitchard's book requires a degree of melodrama that
fails to interest Grosbard, who leaves issues unchecked in the name
of an ending so maudlin (and seemingly tampered with) that Douglas
Sirk would have blanched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't he like us?'' asks Beth's 9-year-old daughter
about the estranged brother being forced to sleep down the hall
from her. ``He just has to get used to us,'' Beth replies as though
they were speaking of some stray dog they just picked up off the
street. Sam doesn't urinate on the carpets or crap in armchairs,
but he should. This is the kind of movie that mistakes heartbreak
for being housebroken.

THE BELIEVABLE RAPE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `You ought to put some ice on that,'' is what she says he said
before he left the room, after he allegedly raped her. And either
you believe her or you don't. If you believe Juanita Broaddrick's
story about Bill Clinton, then the president of the United States
is a monster. If you don't believe it or can pretend it's not on
the table, then life goes on almost as before.
</P>
<P>
   What's so amazing about the Broaddrick story is that most
everyone in Washington believes it. Right-wingers have always
believed the worst about Clinton, so for them the charges are
routine. Left-wingers have long suspected the worst about Clinton,
so for them the charges are the last straw. Everyone else has been
hoping against hope that ``it'' would somehow go away; disappear
into thin air, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   But with Clinton, ``it?'' never goes away and ``it'' always
comes back. Now, the political life support system that has enabled
him for so long is coming apart at the seams. The loyalists are
abandoning ship. At long last, they're starting to tell the truth
about the president or take action based on what they know of him.
Their words and actions indicate that they believe that he should
not be entrusted with the high office he now holds.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, who joined the Clinton campaign in 1991
and rose to become one of his closest political counselors, said
this week that even he was no longer sure about Clinton. ``He's too
fit to be removed,'' said Stephanopoulos, ``but knowing what we
know now, I don't think he'd be fit enough to be elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Wright, who served as Clinton's principal political
operative throughout his years as governor of Arkansas, told the
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in late January that she believed her
former boss was a sick man. ``I feel personally betrayed,'' said
Wright. ``I feel personally lied to. I feel that he was so stupid,
to be such a smart man. And I think he's got a sickness. I'm
serious about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, who served as the president's press secretary for
three years has long let it be known (privately) that he harbored
the gravest doubts about Clinton's character. Asked about Clinton's
fitness for office by the BBC in late December, McCurry replied,
``I have enormous doubts because of the recklessness of his
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else one might say about these people, they are not
members of some imagined right-wing conspiracy. Together they span
20 years of service across the spectrum of Clinton's political
life. And the woman who spans his entire adult life in politics,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, is reliably reported to be so unnerved by
Broaddrick's allegations that she may soon take leave of her
marriage rather than continue its charade.
</P>
<P>
   The Broaddrick allegations are changing the political terrain.
Prior to their publication in The Wall Street Journal and their
broadcast on NBC television, Vice President Gore trailed Texas
Governor George W. Bush (who is my first cousin) in year 2000 trial
heats by 5 to 10 points. Today, according to the most recent Gallup
and NBC/Wall Street Journal polling, Bush's lead has more than
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   After the US Senate acquitted the president of impeachment
charges, the press was filled with ``analysis'' of Republican
``demise.'' There were reports that the GOP would lose control of
the House in the next election and, perhaps, the Senate as well.
</P>
<P>
   You won't read that story today. Privately, Democratic
strategists fear a loss of two to three seats in the year 2000
Senate contests. And if the China scandal story is even half as bad
as many in Washington suspect, some GOP strategists believe the
party might run the table, winning the presidency and maintaining
control of the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the most startling impact of Broaddrick's allegations has
been that they have rendered Democrats speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators and representatives avoid all mention of the
subject. Members of Clinton's Cabinet have been struck dumb. The
only one who has hazarded a response, Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala, said only that she took the charges
``seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Washington agrees with her about that; the charges
cannot be dismissed out of hand. They fit the Clinton modus
operandi. And his denial, so carefully parsed, is almost as telling
as the charges themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He lies about everything. Why would anyone think he's not lying
about this?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that Clinton serves out his term, amid a swirl of
mixed emotions. But it is not certain that he will. The
consequences of his acquittal are just beginning to be felt. People
don't like the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of rape has changed the moral arithmetic. It will get
worse before it gets better, because the truth is it will never get
better until Bill Clinton is gone.

BRITON'S FIRST FILM PORTENDS IMMENSE PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I doubt that next March, the creators of ``Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels'' will be standing on the podium at Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. This film is to ``Shakespeare in Love'' what
Green Day is to the San Francisco Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Flawed but scrappy, confusing yet exhilarating, the British-made
``Lock, Stock'' is far from a perfect movie. And it's not for
anyone squeamish about violence. But it is, like Green Day, a
rockin' good time.
</P>
<P>
   With a fine ensemble cast peopled with half-wits and brutes
going by names like Hatchet Harry and Barry the Baptist, ``Lock,
Stock'' is a dark-hearted crime comedy set in London's East End _ a
place that can't be in too many tourist guides. The cast moves
about in gangs, double-crossing each other, stealing, breaking
legs. Male-bonding stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of characters to actually care about, ``Lock,
Stock'' works beautifully as an exercise in joyful anarchy, an
unsentimental roller-coaster ride that is both violent and funny.
Imagine ``A Hard Day's Night'' directed by Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   Director Guy Ritchie, 30, will inevitably be compared to
Tarantino (for ``Reservoir Dogs'') or Danny Boyle (for ``Shallow
Grave'' and ``Trainspotting''), but those filmmakers are all about
the drama, with mere dollops of humor thrown in. ``Lock, Stock'' is
comfortable going for the belly laugh _ lots of them in fact. And
the violence, while always nerve-wrackingly possible, is more
implied than graphically depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of the film is trying to figure out who _ if
anyone _ will be left standing.
</P>
<P>
   The complex plot revolves around a quartet of young
ne'er-do-wells _ Eddy, Bacon, Tom and Soap, all played by virtual
unknown actors _ who plot to make some money by pooling their
resources and giving it to Eddy, who is a well-known card shark.
</P>
<P>
   He enters a high-stakes game with porn king/gangster Hatchet
Harry (P.H. Moriarty), and things go dreadfully wrong. Instead of
winning, Eddy winds up losing in a fixed game, and owing the
gangster nearly half a million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Harry's true goal is to take over the bar run
by Eddy's dad, J.D. (played smartly in a small role by Sting, whose
wife, Trudie Styler, was executive producer of the film). So now
Eddy's not just in danger of losing his life, his dad is ready to
take him to the woodshed.
</P>
<P>
   To get their money back, and avoid having their legs broken by
Harry's henchmen (one of whom is played with surprising alacrity by
English soccer star Vinnie Jones), there isn't much the foursome
wouldn't do. That includes breaking the law: beating a rival gang
to the punch on a heist of both money and plants from hydroponic
marijuana farmers.
</P>
<P>
   After a hail of bullets and high-fives all around, the gang
discovers they have inadvertently also made off with some antique
rifles highly coveted by Harry. It gets _ if you can imagine _ more
complicated from there.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie as both writer and director shows a dazzling talent for
creative camera work, clever plot twists and Cockney dialogue _
although some of that is nearly incomprehensible to Yankee ears (a
portion is even subtitled). Made for a mere $1.6 million, it's
refreshing to see a film that excites without special effects.
</P>
<P>
   But as exhilarating as it is, the galloping pace and cumbersome
number of players start to wear thin towards the end.
</P>
<P>
   The short-attention-span direction could be due to Ritchie's
previous experience as a director of music videos (this is his
first film). But give this kid another great script, a few bucks
and a smaller cast, and there's no telling what he can do.

LIGHTNING SIMPLY ISN'T MY FORTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we enter the spring storm season, I find it reassuring to
know there are scientists dedicating at least part of their
professional lives to the study of lightning, which is the weather
phenomenon that most strikes fear in my otherwise fearless heart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Well, fearless except for all the other stuff that scares the
pazooties off me.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have never been struck by lightning, I'm pleased to disclose,
despite what you may have heard about how that is what made me this
much off plumb. And yet I've always had a healthy respect for its
killer nature. In fact, when my children were small and were scared
by a storm in the night, I was perfectly willing to let them get
under the bed with me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most people, certain fears are silly and inappropriate, such
as the fear of being bitten by a rhinoceros. (Well, unless you try
to steal his or her dinner.) But some things deserve to be feared,
and, as I say, I rank lightning high up on that list, even slightly
above Jerry Springer's TV show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I was pleased to read recently about scientists from the U.S.
Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory who are
studying the electrodynamic processes of lightning. I have no idea
what they mean by electrodynamic processes, but it sounds exactly
like the sort of complicated matter that scientists should worry
about so you and I don't have to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These researchers are reported to be examining measurements of
millions of lightning bolts recorded by a radio receiver aboard a
satellite known as FORTE. Those initials stand for Fast On-orbit
Recording of Transient Events, and despite what that sounds like it
has nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky or Linda Tripp. And I, for
one, am monstrously glad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (This is an aside that I give you permission to skip: Did you
know Lewinsky said recently she was thinking about going to law
school? I bet some social scientist could get a lucrative
government grant to study the admissions policy of any school that
would let her in.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The radio receiver on the FORTE satellite is pretty high tech.
Radio signals associated with lightning last less than one
thousandth of a second, so, FORTE scientists say, the receiver can
make a recording and reset its trigger almost instantaneously. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know lightning is a visible discharge of atmospheric
electricity, but I never thought about it flashing out radio
signals. It strikes me, however, that a radio signal lasting one
thousandth of a second would deliver as much of the Rush Limbaugh
show as I usually can enjoy at one sitting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the FORTE satellite was developed to detect
nuclear detonations and help slow the spread of nuclear weapons.
But Los Alamos physicist Abe Jacobson, who heads the FORTE team,
says lightning ``is of interest to Los Alamos' national security
missions because there is a parallel between the spectrum of
lightning emissions and the electromagnetic pulse created by a
nuclear weapon detonation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See? I'm not crazy to be scared of lightning. It apparently is
sort of like nature's own nuclear arsenal. Yikes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of its orbit, the FORTE satellite makes several passes a
day over South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. But how much
different can killer lightning be in those locations than it is in
the Midwest, where I live and do my best to avoid getting zapped by
bolts from the scary spring sky? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that lightning bolts are like the previously
mentioned Jerry Springer TV show. If you've seen one you've pretty
much seen 'em all. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The voices of vouchers
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The readers write ...
</P>
<P>
   A recent column opposing school vouchers produced _ or provoked,
as the case may be _ an outpouring of e-mail. Here's a sampling
from here, there and yonder:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Every citizen has an investment in public education. Both my
children attended church schools and public schools at different
times in their life. Not all public schools are bad schools. My
disappointments were with the church schools, not the public
school.'' Sheila M. Hopkins, Ohio, sheila.m.hopkins(at)bge.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Education (in public schools) fails miserably. The current
liberal cure is to reduce class size. That ain't the problem. When
we were in school (in the 1950s) classes were larger than they are
now, but we had quality teachers who had, and gave, quality
education. Vouchers make competition. Competition improves
organizations, or they die.'' Thomas W. Moore, Houston,
tmoore(at)pyramid3.net.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Vouchers have been a threat to public education for the
state of Michigan for many years now, thanks to Gov. John. M.
Engler, and continue to threaten the nation as a whole. This is a
'quiet issue' that would have devastating consequences to our
future, our children, should it sneak its way through the national
agenda.'' _ Kathleen Tabor, ktabor(at)mstv.org.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Government is not a restaurant where services are a la
carte. It is a system whereby what is best for the group as a whole
is, in theory at least, the choice that is made. Some, such as
public schools or drinking water, we may choose not to use. But
either way, government has decided that the majority of its
citizens benefit by having that service available.'' David Sattler,
falcon4(at)home.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We are opposed to school vouchers because it will destroy
the public schools. We are in favor of public schools for the
education of all our children.'' Mr. and Mrs. Byrd Harris, Corpus
Christi, Texas, whubler(at)trip.net.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Times, kids, schools and staff have changed, clearly not for
the better. What worked in the past doesn't necessarily work today.
I'm confident the Cleveland, Ohio, schools are not as strong today
as was the case 50 years ago when I attended. Clearly, change is
necessary in most parts of the country.'' Dean Webster,
dwebster01(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You may be right. But for a different reason. Once the
government got its hands on the private schools it would probably
try to teach the same crud it has forced on the public schools. So
I would urge all private and religious schools to be very careful
about taking any government money!'' Douglas B. Doty, Forest Hill,
Md., doty(at)magnus.net.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It's amazing to me that the people who crow the most about
traditional values and have the least patience for
multi-culturalism are so eager to carve society up into a buch of
splinter groups. I've read that the voucher movement got its start
after the Brown vs. Board of Education case that desegregated the
public schools. Though the voucher idea strains for credibility, it
has a bad pedigree.'' Daniel Rosen, sed(at)toad.net.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What has contributed the most to democracy in America from
its conception has been freedom of choice, not the public school
system. This is a phrase, freedom of choice, that liberals love to
use when it applies to issues they're concerned with, but not when
it comes to how parents choose to the educate their children.''
Catherine Matthews, Baltimore, Md., eastmatthews(at)juno.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It is my opinion, based on what I've observed in the public
schools I've worked in and subbed in, that allowing vouchers would
further delineate the 'haves' and the 'have nots.' While a voucher
of $1,500 a year, for example, might nicely ease the burden placed
upon a middle-class family whose child attends private school, this
may not be enough to make it possible for a lower-income child to
attend the same school. The additional $500 or more that the
lower-income parents might have to pay from their own pockets could
be an insurmountable cost.'' Kathy Fink, kdkgfink(at)aol.com.

MATH EMERGES BLINKING INTO THE GLARE OF THE POP WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ When more than a hundred mathematicians from
around the world gathered at the Institute for Advanced Studies
here recently to discuss the work of the French-born mathematician
Andre Weil, no one even mentioned his one achievement that has
affected tens of thousands of people, most of whom have never heard
of him.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, who died in August 1998, was possibly one of the greatest
mathematicians of his age, making fundamental discoveries in number
theory, laying the basis for algebraic geometry and searching for
what he called a Rosetta stone that would establish the unity of
all branches of mathematics. But Weil was not interested in the
utility of his discoveries. ``If you asked Andre to justify
mathematics, he would say that was like trying to explain a
symphony to a deaf person,'' said Armand Borel, a Swiss
mathematician.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Weil's math has had one significant practical consequence.
It helped create the boom in sales of popular books about
mathematics since 1994. That was when a young British mathematician
named Andrew Wiles made headlines around the world by using an idea
developed by Weil and two Japanese mathematicians to solve the most
famous mathematical conundrum in history, Fermat's last theorem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular science books had been doing well for some time, but
after Wiles solved Fermat's theorem the focus swung to
mathematics,'' said George Gibson, president of Walker &AMP; Co., which
publishes the American edition of a best-selling book about Wiles'
work called ``Fermat's Enigma: The Quest to Solve the World's
Greatest Mathematical Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are good stories in math no one has told,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Princeton University press followed up a 1994 book
about the mathematical idea known as ``e'' (the base for natural
logarithms) with a book about the imaginary number ``i'' (the
square root of minus 1), a book of ``adventures in applied
mathematics'' and another on the role of computers in math. Another
book, published this month by Paulo Ribenboim, includes an account
of the mathematical strategy Wiles used to prove the theorem,
written for the layman.
</P>
<P>
   And no less than three American writers are working on popular
books about the concept of zero.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the February issue of the Notices of the
American Mathematical Society, the country's leading mathematics
journal, says ``the present time is a `golden age' for
popularizations of mathematics,'' noting that ``in the past couple
of years one finds that a large number of well-received popular
books on mathematics have appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the new interest in mathematics, the society is
``establishing a public relations effort to help reporters find out
about stories in mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a Web site called What's New in Mathematics at
www.ams.org/new-in-math/.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very striking,'' said Ian Stewart, a British
mathematician at Warwick University who has written 10 popular math
books. ``I used to approach publishers. Now they come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Peter Tallack of Weidenfeld &AMP; Nicolson, a London
firm that has published several popular math works, such books give
readers ``the illusion they are mastering complicated ideas.''

JURY AWARDS $166,000 TO HIV-POSITIVE PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Superior Court jury awarded $166,000 to an
HIV-positive man who sued the University of California at San
Francisco after being denied surgery for a debilitating shoulder
condition.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-2 decision, the jury found that Dr. Franklin Hoaglund,
an orthopedic surgeon, committed malpractice when he declined to
perform shoulder-replacement surgery nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury, after a nearly two-week trial in San Francisco
Superior Court, decided that Hoaglund did not commit discrimination
when he suggested a more conservative approach of physical therapy
for the plaintiff, Steve Iacovino. The surgeon is now retired.
</P>
<P>
   A former technician at the San Francisco Fine Arts Museum,
Iacovino, 47, now lives in Honolulu. After being turned down by
Hoaglund, Iacovino had surgery successfully performed on both
shoulders in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy with the verdict,'' Iacovino said Thursday.
``It's good to have people understand the mechanism of AIDS, and
how it really didn't apply to my having surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very fine doctors at UC. When I was a resident
here and was treated at San Francisco General, the care was
wonderful. That's why I was so shocked about Dr. Hoaglund.''
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed in 1995 with an irreversible bone degeneration called
avascular necrosis, Iacovino said he was in excruciating pain,
unable to lift his arm or dress himself, when he first met with
Hoaglund in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon, without consulting an AIDS specialist, declined to
operate on the grounds that it would put Iacovino at severe risk of
infection because of a low count of the disease-fighting T-cells,
Iacovino said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Iacovino's lawsuit, no credible medical evidence
shows that the risk is greater for a patient with a low tally of
T-cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of this suit is that you have to look at a
number of factors when you are deciding about surgery,'' said Gary
Cloutier, the lawyer who represented Iacovino. ``In an HIV-positive
person, you can't raise T-cell counts as an absolute barrier. This
case demonstrates that HIV status, in and of itself, does not
present a risk factor in having significant surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Giordano, a New York infectious disease specialist
who testified on Iacovino's behalf, said Thursday that HIV does not
put a patient at increased surgical risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician dismissed out of hand that the person was a
(surgery) candidate,'' said Giordano, who runs the AIDS research
program at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center. ``It was a
prejudgment. It was completely inappropriate, especially for a
facility like UCSF which is known for its AIDS treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lucey, the lawyer who represented UCSF and Hoaglund,
said he was pleased that the jury found no discrimination in the
case nor intentional infliction of emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed with their finding of malpractice, but I
respect their decision,'' he said. ``It's unfortunate that this
comes at the end of a distinguished career spanning 30 years. It's
a bitter pill, no question about it.''

MADALYN MURRAY O'HAIR'S DIARIES ATTRACT FEW BIDDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After only four modest bids, the diaries of
vanished atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair will soon be sold as part of
the ongoing liquidation of her estate.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Ingalls, the court-appointed trustee of the estate, has
asked a federal bankruptcy court for a hearing to approve the sale
of the diaries to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest bid to date is from Stanley Main in the amount of
$6,500 cash,'' wrote Ingalls, who said additional bids are still
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls said only four offers were received for O'Hair's diaries
that span more than four decades, with several lengthy gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of personally disappointed. I thought the diaries are
real interesting, and I thought they would have commanded a
price,'' Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   The other bids ranged from $3,000 by the University of Texas to
$5,000 bids by the American Atheists organization, which O'Hair
founded three decades ago, and by the Council for Secular Humanism.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls said that Main, of Austin, Texas, didn't indicate why he
is interested in buying the hand-written journals of O`Hair, who
once described herself as ``America's most-hated woman.''

   ``He came to look. He didn't indicate he was involved with any
organization. He made an offer. That's about all I can say,''
Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   Main did not return a telephone call Friday asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls said the hearing on the sale will probably be next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds will be applied against more than $260,000 in
creditors' claims filed against O'Hair's estate. The biggest
creditor is the Internal Revenue Service, seeking unpaid taxes and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the diaries do not pull a higher bid, O'Hair's assets
total less than $20,000, Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, then 76, and her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin
Murray O'Hair disappeared from Austin in late 1995. They spent
approximately a month in San Antonio and then vanished, along with
$500,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Theories about their disappearance range from kidnapping and
murder to a self-imposed foreign exile with funds skimmed from
their atheist organizations. The FBI and several police agencies
are currently investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls said he is still hopeful that other offers will come.

<P>
   PETALUMA, Calif. _ The client is a big, horsey kind of gal
suffering trauma to her back and hips from a lifetime of
high-stepping.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to her relief is masseuse Dianne Magliulo whose hands and
fingers rub away years of tension as they squeeze and manipulate
tight, sore muscles during a 1 1/2-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just loves this,'' said Magliulo, running her hands over
knotted muscles along the broad back.
</P>
<P>
   The client, a 14-year-old thoroughbred named Impress, seems to
relish the massage, stretching, licking and lowering her head _ all
signs of equine contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's animated now,'' said Impress's trainer John Stanley of
Petaluma. ``She's more receptive to everything because she's
feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the $65 massage _ Impress's third in the last two months
_ has improved her disposition, stamina and physical condition.
She's acting more like a filly than an irritable old mare.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, a former cowboy and athletic coach who now trains and
boards horses on his Petaluma ranch, said Impress was an
award-winning jumper whose muscles and tendons had become stressed
and sore from years of hoof-pounding jumps in show arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Impress' ailments weren't something a veterinarian could treat,
said Stanley. But it was clear she needed something to make her
feel better so she would be more sociable with the other horses on
his ranch.
</P>
<P>
   He called Magliulo, a Penngrove horsewoman certified in equine
sports massage, a growing field in horse care.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more horse people, both lay and professionals, are
recognizing the benefits of deep tissue therapy,'' said Magliulo,
46.
</P>
<P>
   She became certified seven months ago after completing training
at Equinology, a school operated by Debranne Patillo of Windsor.
People from throughout the world come to the Sonoma County school
to learn equine massage therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Magliulo said horses get stiff, tight and sore just like people
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses are tremendous athletes. Approximately 60 percent a
horse's body is muscle and just like humans, a horse's muscles get
overstressed and overused,'' Magliulo said. She said massaging a
horse was as much intuition as physical touch, knowing when to
apply pressure and when to ease off.
</P>
<P>
   For an old cowboy like Stanley, it's just plain old horse sense
that muscles _ whether human or horse _ sometimes need a healing
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse massage is widely used today. It's no longer fringe and
even when it was there were horse owners who were using it and
didn't make it known,'' said the longtime trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Magliulo, a horse enthusiast all of her life, didn't own her
first horse until seven years ago. She believes she has found her
life's calling as an equine masseuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love horses so much. This is a way for me to give
something back to horses who give so much to us without ever asking
anything in return,'' said Magliulo, who works part time in the
family real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   She admits she is more passionate about horses than real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I do is gain the horse's trust,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She starts with the muscles in the nose and ends more than an
hour later by firmly pulling the horse's tail.
</P>
<P>
   When her hands go over a muscle that is tight or sore Impress
stiffens and lifts a leg. Once the kink is worked out, the horse
relaxes again.
</P>
<P>
   Magliulo said the work was as therapeutic for her as it was for
the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``After massaging a horse I feel so pumped up. I feel I have
done something to make them feel better and that's a good
feeling,'' she said.

DOWN TO EARTH IN PARIS

<P>
   PARIS _ Getting into the Chloe show was difficult enough, what
with the crush of television cameras, the snagging cascades of
vines and one hysterical French fashion editor. But then, there she
was. Not a flaming rock star. Not a bosomy actress. Not even Jerry
Hall, who's in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is her,'' said an equally surprised Patrick McCarthy
of Women's Wear Daily, as an editor stopped dead in her tracks
before Camilla Parker-Bowles, the companion of Prince Charles, who
was front and center Wednesday in a demure dark suit at the Chloe
show.
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Parker-Bowles was doing at a French fashion show was
not clear, but suffice it to say that her presence added a strange,
if frenetic, sense of English bonhomie at Chloe, which is designed
by Stella McCartney. Her father, Paul McCartney, was there, and as
he took his seat across from Mrs. Parker-Bowles, he was greeted
with a hug from Marianne Faithfull, the singer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCartney has come into her own as a designer, mixing strong
tailoring with a louche club style. Out came glossy denim trousers
with nail-head tigers on the rear, and lacy camisoles, a Chloe
signature, followed by Stella Tennant in a razor-sharp gray
herringbone pants suit with creamy lace worked into the lapels. Ms.
McCartney's real strength is mixing separates, like a heathery
tweed bustier over a cream off-the-shoulder sweater, the way her
London girlfriends might.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent memory, none of the editors in
chief of the top American fashion monthlies were here, not Anna
Wintour of Vogue or Elizabeth Tilberis of Harper's Bazaar or Bonnie
Fuller of Glamour. But nearly all were at the Italian shows, an
acknowledgment of Milan's advertising clout. ``It's business,
baby,'' said Polly Mellen, an Allure editor who did come to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But Paris. How can one explain the effect this city has on
fashion people, editors, retailers and hangers-on, who after six
straight days of staring at clothes in Milan come here and feel
alive; who start combing their hair differently and think maybe
they'll buy that coat with the Mongolian lamb fluffing madly from
the collar after all; who run over to some place near the Bastille
called Purple, a kind of gallery of new style _ people who, in
effect, live to ``die'' for fashion 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can't explain it without sounding like some poor old
weepy gal planted like a fir tree under Serge Gainsbourg's window.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the front row the other day at the Yohji Yamamoto
show, Ms. Mellen, who began her career in the Diana Vreeland era of
exploding exclamation points, was utterly absorbed, muttering to
herself such words as ``Divine!'' and ``Genius!'' so that her
rapture was almost an unconscious thing. When a model came out
cloaked in mossy green velvet, Ms. Mellen drew back, gasped and
whispered, ``Is that Giselle?'' Ms. Mellen smiled. ``Yes, it is
Giselle,'' she said, her voice settling like butterflies on a
branch.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, what Ms. Mellen and her fashion sisters want _ indeed,
what anyone who cares about fashion wants _ is a sense of crossing
a frontier. They want to stand on the edge of something, to look
out across a forbidding plain of new styles, and experience
emotionally what is essentially an optimistic undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a coincidence that the least dreamy expressions of the
millennium seen this week have belonged to the women _ Veronique
Branquinho, Ann Demeulemeester, Martine Sitbon and Rei Kawakubo of
Comme des Garcons _ rather than to the men?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Alexander McQueen, for example, staged his Givenchy show
Wednesday with models in Martian pancake and frizzled wigs walking
robotlike down a mirrored runway beaming with airport lights. The
collection vividly showcased McQueen's laser-sharp tailoring _
lunar-white trouser suits with crosses etched out in gray fur,
slick coats with the couture equivalent of clear plastic upholstery
covers, silvery leathers and a molded red top that would enhance
any alien bosom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sitbon's message was far more thoughtful and deliberate, and
in its unsentimental refusal to look backward or too far ahead,
modern. She opened her show Wednesday with a high-necked black
jersey dress, inset on one side with a panel of gathered cream
jersey, and proceeded to play with that theme, sending out pleated
black satin skirts with panels of white, some with a graphic band
of orange shooting around the hips like a Dan Flavin neon
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   There were leather skirts with papery flower cut-outs at the hem
and trousers slopping guilelessly over the shoes, a ubiquitous
style this season. But it was in her ingenious use of black
decoration ribbon that Ms. Sitbon summed up a more sober era.
Drizzled on the front of a smocked white blouse, they looked like
old love-letter ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from her relentlessly plain collection of dark blazers
and plaid schoolgirl skirts hiked above one knee with a strap from
the waist, Ms. Branquinho must be a very hard woman. To her,
everything is a nail, and she keeps hammering it until you
eventually grasp that Ms. Branquinho, who is young and Belgian and
apparently shy, is taking on the most cherished of female symbols:
the skirt. She treats it with playful indifference, lifting it
above an underskirt of humble gray cotton or a pair of thick
leggings, and showing its variations with snug jackets and
sweaters, including a purple turtleneck with unknitted strings of
yarn hanging down the front.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Ms. Demeulemeester finessed the well-cut black
pants suits for which she is known, and went Celtic. That meant
brown and gray pinstriped wool dresses wrapped in bunchy folds and
asymmetrical lengths around the body; ribbed trousers and loose
jackets in rough-looking fabrics for her long-haired guys, and
shearling in maxi vests and cave-dweller ponchos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kawakubo is hardly anyone's idea of fun and games. Her shows
tend to be serious, churchlike affairs, with tricky clothes that
perennially test the fashion world's indulgence. But on Tuesday
night in her showroom in the Place Vendome, it was Ms. Kawakubo who
had the last laugh. She opened with some elaborately wrapped
dresses in vivid yellow and red plaid that immediately brought to
mind Vivienne Westwood, tartan queen. Judy Collinson, the general
merchandising manager of Barneys New York, which sells Comme des
Garcons, thought she detected parody, too. And then out came a
fussy brocade dress, cut kimono-style, with an enormous bow.
``Saint Laurent?'' Ms. Collinson conjectured. But of course.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonderful parody of a fashion show, right down to the
bright red runway, the nunlike procession of the models (without
music), and the over-the-top western shoes in hot rodeo colors. But
it was for fashion's glittery gaucheness that Ms. Kawakubo reserved
her sharpest dart. She sent out a long black coat, perfectly
beautiful, with folds of wool rising up toward the chin and a large
safety pin holding the thing closed. It was all very lovely,
Japanese and reverent _ until the model turned and, from beneath
the deep vent, flashed a pair of iridescent gold bloomers straight
out of Vegas. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Paris runways, Emanuel Ungaro showed one of his
better collections in a while. It was full of gypsy skirts and
folkloric prints, and included some terrific jackets in wine and
lavender suede with Mongolian trim that his customers can wear with
plain trousers. Issey Miyake's was typically inventive, with
egg-shaped pleated coats and papery-looking dresses that resembled
crushed flowers (or a dried spitball, if you like), but there was
no real news. As for Ronald Van der Kemp's debut collection
Thursday for Guy Laroche, it was heavy on the sort of colorful,
sparkling clothes that women who don't have great expectations
about fashion usually find thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ghesquiere, on the other hand, bears watching. His
Balenciaga show Thursday was genuine and poetic, with high-necked
coats, modern cuts and tight leather sleeves pushed up the arms. It
made one think of what fashion-besotted convent girls would do if
they got their hands on the priests' frocks.

NEW RULES FOR INTERNET GAMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics in 2nd graf)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Staple-shooting copiers. Career-building
production assistants navigating a busy backlot with a cup of
coffee. A taco maker fending off roaches.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALS)This (END ITALS) is the future of Internet gaming?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, in the twisted but affable inventions of Steve
Zehngut, a former San Fernando Valley boy turned Web game guru.
Zehngut sort of stumbled into business creating Web-based games
particularly for the sites of big corporate clients, such as
Toshiba and Bugle Boy clothing.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a radio, TV and film degree from
California State University, Northridge, Zehngut found he didn't
much like the people he worked with in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But the folks in multimedia were different.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would answer their own phones and talk your ear off,''
Zehngut said. And Zehngut had played a lot of games growing up,
beginning with the Atari 2600 and on every major platform since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all these games, shoeboxes of them,'' Zehngut said. ``I
definitely grew up on games.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining his gaming interests, film training and new-found Web
opportunities, Zehngut eventually started Zeek Interactive (at
www.zeek.com where you can try out all of his company's game
sites), moving it recently from Santa Monica to Seal Beach.
</P>
<P>
   His company is one of the few to use Macromedia's powerful but
complex Flash technology to create online games. Flash creates
files that are small enough to load quickly into a Web browser, but
involving enough to captivate a user for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is to find the cinematic elements in 100 or 150k
(kilobyte-sized game files),'' Zehngut said. ``That's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Zeek's first big breaks came when Toshiba asked him to
create a game for its Web site devoted to a line of copiers. The
result was a wacky game where paper wads and staples fired by the
copiers fight off marauding co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other work has followed, most recently with a deal
with the Fox Family Network to create game sites for 10 of the
cable channel's shows. He also helped create and co-publish a pair
of CD-ROMS with former employer ADout in Van Nuys that use games to
train people how to use major Mac and PC programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my parents and parents of friends said, `Why are
you wasting your time playing games?' '' Zehngut said. ``But it
turned out to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY'RE DRAWN THAT WAY: With Cartoon Network Online, we finally
have a Web site that does what it says it does: put cartoons on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The online spinoff of the cable channel devoted to animation has
started what it calls Webtoons, creating series of animated
adventures that will debut online. If there's enough response,
they'll migrate the characters to full-fledged TV shows, said Sam
Register, the site's vice president and creative director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use this as a laboratory, to test new characters,
new styles, new episodes,'' said Register. ``The Web is the
Nielsens (TV rating service) on steroids. Hopefully we'll see right
off the bat what people are buzzing about. And if something is
buzzing, maybe we'll make another Webtoon, or maybe we'll go right
to TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But Register said Webtoons will take advantage of the Net's
nonlinear nature to add features that can't be replicated on TV,
such as branching narratives that change the story line, depending
on where you click.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, it remains to be seen what will be the standard''
for Web-based cartooning, Register said. ``We are learning so much
about what's working interactively and what's not working. We're
just looking to see how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two sets of Webtoons are already up. One, from
Emmy-winning Gary Panter, is called ``Pink Donkey and the Fly,''
and follows the misadventures of an insect infatuated with, yes, a
pink donkey. The other, ``B. Happy,'' stars a less-than-gleeful
bluebird of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up soon will be a series of shorts based on the old
Hanna-Barbera Studios live-action children's show, ``The Banana
Splits,'' Register said. And expect lots more of the classic, but
visually simple Hanna-Barbera cartoons to start appearing on the
online site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the H-B library is they made (the
original cartoons) cheap for TV, so many of the characters hardly
animate,'' Register said. ``It's like H-B was pre-purposed for the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of places doing animation on the Web in
substantial amounts already, Register acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wired, for instance, started an animation section a few
months ago. And Shock Rave, the showcase site for developers using
Macromedia's Flash and Director software, also features some fun
stuff in its regularly changing galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing it, but the difference is the expertise in
making animation,'' Register said. ``They're technology people, not
animation people. And that's where you really see it. I have a
whole network of people who will tell me if it sucks.''

THEY'VE GOT GAME: The techno-fanatics at Digital Home Entertainment
Magazine dreamed up a particularly fun little exercise recently:
designing the ultimate computer gaming system. The results,
detailed in their winter 1999 issue:
</P>
<P>
   _ An IBM Aptiva SE7 computer, a sleek black beauty housing a 450
Mhz Pentium II brain, a whopping 16.8 Gb hard drive, and an equally
eye-popping 128 Mb of memory. The machine, with a 56-kpbs modem,
respectable ATI Rage Pro Turbo graphics card and DVD-ROM player,
make the SE7 enough computer even for most gamers. But wait,
there's a lot more to this dream system:
</P>
<P>
   _ Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live! sound card, to take the
increasingly sophisticated audio from games and create
three-dimensional sound;
</P>
<P>
   _ Cambridge SoundWorks Desktop Theater 5.1 speaker system, to
reproduce that movielike sound;
</P>
<P>
   _ Intensor Sensory Gaming Chair, literally a chair that vibrates
with the explosions and impacts of your game. You'll be wrung out
from this after a few hours;
</P>
<P>
   _ Union Reality UR Gear Headset, to allow you to do
voice-activated control of games;
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro controller, a very cool
batwing that uses internal sensors to help steer, so you focus on
the shooting buttons and other actions;
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro Joystick, to give you
the feel of a tire blowout in a racing game, or the recoil of a
weapon in that first-person action shooter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Panasonic CT36VG50 36-inch SVGA monitor/TV, a massive hybrid
TV and computer monitor that's also ready to accept HDTV signals if
you want to splurge on a decoder box;

LEGO THE MAIN ATTRACTION AT NEW THEME PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were about imagination, those blue, red and
yellow blocks of plastic. Out of their simple form came castles,
robots and fighter planes _ as fancy or strange as a mind could
make them.
</P>
<P>
   With LEGO, there were no limits.
</P>
<P>
   And now, those primary-colored building blocks are about to
become larger than life. LEGOLAND has come to California.
</P>
<P>
   The 128-acre theme park _ the first in the United States _ opens
in Carlsbad on March 20. It took $130 million and three years to
put together the nearly 30 interactive attractions, family rides
and shows, plus displays of everything from animals to miniature
cities built out of _ what else? _ LEGOS.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bathroom mirror frames are made of the toy blocks.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and you barely see it coming until you walk up the
hill from the parking lot in the business district of this seaside
community of 70,000, located about 30 miles north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The park began to take root in 1994, when a local company, the
Carltas Group, was looking to open a youth-oriented attraction in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlsbad had to compete against some 600 municipalities that
sent proposals to LEGO Group headquarters in Denmark, vying to
become the first U.S. LEGOLAND, said Marianne Flowers, the park's
director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsbad, however, had something to offer that many of the
others did not: It's within a two-hour drive of most of Southern
California, a region accustomed to world-famous theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a strong tourist base,'' Flowers said. ``The company
was looking for an area that could accommodate year-round
operation; our weather here is perfect for that. And Californians
are theme-park goers.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some work, though, to convince Carlsbad residents _ who
worried LEGOLAND would turn the community into a congested tourist
town _ that the park would be a good thing, recalls Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to every civic organization, attended many
breakfasts,'' she said. ``We assured them that we were dedicated to
children and their families. This would not be a teen-age
hangout.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. In a recent preopening-day trial run, families
of park builders were invited to come see the new attraction. And
while many of the activities are geared toward children ages 2 to
12, kids of all ages said they had a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said Sheree Rouse of Escondido, who was there
with her husband and two children. ``It makes me want to go home
and play with my LEGOS.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Shinn, a first-grade teacher at Holmes Elementary School in
San Diego, took her class on a LEGOLAND field trip during a recent
test day and admits she was amazed by the park. ``I thought it was
wonderful. I think the Miniland was really exciting. The kids had a
wonderful, wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world increasingly fixated on all things high-tech, the
park offers just the opposite _ simple wonders. &QL;

A PARK OF MANY LANDS, MANY THEMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like Disneyland, LEGOLAND is divided into themed
lands. Here are some highlights: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MINILAND: This is the heart of the park. You'll see LEGO replicas
of America's most famous landmarks _ from the New York skyline and
San Francisco's ``painted ladies'' to Mann's Chinese Theater and
the nation's capital. Enjoy sunbathers on the beach, the Hollywood
Bowl (complete with full orchestra and filled seats) and the
Griffith Observatory. The boats, trains, wagons, cars _ all the
vehicles in Miniland _ are animated, controlled by 12 computers
that use 300,000 yards of wire underground. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VILLAGE GREEN: It was designed to resemble the imaginary garden of
a child, featuring a boat ride through favorite childhood fairy
tales along Fairy Tale Brook; life-size giraffes, zebras, lions and
more (all made of LEGO) in the Safari Trek; and Waterworks, an
interactive water play area. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE LAKE: Visitors embark on a ``world tour,'' featuring the
international Coast Cruise. While traveling along the lakeshore,
you'll see animated LEGO models ranging from dinosaurs to
octopuses, along with some curious figures out of history. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE RIDGE: Here you'll climb aboard Sky Cycle, a zany pedal car
that travels on a roller coaster-like track, propelled by _ you
guessed it _ you and a partner. The faster you pedal, the faster
your vehicle moves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FUN TOWN: The land geared to the young adventurer. Kids ages 3 to
12 get to experience the exhilaration of driving a car just like an
adult. Young drivers travel along scaled-down streets, complete
with stop signs and signals. After completing the driving course,
they are entitled to a LEGOLAND driving license. This neighborhood
also houses the LEGO Factory, where you will see a miniature
version of LEGO production.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CASTLE HILL: Made for anyone who's ever dreamed of knights,
princesses and dragons. Take a ride on the Dragon, a gravity
coaster that travels through the LEGOLAND castle; let your
youngsters take a stab at riding a LEGO horse on a simulated joust;
or let them pan for gems at the King's Treasure.

FLORIDA ORANGE CROP DOWN MORE THAN 20 PERCENT

 By MATTHEW SAUER   
 The Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ True to federal predictions issued in October,
Florida's orange crop is down more than 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the drop has brought a 10 percent increase in
prices. For Bill Ferrari, vice president of procurement for
Tropicana, the drop has yielded a challenging season.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Florida's orange crop is used in juices. To meet his
company's needs, Ferrari must arrange to buy about 25 percent of
this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari remembers well Oct. 9, when the U.S. Department of
Agriculture predicted this season's crop would drop 22 percent to
190 million 90-pound boxes, which is the standard of measure in the
citrus industry. The 1997-98 season produced 244 million 90-pound
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the USDA released updated figures that put the
orange crop at 192 million 90-pound boxes. That figure shows how
accurate the department has become with its predictions issued each
October.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari said when one of his procurement workers brought him the
number in October, he had trouble believing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought the number in on a piece of paper to look at,''
Ferrari said. ``I thought, `This is the early-mid-crop estimate.
Where's the rest of the crop?' She says, `No, no, this is the
number.' I stared at it and I literally waited until I got a second
confirmation before I sent ... e-mail out to the whole company. I
later apologized to her for not believing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., has adjusted accordingly,
increasing the fruit and juice it purchases from outside of its
traditional 250 suppliers and, like its competitor, Coca Cola
Co.-owned Minute Maid, raising prices 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average supermarket price of orange juice, as of
mid-February, was $4.26 per gallon, the highest it has been in
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The crop shortage has been worse than any freeze. But such are
the vagaries of procuring fruit for one of the world's largest
juice makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we had the largest _ not percentage wise _ but the
largest absolute volume drop in boxes,'' Ferrari says. ``When
you're faced with that and you're as reliant on the Florida crop as
we are for your product, you can't go to an offshore source.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a challenge this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana, which is based in Bradenton, has a procurement
department of about 20 employees, including 14 field workers who
work directly with growers. Ferrari, 45, has held his procurement
job for about nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The field workers determine daily how many loads of fruit are
needed for Tropicana, which has major plants in Bradenton and Fort
Pierce. They also test and document crops, using a 3-year-old
database.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their jobs have changed over the years,'' Ferrari says. ``They
will already start sampling and testing next year's crop probably a
month after this one is over. We try to get an early start on being
able to predict what that next year's fruit crop will look like.''
</P>
<P>
   That helps Tropicana's plant managers know how to use stored
juice to maintain a consistent quality.
</P>
<P>
   The number of field workers has shrunk as the citrus industry
has moved south and consolidated. The company had nearly 30 such
jobs in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Three of today's workers replaced their retiring fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of field reps were born and raised in the areas they're
working with, so they know a lot of these growers,'' Ferrari says.
``They went to school with them and played with them as kids.
That's an important part of our area, the relationships built up
with the growers. It helps get through the difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   When Anthony Rossi, Tropicana's founder, picked the Bradenton
and Fort Pierce plant sites, some in the citrus industry thought it
odd.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossi proved prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's citrus belt has moved south after devastating freezes,
putting Rossi's plants in the thick of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came down in '82, Orlando was kind of the center of the
industry. Our two plants were considered way south,'' Ferrari says.
``Now, our two plants, which are almost directly across from one
another, are right in the middle ... You couldn't have picked
better locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some growers have been with Tropicana for more than 30 years.
Their citrus holdings range in size from five acres to 40,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, with a boom in plantings, Tropicana bought
about 20 million boxes of fruit each year from about 700 growers.
While it now buys more than twice the number of boxes, its base of
growers has shrunk to about 250 with the consolidation of the
growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana often buys all of a grower's crop.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts set a floor price and generally run from three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Tropicana will offer longer contracts to try to
encourage growers to plant. The stability of a 10- or 15-year
contract gives a grower better borrowing leverage with banks. It
can often take five years just to get any cash flow from a grove,
Ferrari says.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana has encouraged growers to plant more valencia trees.
Valencias are the mainstay for Tropicana's Pure Premium,
not-from-concentrate juices. The late-ripening orange is prized for
adding color and flavor to Pure Premium throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Valencias typically do not have the same crop yield as other
varieties of citrus and can create cash-flow problems for growers
because of their late development, but they generally garner a
price premium from juicers.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari is looking forward to the end of the season this summer.
He's hopeful that next year's crop will be larger.
</P>
<P>
   He's still reeling from this year's drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing that number was just a shock,'' Ferrari says.

&HT;        BILL TO EXPAND FEDERAL HATE CRIMES LAW INTRODUCED BY
LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By C.J. Karamargin  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 12 -- James Byrd, Jr. was killed in Jasper,
Texas last June because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Matthew Shepard was killed in Laramie,
Wyoming because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month, Billy Jack Gaither was killed on the banks
of a river where baptisms are performed in rural Alabama because
he, too, was a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The three high-profile murders were cited by a bipartisan group
of lawmakers and Vice President Al Gore Thursday as reason to
expand the federal laws covering hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the nation's outrage over the treatment of Rosa Parks
helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, I
believe that revulsion over these incidents will galvanize the
public and lend support for hate crimes legislation,'' said Rep.
John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI).
</P>
<P>
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would extend the current federal
hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation, gender and disability.
The current law covers crimes motivated by racial, religious and
ethnic prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Introduction of the act comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee
prepares to hold what are expected to be a series of emotional
hearings on hate crimes next month.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the hearings on Tuesday, Chairman Orin Hatch
(R-Utah) said he has ``become increasingly shocked and appalled by
the level of visciousness associated with a type of criminal
activity that is bigoted, ugly and downright un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   When the committee held hearings on a similar bill last July,
Hatch said that despite his belief the federal government has a
role to play in fighting hate crimes, there are disagreements about
what that role should be.
</P>
<P>
   That previous bill, as well as companion legislation in the
House, never got out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by 120 members of Congress, the act introduced
Thursday would make it easier for federal authorities to get
involved in hate crime cases by loosening what Gore called
``needless jursidictional requirements'' that now leaves state and
local officials with the primary responsibility to prosecute the
perpetrators of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 10 states do not have hate crime laws and another 21
states do not mention sexual orientation as a category for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This omission prompted Elizabeth Birch, executive director of
the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based gay and lesbian
lobbying group, to urge Congress to pass the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a key component of the
effort to reduce hate crimes, and it sends the message that hate
motivated violence against minorities has no place in Amercia,''
she said. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), co-sponsor of the act in the
Senate with Sen. Arlen Specter ((R-PA), called the current law
inadequate and said ``the federal government has been forced to
fight hate crimes with one hane tied behind its back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill does not undermine the role of states in
investigating and prosecuting hate crimes,'' Kennedy said. ``States
will continue to take the lead. But the full power of federal law
should also be available to investigate, prosecute and punish these
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the act, Kennedy said, ``will make the federal
government a full partner in the battle against hate crimes.''

<P>
   PURSUIT _ WEST PALM, BEACH, Fla. _ Smuggling immigrants into
Florida is a money-making enterprise. It's becoming a booming
business as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers
equipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances
of reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40
Haitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last
weekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of
putting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector
has less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency
hasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that
period, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,
doubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.
Unfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of
agents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,
California, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector
has 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;
Tucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2
million; San Diego is $178 million. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) 60

   BRYOSTATIN _ WASHINGTON _ The presence of a group of
single-celled animals called bryozoans in underwater sand just off
Fort Pierce, Fla., didn't matter to anybody until concern about the
animals' future caused a federal judge last week to temporarily
halt Corps of Engineers work to renourish the beach. However, to
one of the world's largest drug companies and a group of
scientist-divers who scour the ocean floor for substances that
might be converted into useful medicines, the word bryozoans stirs
excitement. Bryostatin, a drug derived from relatives of Fort
Pierce's sandy creatures, is being tested on human volunteers as a
possible new class of cancer drug, one that seems to act on
particularly stubborn forms of the disease. Some drug industry
analysts say it may have a market worth $1 billion a year if it is
ultimately licensed. Environmentalists fighting the beach
renourishment project say it is typical of the treasures that could
be destroyed forever if such projects are not undertaken with great
care for the environment. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

effect five years ago. But to get what they want, border counties

have a new vote. One parish is trying to annex some other town to
get its machines. This likely will be an issue in the legislature,
and already there is a court battle brewing with a May trial date
on whether the vote was legal in the first place. Real issue here
is, once you've let gambling in, how do you ask it to leave?

TV DOCUMENTARY DEVOTED TO WAR EFFORTS OF WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, March 14 by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(``Tonight'' refers to Sunday, March 14)  
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Say you were an alien and knew virtually nothing
about World War II. If you learned about America's ``Good War''
only through the current films ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The
Thin Red Line,'' you'd think women had no role in the war.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wrong. Tonight, cable TV's History Channel will show
America something Hollywood hasn't: the real and fascinating story
of women who served in World War II. ``Free a Man to Fight'' tells
the story of women who became mechanics, pilots and officers and
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being hailed as heroes as male GIs were, they were too
often chided and forgotten by their fellow citizens, and even their
families. A few have managed to produce books, but their stories
remain largely unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that we have to rewrite ourselves back into
history,'' says Josette Dermody Wingo, who wrote the memoir
``Mother Was a Gunner's Mate'' and came to know ``Free a Man''
director and producer Mindy Pomper through the film.
</P>
<P>
   Pomper was herself startled when she stumbled across the story.
``I went to the Burbank Aviation Museum to see some Tuskeegee
Airmen talking there,'' Pomper recalls. ``They had great stories,
but they said they were already working with George Lucas on a
movie,'' continues Pomper, ``so they were tied up. But then, at the
end of the evening, they said a thank you to the female air pilots
who participated in World War II. And I said, `What?!'''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, after conducting dozens of interviews and
running up her credit cards to help finance the film, Pomper
finished ``Free.'' Meanwhile, the multimillion-dollar studio films
``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line'' are vying with
expensive ads for a combined 18 Academy Awards between them.
</P>
<P>
   These big studio movies tend to have one thing in common: They
have virtually no female roles of any substance. Mrs. Ryan, the
soldier's mother, is a faceless icon in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
Agents reportedly were so desperate to get their female clients
into ``Thin Red Line'' that they were fighting for the opportunity
to have actresses play the single female character who has more
than a minute of screen time: a nonspeaking role, seen only in a
few gauzy flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of war films that include women is largely due to
ignorance, say women who have studied and written about the
subject. ``Men truly don't know about these stories; it's not like
there's a cabal of men intentionally keeping these stories out of
Hollywood,'' says author Susan Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs wrote ``Shining Through,'' a novel about a woman who
becomes a spy in World War II. Though Hollywood did make the book
into a movie, the female character (played by Melanie Griffith)
became more passive and more stereotypically ``feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara McPherson, professor of critical studies at USC's School of
Cinema-Television, says she has an idea why women aren't being
included in these big war films. ``There is a kind of narrowness
among filmmakers, of not being able to imagine women outside of
traditional roles,'' McPherson says.
</P>
<P>
   She continues, ``I think the problem goes beyond these (war)
films: There seems an unwillingness on the part of studios to make
movies that aren't blockbusters. In general, that doesn't serve
women well.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-male casts of most war films would seem to further cut
down on the already small pool of strong female acting parts. ``I
noticed this year that the male nominees for the (Screen Actors
Guild) awards tended to be in bigger pictures, while the women were
in smaller films,'' says Rafe Greenlee, a SAG spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Award nominations tend to recognize work in ``arty'' films. But
big-budget, high-minded war films like ``Private Ryan'' can allow
actors the best of both worlds. That is, a healthy paycheck
!ital!and !off! critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Figures compiled by SAG show that for 1997 (the last full year
for which figures are available), there were 1,232 men hired for
lead roles vs. 736 women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of days worked by males vs. females in lead roles is
even more slanted: Men worked a total of about 35,000 days, nearly
double the 17,800 days worked by women.
</P>
<P>
   This reflects the fact that even when women do have ``lead''
roles, those roles are somewhat smaller and tend to be in
smaller-budgeted films with shorter shooting schedules.
</P>
<P>
   John Burman, who tracks stars' ``bankability'' for the Hollywood
Reporter's Star Power report, says women are catching up, to some
degree, but only at the very top. ``It's getting better at the
rarified air level, among stars who get the very top salaries,''
Burman said. He cited recent reports that Julia Roberts is getting
$20 million for her next movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jodie Foster or Julia Roberts wanted to do (a war-themed
picture), I think it could be done. But I think it would still be a
bit of an uphill battle, and it almost certainly wouldn't be a $70
million picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Creative Artists Agency and the William
Morris Agency, two of the top talent agencies in Los Angeles,
declined to discuss the status of roles for women in film. Those in
the business who are willing to discuss the subject, though, tend
to agree with Burman that it's up to top female stars to seek out
strong roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put the most commercial names in a picture that we
can,'' said Pamela Pickering, head of Mutual Film International
(Mutual developed and co-produced ``Saving Private Ryan.'') She
added: ``God help me if I champion a strong woman's role, and the
movie doesn't end up doing any business. Then I'm out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said there are several ``compelling'' scripts about
female war correspondents making the rounds. For the most part,
though, scripts overwhelmingly seem to categorize females as ``the
subject of violence, as a bitch, as fluff-heads,'' Pickering said
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   Pomper hopes her documentary ``Free a Man'' will open some eyes
in the real world _ and in Hollywood. ``You have to take into
account what the public wants. But it's kind of a chicken-and-egg
sort of thing,'' Pomper said. ``If you show good stories with
strong female roles, people will be interested.''

FBI FEARS MISSING WOMAN, TWO GIRLS ARE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>

   EL PORTAL, Calif. _ When the toughest question came, Jens Sund
couldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   Does the family believe his wife, daughter and their Argentinian
friend were still alive?
</P>
<P>
   The FBI believes Carole Sund, 42, her daughter, Julie, 15, and
Silvina Pelosso, 16, a friend from Cordoba, Argentina, were the
victims of a violent crime and probably are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Maddock, FBI special agent-in-charge, said his 50
investigators have all but eliminated a theory that the three were
involved in an accident while traveling in the rugged, twisting
mountain roads near Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund amd the two girls vanished Feb. 15 from the Cedar
Lodge, a restaurant and motel in El Portal on the western edge of
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a credit card wallet insert belonging to Carole Sund
was found on a street in nearby Modesto, about 80 miles west of the
park, the FBI continues to search dozens of abandoned gold mines,
gorges and hills using all-terrain vehicles and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one possibility left, Maddock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that we feel almost certain that the women were
the victims of a violent crime,'' Maddock said. ``We are now
focusing on one theory that we believe to be the most likely
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scenario includes a violent crime occurring at or near the
Cedar Lodge on the evening of Monday, Feb. 15, or during the early
morning hours of Tuesday, Feb. 16.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jens Sund left a meeting with the FBI looking worn
and drawn, saying he was devastated by what he was told.
</P>
<P>
   But it was news he had heard before, perhaps not willing to let
it sink in.
</P>
<P>
   Sund sparked a news media frenzy Wednesday by implying that
there had been a major development in the case. He apologized
Thursday and said he was reacting to the tremendous stress of it
all. He returned to his home in Eureka for a visit with his other
children, promising to return for a Sunday vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Maddock declined to say what investigators told the Sund and
Pelosso families that upset Jens Sund so much. But Maddock said
investigators were making ``substantial'' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not arrested anyone,'' Maddock said. ``No one has been
charged in connection with the missing persons. We have not
recovered the missing people. We have not found the car.''

BACK WHEN POP WAS PUNK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IGGY POP: BEHIND THE MUSIC 
When: Sunday at 9 p.m. Program repeats March 19 at 1 p.m. and March
20 at 2 a.m. 
On: VH-1 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Some people thought I was arrogant; some people thought I was
crazy; some people thought I was funny. All were correct,'' Iggy
Pop tells his interviewer during VH1's ``Iggy Pop: Behind the
Music.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 18, he'd been drunk, been in a car crash,
been in jail. By the time he was 21, in 1968 with his Ann Arbor,
Mich.-based rock band the Stooges, he became what might be called
an anti-rock star: a bare-chested, coiled spring of a singer who
corkscrewed across stages, goaded audiences, and exposed himself.
His autobiography was called ``I Need More.'' His theme song might
be ``Gimme Danger'': ``Gimme danger little stranger / And I'll feel
your disease''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of everything I've done onstage,'' Pop says in the
hourlong musical documentary. He saw what the Doors' Jim Morrison
did onstage and upped the ante. His early music, concocted as the
hippie dream was coming apart, was harsh and nasty, expressing rage
and futility. At the time, it went largely unheard. Says Pop: ``We
did really well with social deviants, high school dropouts, people
with lousy jobs, alcoholics, drug addicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the mid-'70s, punk rock exploded and Pop got a new
lease on life. He was the godfather of it all. ``We changed the
playing field of what was cutting edge,'' Pop says.
</P>
<P>
   Pop _ born James Osterberg, once called Iggy Stooge _ has led a
fascinating life, for what he's accomplished and endured (massive
amounts of drugs and self-abuse) and, simply, for surviving. If the
Rolling Stones' Keith Richards has topped everyone's Next Rocker to
Die list for a couple of decades, Iggy Pop _ the proud,
self-proclaimed ``world's forgotten boy'' of ``Search and Destroy''
_ has been right behind him.
</P>
<P>
   VH1 producers Jeff Gaspin, George Moll, and Gay Rosenthal have
put together a highly entertaining hour, with Pop serving as the
older-but-wiser tour guide to his own tattered life. The show draws
upon interviews with former Stooges, mentor-savior-collaborator
David Bowie, his discoverer Danny Fields, and others. The most
notable other would be Iggy's son, Eric Benson (he took his
mother's last name), who looks and sounds very much like his pop,
and went through many of the same highs and lows. (The two work
together now; Eric has helped protect his dad onstage and may
become his road manager.) Top-flight Rolling Stone writer David
Fricke provides critical context.
</P>
<P>
   But the title of the VH1 series is ``Behind the Music,'' and one
wishes that the producers had gotten behind the music. What was
Pop's motivation, besides the bottled-up anger and resentment of
his youth? Bowie jokes about their move to West Berlin _ they went
to the heroin capital of Europe to kick heroin addiction _ and Pop
says their work schedule was this: two-day binge, two-day recovery,
three days of music. Which is fair enough, but how does that
schedule accommodate the groundbreaking ``Lust for Life'' and ``The
Idiot'' albums that were recorded there? There's a larger issue
about the relationship between the drug-taking and the
music-making: How did so much vital music get made while these guys
were seriously messed up? What is the relationship between drugs
and creativity? What about the vicarious ride the audience gets
from the performer's tightrope walk? How about Pop's linkage of
hedonism and nihilism? What about Pop's transition from an angry
man to a more contemplative, philosophical one?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than explore these topics, ``Behind the Music'' skips
from one drug-phase-and-recovery to another
drug-phase-and-recovery. The bulk of the show dwells on the 1970s _
Pop's most fertile period _ but when it jumps into the '90s and his
relative commercial success, it's presented almost as a rushed
afterthought. Oh yes, he had a hit with ``Real Wild Child,'' got a
boost when ``Lust for Life'' was used in ``Trainspotting'' and Nike
picked ``Search and Destroy'' to peddle overpriced sneakers. Pop,
speaking on having his music used in ads: ``My policy is: Use 'em
for sausages, use 'em for cars. I do not care. They were not
commercially conceived.'' We learn that his relationship with his
wife, Suchi, which may have saved his life and career, is now over,
and Iggy Pop, at 51, is looking for love again.

SLOW START DOESN'T DIMINISH SPIELBERG INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO: STEVEN SPIELBERG 
Executive producer and host: James Lipton 
On: Bravo 
Date: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One learns a lot about Steven Spielberg, both the filmmaker and
the candid and likably engaging man, in Sunday's special
two-hour-plus edition of ``Inside the Actors Studio'' (on Bravo at
8). But be prepared. It takes a while for the show to get into gear
and for the understated Spielberg to wrest the event from the
interview series's dourly histrionic host James Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   The self-admiring host occupies nearly five fawning minutes
introducing the abashed-looking director, but it's worth enduring
this and his William Buckley-ish interrogation. ``Is it safe to say
your parents played a significant role in shaping the major
interests in your life?'' is a typically ornate query, delivered
with theatrical drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg himself is refreshingly unaffected. The interview
format is stiff, following its subject chronologically from
childhood through his major movies, but, because of Spielberg's
good humor, never stifling. Like his best movies, ``E.T.'' and
``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' Spielberg expresses a
childlike openness to experience and a gently percolating joie de
vivre.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he does say that his musical mother and technically
oriented father are perhaps the principal influences on his work.
He explains the parental roots, for instance, of the finale of
``Close Encounters'' in which a high-tech language of musical tones
and flashing electronics bridges our world to that of the innocent,
visiting aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg readily admits his near-phobic nature inherited from a
mother ``afraid of everything.'' He fears elevators, furniture with
feet, and, he says in regard to ``Jaws,'' not sharks so much as
water itself and what it conceals.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ambitious sweep of the interview, interesting
ideas and experiences are rarely developed completely. Some of his
success Spielberg attributes to creative looseness, a receptiveness
to the possibilities suggested by accidents on location, an
openness to improvisation. ``I always covet my second thoughts,''
he says tantalizingly, but the subject is accorded limited time.
</P>
<P>
   But even truncated musings like this are valuable for their own
sake and, often, for the way Spielberg unguardedly reveals himself.
He talks a little about his refusal to rehearse actors, believing
that ``fear produces extraordinary moments'' on film. He generously
praises collaborators and credits the late Francois Truffaut, the
great French director who appeared in ``Close Encounters,'' for
nudging him toward ``E.T.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg gets off his goofiest line when asked if E.T. was a
boy or girl: ``E.T. is a plant, a botanical garden,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The prolific, successful, and wealthy director never sounds
self-congratulatory. In the Q-and-A session with drama students
that concludes Lipton's interviews, Spielberg talks about his
image, but only because he's asked to. His disarming response is
worth repeating. ``I don't see myself the way you may, as a famous
person. If I see myself as you see me, I'll have to retire _ I'll
be imitating the person you think I am.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be considered that Spielberg's benevolent ease, if not
his sharp memory and storytelling gift, has something to do with
Lipton's fulsome praise. In only one example, the host calls the
sometimes powerful but conventionally nostalgic ``Saving Private
Ryan'' a ``truly enduring 20th-century work of art.'' Lipton does
much the same thing with the actors he presents on other shows,
often resulting in cloying public love-ins. But while Spielberg
doesn't deflect the endless compliments, he pays scant attention,
concentrating on the frequently lively topics at hand.
</P>
<P>
   While no deeply critical probing takes place, Lipton manages to
mine intriguing information and wonderful anecdotes, and to reveal
interesting, unconscious connections among Spielberg's widely
varied movies. Whatever posterity says about Spielberg as a film
artist, he comes across as a generous, well-meaning man and an
earnestly dedicated, tremendously enthusiastic professional.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As members of New York's social establishment took
their seats at the annual winter gala for the Whitney Museum of
American Art, Andre Harrell was perplexed. Sitting beneath a giant
orb of white carnations, Harrell, a rap producer, gazed upon guests
like Ronald O. Perelman, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Martha Stewart,
and asked: ``What is this about? And what does this have to do with
hip-hop?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Harrell, a guest of Russell Simmons of Def Jam
Records, had come to hear brief performances by Gloria Gaynor, the
disco queen, and Foxy Brown, a teen-age hip-hop sensation, at what
was billed as Brite Nite at the Whitney. ``It's probably timely in
the sense that hip-hop is becoming mainstream,'' Harrell said,
while Ms. Brown, in an olive micro-minidress that revealed the
tattoos on her upper chest, chatted nearby. ``I guess it's a way to
take an Upper East Side crowd and make it hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. In addition to a dinner committee composed of the
museum's chairman, Leonard Lauder, and other leaders of commerce
and the arts, Brite Nite, which raised almost $1.4 million, was
organized by a second committee, responsible for an after-dinner
dance. Its members, luminaries from fashion, hip-hop and the
downtown club world, were asked to send invitations to the $75
after-party to their friends, representing the museum's attempt to
get a younger and hipper crowd to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell L. Anderson, the Whitney's director, made no apologies
for the unlikely after-dinner committee, which included Marcus
Schenkenberg, a former Calvin Klein model; Jade Jagger, a jewelry
designer and a daughter of Mick Jagger, and Jeffrey Jah, a promoter
for Life, a nightclub. ``I used to take dancing lessons in eighth
grade, at the Pierre,'' Anderson said. ``New York is changing. All
kinds of people are making their way into society.'' He declared
the sold-out dinner for 550 _ with tickets at $1,000 and up _ and
the packed dance to be the Whitney's most successful party.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the latest in a series of efforts by old-line New
York cultural institutions to embrace the realms of fashion and pop
culture with the express purpose of adding sex appeal to their
images. In fall 1997, the Whitney opened a show of Andy Warhol's
work with a gala featuring Duran Duran. The Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum has an underwriting deal with the fashion company Hugo Boss,
which has led to such promotions as one in which 100 Neiman Marcus
executives and buyers were asked to wear biker gear at the time of
the museum's ``Art of the Motorcycle'' exhibition last summer. An
exhibition catalog was awarded to the store executive with the best
biker outfit.
</P>
<P>
   And last December, the Guggenheim put on a lunch and a somewhat
airy discussion of style in art and fashion, attended by 30 fashion
designers, including Michael Kors and Diane Von Furstenberg. ``We
wanted to get the `in crowd' of society,'' said Gina Rogak, the
Guggenheim's director of special events, ``by bringing in a fashion
element and seating designers at every table.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hartley, the director of communications and sponsorship for
the Guggenheim, said bluntly: ``We are in the entertainment
business and competing against other forms of entertainment out
there. We have a Guggenheim brand that has certain equities and
properties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing these cross fertilizations, we get a crowd that
perhaps doesn't typically come to Guggenheim openings,'' he added.
``But if they are here for a party and happen to look at the art
and come back again, that's valuable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some museum-goers question whether borrowing the patina of chic
has anything to do with art, and whether such extravagant parties
make a difference. ``It's becoming more about the people and less
about the art,'' said William Corbin, a restaurant marketing
consultant, who said he moved from the Upper East Side to Chelsea
expressly to be near the exploding gallery scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art seems conspicuously absent from the
trend; its main effort to attract young patrons is through its
Junior Associates group, whose activities are narrowly art-related.
``We get lots of young people coming to the openings for the art
without any further enhancement,'' said Mary Lou Strahlendorff, a
spokeswoman.

   But even an institution as traditional as the Museum of the City
of New York, where many of the patrons are from old-line families
with names like Astor and Pulitzer, has dipped into youth culture.
Last June, the museum held one of its most successful openings for
``Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks,'' the African-American
photographer. The event was supported on the invitation by Sean
``Puffy'' Combs, the rap entrepreneur, and Spike Lee, the director,
both listed as members of the honorary committee. It drew more than
1,000 attendees, more than double the museum's average.

<P>
   Tiffany Dubin, the director of Sotheby's fashion department,
likes the diverse crowds that museums are embracing, even if things
are sometimes confusing. Ms. Dubin, a young woman recognizable by
her perfect chin-length bobbed hair and Empire-style dresses, was
on the cover of Town &AMP; Country magazine in January. She met a few
nights before Brite Nite to plan the after-dinner party with some
other committee members, among them Amy Sacco, the owner of Lot 61,
a hip lounge in Chelsea, and Avi Adler, a floral designer of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   As the others discussed Twilo, a downtown dance club where the
well-known deejay Junior Vasquez presides over an all-night
Saturday party, Ms. Dubin, who rarely ventures below 50th Street,
looked blank. ``I've never heard of these places,'' she said. But
she was eager to welcome the new crowd sought by the Whitney. ``The
people going now are interesting,'' she continued. ``Fund-raisers
in the past have been stereotyped as ladies who lunch and spend
days attending meetings, which is less enticing for my generation,
who work and do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Four nights later, following the seated dinner, the Brite Nite
crowd descended from the fourth floor to the third, where Foxy
Brown belted out a song from her hit record ``Chyna Doll,'' and
Kennedy approached the stage just as she finished. He said he was a
big fan. ``I was in Korea two weeks ago and couldn't sleep,'' he
said. ``I turned on the television and saw Foxy doing `Hot Spot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brandywine, a bewigged drag queen, darted through the
pitch-black party space, as the Earl of Albemarle escorted Princess
Olga of Greece. Club kids, a few wearing wedge-heeled boots with
long dresses, gathered near the sound stage to boogie to the sounds
of Funkmaster Flash, the deejay.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Bushnell, the author of ``Sex in the City,'' surveyed
the room and said, ``If Edith Wharton were around today, instead of
the opera she'd be going to the Whitney.''

from the Style section for use Sunday, March 14, and thereafter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FUBU-FASHION (New York) _ Fubu stands for ``For us, by us.'' The
company, which was founded in 1992, has prospered by promoting
itself as a black-owned fashion label by and for young urban men.
The founders, Daymond John, Carl Brown, Keith Perrin and J.
Alexander Martin, all from Hollis, N.Y., insist that ``For us, by
us'' is not a call to racial empowerment, but clearly race is part
of their appeal. Last year, the company says it sold a stunning
$350 million worth of goods, which catapults it beyond a niche
market into a league with labels like Donna Karan ($670 million)
and Tommy Hilfiger ($847 million.) By Leslie Kaufman. Photo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIGARETTE-LOUNGE (Undated) _ These days cigarette girls have
gone the way of Gibson girls. And not only is smoking outlawed now
in most New York restaurants, but so is the sale of individual
cigarettes. That is why cigarette girls aren't employed at Circa
Tabac, billed as the city's only ``cigarette lounge.'' But it
certainly has everything else a smoker could desire. There's a full
bar, an interesting selection of appetizers (in order to avoid
being classified as a restaurant, it does not serve entrees), an
international cigarette menu with more than 100 brands, and every
kind of antique cigarette accessory imaginable _ from holders,
cases and lighters to a roll-your-own maker from the 1920s. By Alex
Witchel. Photo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHITNEY-YOUTH (New York) _ The Whitney museum sponsored a Brite
Nite event recently, which raised almost $1.4 million. Luminaries
from fashion, hip-hop and the downtown club world, were asked to
send invitations to the $75 after-dinner party to their friends, in
the museum's attempt to get a younger and hipper crowd to support
it. By Susan M. Kirschbaum. Photo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MODELS-FILMS (New York) _ Filmmakers have been down this road
many times, smitten by stars of the runways and cosmetics
advertisements and casting them for publicity value or in hopes
that their stunning beauty will rivet viewers. But experience
suggests a hard lesson. The model Angie Everhart has twice played a
hooker _ in ``Jade'' (1995) and ``Bordello of Blood'' (1996) _ but
neither performance hooked audiences. The appearance of Elle
Macpherson in ``If Lucy Fell'' in 1996 prompted some to suggest a
new name for the film, ``If Elle Could Act.'' By Jared Paul Stern.

</P>
<P>
   SIKH-NITEOUT (New York) _ Vikram Chatwal, 27, is one of those
people who uses the word ``slash'' suspiciously often when he
describes what he does for a living. ``I guess you could say I'm a
model slash hotelier slash actor slash screenwriter,'' the Sikh
impresario said on a recent March evening at the Staley-Wise
Gallery in SoHo, his white turban bobbing above the chain-smoking
crowd. Chatwal had stopped in for a show of photographs by Ellen
von Unwerth, who shot him for a Vogue fashion spread in 1997 _ that
explains the model part of his self-description. Chatwal comes
across as a 1999 poster boy of multicultural chic: a spiritually
conversant playboy with a penchant for rap music and friends
gathered from the worlds of banking, music and just plain money. By
Alex Kuczynski. Photo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ They are a colorful group, the
corydalises. Their small, trumpet-shaped flowers are tinted in
yellows, blues, reds, pinks, purples or whites. Their foliage
spectrum encompasses blue-greens sheathed with silver to warm
greens tipped with bronze. Until the last decade or so, they were
almost unknown in 20th-century American gardens. Now, with the fall
of the Soviet Union, there are a host of exciting new plants
becoming available, and there is renewed interest in old standbys
as well. By Patricia A. Taylor.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not quite right to say that Carolyn Murphy's
face is unfamiliar to filmgoers. She is widely seen on popcorn bags
sold in movie theaters, advertising Calvin Klein khakis and other
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But next fall, Ms. Murphy, one of the world's top models, will
be on the silver screen itself, in what is described as a
substantial role in ``Liberty Heights,'' Barry Levinson's fourth
film set in working-class Baltimore, this time in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part was described as a young Grace Kelly,'' said Ellen
Chenoweth, the casting director. ``We saw a lot of actresses, but
that certain quality wasn't there, so we started seeing models.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy, who is on the cover of the March issue of Vogue and
is photographed inside in a fashion feature inspired by a film set,
aggressively sought the part. She went to see Ms. Chenoweth the
same day the casting director called, and she returned numerous
times for readings and screen tests. ``Carolyn did everything you
do to get into the movie business,'' said Paula Weinstein, a
producer of the film. ``Barry felt she was a natural. Right away he
felt he'd found someone new and exciting and talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers have been down this road many times, smitten by stars
of the runways and cosmetics advertisements and casting them for
publicity value or in hopes that their stunning beauty will rivet
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But experience suggests a hard lesson. Angie Everhart has twice
played a hooker _ in ``Jade'' (1995) and ``Bordello of Blood''
(1996) _ but neither performance hooked audiences. The appearance
of Elle Macpherson in ``If Lucy Fell'' in 1996 prompted some to
suggest a new name for the film, ``If Elle Could Act.'' And there
is the cautionary career of Cindy Crawford, who had her first real
film role in ``Fair Game'' (1995), cast as a brainy maritime
lawyer. Or rather, stunningly miscast, in the opinion of most
critics. ``She had a great time, but in the end she didn't like it
as much as she thought she would,'' Ms. Crawford's publicity agent,
Annett Wolf, said carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Have these cinematic train wrecks caused filmmakers to cool on
giving supermodels speaking roles? Hardly. Lately, so many A-list
catwalkers have been moonlighting in the movies that the Cannes
Film Festival may come to resemble fashion week in Bryant Park.
Besides Ms. Murphy, well-known models cast in forthcoming films
include Claudia Schiffer (``Black and White''), Frederique Van Der
Wal (``The Wild Wild West''), Shalom Harlow (``Cherry''), Michele
Hicks (``Twin Falls, Idaho''), Esther Canadas (``The Thomas Crown
Affair'') and Eva Herzigova (``For the Time Being'').
</P>
<P>
   A few make cameo appearances, playing _ surprise _ models, and
say they are acting as a lark. But most of the others have serious
aspirations. Despite the high-profile embarrassments of the past,
there are well-known success stories, too, including those of
former models like Andie MacDowell, Cameron Diaz and Kim Basinger.
One big difference is that those successful actresses had marginal
careers as mannequins. Today's crop with crossover dreams includes
many supermodels. Maybe they're just looking for revenge: With
Hollywood stars increasingly pushing models off the covers of
fashion magazines, the shortage of work for ``the supes'' could be
driving them to invade their rivals' turf.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Glascoe and Joseph Pierson, who cast Ms. Harlow in the lead
of ``Cherry,'' a low-budget romantic comedy that will have its
premiere on April 18 at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival,
said that the model's publicity value was ``definitely a factor in
our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing auditions, and this fascinating young woman
showed up,'' Pierson said. ``Our casting agent didn't tell us who
she was. Afterwards we were, like, `Whoo, scary _ a supermodel!'
But by then we were already captivated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is independently financed, but at the end of the
day you need to sell it to somebody. Her name recognition was a
factor. People seem fascinated with the concept of supermodels,
although I'm not one of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harlow, who had a small part in ``In and Out,'' has a
Hollywood agent, Clar Ryu of the United Talent Agency, to build her
film career. ``It makes sense,'' Ms. Ryu said. ``We're seeing more
and more actresses who look like models, and vice versa. But it's a
shame that people still have preconceived notions about models.
People like to hold on to the belief that models are stupid
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   The models are often the first to acknowledge that directors
seek to cast them for their novelty value, and sometimes they
resist. Eva Herzigova, the face (and torso) of Wonderbra, said she
turned down a role in Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He only called because he needed a model,'' she recalled
before the director's death last week. ``The part called for three
scenes: in the first, I'm OD'ing; in the second, I have an intense
20-minute dialogue with Tom Cruise, and in the third, I'm dead _
and I had to do it all totally nude. I just didn't want to start
out that way. I really tried to bargain with him and say, `Couldn't
I just wear a little something?' but he said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Herzigova pursued and was given the lead role in a
low-budget film, ``For the Time Being,'' a first feature by Gil
Brenton. Brenton himself resisted _ for a while. ``Frankly, after
seeing Cindy Crawford in `Fair Game,' I wasn't interested in
models,'' he said. ``I did not want to meet Eva _ no way.'' But
once he did, he was charmed and made up his mind on the spot that
she was right. He predicted that she would be a movie star _ but
meantime, he must finish his movie and find a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the budget spectrum, Barry Sonnenfeld,
who made the hit ``Men in Black,'' gave a part in his next film,
``The Wild Wild West,'' to Frederique Van Der Wal, a Victoria's
Secret model. Based on the 1960s television series of the same
name, the $90 million film stars Kenneth Branagh, Will Smith and
Kevin Kline, and opens on July 2. Ms. Van Der Wal plays Amazonia, a
henchwoman helping plot the assassination of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of screen time, though not a whole lot of
dialogue,'' Ms. Van Der Wal said. ``Do I feel like an actor? No,
not yet, but I'm taking baby steps towards that. It's a long road,
and an interesting one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Van Der Wal first started taking acting classes out of
curiosity, but now she's working mainly on her speech. (She has a
heavy Dutch accent.) She is secure enough in her modeling career to
have a refreshingly realistic view of her prospects for movie
stardom. ``Being a model doesn't mean you can act, as has been
proven on numerous occasions,'' she said. ``There's an overall
negative feeling about models going into acting sometimes, but I
think it depends on how you present yourself. Of course, there's
even more rejection in this business than in modeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiffer, by contrast, is already sounding like an old hand
on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know where it's going,'' she said. ``You just study,
build your craft and try to get experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``I've been very lucky. Every time I like a script I've been
able to read for the part. But it's as difficult for me as for
everyone else who's just starting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But what was Ms. Schiffer doing in the cast of
``Black and White,'' along with celebrities like Mike Tyson, Marla
Maples and Allan Houston of the New York Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   On her first day, in October, she filmed with Tyson in the Lemon
restaurant, a real-life model hangout on Park Avenue South. Between
takes, the director, James Toback, offered pointers _ ``Make it
more fluid,'' ``Let her ravish you'' _ while a handler fed Tyson
from a sack of Twizzlers. Toback said he hoped to finish the $3.5
million film in time for Cannes in May.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiffer plays a European anthropologist who goes to New
York to study hip-hop culture. After the director called
``Action!'' on the same scene for the 12th time, she began once
more with the line ``In the Paleolithic era....''

 &HT;    Where are our education priorities?
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ In the furor which followed the ruling by a
federal appeals court that prayers and other ``solemnizing''
ceremonies before high school football football games are
unconstitutional, you may have missed a couple of other school
related stories.
</P>
<P>
   They were all in the newspaper on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   So, put down the pen with which you were going to sign the
petition protesting the prayer decision and consider that since
1996, the passing rate for an end-of-course Algebra I exam in Texas
schools has not exceeded 39 percent. That means almost two-thirds
did not pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent.
</P>
<P>
   Algebra I.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids.
</P>
<P>
   Did not pass.
</P>
<P>
   A second court ruling held that public schools are to pay for
one-on-one nursing care for some disabled students. The Iowa child
whose case was brought to the high court is described as thriving
in high school. Still, schools all over the country are wondering
where the money will come from.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the Texas Senate approved a bill that allows expulsion of
students who assault school employees or volunteers rather than
placement in alternative education programs.
</P>
<P>
   So, there you have it.
</P>
<P>
   No prayer before ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Most students can't pass the algebra exam.
</P>
<P>
   More money is going to be required from already strapped school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Violence on campus spurs yet another stiffening of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the court ruling, prayer was touted by
several local school officials as a tradition long held and one
that most wished to continue, no matter what the law says. Their
reasoning: it is what the
</P>
<P>
   community wants.
</P>
<P>
   Logic tells me that if we were to apply the same financial
resources and the heart and soul we pour into our Friday night
contests, including praying, we might, just might, be much closer
to solving problems such as school violence, poor academic
performance and inequitable educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Logic also tells me that we will do it, if it's what the
community wants.

DAYTON MOVIE HOUSE CARRIES ON A CINEMATIC REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SOMMER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ New Neon Movies, a small art house nearly
swallowed up by a nearby sprawling, concrete parking garage located
above the Greyhound Bus station, sits across from a 24-hour White
Tower hamburger stand.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a highway overpass away from a gritty stretch of
downtown and its mix of coffee bars and X-rated book shops. At
first glance, and second, this would hardly seem to be the site for
the first screenings of Cinerama in the United States in more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as improbable is it's revival in this heart of Middle
America, home to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and once, Orville
and Wilbur Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlikely as it is, nearly a half-century since Cinerama's
debut, John Harvey, a projectionist and theater equipment supplier,
and Larry Smith, the theater's co-owner, have done what some
thought would never happen: They have brought back the
revolutionary motion picture process in all its three-projector,
curved-screen and stereophonic glory.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with wide-screen movie formats taken for granted and IMAX
theaters housing screens eight stories tall, it's hard to grasp the
special excitement Cinerama once held. But at a recent matinee of
``This Is Cinerama'' it was possible to see what all the fuss was
about.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it: When ``This Is Cinerama'' opened on
Sept. 30, 1952, at the Broadway Theatre in New York, beginning what
would be a 122-week run, it was a hugely anticipated event.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional material touted Cinerama as ``a new technique for
seeing the world of reality as well as the world of make-believe
with new eyes.'' But it wasn't only the company saying that; many
front-line publications agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinerama is truly wonderful to behold. (It's) the movies
greatest innovation since sound,'' proclaimed Newsweek. ``Most
spectacular and thrilling,'' declared the New York Times' Bosley
Crowther in a rare front-page review. ``Cinerama is the most
exciting thing to hit New York since Penicillin,'' added Ed
Sullivan (yes, that Ed Sullivan) of the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when narrator Lowell Thomas looked into the camera and
boldly declared, ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is Cinerama!'' he was
at once heralding a new era in motion pictures and a sensory
experience that many film aficionados insist remains without
parallel to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   As the theater's red curtain pulls back, and still back some
more, Thomas' normal-size flickering, black-and-white image gives
way to an astonishing depth and field of vision, shot in
Technicolor, of Rockaways' Playland in New York that is nothing
short of breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   With a sonic blast, the audience is transported into the lead
car of the Atom Smasher Roller Coaster, feels the anticipation of
its slow rickety climb up the first slope, braces for the
impossible descent that looms ahead and holds on for dear life with
each sudden dip and drop and turn of the 90-second ride.
</P>
<P>
   The opening roller coaster scene in ``This Is Cinerama'' is just
one of many extraordinary sequences in the travelogue. Others
include panoramic aerial views of national parks to a rousing
``America the Beautiful''; a buffalo stampede; ``Aida'' being
performed inside the Italian opera house, La Scala; and a close-up
of the Vienna Boys Choir. But it's the one most remembered after
all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sort of prepared that we were going to get something
we were not quite ready for, and sure enough, it's true,'' Dayton
resident Tommy Bankston said during the film's intermission, a big
grin stamped across his face. ``You really did feel like you were
actually there. There's the whole anticipation of the roller
coaster descending, and it's just absolutely breathtaking, it
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``This Is Cinerama,'' the theater also showed
coming attractions for ``The Wonderful World of the Brothers
Grimm,'' ``How the West Was Won,'' and as an added Cinerama treat,
a 1959 Renault commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Residents from Dayton, like Bankston, seemed to be in the
minority at the screening. Many among the 78 people in attendance
had come hundreds of miles for the opportunity to see Cinerama. For
some it was the first time; for others, it was their first time
since the Eisenhower or Kennedy administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Cletus Epple was among the latter. He drove from a town outside
Indianapolis to be there, and seemed pleased to have made the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it holds up very well,'' he said after the film. ``A
lot of movies and things from your youth don't hold up, but this
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinerama was developed by Fred Waller, a former head of
Paramount Picture's special effects department. A prodigious
inventor, Waller created water skis and the Waller Gunnery Trainer,
a modern flight simulator credited with saving thousands of lives
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was determined to create a motion picture experience that
would mimic how people actually see and hear. After years of trial
and error, he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Waller developed a camera to capture images on three strips of
film concurrently, and then have three projectors project the film
onto a 146-degree curved screen that emulated the range of a
person's peripheral vision. In this way, Cinerama was able to
provide a depth and field of vision unlike anything seen before.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreground and background are both in focus, which creates
a kind of hyper reality,'' Smith explained. ``Because of the sharp
focus, and the curved screen, Cinerama breaks the third dimension,
and it actually feels like you're part of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem Waller addressed but never completely
solved _ masking the vertical lines that appeared on the screen,
where the seams of the film strips met. For some viewers it would
be an annoying distraction that negated the Cinerama experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cinerama's stereophonic sound, which allowed sound to be heard
through seven channels rather than one, was developed by Waller's
associate, Hazard Reeves. He used seven microphones for filming,
which when played back through a sound reproducer, produced a
highly defined tracking of sound direction and movement. (Disney's
``Fantasia'' in 1940 had been recorded in stereo, but the sound
suffered for not having been magnetically recorded.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cinerama's initial success, and a rash of imitators that
followed, including KinoPanorama, in Russia, only seven
feature-length films were made, the first five of them travelogues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Cinerama'' was the top-grossing movie to come out in
1952, with a box office take of $12.5 million in just four
theaters, but ticket sales for the subsequent releases were
disappointing with the exception of the last, 1962's ``How the West
was Won.''
</P>
<P>
   One of only two Cinerama pictures to boast Hollywood stars _ the
all-star cast included Henry Fonda, Gregory Peck and Jimmy Stewart
_ it was also the third most expensive film ever made by M-G-M.
</P>
<P>
   The movie studio, which had bought out Cinerama Prod. in the
late-1950s, then turned to simpler and less ambitious wide-screen
formats, including 70 millimeter film and Cinemascope, that could
be shot by a single camera and projected onto a wide but flat
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cinerama, the process that opened the door for wide-screen
presentation and stereophonic sound, was in the end a victim of
high costs and technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the final curtain came down on Cinerama at the same
time a wave of Super Cinerama theaters, with wide, curved screens,
began opening across the country. The best known, the Cinerama Dome
in Los Angeles, never actually showed the three-projector process.

<P>
   When Variety Cinemas contemplated two years ago putting a wall
down the middle of New Neon Movies to create two small auditoriums,
Smith, a minority owner and also the theater manager at the time
and a Cinerama buff, and his long-time friend Harvey, proposed the
unlikely notion of presenting films in Cinerama.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the larger screen _ it's two stories tall and 50
feet around the curve _ and the three projectors, they and a team
of 40 volunteers pulled 88 of the 300 seats, tore out a third of
the ceiling, built the booth and did all the wiring and carpentry.
They finished in five weeks, and began showing Cinerama in August
1996 on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance began earnestly but tailed off after several months.
Last year, the theater nearly closed, and employees say the movie
house is not yet out of the woods. There were only eight weekend
showings of Cinerama, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects for Cinerama's long-term revival uncertain, Smith
and Harvey have started the Cinerama Preservation Society, a
non-profit group dedicated to keeping Cinerama alive, with the goal
of establishing a museum in Dayton. They have been unable to get
Pacific Theaters, which owns the rights to ``This Is Cinerama,''
and the negatives to the other travelogues, and Warner Bros., which
has ownership of ``The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,'' to
strike new prints or to show interest in bringing Cinerama back.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey and Smith insist they will keep on trying to build
momentum.

 By DEE WEDEMEYER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ William H. Gass is sitting in his living room,
sipping cognac, when he makes an announcement: He will never again
write a negative book review. This is the same William H. Gass who
said he stopped reading Tom Wolfe in 1981 because ``From Bauhaus to
Our House'' ``could have been written by Prince Charles''; the same
William H. Gass who said the Pulitzer Prize for fiction ``takes
dead aim at mediocrity and almost never misses.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution comes after his newest book, ``Cartesian Sonata
and Other Novellas'' (Alfred A. Knopf), got a mixed reception last
year. Although the influential Kirkus Review heralded the
``virtuoso performances'' in the book, too many other reviewers, in
Gass' opinion, ``stupidly'' ignored the writing and focused on how
his literary theories affected his work.
</P>
<P>
   That critics should focus on those theories should not have come
as a surprise, however. For decades, Gass, 74, has led a spirited
attack on the traditional American novel, denouncing plot as less
important than form and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ideological war that has been going on since the
beginning of literature,'' he said. ``The whole problem of what the
novel is supposed to be doing and what literature's value is,
whether it is truth or morality or what my friends accuse me of _
esthetic bliss _ this will continue to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his first novel, ``Omensetter's Luck,'' was published in
1966, Gass has been one of the most respected writers never to
write a best seller. His fans love the layers of metaphors and
philosophy that keep them digging like archeologists through the
strata of western intellectual thought. He has won a raft of
awards, including two National Book Critics Circle Awards for
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his complex fiction loses many readers and has caused
critics to say he has sacrificed character for literary gimmicks.
The late novelist and critic John Gardner once said that Gass,
``the greatest genius ever given to America,'' was ``fiddling''
with his talent. ``What I think is beautiful,'' Gardner went on,
``he would think is not yet sufficiently ornate.'' Comparing their
literary approaches to airplanes, he said, ``The difference is that
my 707 will fly and his is too encrusted with gold to get off the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Gass replied, ``What I really want is to have it sit there,
solid as a rock, and have everybody think it is flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the writers who emerged with Gass in the late 1960s and
'70s, like John Hawkes and William Gaddis, have died. Today, the
``new fiction'' of such postmodernists, as they were called, isn't
quite so new anymore. But the debates continue among critics and
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of character is what matters,'' said Harold
Bloom, a professor, critic and author who has known and disagreed
with Gass since they were both students at Cornell University 50
years ago. ``I think the postmodern novel is increasingly a
disaster. I'm tired of games. It can't be an accident that the
three authors who manage to maintain themselves are Shakespeare,
Jane Austin and Charles Dickens. It is because they create worlds
and the worlds are full of people. But I don't want to be the
anti-Gass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gass, however, believes he is a realist even if other people do
not. ``In the Victorian novel everything is clear,'' he explains.
``In the real world, motives are mixed. People are unreliable.
There are contradictions. People forget. There are omissions. You
certainly don't know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Because in the real world a writer is writing the story, Gass
describes that process of creation, whether it means detailing how
the narrator thought up the shape of a character's nose or applying
coffee rings and heel marks to pages.
</P>
<P>
   Gass has folded his short, portly body into a Breuer chair in
his living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objection to narrative is that it should not be privileged,
as if it were the chief organization of fiction,'' he said. ``It is
one of many.''
</P>
<P>
   Gass is aware of the demands that complex writers place on
readers. In preparation for his last semester of teaching at
Washington University, he looked up every reference in Marianne
Moore's poetry. When he was finished, he had 40 pages. ``The demand
she is making is unrealistic,'' he said ``because only a few nuts
like me are going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that he doesn't expect everyone to go to that much
trouble to read his books. Still, he admits he was discouraged that
so few reviewers of ``Cartesian Sonata'' picked up on the music and
philosophy, which dealt with theories on mind and matter by the
French philosopher Rene Descartes. He is comforted, however, by the
fact that serious books do eventually get read. ``A lot of these
books that are thought to be impenetrable get easier,'' he said.
``Everyone reads Joyce now. People are reading Proust. `Moby Dick'
was not an easy read. `Finnegans Wake' is taught in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   William Gass grew up in Warren, Ohio, which he remembers as a
grim, sooty, uncultured steel town, and spent summers in North
Dakota. He has described his father, an architect and
semiprofessional baseball player, as crippled with arthritis,
bitterness and bigotry. He taught drafting at a high school. Gass'
mother, a former school teacher and an alcoholic, supported his
interest in poetry and other subjects that his father disparaged.
</P>
<P>
   Gass served in the Navy in World War II, then returned to school
and got a Ph.D. in philosophy. After teaching at Purdue University,
he came to Washington University in 1969, when the faculty included
two future poet laureates and other well-known novelists. That same
year, Gass had left his wife, the mother of three of his children,
after what he blithely described as a ``wondrously adulterous
affair'' with Mary Alice Henderson, the daughter of another Purdue
faculty member and a former student 22 years his junior. The two
eventually married and had twin daughters, Catherine and Elizabeth,
now 26. The three children from his previous marriage remained with
their mother. ``It was just a sort of mutual distancing,'' he said.
``No acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gasses live in a three-story Colonial Revival home with more
than 10,000 books arranged by country. On a tour, Gass agrees to
show his study, but refuses to turn on the light because a leak on
the third floor has created a mess.
</P>
<P>
   After a dinner of salmon wrapped in radicchio cooked by Mary
Alice, Gass leans back to talk of writing and writers. He knows
whose wife left him after a book flopped, who stays out of the
country to avoid taxes and who survived cancer to face financial
devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The stories sound as though they could be plots for a book, but
if such good, old-fashioned tales fill his conversation, it is
language and form that have a hold on his writing. For him, form
includes the typography and design of his books. In ``The Tunnel,''
a novel he labored over for 29 years, the main character is a
professor who has finished his magnum opus about Nazi Germany and
is now writing the preface _ a process that results in a 652-page
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Since the character hides the pages of his preface between the
pages of the manuscript, Gass would have liked to have published
``The Tunnel'' in a loose-leaf format and shipped it in a box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to set this book in a German type of that
old-fashioned sort where it's very thorny and it looks like a field
of barbed wire,'' he said. Instead, ``The Tunnel'' was published by
Knopf as a traditional bound book, mostly in common Fairfield type,
although the use of a concentration camp tattoo for some page
numbers or words in the shape of a six-pointed star is far from
conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Gass believes some critics suspected that he shared the
anti-Semitism expressed by the narrator, who also has a German name
and teaches at a Midwestern college. But the book is not about the
Holocaust, he said, it's about fascism in America. ``If Milton were
writing today, he would be criticized for giving the devil all the
good speeches,'' he said of those critics.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he insists popularity is not his goal. For him, the
best-case scenario is having his books included in academic
anthologies and taught.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst?
</P>
<P>
   ``They fall into oblivion,'' he said.

A NIGHT OUT WITH VIKRAM CHATWAL: THE TURBAN ALSO UNWINDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday March 14)  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vikram Chatwal is one of those people who uses the
word ``slash'' suspiciously often when he describes what he does
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say I'm a model slash hotelier slash actor
slash screenwriter,'' the 27-year-old Sikh impresario said on a
recent March evening at the Staley-Wise Gallery in SoHo, his white
turban bobbing above the chain-smoking crowd. Chatwal had stopped
in for a show of photographs by Ellen von Unwerth, who shot him for
a Vogue fashion spread in 1997 _ that explains the model part of
his self-description.
</P>
<P>
   Chatwal emigrated from India to Canada in 1984, and moved to New
York a decade ago. Because he is a Sikh, he usually wears a
pristine white turban. (Sometimes he takes it off when he dances,
he said.) Chatwal comes across as a 1999 poster boy of
multicultural chic: a spiritually conversant playboy with a
penchant for rap music and friends gathered from the worlds of
banking, music and just plain money.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Chatwal
worked at Morgan Stanley. ``Then I left to pursue some more
cultural journeys,'' said Chatwal, who is becoming something of an
Indian Ian Schrager. He is already a part owner of Joe's Pub, the
downtown boite of the moment; in May, Hampshire Hotels, a chain run
by Chatwal's family, will open the Time, a hotel on West 49th
Street, where Chatwal will be the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an upscale boutique kind of hotel,'' he said,
his voice as soporific as warm buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   A gallery assistant flashed the lights as a signal to disperse.
Chatwal rounded up friends for dinner: Gotham Chopra, the son of
Deepak Chopra; Daniella Rich, the daughter of the social songwriter
Denise Rich; a globe-trotting English lawyer named Richard, and Sky
Nellor, a slim brunette who described herself as ``a deejay slash
television hostess slash model.''
</P>
<P>
   The group piled into Chatwal's white Mercedes 500S sedan, a car
more suitable for a Palm Beach housewife. Chatwal says he likes it
``because it's a moving living room.'' He turned on Big E. Smalls
(``Uh-uh/Money, I'm gonna front you/Uh-uh/Girl, I'm gonna flaunt
you'') and drove to Bamboo, a restaurant on West 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's an Arawak steak?'' Ms. Rich asked as she perused the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arawak are one of two indigenous Indian tribes in the
Caribbean,'' the lawyer replied, without moving his eyes from his
menu.
</P>
<P>
   As plates of steak and steamed mussels and jerk chicken, fried
plantains and crab cakes arrived, the conversation turned to
organized crime. Chopra and Chatwal are writing a screenplay
together, which Chatwal described as ``the Indian `Scarface.''' A
guest posed this question: Does crime pay?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Chatwal said, turning solemn. ``There is nothing you can
do to assuage your conscience when you commit sins. Crime is a
spiritual assault on the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatwal said his movie was ``really about the pressures on
immigrant families to achieve the American dream.'' He started
talking about how difficult it was to be a, well, Sikh slash
American.
</P>
<P>
   Chatwal said he was not a religious Sikh. ``I'm more of a
cultural one. As a Sikh, you're not allowed to cut your hair,
drink, smoke or have premarital sex.'' Despite his parents'
expectations, he said he would not submit to an arranged marriage.
``I'll be marrying for love, like we all should be,'' he added.
Slash romantic?

<P>
   DULLES, Va. America Online President Stephen M. Case was piecing
together a struggling online company in 1994 when he heard of a hot
new Internet startup, Netscape Communications. He desperately
wanted to buy that company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he's had to wait five years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, (March 17) Netscape shareholders are expected to
approve the sale of their company to AOL in a stock deal worth more
than $8 billion. The deal, cleared Friday by the Justice
Department, would catapult AOL into new business markets and
solidify its position as a major player in online advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is like looking at a 17th century geopolitical
map of Europe,'' says James Kimsey, AOL's founder and former
chairman, and now head of its non-profit foundation. ``Everyone is
trying to marry off his daughter to strengthen alliances. There's
no doubt Netscape is a key strategic play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the nation's largest online service, with 16 million
members. Netscape's Netcenter is one of the most frequently visited
Internet sites. Once the companies are combined, AOL can use
Netscape's Internet browser to lessen its reliance on Microsoft,
whose Windows operating system is one route to AOL. The deal also
should help the consumer-focused AOL attract business customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal certainly makes them the big kahuna of Internet
portals,'' says Andrew Bartells, senior research analyst with Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL users, the merger isn't expected to change the chatty
online service.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the deal is expected to improve earnings growth
because it gives AOL access to lucrative business customers, who
prefer Netscape. AOL is solidly established in the consumer market,
with 60 percent of U.S. online users as members. But while today's
consumer e-commerce market is valued at $6 billion to $8 billion a
year, the business-to-business market is worth a much larger $25
billion to $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal, however, does not shield AOL from increasing
competition in the rapidly changing business-to business market.
AT&AMP;T completed its acquisition of cable operator
Tele-Communications Inc. on Tuesday. There's also a challenge from
Microsoft Network, as well as from entertainment giant Time Warner,
which is rolling out its Road Runner service.
</P>
<P>
   Today, AOL provides service mostly over phone lines. It is not
well-positioned to deliver its services over cables lines, although
there is speculation of possible deals to gain access to these
high-speed pipelines. And the company has turned to the government
for help, asking for regulatory intervention to provide access to
cable,
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what pipe we use,'' says Kimsey.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's anywhere, any way strategy is aimed at developing an
online media company whose services that can be accessed from
devices ranging from computers to cell phones to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL could even be on your electric toothbrush one day,'' jokes
Matt Korn, the company's senior vice president of network
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy could be key to holding onto AOL's dominant online
position, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are any number of ways to access the Internet --
phone lines, cable lines, ADSL lines and wireless,'' says Bill
Whyman, an Internet analyst with Legg Mason Research Technology
Team in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is who controls the customer relationship,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind AOL's drive to build that needed loyalty is Case.
When Case joined AOL's predecessor, Quantum Computer Service, in
1983, he was 24 and the company was nothing more than a
cyber-experiment. Since then, he has guided the company through a
handful of near-death experiences _ including an uproar created by
subscribers frustrated over troubles connecting to AOL _ and more
recently to better-than-expected financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, fiscal-year revenue has climbed to $2.16 billion
from $98 million, and earnings per share to a split-adjusted 14
cents a share from less than 1 cent per share. Wall Street expects
revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June to hit $3.9-$4
billion, and earnings of about 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is growing overseas. AOL International now
operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Japan
and Australia. It will launch AOL Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international markets are like watching the U.S. market on
fast-forward,'' says Jack Davies, president of AOL International.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute AOL's success to a handful of key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Case started mass-mailing 250 million free AOL disks to
the public. A risky move, it has been credited as helping make AOL
one of the best known consumer brands in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he changed the pricing structure from a per-minute
charge to a flat fee. Today the service costs $21.95 monthly. As a
result, members are staying online longer-- up from an average of
14 minutes online per day then to an average of 55 minutes daily
now.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, there was another shift. Since the company's
inception, the lion's share of revenue had come from online
subscriptions. But with a growing membership staying online longer,
AOL set out to market the captive audience to online advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, advertising and e-commerce fees jumped to $98 million,
a 717 percent increase from $12 million in 1996. The first big deal
was a $100 million, three-year agreement with long-distance company
Tel-Save Holding, which wanted to market phone service on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company is shifting focus again -- to Washington. Case
has said that U.S. policy decisions will set the course for the
industry's future and greatly affect AOL's business decisions. The
company has responded by has increasing its lobbying force from two
to five people. And it is in the process of setting up its first
political action committee to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been instrumental in setting up the Open
Net Coalition, staffed by Vice President Al Gore's former
technology staffer, Greg Simon, and former National Republican
Committee chairman Rich Bond, to lobby for government intervention
in the cable wars. AOL and others, including MindSpring
Enterprises, want regulators to force cable companies to make their
lines available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's really going on here is that they are trying to
slow down the deployment of broadband technology because they are
not in a position to dominate that market,'' says James Cicconi,
AT&AMP;T's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ulric Weil, managing partner of the Arlington-based Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey brokerage firm isn't concerned AOL will be left
behind.

INS TAKES DIFFERENT TACK AGAINST UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
(for release Sunday March 14) By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) In Washington state's Yakima Valley, undocumented
workers in the fruit packing sheds thought they knew what to expect
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The INS would show up, people fearing deportation would bolt for
the doors and the INS would sometimes make 50 to 60 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But the landscape in Yakima changed dramatically last month when
the INS took a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scattershot raids at various fruit-packing sites, the
INS reviewed the payrolls at 13 different packing companies and
then instructed the companies en masse to fire those workers whose
documents were false.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 600 workers were fired. Several hundred more who already
had been laid off during a seasonal downturn will apparently not be
allowed to return to work. And Yakima is in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that the social service agencies are going to
be able to support 700 families for any period of time,'' said
Rosanne Fischer-Pineda , director of the Yakima Interfaith Council.
``There's got to be some kind of political solution to this.''
</P>
<P>
   But this type of enforcement strategy is a political solution,
of sorts, for the INS. The embattled agency concedes that it cannot
realistically catch all of the estimated 5 million people living
illegally in the United States and it cannot afford to deport
everyone it can catch.
</P>
<P>
   INS resources have swelled dramatically in recent years, but
with few exceptions the money and staff have gone to U.S.-Mexico
border districts. Budgets for special agents in the interior _ the
people who handle work-site enforcement and investigate document
fraud _ have not grown accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and INS officials agreed the agency needed a more
comprehensive approach to interior enforcement. Joe Greene,
district director for the INS Denver region, led a committee which
in January recommended several ways to respond to changes in the
pattern of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Greene wants the INS to stop using the number of deportations as
a measure of the agency's success. Critics like Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration,
thinks that sends a message of encouragement to anyone who does not
immediately get caught at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Greene countered that while deportations will be one of many
tools the agency uses to deter illegal immigration, the agency has
conceded that removing large numbers of immigrants does not prevent
them from returning _ often in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most telling points in Greene's analysis was spelled
out in numbers. The INS apprehended 13,897 illegal immigrants at
work sites throughout the United States in 1988, which works out to
45.5 apprehensions per INS investigator per year.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, it would take take almost 35,000 investigator
``work years'' to apprehend the illegal residents who entered the
country in the last four years alone.
</P>
<P>
   The approach used most recently in Yakima was developed by an
immigration officer from Phoenix who was assigned temporary duty in
Reno, Nev., five years ago. Tony Esposito said that by following up
on old leads he found in office files, his small staff found 450
unauthorized workers on the payrolls of five casino industry
businesses. They pursued more business payrolls and the list grew
to as many as 800 illegal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what do we do now? We can't arrest them,'' Esposito
recalled. ``And transportation is even a bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito put together a training seminar for affected
businesses, teaching them how to spot fraud in workers' documents.
The agents then presented employers with lists of illegal
employees, and asked that they confront and dismiss them. If the
employees are not fired, the employer would be subject to INS
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the genesis for new a INS strategy _ target large groups
of illegal employees within a specific industry, and target those
workers through firings. With the development of sophisticated
computer databases, the INS is now also providing software to
employers to allow them to access immigration, Social Security and
even drivers license information to help verify immigrant
employment documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sanctions become heavily worked in an industry, it becomes
a place that's not friendly to the unauthorized alien,'' Esposito
said. ``If we do this throughout the country, we're going to be
working real smart _ with fewer resources and a smaller force.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito says deportations are still an important psychological
tool. But trying to go out and arrest people every day means having
to arrange corresponding transportation, bed space, food and
manpower, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has prosecuted thousands of employers for willfully
hiring undocumented workers over the past decade, but the agency is
now also aiming for the cooperation of employers they say are being
victimized by employees who present sophisticated, easily obtained
fraudulent documentation of eligibility to work.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito said the efforts to train employers to spot fake
documents have been pretty successful, but a participant in one of
the recent training seminars for employers in Yakima disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, he's dreaming,'' said Michael Gempler,
executive director of the Washington Growers league. ``At the
seminar they showed slides of documents that were false _ and
nobody in the room could tell they were false.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one good thing is they haven't grabbed the people and
shipped them out of the country,'' said the Rev. Patrick C. Carroll
of Yakima's St. Joseph Catholic Church. ``They got into too much
trouble the last time because they shipped out mothers with tiny
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But his parishioners are very upset, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the women I ran into (who had been fired), single
mothers with children, said they have no other means of support,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the tough side of it,'' said Bill Strassberger, a
spokesman for the western regional office of the INS. ``We've heard
that somewhere in the order of 500 to 600 people have been
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how many people will not reapply and say ... it's time to
go home? There's no way for us to count those numbers.''

<P>
   DULLES, Va. America Online President Stephen M. Case was piecing
together a struggling online company in 1994 when he heard of a hot
new Internet startup, Netscape Communications. He desperately
wanted to buy that company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he's had to wait five years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, (March 17) Netscape shareholders are expected to
approve the sale of their company to AOL in a stock deal worth more
than $8 billion. The deal, cleared Friday by the Justice
Department, would catapult AOL into new business markets and
solidify its position as a major player in online advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is like looking at a 17th century geopolitical
map of Europe,'' says James Kimsey, AOL's founder and former
chairman, and now head of its non-profit foundation. ``Everyone is
trying to marry off his daughter to strengthen alliances. There's
no doubt Netscape is a key strategic play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the nation's largest online service, with 16 million
members. Netscape's Netcenter is one of the most frequently visited
Internet sites. Once the companies are combined, AOL can use
Netscape's Internet browser to lessen its reliance on Microsoft,
whose Windows operating system is one route to AOL. The deal also
should help the consumer-focused AOL attract business customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal certainly makes them the big kahuna of Internet
portals,'' says Andrew Bartells, senior research analyst with Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL users, the merger isn't expected to change the chatty
online service.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the deal is expected to improve earnings growth
because it gives AOL access to lucrative business customers, who
prefer Netscape. AOL is solidly established in the consumer market,
with 60 percent of U.S. online users as members. But while today's
consumer e-commerce market is valued at $6 billion to $8 billion a
year, the business-to-business market is worth a much larger $25
billion to $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal, however, does not shield AOL from increasing
competition in the rapidly changing business-to business market.
AT&AMP;T completed its acquisition of cable operator
Tele-Communications Inc. on Tuesday. There's also a challenge from
Microsoft Network, as well as from entertainment giant Time Warner,
which is rolling out its Road Runner service.
</P>
<P>
   Today, AOL provides service mostly over phone lines. It is not
well-positioned to deliver its services over cables lines, although
there is speculation of possible deals to gain access to these
high-speed pipelines. And the company has turned to the government
for help, asking for regulatory intervention to provide access to
cable,
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what pipe we use,'' says Kimsey.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's anywhere, any way strategy is aimed at developing an
online media company whose services that can be accessed from
devices ranging from computers to cell phones to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL could even be on your electric toothbrush one day,'' jokes
Matt Korn, the company's senior vice president of network
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy could be key to holding onto AOL's dominant online
position, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are any number of ways to access the Internet --
phone lines, cable lines, ADSL lines and wireless,'' says Bill
Whyman, an Internet analyst with Legg Mason Research Technology
Team in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is who controls the customer relationship,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind AOL's drive to build that needed loyalty is Case.
When Case joined AOL's predecessor, Quantum Computer Service, in
1983, he was 24 and the company was nothing more than a
cyber-experiment. Since then, he has guided the company through a
handful of near-death experiences _ including an uproar created by
subscribers frustrated over troubles connecting to AOL _ and more
recently to better-than-expected financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, fiscal-year revenue has climbed to $2.16 billion
from $98 million, and earnings per share to a split-adjusted 14
cents a share from less than 1 cent per share. Wall Street expects
revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June to hit $3.9-$4
billion, and earnings of about 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is growing overseas. AOL International now
operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Japan
and Australia. It will launch AOL Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international markets are like watching the U.S. market on
fast-forward,'' says Jack Davies, president of AOL International.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute AOL's success to a handful of key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Case started mass-mailing 250 million free AOL disks to
the public. A risky move, it has been credited as helping make AOL
one of the best known consumer brands in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he changed the pricing structure from a per-minute
charge to a flat fee. Today the service costs $21.95 monthly. As a
result, members are staying online longer-- up from an average of
14 minutes online per day then to an average of 55 minutes daily
now.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, there was another shift. Since the company's
inception, the lion's share of revenue had come from online
subscriptions. But with a growing membership staying online longer,
AOL set out to market the captive audience to online advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, advertising and e-commerce fees jumped to $98 million,
a 717 percent increase from $12 million in 1996. The first big deal
was a $100 million, three-year agreement with long-distance company
Tel-Save Holding, which wanted to market phone service on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company is shifting focus again -- to Washington. Case
has said that U.S. policy decisions will set the course for the
industry's future and greatly affect AOL's business decisions. The
company has responded by has increasing its lobbying force from two
to five people. And it is in the process of setting up its first
political action committee to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been instrumental in setting up the Open
Net Coalition, staffed by Vice President Al Gore's former
technology staffer, Greg Simon, and former National Republican
Committee chairman Rich Bond, to lobby for government intervention
in the cable wars. AOL and others, including MindSpring
Enterprises, want regulators to force cable companies to make their
lines available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's really going on here is that they are trying to
slow down the deployment of broadband technology because they are
not in a position to dominate that market,'' says James Cicconi,
AT&AMP;T's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ulric Weil, managing partner of the Arlington-based Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey brokerage firm isn't concerned AOL will be left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will do a deal when they have to,'' he says. ``AOL
wouldn't even get out of bed for the numbers these cable companies
have.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In third grade, I wanted to be one of two things when
I grew up: either a counterman at my favorite delicatessen,
Feitlin's, in Passaic, N.J. _ free hot dogs and fries _ or a
cigarette girl. No occupation seemed more glamorous: sexy outfits,
lots of lipstick, and the men about town were always happy to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   These days, of course, cigarette girls have gone the way of
Gibson girls. And not only is smoking outlawed now in most New York
restaurants, but so is the sale of individual cigarettes. That is
why cigarette girls aren't employed at Circa Tabac, billed as the
city's only ``cigarette lounge,'' open since December at 32 Watts
St. But it certainly has everything else a smoker could desire.
There's a full bar, an interesting selection of appetizers (in
order to avoid being classified as a restaurant, it does not serve
entrees), an international cigarette menu with more than 100
brands, and every kind of antique cigarette accessory imaginable _
from holders, cases and lighters to a roll-your-own maker from the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Circa Tabac's owners, Lee Ringelheim and Brian Michels, have
devoted themselves to a simple, if currently verboten, concept: to
directly cater to the discerning smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Lord. I asked my friend Nan to join me for a few
stolen hours of Puff Mommy sin. She is a devoted smoker who rails
at the smoking police, which include her husband and college-age
daughter. In my house there are my stepsons and my husband, a
long-reformed three-pack-a-day man who seems convinced he'll start
again if he even smells smoke. Most days, my neighbors find me
inhaling in the service stairway.
</P>
<P>
   Circa Tabac is certainly an improvement. It has a distinctly
different feel from the burly, wood-paneled dens for cigar lovers
around town; while not exclusively feminine, it does have a certain
``Casablanca'' elegance. A smallish space that seats 75, it is
filled with Art Deco touches, including a mirror behind the bar
etched with a woman in evening dress with a cigarette holder
protruding from the silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   The windows are covered in lacy curtains that repeat the
palm-frond motif of the carpets. There are powerful air purifiers
on the ceilings and others strategically placed around the room _
two to remove smoke, two to remove odor. They change the room's air
every six minutes, the owners say. The place smells better than
most restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was early, 6 p.m. (the lounge opens daily at 5 p.m.
and goes till 2 a.m. Sundays through Wednesdays and to 4 a.m. on
weekends), the room was almost half full with a young, chic,
racially mixed clientele, which looked like the lounge's staff:
dressed in black and decoratively tattooed.
</P>
<P>
   Plates of spinach won tons and filet mignon en croissant passed
quickly to a table of 16 that filled the back wall, while
painstakingly poured cosmopolitans and martinis crept by more
slowly. As far as we were concerned, though, dinner could wait.
Framing the bar is a dizzying variety of cigarette packages, and
upon being seated at a tiny circular table in oversize velvet
chairs, we were handed a cigarette menu.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. We could choose from Britain, Canada, Indonesia, Turkey,
France, Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Spain, Japan, China, Greece,
Germany, the Netherlands, Uruguay, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland,
India or, naturally, the United States. There were also
tobacco-free herbal cigarettes. Please.
</P>
<P>
   After serious consideration, Nan and I ordered two packs _
Cleopatra Lites from Egypt and Al Capone Sweets, Cognac-dipped
cigarillos from Germany. Cleopatra came in a gold striped paper
box, Al Capone in a navy plastic box adorned with the slogan ``no
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Which did not apply to us. Emboldened by Circa Tabac's Candyland
atmosphere, we gave full vent to our disgust of the punitive world
outside. ``On my way over here I passed a Y,'' Nan said, ``and
there was a big sign out front: `The YMCA thanks you for not
smoking within 15 feet of the YMCA entrance.''' We shook our heads,
then bemoaned the new Jackson Pollock stamp, which pictures him in
his famous crouch but erases the cigarette from his mouth. I also
told Nan I had just read that in the next James Bond movie, for the
first time, 007 will not smoke. ``That's censorship!'' she cried.
``Ian Fleming created a character who smoked and drank martinis.''
</P>
<P>
   We were soothed by the arrival of our drinks _ bourbon all
around _ and opened the Cleopatra pack first, reveling in the
freshness of the new-tobacco smell. The cigarettes were just as
good to smoke, with a mild, pleasant taste. The best part, though,
was not what we were smoking but how we were smoking. I leaned all
the way back in my plush chair and stretched my arm along its side,
taking up as much space as I possibly could.
</P>
<P>
   I've become so accustomed to affecting an apologetic cringe when
I smoke in company, twisting one arm out of its socket to try to
aim the smoke in an opposite direction. Even if people insist they
don't mind, someone will invariably make a show of opening a window
or pushing a chair from the table, and I find myself puffing faster
and faster and slumping lower and lower and end up just as glad as
they are when I'm finished. But here, there was no rush, no
schoolmarmish sighs and glares. If I knew how to blow smoke rings,
I would have.
</P>
<P>
   Nan lighted another. ``Why aren't these places all over town?''
she asked longingly. We called Ringelheim over to ask him, but he
said he and Michels were more interested in pursuing South Beach
than midtown. What a shame. At the next table, a waitress opened a
humidor to display some cigars to a man smoking cigarettes. He
considered a while, then shook his head. The four twentysomething
women at another table got up to leave and were quickly replaced by
four more, yet the room stayed at about half capacity. ``People
must hear `cigarette lounge' and think it will smell like a
clogged-up opium den,'' Nan said. ``They probably want to avoid
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled. ``Let them,'' I said, while lighting up an Al Capone.
Even though the Cognac dip tasted sweet, this was a macho smoke,
thick and rolled with dark leaves. A busboy came by and replaced
the dirty ashtray with a clean one _ the fourth time he did so in
less than an hour. Nan looked around. ``It's not the slightest bit
smoky in here,'' she said triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Our waitress brought the bill and stayed to chat. We learned
that the BBC recently shot a documentary here on the history of
smoking and that, unsurprisingly, the space was popular for private
parties. It would surely be ideal for a cocktail party. She
laughed. ``Actually, we had a baby shower here a few weeks ago,''
she said. ``They all smoked.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, Nan and I split custody of the cigarettes; she
loved Cleopatra, so I settled for Capone. The following week, when
we got together again, this time for dinner with our husbands, I
rejoiced to see that she had brought along the remainder. We were
at a restaurant with a smoking section, and she and I each lighted
a Cleopatra. Almost instinctively, I leaned back in my chair and
exhaled luxuriantly. My husband took this as a cue to wave his hand
in front of his face. ``Can't you blow it in the other direction?''
he asked plaintively.
</P>
<P>
   Nan's husband, delighted with his anti-smoking company, started
waving his hand, too. She dutifully turned in her seat, bent her
arm back, twisted her neck and blew the smoke sideways. I shifted
my legs so my body faced away from the table and blew the smoke
down, while craning my head back to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Nan hunched over to whisper. ``Next time,'' she said,
``we'll go smoking without them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' I said, ``we'll go to the chiropractor.''

APATHY, LENGTHY DEBATE MAY KILL OVERHAUL OF TEXAS CONSTITUTION &HT;     
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As chairmen of the state Legislature's
budget-writing committees, Sen. Bill Ratliff and Rep. Rob Junell
usually have enough muscle to remove obstacles to their legislative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But so far they haven't been able to budge the public apathy
that threatens to smother their proposed overhaul of the
123-year-old Texas Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate State Affairs Committee held a public
hearing on the effort, and only six witnesses showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists _ hundreds of whom have signed up to battle each other
over electric utility deregulation, insurance, vouchers, abortion
and numerous other divisive issues _ are mostly ignoring the
Ratliff-Junell proposal. And average Texas residents are nowhere to
be found.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, the Senate's presiding officer, has
received only two letters on the issue, said spokesman Ray
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, believes that many Texans, tired of
being asked to vote on a long list of constitutional amendments
after each legislative session, would welcome the opportunity to
vote on a shorter, modern document.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits that his and the San Angelo Democrat's proposal,
filed separately in the Senate and the House as SJR1 and HJR1,
hasn't stirred up the public or created any sense of urgency among
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can this Legislature tackle a matter of the gravity of the
constitution in the absence of a crisis?'' Ratliff asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're accused of not being able to do that. I'd like to think
that we have enough members in the Legislature who can look
seriously at something as important as this and be able to do it
proactively rather than be driven by a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers say it is unrealistic to expect the
Legislature to rewrite the entire state constitution in one
session, particularly when Perry, House Speaker Pete Laney and Gov.
George W. Bush are all cool toward the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem are controversial features in the
Ratliff-Junell proposal _ including a Cabinet and more powers for
the governor, term limits for legislators and changes in the
judiciary _ that could each generate extensive debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we have enough time,'' said state Rep. Joe
Driver, R-Garland, chairman of a special committee that Laney
appointed to consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Although constitutional revision is the only issue that Driver's
nine-member committee will address, the panel waited until March 1,
seven weeks into the 20-week session, to have its first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Driver predicted that the House would do little more than
``clean up'' the present constitution by removing some obsolete
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan is to kick something out (of committee) that makes
nonsubstantive or minimal changes,'' he said. ``The present
constitution has worked well for a long time. So I'm not rushing to
make major changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff and Junell argue that the constitution, initially
adopted in 1876, has been able to work at all in modern times
because it has been amended more than 370 times, a tiring process
for both legislators and voters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Daymond John, the co-founder and chief executive
of Fubu hip-hop clothing, drives through his old neighborhood in
Hollis, Queens, he leaves no doubt that he has moved on _ and up.
</P>
<P>
   His Bentley, royal blue with a matching pinstripe on the
cream-color upholstery and so new that plastic wrap still covers
the wood paneling, makes heads spin in this working-class enclave.
John shook his head when he saw two women walking by to inspect the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't brought it around here before because it makes us
look unattainable,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing attainable is no small concern. Fubu stands for ``For
us, by us.'' The company, which was founded in 1992, has prospered
by promoting itself as a black-owned label by and for young urban
men.
</P>
<P>
   The founders, who also include Carl Brown, Keith Perrin and J.
Alexander Martin, all from Hollis, insist that ``For us, by us'' is
not a call to racial empowerment, but clearly race is part of their
appeal. ``Customers see our pictures and can relate, whereas they
couldn't relate to some 45-year-old man living in Italy,'' John,
30, said. ``We are just like them. We are the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Fubu's origins give it street credibility. And
these days, street credibility translates into sales. Last year,
the company says it sold a stunning $350 million worth of goods,
which catapults it beyond a niche market into a league with labels
like Donna Karan ($670 million) and Tommy Hilfiger ($847 million.)
</P>
<P>
   But because Fubu's success is so dependent on its homeboy
appeal, this wow-wow growth carries risks. If the company is going
to expand as much as John and his partners would like _ and in the
last year they've added everything from backpacks to a men's suit
line _ it will have to do even more business with middle-class,
mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that nothing destroys the urban buzz of a label
quite so fast as having Westchester teen-agers clamor for it. Tony
Shellman, vice president of Enyce, a Fubu competitor, predicts,
``Fubu is going to lose its street essence as little Johnny in
suburbia starts picking up its stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the brand is having an (italics)it(end italics) moment.
Not only is the rapper LL Cool J, a company spokesman, seen wearing
Fubu designs (he sports Fubu's signature oversize football and
hockey shirts), but also stars like Janet Jackson, Will Smith and
Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   At night, John and his partners make the scene with style
players like Sean (Puffy) Combs, the rap impresario. They recently
received an award for black economic enterprise from Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani. John, who wore a black, sueded rubber Fubu track suit
to Gracie Maison to accept it, took the attention in stride. ``Just
business,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up fast, however, are copycat competitors who say they
have a better bead on the street's needs than Fubu. These days it
seems that every other rap and inner-city entrepreneur is hawking
his own line of baggy fashions.
</P>
<P>
   At some of Manhattan's most fashion-conscious emporiums of urban
gear, Fubu is already losing ground to challengers like Phat Farm,
Mecca USA and Enyce (pronounced en-EE-chay).
</P>
<P>
   At Transit, today's must stop-and-shop, on Lower Broadway, Nikki
Abreu, a manager, said: ``We don't even carry Fubu anymore. It
wasn't selling that much. Enyce is the hottest.''
</P>
<P>
   John and his partners are aware of their rivals, but not
panicked. Short, thick and supremely confident, John is the de
facto company spokesman and persona. He brags that Fubu has a far
closer relationship with customers than other clothing labels have.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many companies do you know that get 5,000 e-mail messages
a day?'' he asked. The e-mail often includes detailed design
suggestions. Some of those, like making a soft leather jacket
covered with small embroidered patterns, have been followed up by
Fubu.
</P>
<P>
   John is too smooth to say so, but he clearly keeps close tabs on
how his company is faring on the streets. He does not want his
Bentley mentioned in this article, for example, because ``people
might get the wrong idea.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his partners also mysteriously refused to be
photographed. (An editor at a hip-hop magazine that was allowed to
shoot the Fubu founders suggested they might be coy about appearing
in The New York Times because it would make them seem co-opted by
the establishment.)
</P>
<P>
   The founders keep a high profile in the old neighborhood, doing
good deeds like handing out Thanksgiving turkeys and filling the
Christmas wish lists of needy local children.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Fubu men rely on one another to stay grounded.
All of their clothes, whether designed in the house by Martin or by
outside licensees, have to be approved by three of the four
partners. They make a wide range of products, from the core men's
casual line, emphasizing oversize cuts and bright colors, to
footwear and lounge wear (think red satin robes a la Hugh Hefner).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all like it, it'll probably sell,'' John said
confidently. Whatever the changing public perception, he believes
that he and his partners are too rooted in their community to be
cut off from it by a little flash and money.
</P>
<P>
   Their life story, as he tells it, is a Horatio Alger tale
updated for the VH-1 age. In 1992, John was waiting tables at a
local Red Lobster and working any get-rich scheme he could think
of. These included, as he told Vibe magazine this month, dealing
crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I started the company that I didn't have
something crooked going on,'' he was quoted as saying by Vibe.
</P>
<P>
   Although being known as a former drug dealer may enhance a rap
star's ``street cred,'' it is no asset for a businessman whose
clothes are manufactured and distributed by Samsung, the Korean
electronics giant. John declined to comment on the Vibe article. A
company spokeswoman, Leslie Short, said, ``Those remarks were taken
out of context, and frankly I am very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fubu began modestly enough. The fashion rage at the time was
wool hats with their tops cut off and tied with string. When John
saw the hats being sold for $20, he corraled a next-door neighbor,
Carl Brown, to help sew up a bunch. The two sold their homemade
headwear for $10 a pop in front of the New York Coliseum. They made
$800 in a single day, and a clothing label was born.
</P>
<P>
   There were years of struggle as John and Brown (whose job now is
to handle licensees), joined by Martin and Perrin (who now manages
celebrity relations), moved into John's mother's house and sewed
logos on hockey jerseys and sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Their first break came in 1993, when they convinced LL Cool J, a
double-platinum rapper, who grew up a just few blocks from John's
home, to pose in a Fubu T-shirt. It took months more of cajoling
and sitting in on video shoots to persuade him to wear the line
while performing. When he did, Fubu started taking off.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, a paid spokesman for the company since 1996, managed
to pull off a perfect bit of insider subversion by wearing a Fubu
hat in an advertisement he did for the Gap a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   John says the company also found motivation in what the partners
perceived as efforts by white-owned outdoor apparel brands like
Timberland and North Face, popular with inner-city youths, to
distance themselves from the customers who were making them street
chic.
</P>
<P>
   Fubu's marketing played off a sense of shared resentment at
being ignored. Gritty pictures of Fubu's founders, posed with
exposed tattoos, reversed baseball caps and a hint of gang-style
menace, started popping up in magazine advertisements and even on
the company's labels. The message was clear enough to the
initiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what they were talking about, and it made me happy,''
said Tracii McGregor, executive editor of The Source, a magazine on
hip-hop culture. ``The way they are marketing is unmistakably
black.''
</P>
<P>
   But gangsta style has it limitations, said Irma Zandl, president
of a youth marketing consulting firm in New York. ``There is
something about their premise that is a little alienating for
nonblacks,'' she continued. ``I've had white kids say to me, `They
don't want me to wear this.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Watkins, president and chief executive of Icon Lifestyle
Marketing, a marketing company that focuses on urban areas, said
that even if this were true, concessions of any type to the
suburban market would be the wrong way to go. So far, Fubu has done
well, he said, because ``they have let people outside the market
come to them, instead of the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered Fubu a bit of Shakespearean advice: ``They just have
to keep their marketing message the same _ and be true to
themselves.''

 &HT;    `Falling' about a marriage doomed from the start
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is no more finely calibrated human
hell than a bad marriage. Half of us have been in them, and we've
all seen them. Let's face it, even some of the marriages that seem
to be good aren't. Nobody knows what goes on inside a marriage
except the two people in it, and sometimes not even then.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist John Taylor (``Storming the Magic Kingdom,'' ``Circus
of Ambition'') has written a book about his marriage's failure, and
you know it won't be an ennobling saga about rising from the ashes
when he compares people without a prenuptial to criminals who don't
think about prison when they commit their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marriage wasn't hellish, it was simply dispiriting,'' he
writes. ``My wife and I didn't hate each other, we simply got on
each other's nerves.'' Actually, as the book proceeds, it's obvious
that they did dislike each other but were either too well-mannered
or too indifferent to bring out the long knives.
</P>
<P>
   Since Taylor's marriage is his book, to review the latter is to
review the former. So let's go right to What Went Wrong: The
marriage was doomed because neither party had a sense of humor.
There, I've said it. More important than intellectual stimulation,
and damn near as important as sexual compatibility, husbands and
wives had better be able to make each other laugh, because, baby,
it's cold outside.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing _ you'd better never think that it'll
get easy, because it never does. Marriage is hard work; it's
supposed to be hard work, otherwise, every marriage would succeed.
(Personal disclosure: I've been married to my only wife for 13
years, and I've always regarded the entire transaction as a
glorified 12-step program: one day at a time.)
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his wife separated after 11 1/2 years. He started
having affairs shortly after their daughter was born. What's worse
is that, as Taylor tells it, the marriage was never good.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing here about the good times, the great sex, the
shared interests, the laughter, all those things that can logically
lead you to the delusion that you can spend the rest of your life
with someone.
</P>
<P>
   No, this was one of those three-yard-and-a-cloud-of-dust
relationships, a slow, grinding slog down the field only to find
that the goalposts have receded just when you thought you were in
field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   The gray, ominous air of an impending icestorm permeates
``Falling.'' ``Our marriage was a mechanism so encrusted with small
disappointments and petty grudges that its parts no longer
closed.'' Rage grows, and it doesn't take much to set it off.
Taylor takes a baseball bat to a car whose alarm won't shut off; at
another point, he assaults a cabdriver who refuses to take him to
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough when one marital partner is a brooder and an
injustice collector, but when there are two of them, it's not a
question of whether things will explode, just when.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, a successful marriage involves some harsh
choices, as well as a little luck _ not a combination frequently
encountered when the hormones are pounding like jungle drums. There
are more ways to fail in a marriage than to succeed. (My favorite
strategy was told to me by my aunt, who was married for 54 years:
``You both have to agree to always put the other person first.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling'' is more clinical than voyeuristic, probably because
Taylor and his wife have a teen-age daughter. Even the feverish
gropings that are early-stage affairs tend, in Taylor's telling, to
devolve into accusations and unhappiness. If his affairs ended up
as miserably as his marriage, why was Taylor bothering?
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad, mildly corrosive book, and Taylor asks a lot of
questions (``Are we all opaque to ourselves? . . . Were we weaker
people than our parents? . . . Did we have less self-control, a
diminished sense of duty?'') without answering them.
</P>
<P>
   There is one nice touch of irony: Taylor gets roped into paying
lifetime maintenance to his ex-wife _ she has an early case of
Parkinson's _ obligating him for an immense sum of money. I rather
like the idea of his writing a conspicuously public book about
their mutual failure in order to get money he'll need to pay
alimony.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tinge of malice to it _ maybe some of this confused,
unconsciously poignant and very dark book rubbed off on me.

 &HT;    Nonfiction top 100 won't get same reation
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Coming: 100 top nonfiction books (Do you
care?)
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to repeat the publicity storm that greeted last spring's
list of the 100 greatest novels of the century, the Modern Library
will be issuing its list of the 100 greatest nonfiction books of
the century at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: there will be no remotely similar reaction. For one
thing, readers don't have anywhere near the emotional connection to
nonfiction that that they do to fiction; for another, the list of
nonfiction books will probably be largely confined to the postwar
era, because, other than occasional bright spots such as Hendrik
Van Loon, H.L. Mencken, H.G. Wells, Douglas Southall Freeman and
John Hersey, nonfiction as such didn't really flower until the
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Modern Library is expanding its publications by
inaugurating several new series. The Harlem Renaissance series will
debut this spring, and Modern Library War, edited by Caleb Carr
will begin reissuing books. Later this year will come Modern
Library Exploration, edited by Jon Krakauer, and Modern Library
Hollywood, edited by Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   New wrinkles . . .
</P>
<P>
   Please welcome Vivisphere Publishing, an on-demand publishing
operation that will keep its list of titles digitally stored. Among
the previously out-of-print titles offered are books by Erskine
Caldwell, Mel Arrighi and Terry Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   On-demand publishing boasts that it can print just one copy,
when ordered by a bookstore or any of the online suppliers. The
upside is that, in the very near future, it's possible that many
books will never go out of print. The downside is that, unless the
major publishers get behind this concept with their backlists, all
that on-demand publishers will be able to get are the rights to
books few people want.
</P>
<P>
   Zora . . .
</P>
<P>
   Go Gator and Muddy the Water (Norton, $13.95) is a wonderful
collection of writing by Zora Neale Hurston from the time she spent
working for the Federal Writers' Project during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston's modest stipend enabled her to travel around Florida
and record local folklore and storytelling. There's much humor
here, as field hands gather and try to top each other with
picturesque insults. The Works Projects Administration, the
umbrella organization that the FWP was under, published some of
Hurston's work _ but not much _ in its Florida Guide, but the
enterprising work of editor Pamela Bordelon in the WPA archives
restores more of the work of one of America's better writers to
print.

CORYDALIS STANDBYS GREET THEIR DISTANT COUSINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 14)  
(mk) 
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are a colorful group, the corydalises. Their small,
trumpet-shaped flowers are tinted in yellows, blues, reds, pinks,
purples or whites. Their foliage spectrum encompasses blue-greens
sheathed with silver to warm greens tipped with bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Many glow in dark corners, and others shine in full sun. Until
the last decade or so, they were almost unknown in 20th-century
American gardens. Now, with the fall of the Soviet Union, there are
a host of exciting new plants becoming available, and there is
renewed interest in old standbys as well.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those standbys enrich my central New Jersey borders. The
first to bloom, usually by late March, is Corydalis solida. Like
most other members of the genus, it does not have a popular name,
so I simply call it pink corydalis. But ``various shades of
lavender-pink corydalis'' would be more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Classified as a perennial, pink corydalis is usually offered by
bulb catalogs because of its tuberous nature. Its refined,
blue-green foliage glistens in the bareness of early spring shade
gardens. The abundant flowers, reaching no more than six inches,
are equally attractive.
</P>
<P>
   As with all corydalis plants, they cluster on short spikes,
technically called racemes.
</P>
<P>
   My plants were a gift from a garden dating back to the turn of
the century. It was around then that pink corydalis disappeared
from horticultural favor. This was no mean feat, because like most
corydalis plants, it is a prolific self-seeder. Perhaps it was a
victim of European sentiment, which deemed it rather plebeian
because it is so widespread throughout the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness American gardeners are no longer in thrall to
European horticultural dictates. With its good looks and carefree
nature, pink corydalis, common though it may be, is wonderful in
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Fernleaf corydalis (C. cheilanthifolia) is an equally handsome,
low-maintenance flower. As long as it has excellent drainage, it is
a superb front-of-the-border or rock garden plant, provided it has
shade or only morning sun. Its soft yellow flowers appear about a
week or two after those of pink corydalis. Similar in height, the
two form a charming pastel combination.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pink corydalis, which goes dormant in summer, the
fernlike foliage sprays forth joyously, often all year long, from a
central rosette. In fall, bronze shades tip the warm green tones.
In winter, frost often sparkles on the lacy, finely textured
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Fernleaf also differs from pink corydalis in that it is a
relative newcomer. In 1933, as reported in Bailey's Standard
Cyclopedia of Horticulture, fernleaf corydalis was not only rare in
the garden but also ``probably unknown in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't totally true. Henry Francis du Pont, the plant
collector who created Winterthur, had managed to obtain fernleaf
corydalis from central China despite the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria in 1931. He placed it in one of his rocky slopes and then
moved on to other projects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, when du Pont decided to develop his slope as the Quarry
Garden, he found fernleaf corydalis splashed throughout its nooks
and crannies. Since it had demonstrated such amazing ease of care,
he made it part of the site's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   C.lutea is ubiquitous in England, its golden yellow flowers and
rich blue-green foliage found in locations ranging from sunny
sidewalk cracks to woodland glens. As recently as 1986, Donald
Wyman was writing in his Gardening Encyclopedia that it should be
grown more widely in United States borders.
</P>
<P>
   American gardeners may have hesitated to do so because they may
have heard that yellow corydalis, a perennial that grows to six to
eight inches, is suited only to alkaline limestone soils. That
doesn't hold true in my acidic dirt. From May through light October
frosts, this gem of a workhorse blooms away in dark settings. In
full sun, it flowers from mid-April to mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   While botanists distinguish between C. lutea and C. ochroleuca,
I find they are very similar in appearance, except that C.
ochroleuca bears creamy white flowers, is not as prolific a
self-seeder and must have shade. Nestled in a dark, slightly moist,
protected corner on my property, it flowered from mid-April through
the first week of December last year.
</P>
<P>
   As attractive as these corydalises are, even more enticing ones
are entering the horticultural pipeline. They were discovered by
plant explorers in the Soviet Union during the Cold War and are
only now being seen in the West, largely through the efforts of a
Latvian horticulturist, Janis Ruksans.
</P>
<P>
   From Magadan in far eastern Siberia, there is C. magadanica, a
white-flowered dwarf with silver-tinged foliage. Vladivostok is the
home of C. turczaninowii Kedrovaya Padj, with bright blue flowers
and light green, finely divided leaves.
</P>
<P>
   A profusion of C. solida cultivars have emerged. Blushing Girl,
with soft, creamy pink flowers, was found in Riga. The milky white
flowers of Snowstorm were discovered in a Latvian river valley. The
Penza strain was gathered in central Russia and features flowers
ranging from pure white to muddy blue.
</P>
<P>
   Though long obscure in this century, colorful, easy-care
corydalis flowers could easily become garden staples in the next.

VINTAGE AIRPLANE HAS PLENTY OF WORK, THANKS TO NAFTA 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
(for release Sunday, March 14) By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas _ In the new era of air cargo along the border,
Charles ``Chuck'' Stewart flies to Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, picks up a load of car parts and drops them off five hours
later in Guadalajara, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The next flight might be up the Rio Grande to load auto
components in Laredo, then down south to a factory in Saltillo,
Mexico. Or up to Evansville, Ind., with wire harnesses for washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 49, and his cargo company are riding a growing demand
on the border for air freight delivery of auto and electronic
component parts created by NAFTA and other U.S.-Mexico trade
treaties. The parts are shuttled overnight to northern U.S.
assembly lines after they are manufactured at hundreds of plants
known as ``maquiladoras'' south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fly anything, anywhere, anytime,'' is the catchy slogan of
International Air Services, the company Stewart formed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But notice Stewart doesn't advertise getting there at jet speed.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the workhorses of this family-owned McAllen air
freight service are three World War II-vintage Douglas DC-3s _
silver-bodied, propeller-driven airplanes that are perhaps the most
recognizable, efficient and durable of any American-built aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the jet age, when newer aircraft can whisk their cargo
at 450 mph, the DC-3 can still compete. Although it plows along at
a tame 175 mph, the aging transport can cheaply deliver up to three
tons of bulky parts to a destination 1,200 miles away or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DC-3 still provides a critical service, and I don't see it
ending anytime soon because no one has built an airplane that can
replace it,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing about the DC-3 is that it can go so far. It
carries 800 gallons of fuel _ which is seven hours of flying time
plus reserve. It can go nonstop for 1,200 miles. That's a long way
to carry cargo. It would take a truck days to go that far.''
</P>
<P>
   And NAFTA has given new life to these veteran aircraft, which
for decades were hangared in airfields along the border and flown
deep into Mexico by contraband smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, scores of DC-3s, Curtiss C-46s, Lockheed
Lodestars, Fairchild ``Flying Boxcars,'' and other surplus military
transports were crammed full of Sony color TVs, VCRs, radios,
pantyhose, Bic pens, jogging shoes and other consumer items, and
flown to clandestine landing strips all over Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggled goods stocked the shelves of Mexico's huge black
market _ known as the ``fayuca'' trade _ which developed because of
past trade restrictions that slapped hefty customs duties on most
imported items. And while the contraband pilots were not breaking
U.S. law by exporting the merchandise, Mexican officials who caught
them often seized the aircraft, confiscated the untaxed merchandise
and sometimes even threw the pilots in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``As NAFTA came into effect, it became a situation where it was
no longer as profitable to move the stuff clandestinely into
Mexico,'' said Stewart, who acknowledged flying for the fayuca
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stewart and his pilots are not concerned about operating
cargo airplanes that in most cases are older than the pilots who
fly them _ planes that were first laid out on drafting boards in
1934. Because of strict FAA regulations, every component of a DC-3
except the airframe _ from radios to propellers, tires and engines
_ must be replaced or rebuilt after so many hours of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very docile, a very smooth-flying airplane. It almost
flies itself,'' said Kyle Battle, a 30-year-old Plano, Texas,
native who often co-pilots a DC-3 for International Air. ``It's
amazing, but there are quite a few still flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Stewart's pilots is John Emerson, a former Navy
combat pilot who logged 175 missions over Vietnam and 300 carrier
landings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done all types of flying. I've flown fast, flown high,
shot at people, dropped bombs, taught people to fly, but I've
always wanted to fly `The Doug.' It's the ultimate transport,''
said Emerson, 58, who began flying DC-3s last month after moving to
McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   For Emerson, Stewart and other pilots, the allure of the DC-3 is
not only the plane's rugged utility _ Stewart last year flew one
which had logged 104,000 flight hours _ but the opportunity to fly
a bona fide hunk of aviation lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This airplane has a colorful and very diverse history,''
Stewart said. ``It has done everything you can imagine. There's a
version built with skis on it that has done research work in the
Arctic and Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in virtually every theater of operation in the
world, pressed into any kind of service you can think of. This
airplane is built like a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured in huge numbers by Douglas Aircraft Co., the DC-3
was built after American Airlines asked the company to widen its
already popular DC-2 so sleeping berths could be installed. The
company reluctantly agreed, and international aviation experts say
the resulting airliner is one of the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, a military version of the DC-3, called the
C-47 Skytrain, was produced with reinforced floors and double cargo
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The C-47 ``made such an important contribution to the U.S. war
effort that General Eisenhower considered them to be one of the
four most significant weapons of World War II,'' according to
``Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   They even fought as heavily armed gunships in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Douglas built 10,654 such aircraft between 1935 and
1947, Russian allies produced another 2,000 and Japan built 485
with plans obtained before the war, according to ``Jane's.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the thousands manufactured, finding a DC-3 today is
not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's air freight operation has three. Two were purchased
last year in Michigan and Canada where they were hauling freight or
passengers to the Northwest Territories. The third DC-3 was found
in an aircraft graveyard in the Arizona desert and refitted.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a Vietnam veteran who came to McAllen in 1982 from
Michigan to fly air charters, decided to stay in the Rio Grande
Valley ``because I liked the climate, I liked the people and I
thought there was opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious with NAFTA that McAllen's airport needed
an operation that was going to specialize in cargo,'' Stewart said.

THEY'RE ROUNDING UP EELS IN TEXAS 
 
By TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONAVILLE, Texas _ Out here on the fertile prairie west of
Houston, the coming summer holds the promise of something beyond
its usual bounty of tall corn, fat watermelons and sleek cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Signs are that 1999 will be a banner year for eels, too.
</P>
<P>
   You heard right, pardner: eels, those slimy, snakey fish chiefly
known for lurking in coral reefs and providing skins for belts and
wallets.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that the freshwater variety, which do their
lurking in rivers and ponds, are eminently edible and much in
demand in certain markets. To serve those markets, a fast-growing
Chinese company called Longshan Group is out to make Waller County
the eel capital of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Eels may not seem like a natural fit for a county where most of
the water is found in stock tanks or irrigation ditches and marine
life generally means crawfish, turtles and frogs. But Longshan,
whose eel ranch is about halfway between Brookshire and Hempstead,
has been raising blue eels at the location since 1997 for sale to
Asian restaurants and supermarkets from Houston to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business in this country as Longshan USA, the company
recently acquired an indoor aquarium facility near Katy where tiny
inch-long baby eels are being nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by month's end Longshan expects to fire up the
ovens at its new processing plant in Hempstead, where filleted eel
will be steamed or broiled, packaged and shipped across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Longshan is finishing what amounts to its start-up
phase, during which it acquired a production site, dug and filled
ponds, and raised and marketed its initial _ herds? crops? schools?
_ of eel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term is `harvests,' '' explains Christina Lynn Koo,
Longshan's chief financial officer. When the 6-inch fingerlings get
to 1{ to 2 pounds, or about 18 inches long, ``we harvest them by
seining the ponds. We've already had a number of harvests.''
</P>
<P>
   A baby eel reaches market size in a year to 18 months, during
which it spends its time idling in the muddy water and grazing on
the gelatinous glop of fish meal and potato starch that's dumped at
water's edge each day.
</P>
<P>
   The budding eels' only worry comes from above, says General
Manager Jim Meader. ``The herons and cormorants manage to get a
bunch of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Left alone and fed regularly, these eels would grow to 10 pounds
or more, but by then they would be up to 3 feet long, too awkward
to net and handle, and far too tough for customers' tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The seining and culling, which assigns market-size eels to
holding tanks and sends the rest back to the ponds, is a
never-ending chore. Each of the 40 eel ponds on the Longshan site
is seined twice monthly.
</P>
<P>
   The task involves first stretching a 20-by-400-foot net along
two sides of the 2-acre pond. Then, with the help of workers in the
water and tractors on the levees, the net is guided slowly across
to the opposite corner, where the now-compressed net is filled with
a roiling, writhing mass of eels.
</P>
<P>
   The workers then move the eels into tank-trailers, using
hand-held basket nets, and trundle them over to the sorting table
and holding tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The eels are a handful. Or rather, they're not: Smooth and
slippery as, well, eels, they easily squirm out of all but the
firmest handholds. On the plus side, their catfishlike skins are
tough and durable, and they have no teeth or spiny fins to watch
out for.
</P>
<P>
   Eels sorted for shipment are put in plastic bags with ice,
boxed, then trucked away, usually to Houston's Bush
Intercontinental Airport, in a cold-induced stupor. Eels survive
unusually well in very little water, and there's no fresher product
than one that's still alive when it arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process _ ``very labor intensive,'' Koo admits _ was
imported from China, where eel-raising is a huge industry. The
pilot project here has been modeled after its Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That even included the construction of the ponds,'' says Koo.
``A man from China was brought in to supervise the earth-moving,
and he relied on his mental picture of the ponds back home to
determine the size and banking. The `blueprint' for everything was
in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Meader says the ``old country'' approach resulted in a few
problems, such as misaligned levees, but there's nothing that can't
be fixed as the operation matures.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described jack-of-all-trades who until recently managed
an area fish farm, Meader, 50, already is plotting improvements for
the Longshan operation. Right away, he wants to automate the
tedious seining and sorting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes way too long,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there's no arguing with success, and so far the
Monaville eel ranch has been that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to reinvent the wheel for a lot of our business side,
but things are coming together,'' says Koo. ``Our sales are up.
We're expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Koo came into the eel business by way of her father, Carlos Koo,
a California businessman who became lead investor in Longshan's new
stateside project through friends with the company in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese wanted a foothold in the U.S. market because they
were concerned about possible over-reliance on Japanese buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Father tapped 26-year-old daughter, who has a master's degree in
economics from the University of California at Davis to oversee the
project. With no previous agricultural experience, she concedes she
felt a little overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seemed like an adventure, and my dad needed someone he
could trust. So here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   She first scouted possible sites in California and Arizona, but
either land costs were too high or water supplies too iffy to make
the grade. On a hunch, she moved her search to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't end up right here by design, but just by luck _ good
luck,'' says Lynn Koo. ``But this is rice-farming territory and
there's lots of water. It figured we ought to look here.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting started at the 255-acre site involved more than
pond-digging. Wells had to be drilled, pipe laid, pumps installed,
permits and licenses secured, feed supplies arranged _ the list
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of eels to the ponds was almost an
afterthought. ``We weren't even sure they'd grow here. In China
they grow in river water,'' says Koo.
</P>
<P>
   But grow they did. The first 500,000 fingerlings, air-shipped
from China, were put in the water here in the spring of 1997. By
the end of 1998, Longshan had sold its first 15,000 pounds of fresh
eel.
</P>
<P>
   Production capacity at the site here is about 50,000 pounds a
year, Koo says.
</P>
<P>
   The operation doesn't include eel-breeding. Meader says eel
reproduction is somewhat mysterious and takes place only in the
wild, which is why captured baby eels must be imported regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Meader guesses the facility now has about 120,000 pounds of eel
in the water, ranging in size from a few ounces to as much as three
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   If 15,000 pounds of eel sales _ or even the targeted 50,000 _
doesn't sound like a lot, Meader reminds that the eel market isn't
quite the same as that for catfish or beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish sells for maybe 75 cents a pound,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The price for live freshwater eel: $5 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big money,'' he says.

ECUADOR'S SINKING ECONOMY COMPARED TO THE TITANIC 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Once again, things seem to be getting crazy in
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after mass demonstrations led to the ouster of a
flamboyant president who called himself ``El Loco,'' or ``the Crazy
One,'' protesters returned to the streets last week to decry their
current president's failure to stanch an economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, inflation jumped so fast that supermarkets hired
emergency help to keep up with price changes. Long lines formed at
instant-cash machines after banks were ordered to shut until next
Monday to stop a panicked run on deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Police and army troops used tear gas to break up riots and
looting during a two-day national strike. Following wild rumors
that President Jamil Mahuad was preparing to resign, the government
declared a 60-day state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad survived last week's strike. But he acknowledged that
this impoverished South American nation of 12 million people is on
the brink of disaster. At one point, he compared Ecuador's sinking
economy to the Titanic. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In a nationally televised speech Thursday night, Mahuad tried
to stop the hemorrhaging by proposing steep budget cuts and tax
increases. Many fear the austerity measures will provoke more
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's worst economic crisis in decades was brought on by
natural and man-made disasters.
</P>
<P>
   A brief border war with Peru in 1995 led to a surge in military
spending that, analysts say, the country could not afford. Soon
afterward, prices for oil, one of Ecuador's main exports, began to
plunge. Last year, Ecuador's oil income dropped to nearly one-half
of 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 El Nino weather pattern caused $2.6 billion in flood
damage along the nation's Pacific coast. Washed-out roads and
bridges prevented exporters from getting their products to ports,
leading to a wave of defaults on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Bad loans _ plus the January currency crisis in Brazil, which
sparked capital flight throughout Latin America _ led to the
failure of a handful of Ecuador's leading banks. An &UR;  &LR; effort to bail
them out sparked inflation and weakened the sucre, which has lost
half of its value in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our money isn't worth anything,'' lamented Francisco Lara, a
truck driver. His monthly wage of about 2.2 million sucres is now
worth less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of confronting the looming fiscal deficit, analysts say,
Ecuador's political class has been entangled in scandals and
infighting.
</P>
<P>
   The past two presidents _ Abdala Bucaram, who was widely called
``El Loco,'' and Fabian Alarcon, who served as Bucaram's
replacement until new elections were held last year _ were
sidetracked by corruption charges and left office in disgrace. Even
before Mahuad was sworn in last August, Ecuador's economic
situation was viewed as critical.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, a Harvard graduate and a successful two-term mayor of
Quito, initially won wide support by signing a treaty to end the
long-running border dispute with Peru and by waging a war on
government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   To address the economic crisis, he eliminated subsidies on
cooking gas and raised gasoline prices. Further austerity measures
were blocked by legislators in the 121-member Congress, where
Mahuad's political party lacks a majority of seats.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been months of gridlock, according to analysts.
In his speech Thursday, Mahuad called on Congress to do the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I govern if I'm not given the indispensable tools to
do so?`` Mahuad asked in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that some of Ecuador's problems are Mahuad's own
doing, however. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In a country with one of the lowest rates of tax collection in
Latin America, Mahuad eliminated the income tax, a move viewed as
favoring the rich. He replaced it with a 1 percent fee on all bank
transactions, a regressive measure that affects far more people
than an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   And against the advice of experts, Mahuad engineered the bailout
of the loosely regulated financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The government loaned more than $1 billion to several banks, a
cash infusion that required the nation's central bank to print more
sucres. That drove up inflation and pushed down the value of the
currency. The sucre, which traded at 6,400 to the dollar in
November, reached a record of 18,000 to the dollar early this month
before stabilizing at 12,800. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Diego Cornejo, assistant editor of the Quito newspaper Hoy,
said that Mahuad felt obligated to go forward with the bailout,
because he had received huge campaign contributions from bankers.
Still, eight banks have closed down or have been taken over by the
state in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its troubles, Ecuador _ due to its small size _ has
received just a fraction of the attention showered on other
financially strapped Latin American nations such as Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Some people complain that after Nicaragua and Honduras were
waylaid by Hurricane Mitch last fall, governments and banks
canceled parts of their foreign debt. By contrast, there was no
debt relief for Ecuador after the El Nino flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of debt relief is extremely sensitive. In a nation
where 60 percent of the population is classified as poor, 40
percent of the annual budget is swallowed by payments and interest
on the $15 billion foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   In just seven months, support for Mahuad has dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers are baffled by what they call Mahuad's detached
style. Until Mahuad's Thursday night speech, he had all but
disappeared from public view.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged Congress to approve within 30 days an increase in
the sales tax from 10 percent to 15 percent as well as a tax on
luxury vehicles and a law to imprison tax evaders. He restricted
the amount of money that can be withdrawn from checking and savings
accounts to stem capital flight and proposed steep spending cuts
and banking reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. State Department jumped into the fray, calling on
Ecuador's Congress and the Mahuad administration to ``work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   An impasse could stall negotiations for a long-term accord with
the International Monetary Fund that would give Ecuador access to a
desperately needed $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's strike, demonstrators burned paper-mache
effigies of Mahuad and called for him to step down. But cooler
heads noted that the removal of former President Bucaram _ who was
fired by Congress for ``mental incapacity'' in February 1997 _ made
little difference in the fate of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to sacrifice just so the rich get richer.
That's why they are in the streets,'' said Leonardo Carpio, an oil
worker. ``The idea isn't to oust Mahuad,'' Carpio said. ``The
country can't keep going from coup to coup.''

HISTORY WORTH REPEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday March 15)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people worry how future historians will treat President
Clinton and his scandal-rocked administration.
</P>
<P>
   What people tend to forget is what historians say and what
students learn are often two (or three or four) different things,
as these actual, genuine, documented (hey, they were posted on the
Internet; what more proof do you want?) student bloopers, collected
by teachers throughout the United States, from 8th grade through
college, prove:
</P>
<P>
   ``The inhabitants of Egypt were called mummies. They lived in
the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah
is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain
areas of the dessert are cultivated by irritation. The Egyptians
built the Pyramids in the shape of a huge triangular cube. The
Pyramids are a range of mountains between France and Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   You will notice, as we go along, that many of these so-called
``bloopers'' make more sense than the actual historical facts. The
writing is also considerably livelier than what I remember from
8th-grade history textbooks, which should tell historians
something, though I'm not exactly sure what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw.
Moses led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread,
which is bread made without any ingredients. Afterwards, Moses went
up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. David was a Hebrew
king skilled at playing the liar. He taught with the Philatelists,
a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of
David's sons, had 500 wives and 500 porcupines.''
</P>
<P>
   This student has clearly done his or her homework. Personally, I
found this essay very informative. For example, I did not know that
King David hung out with stamp collectors. It certainly offers a
whole new interpretation to the story of how he ``licked'' Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented
Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were
two singers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin had gone
to Boston carrying all his clothes in his pocket and a loaf of
bread under each arm. He invented electricity by rubbing cats
backwards and declared `a horse divided against itself cannot
stand.' Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew that Benjamin Franklin was one of the more interesting
figures in American history, but I had no idea he was this
interesting. Anyone who has the courage to rub cats backward would
certainly have no fear of the gallows, which could explain
Franklin's extreme patriotism. I wish this student had explained
why Franklin went to Boston nude with a loaf of bread under each
arm. Perhaps there was more to the Boston Tea Party than we were
led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 19th century was a time of many great inventions and
thoughts. The invention of the steam boat caused a network of
rivers to spring up. Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper,
which did the work of 100 men. Samuel Morse invented a code for
telepathy. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis. Charles
Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the `Organ of the Species.'
Madman Curie discovered radium. And Karl Marx became one of the
Marx Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   I must have been out sick the day they taught this because I
don't remember any of this stuff. And I certainly would have
remembered the McCormick raper. While many of the individuals
mentioned here will be remembered forever for their great
accomplishments, it's surprising that we still think so highly of
Louis Pasteur, given the fact that his cure for rabbis was such a
failure.

GOLF SIMULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf courses come in all shapes and sizes. So do golf-simulation
programs for the computer. We'll look at two today, ranging from
the ridiculous (3-D Ultra MiniGolf Deluxe) to the somewhat more
sublime (Tiger Woods 99).
</P>
<P>
   3-D Ultra MiniGolf Deluxe (Windows; about $20-$25) from Dynamix
is the sequel title to the 3-D Ultra MiniGolf. That program had 18
holes of miniature golf, some of them pretty strange.
</P>
<P>
   The standard putt-it-through-the-windmill ones were there, but
so were some other unconventional offerings. One of them, for
instance, was underwater, where an octopus' tentacles were one of
the hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The Deluxe version builds on that theme. Its first 18 holes are
from the original game, but it has added nine more. The new version
also can be played over a local-area network, modem or the
Internet. Internet play is free and supports up to four players.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are good, and the themes of the holes are generally
well conceived. Hitting up the wrong ramp of the sawmill hole, for
instance, sends sawdust flying back from the mill accompanied by
the sound of the blade ripping into lumber. It costs a penalty
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   On another hole, the ball must be putted up a ramp so that it
goes into the screen of a drive-in movie while a monster is in
view.
</P>
<P>
   The animated characters found throughout the holes have
``intelligence coding,'' said a Dynamix spokeswoman. That means the
spider that hides in the ruins on one hole and the shark that
inhabits another can react to the ball in a more realistic fashion
rather than just wondering aimlessly on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are two methods for controlling the putter. Players can
either use the mouse to aim and move the putter, or use the
EasyPutt meter where a power bar gauges the shot based on how long
the mouse button is held down.
</P>
<P>
   Registered buyers of the first version can get a discount from
the publisher for buying the new version.
</P>
<P>
   A playable download demo version is available at www.sierra.com.
It's more than 40 megabytes, so downloading may take time.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods 99 from EA Sports (Windows, PlayStation; about
$35-$40) is this year's version of last year's PGA Tour Golf 98.
Putting a Tiger in the CD-ROM tank is EA's marketing answer to
Links 99, which features a picture of Arnold Palmer on the box
front.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to compare Woods with Links. It's even best not
to, because I expect EA Sports and Access Software, Links' parent
company, had two different markets in mind. Links 99 seems geared
for the Arnie-era golfer who wants pure, super-realistic golf play.
</P>
<P>
   Woods 99, on the other hand, moves along quickly. And while the
game emulates golf, it has many helpful features to make play easy
_ and ways to turn off those features to increase the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Woods 99 offers solid graphics _ although not quite as sharp as
Links _ with quick screen changes between shots. It's possible,
playing against one computer opponent, to move through an entire
18-hold round in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The game supports high-resolution graphics (up to 1600X1200),
but be advised that the higher settings will require a fast system
and a 3-D video card with a chunk of on-board memory to move things
along, and even that can produce choppy graphics if the computer
chemistry isn't right.
</P>
<P>
   There are a wide range of golfers from which to choose, Woods
being only one of several PGA pros on the disk, as well as three
courses: Pebble Beach, TPC at Summerlin, and TPC at Sawgrass. You
can set the game play of the pros from poor to extraordinary _ a
handy feature for allowing users to get the feel of playing and
still remain competitive with the pros.
</P>
<P>
   My 11-stroke lead on Woods looked impressive on the scorecard as
we went back to the clubhouse. I just hoped no one saw me playing
from the red tees, and with Woods set to play only his ``good''
game.
</P>
<P>
   Another big handicap-reducer: The swing meter has a red and
green button on it. Pressing either button before a shot or a putt
automatically lines up the shot and adjusts for wind speed and lie.
Use the green button for a safe shot, the red button for an
aggressive one.
</P>
<P>
   Those items help introduce users to the game, and they allow new
players to play their friends who have become seasoned on the
course without hacking around the course and crisscrossing the
green trying to hit the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Putting without this feature is a good deal harder than it
should be. More than once during the game, the on-screen player
blocked the view of the cup, making it impossible to line up the
putt. The view can be changed, but lining up a putt looking at it
from an off-angle isn't much more of a help.
</P>
<P>
   Players who are experienced at golf sims may prefer the
traditional gameplay offered by Links 99. Those who want more input
before making a purchase can download a playable demo of Tiger
Woods 99 (http://www.gamespot.com/sports/tigerwoo/demos.html), but
take note that it's a 9-megabyte-plus file and takes some time.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Camera Uses
</P>
<P>
   The Kodak DVC323 digital video camera is a small color camera
designed to sit on top of a monitor and show other people on the
Internet what you look like. It has other uses beyond video
conferencing, however.
</P>
<P>
   It came out last year, and the only way to hook it up to a
computer was through a Universal Serial Bus. Not many home users
had one of those on their machines, but with computer prices
dropping, and new ones replacing old ones in the home, USBs are
more common. (It's a small, flat opening in the back of the
computer about the width of a thumb.)
</P>
<P>
   USB connections are now all the rage, in fact. No wonder. Plug a
device in. That's it. The computer knows it's there. Moreover, if
you've forgotten to connect the device, simply plug it in without
rebooting the computer. It will still be found.
</P>
<P>
   The DVC323 is an upgraded version of the DVD300. It supports 30
frames a second (provided the computer has a fast processor) and
has a resolution of about 350-by-290 pixels in video mode. In full
resolution mode for picture snapping, it has a 640-by-480
resolution. That's good, and can be used to make printed shots as
long as the finished product is kept to a small format. For users
who want to turn out pictures to enlarge and pass around, the
resolution falls short.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has a large depth of field, so focusing won't be a
problem. And it can be focused on objects as close as half-foot by
a knob on the top of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The USB feature gives the camera its power. So if you have a
laptop computer with a USB port, the camera becomes portable for
outdoor pictures away from the wall plug. A 10-foot cord gives it
additional movement.
</P>
<P>
   It has the ability to white-balance almost any lighting
automatically from incandescent to fluorescent. PictureWorks Live
software was included with the unit I tested.
</P>
<P>
   Exposures may be set automatically by the camera, or adjusted
manually by the user using software.
</P>
<P>
   The camera's price varies from store to store. The cheapest
price was found from a mail-order company on the Web: about $140.

JAPAN'S ECONOMY SHRANK 2.8 PERCENT IN 1998, GOVERNMENT REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Despite a surge in public spending that was meant to
help touch off a recovery, the Japanese economy was still shrinking
in the fourth quarter of last year, the government reported Friday.
The decline, at an annual rate of 3.2 percent, was a surprisingly
sharp drop that extended the economic contraction to a record five
straight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998 as a whole, the economy contracted by 2.8 percent, the
first annual decline in a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that Japan, the world's second-largest economy,
remained slumped in its worst recession since the end of World War
II. Some economists said that Friday's announcement tended to dash
hopes that Japan might be beginning to recover from its long
downturn. Others noted that the figures, which track the
September-to-December period, are a lagging indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is the last thing Tokyo needs these days as it
tries to raise confidence at home and abroad and entice investors
back to the financial markets and shoppers back to stores. These
kinds of gloomy announcements, particularly after officials have
been making hopeful comments, tend to erode public sentiment and
undermine the credibility of Japanese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a very, very serious decline,'' said Jeffrey D. Young,
economist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``It's huge for a
big economy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last eight years, the economy here has done little more
than seesaw up and down, eking out little overall gain. In recent
years, U.S. officials and other governments have called on Japan to
do its part to revive growth throughout ailing Asia. Now, the
dismal results may intensify calls that the government try
different methods to battle the recession, given that the vast
amounts of money poured into economic revival have so far shown few
results.
</P>
<P>
   The government has released some encouraging data in recent
weeks, and this has raised hopes for an economic lift. But the
situation is highly fluid. Company bankruptcies have plummeted 40
percent from last year's levels, but unemployment is hovering at
record highs. Companies are beginning to sell off some of their
stockpiles, but price deflation is spreading. Orders for new homes
are up, but the houses have not yet been built.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the worst figures in Friday's data reflected the
weakness in home building, which fell in the fourth quarter by 7
percent over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment was that consumer spending, which
makes up some 60 percent of the economy, fell by one-tenth of 1
percent for the quarter, compared with the July-to-September
period. Businesses also cut investment by 5.7 percent over the
previous quarter, an annualized fall of 21 percent that was the
third-largest drop on record.
</P>
<P>
   The government is under enormous pressure to deliver some
positive results. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has vowed to achieve
five-tenths of 1 percent growth for the year that begins on April
1, and Friday, Hiromu Nonaka, the chief Cabinet secretary, echoed
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy for Obuchi to hold onto his job
unless he can ensure that the bad numbers are not repeated,'' said
Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investors have begun to favor Japan's stock market once again in
recent weeks. The government has made significant progress in
cleaning up the nation's financial system, nationalizing two large
banks last fall and toughening the rules that govern the way banks
treat several hundred billion dollars in bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the government marked a milestone by reaching final
plans to pour $63 billion of taxpayers' money into recapitalizing
the banks. Government officials also declared _ to a skeptical
investment community _ that the banks are almost finished with
writing off their unrecoverable loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this step, we are now about to finish the most difficult
part of our job of tackling the bad-loan problem,'' Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Friday at a news conference. ``I
think this will restore the financial industry to health.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have also been heartened by dramatic steps taken
by the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, which last week
drove down the overnight interest rate effectively to zero. Some of
the investors had expected the Bank of Japan to take more steps at
its policy meeting Friday, either to further lower other short-term
interest rates or to signal a shift toward increasing the money
supply through quantitative targets.
</P>
<P>
   But its board members made no change in policy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, had
recently suggested that there was a ``quickening'' in the economy
and that the bottom might come soon. He said in an interview this
week that October was probably the worst moment in the recession.
Friday he reiterated his view that the decline might soon stop, but
he avoided any specific talk of the recession's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many signs these days of the economy's slide being
halted,'' Sakaiya said.
</P>
<P>
   Private economists acknowledge that it is difficult to pinpoint
the bottom of an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it can be said that when we are near a turning
point, it is very difficult to judge _ whether the economy is still
going down, leveling off, or picking up; this is a difficult
judgment for any economy,'' said Makoto Nomura, chief economist at
Sumitomo Life Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He added, half-jokingly, ``So when it's difficult, that usually
means it's near the turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya also underscored the importance of economic
restructuring, which has been a slow and tedious process in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   If done properly, restructuring Japan Inc. will make companies
more efficient, but it will also increase unemployment and bring
about even more pain in the economy. Some economists say that with
companies stepping up their reorganization plans, the economy could
fall even further this year, putting pressure on the government to
turn to steeper tax cuts, even higher public spending and finally
move to sharply expand the money supply.

FREED FROM IDEOLOGY, RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHERS EXPLORE LIMITLESS
POSSIBILITIES

   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Fedorovich Titov is not bitter. True, he was
chairman of the department of Marxist-Leninist philosophy at the
prestigious Moscow State University when the faculty voted in 1991,
as he put it, to ``liquidate completely'' his department.
</P>
<P>
   But as he explains: ``We decided the question pacifically.
Professors understood the political situation.'' He offers a gentle
smile, revealing a gold tooth. His large ears and thick,
rectangular glasses seem to have outgrown his cropped gray-haired
head. This 60-year-old Marxist is now teaching existentialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great mistake,'' he says of his department's
elimination. ``Marx was a great thinker. Without him you can't do
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrow faculty room with its mismatched chairs in neon-aqua
tints is cold, and Titov warms himself with a cup of English
breakfast tea. Gazing down from a photograph hanging above a tall
wooden bookcase is Karl Marx, his face partly obscured by a plant.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years Russian philosophy was Marxism-Leninism. It was
more than a dusty schoolroom requirement; it was the national
religion, the source of the state's political authority and
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Mironov, the chairman of Moscow University's philosophy
department, remembers a teacher once telling him, ``You get paid a
high stipend not because you know philosophy, but because you're
going to be an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   These days ideological work doesn't pay that well, and the
benefits aren't great either. But no one knows yet what will
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the old guard, professors like Titov, still have
their teaching jobs, and some of the textbooks have changed nothing
more than their titles. But Russian philosophy, freed from the
Marxist straitjacket, is clumsily stretching its arms, testing its
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking at every problem through the lens of
scientific socialism, philosophers can now reinvent themselves:
they can be analytical or mystical, try logic or phenomenology. The
ethics of political and economic success are suddenly acceptable
subjects for ethicists, as are abortion and organ transplants. In
epistemology, the study of knowledge, scholars can now examine a
subject once off-limits, like the religious roots of science.
</P>
<P>
   This freedom has pitched Russian philosophy both backward and
forward. In some cases Russians have looked inward, sifting through
their own past to rediscover the philosophical heritage that was
suppressed during most of the Soviet period.
</P>
<P>
   Some have turned to the religious philosophy of the Christian
Orthodox church, while others are re-examining the 19th-century
notion of the ``Russian idea,'' the nation's unique historical
mission. Still others have looked outside, to Europe's and
America's postmodernists.
</P>
<P>
   What philosophical school is most popular now? ``What day is
it?'' Mironov responded with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The ``all of the above'' option is, to some degree, precisely
the point of a post-communist world. Yet as these and other ideas
rush to fill the vacuum left by communism, the question is whether
Russians will be tempted by a substitute orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understood Marx very dogmatically,'' explained Ruben
Apresyan, who teaches at the Institute of Philosophy in Moscow,
historically a more autonomous institution than Moscow State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``they are replacing one set of axioms with another.'' In
this sense, how the born-again field of philosophy develops is a
bellwether of Russia's intellectual life in general, and of its
ties to the country's politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most predictable impulse after the fall of communism was
Russian scholars' desire to fill in the gaps of their history.
Although some of the writings of homegrown philosophers like
Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolai Berdyaev and Ivan Ilian began to be
available in the Khruschev era, they were often carefully
controlled. You could talk about them, says El'mar Sokolov (whose
parents chose E for Engels, L for Lenin, M for Marx), but you
couldn't write about them.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov's thin face, gray hair and weathered pin-stripe suit are
illuminated by St. Petersburg's iron-tinted afternoon light.
Outside is the snowy garden he ran through as a boy during the Nazi
siege of Leningrad; inside this professor's study are
black-and-white photos of his family, Czars Alexander II and
Nicholas II, and Berdyaev.
</P>
<P>
   Even though small public lectures on Berdyaev were allowed in
the mid-1980s, ``a friend had problems because he said Berdyaev was
more important that Lenin,'' Sokolov remembers. ``He was fired,
then sent to a bad university to teach. Then he emigrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Berdyaev, one of the best known Russian philosophers, turned his
back on Marxism in 1922 and was deported to Paris, where he wrote
about Russia's destiny as the new Jerusalem. The Russians, he said,
were a special spiritual, organic people with a mission to
transform society.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other intellectuals and writers he was deeply
influenced by Solovyov, the 19th-century philosopher whose complete
works are now being published for the first time. Solovyov, who
coined the term ``the Russian idea,'' had a mystical bent and saw
Christianity as the repository of supreme wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The return of ``the Russian idea'' worries those who fear that a
belief in Russia's exceptionalism could turn into a dangerous
messianism. When many Russians feel humiliated, the notion of a
divine mission offers psychological compensation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It also seems to set the stage for a replay of the tug of war
between nationalist, conservative Slavophiles and progressive,
secular Westernizers, a struggle that Dostoevsky savagely satirized
in his 1872 novel ``Demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this opposition between East and West has often been
exaggerated. The simple idea that Russia has a unique character, a
particular ``Russkii mentalitet,'' appeals not only to fierce
nationalists, but to religious leaders, poets, anti-communists (who
see Marx as a Western import), as well as young, liberal
Western-educated scholars who don't want to see Russia's form
squished into a one-size-fits-all American-style suit.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true at the moment, when Western-style
liberalism has taken such a battering here. Instead of rose-colored
glasses, many Russians now see the West through what Apresyan calls
``gray glasses.'' Intellectuals in Moscow and St. Petersburg
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disenchantment with Western liberal ideology,''
said Vladimir Lektorsky, editor of the leading philosophy journal,
Voprosy Filosofii (Problems of Philosophy). ``Liberalism was
reduced only to minimal government and private property, with
disastrous results.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory and practice liberalism itself had turned into a kind
of dogma. Corruption, poverty, a dwindling industrial base and
agricultural system, and governmental chaos hadn't exactly help
salvage the capitalist dream.
</P>
<P>
   One Western import that has captured the imagination of the
younger generation of scholars, however, is French postmodernism.
``Every second person considers himself a postmodernist,'' Mironov
said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways postmodernism seems the perfect philosophy for a
post-communist society. After years of listening to the ruling
party dish out the ``Truth,'' postmodernism's insistence on
competing notions of truth is a refreshing change.
</P>
<P>
   Its skepticism of authority extends to Western assumptions about
the straight path of progress and common attributes. Thus, those
who hold on to a sense of Russia's uniqueness are drawn to it as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kostikova, 34, teaches at Moscow State University and has a
ready giggle. She chose contemporary French postmodernism as her
speciality even before the Soviet Union was disbanded.
Postmodernism is not necessarily the most popular field, she said,
but it does characterize the country's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't not be a postmodernist in contemporary Russia,'' she
said, her dark brown hair haphazardly tied back. ``Our country is
very unstable both economically and politically, and no ideology
can be adequate to the situation. In this sense postmodernism is
being realized not as a popular philosophy but as the acceptance of
various philosophies and their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Svetalan Shakirova, 31, also considers herself a postmodernist.
She got interested in philosophy after reading ``Das Kapital'' in
the eighth grade, but she wrote her thesis on the idea of male and
female in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophy is the ``science of elderly men,'' she says through a
translator. Perhaps. Yet she and 10 colleagues also from Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan (formerly part of the Soviet empire), nonetheless
traveled 1,500 miles to St. Petersburg for a seminar on gender
theory.
</P>
<P>
   This unfamiliar intellectual stew has fed anxiety about the
future of Russian intellectual life. This generation of scholars is
a transitional one; what will the next one bring?
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual life has suffered from the loss of state support.
Gone are the comfortable salaries, subsidized journals, research
grants and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior professor now earns $100 to $200 a month; circulation
of the once subsidized Viprosy Filosofii has fallen to 7,000 from
85,000 in 1990. At St. Petersburg University the philosophy
faculty's phone service was cut off for several months in 1997
because no one paid the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet intellectuals have also suffered from the loss of an
authority to fight. In a repressive society, defiant writers and
thinkers carried moral authority; they were prophets who could
speak truth to power. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already a crisis of confidence in intellectuals,'' Ms.
Kostikova said. ``People don't trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikita Pokrovsky, a Jefferson scholar and sociologist who, like
most professors in Russia has had to stitch together three teaching
jobs to survive, is pessimistic. ``In about a decade or earlier,
the quality of teaching and research will decline dramatically,''
he said. Only 1 or 2 percent of his students end up pursuing a
career in academia. ``You can make 10 times as much as a secretary.
We're seeing the degradation of the intelligentsia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokrovsky repeats the litany of complaints: Students are
blockheads; juicy pulp fiction has replaced serious literature;
jobs are scarce and money more so; talk of the ruble has replaced
the ``kitchen discussions,'' philosophical nights at which shots of
vodka, cigarettes and rich conversation would be consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Students ``can buy abridged versions of Tolstoy and
Dostoevsky,'' said Mironov of Moscow State University, ``You have
speed-reading courses everywhere; but how can you read Heidigger
that way?''
</P>
<P>
   To others, such gloomy ruminations are more suited to Russian
literature than life.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta Stepaniants, 63, who heads the Oriental Philosophy
Department at the Institute of Philosophy, says intellectual life
is still vital and more expansive.
</P>
<P>
   Over tea in her uncommonly bright office, with its varnished
wooden floor and new computer, she said that when she published a
book on Sufism in 1987, it was the first on the subject; people
stood in line to buy a copy. Now there are several in print. If
Russians don't queue up for serious books today, she says, ``all it
means is we didn't publish enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because she saw how her own thinking evolved in
difficult times, she is more optimistic. As a teen-ager she cried
when Stalin died, almost getting trampled in the scramble to see
his coffin. A trip to India in 1959 and a stay in the United States
in 1961 with Quakers introduced her to unaccustomed ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a revolutionary or a dissident,'' she explained,
adding a description that could also be applied to the coming
generation of Russian intellectuals, ``but I developed.''  &QL;

BRADLEY TAKES ON GORE IN BUSH'S BACK YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley said Friday he is a
bolder leader than Vice President Al Gore, his almost certain rival
for the Democratic presidential nomination next year, and portrayed
himself as more in touch with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   During a fund-raising trip to Austin, the former New Jersey
senator also challenged a potential Republican candidate in the
2000 campaign, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to sign hate crimes
legislation in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley trails Gore in the polls, he said he was the
better candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real questions is who's best to lead the country
at this time in our history, given our circumstance and what our
future could be. And I think I'm the better person to do that,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who served in the Senate from 1978 to 1996, said he has
spent time traveling the nation and learning about people, while
Gore, the former congressman and senator, has spent much of his
time in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is the only announced candidate against Gore for the
Democratic nomination. He came to Bush's back yard to raise money,
adding about $100,000 to his presidential campaign fund at a
Thursday night event.
</P>
<P>
   Bush this week formed an exploratory committee as a prelude to
deciding on his own campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley attended a luncheon hosted by supporters of a bill aimed
at hate crimes _ those committed against people because of their
sexual orientation, race, gender or religious affiliation. He later
told reporters that Bush should support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think leaders have to step up, and no leader should be
silent on this,'' Bradley said. ``If I get the Democratic
nomination and the governor of Texas gets the Republican nomination
and he does not support passage of this bill, I will make this an
issue in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not said whether he would support a hate crimes bill,
saying he views all violent crime as acts of hate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide help to small counties prosecuting
murders, make Texas' hate crimes definition conform to one upheld
by the U.S. Supreme Court, and assign a prosecutor to coordinate
hate crimes in the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's been silent or not. I only know that if
it passes, he's (Bush) got to support it,'' Bradley said. ``He has
to support passage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates or those considering running in the Republican
primary include Elizabeth Dole, a former Cabinet secretary and head
of the American Red Cross; Arizona Sen. John McCain; former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander; conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan; publisher Steve Forbes; and conservative leader Gary
Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that if Bush does run and wins the GOP nomination,
Democrats should not write off Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Texas is no different than any other state in the
union when it comes to a presidential race. People are saying who
do I trust with my life, who do I trust with my job, and who has a
set of values that are similar to mine?''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A powerful and dangerous storm system churning slowly east from
Texas will bring an assorted arsenal of heavy weather to parts of
the Gulf states and lower Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow swath of moderate to heavy snow will fall across the
middle Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys as a conveyor of moist,
cold air on the northern flank of the low-pressure system wraps
westward around the low.
</P>
<P>
   More than a foot of snow is possible from eastern Oklahoma
across northeast Arkansas and into the lower Ohio Valley by
Saturday night. Accumulations may be limited on the southern edge
of the snowy swath where snow changes to sleet or rain.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, moderate to locally heavy rains, some with
thunder, will deluge the Tennessee Valley and areas just south of
the lower Ohio Valley. Farther south, a line of potent
thunderstorms, some with drenching rain and damaging winds, will
develop along and ahead of a cold front moving east from eastern
Texas. Behind the front, brisk winds from the northwest will whip
across west Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rain will return to the Pacific Northwest as a cold
front approaches from the Pacific. Farther east, sunny, mild
weather will embrace much of the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds associated with low pressure that has been stalled for
the past few days off the New England Coast will slowly recede
northward, with only a few residual snow showers and flurries in
the mountains of northern New England. Gusty winds from the
northwest will continue over parts of eastern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Makings of a Storm
</P>
<P>
   A burst of rain doused San Nicholas Island in Southern
California on Thursday as a compact but potent Pacific disturbance
arrived. Such an active disturbance in the southern branch of the
jet stream is a key ingredient for making a large storm in the East
because its southern path allows it to garner moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico. The next ingredient for a large storm in the East
is a timely merging with a disturbance from the northern branch of
the jet stream, which allows the high-altitude part of the system
to intensify, which, in turn, causes the surface storm to rapidly
deepen.

AS AN ENTERTAINMENT PLAY, LIBERTY IS A VARIETY SHOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you like to own a portfolio of some of the most
coveted entertainment assets, run by one of the sharpest investors
in the industry? It's not a mutual fund, though that may be a
useful way to think of it.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is the Liberty Media Group, the programming arm
of Tele-Communications Inc., the cable TV giant. Both Liberty and
Tele-Communications became part of AT&AMP;T last week, but Liberty
retains a separate market presence.
</P>
<P>
   Split off in July 1995 as a Tele-Communications ``tracking
stock'' _ meaning that investors are effectively buying shares in a
specified income stream, not ownership of a separate company _
Liberty will now trade on the New York Stock Exchange as a tracking
stock of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long been attracted to Liberty's rich portfolio,
which includes equity stakes in premiere private entertainment
properties that are otherwise inaccessible to ordinary investors.
They also like the deft management team that built the portfolio,
led by John C. Malone, the chairman of Tele-Communications Inc, who
will remain in charge of Liberty under AT&AMP;T's ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty has not disappointed. Since 1995, the stock's total
return has been almost three times that of the S&AMP;P 500. In the 12
months ended Friday, Liberty shares advanced 115 percent, compared
with a 21 percent gain for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Other programming plays like Viacom and Fox Entertainment have
been hot, too. But unlike them, Liberty is structured as an
investment portfolio, not an operating company. Because Liberty
trades as an ordinary stock, many investors may not see the
distinction, but that may change as the AT&AMP;T link raises Liberty's
profile, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty has substantial minority stakes in publicly traded
companies like Time Warner, USA Networks and United Video Satellite
Group, and in private holdings like Discovery Communications, BET
Holdings and QVC. It wholly owns the Encore and Starz movie
channels and has a host of smaller holdings ranging from a portion
of Telemundo, a Spanish-language network, to stakes in four
professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   For Liberty bulls like Mario J. Gabelli, chairman of the Gabelli
Funds, there is reason for excitement: The AT&AMP;T deal frees Malone
to focus all his attention on running Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally you'd pay a 20 percent fee for management talent of
that quality,'' said Gabelli, who has Liberty shares in all the
equity funds his company runs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Lawson, manager of the Weitz Hickory fund, has put 5
percent of its $600 million in assets into Liberty and expects 20
percent annual growth in the value of Liberty's portfolio for years
to come. ``Management has been tremendously successful developing
even modest businesses into valuable assets,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty has a history of securing large premiums when it
disposes of properties. And it soon will have $5.5 billion cash
from selling some recently acquired assets to AT&AMP;T, which it can
use to buy anew. ``Every media deal gets run by John Malone
first,'' said Larry Petrella, cable and entertainment analyst with
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Petrella said he expected Liberty stock, now at $56.875, to
exceed $62 within six months, a figure that he said understates
what Liberty's properties could fetch when sold. But the stock
could go even higher _ and trade at a premium to asset value _ if
Malone's full-time involvement gives it the kind of cachet that
Berkshire Hathaway gets from its investor-chairman, Warren Buffett.
Alan Snyder, president of Snyder Capital Management in San
Francisco, also sees Liberty hitting $62.
</P>
<P>
   But Liberty is more than just a play on the capital appreciation
of media assets, analysts say. ``Basic cable programming is the
sweet spot of the industry,'' Petrella said, because it earns fees
both from affiliates and from advertisers. ``People don't realize
that Discovery is more profitable than CBS, ABC and Fox combined,''
he observed.
</P>
<P>
   What if a market slide undercuts the value of the hot media
securities in Liberty's portfolio? Snyder said he thought Liberty
would buy more shares in a downturn, including its own.
``Management's mind-set has always been to repurchase their own
shares on price weakness.''

WOMANPILOT (Chino Valley, Ariz.) - Irene Leverton of Chino Valley
was one of a handful of women who in the 1960s almost became the
first female astronauts but NASA denied that opportunity to the
women who later became known as the ``Mercury 13.'' Flying has been

REST ASSURED, ARIZONA WOULD DIVE INTO A WATER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Every so often I wonder: Is the day creeping up on us,
living as we do in the hottest desert in North America, when we
will turn on our faucets and all that comes out are a few pitiful
drops?
</P>
<P>
   That question arose after reading a story in last Sunday's
paper, warning that a worldwide water shortage is fast approaching.
The story was pegged to steps being taken by Canada, which holds a
fifth of the world's supply of fresh water, to ban bulk sales to
America and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   A similar prediction was made in a recent book called ``Tapped
Out,'' by ex-Illinois Sen. Paul Simon. He says a ``water crisis of
catastrophic proportions will explode on us'' early in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   A few things to think about:
</P>
<P>
   - Nine thousand children die every day due to thirst or polluted
water.
</P>
<P>
   - Global demand for water is doubling every 21 years. By 2025,
nearly 3 billion people in 52 countries _ roughly a third of the
world's projected population _ are expected to suffer from chronic
water shortages, even without a serious drought.
</P>
<P>
   - A predicted water shortage in China, the world's most populous
nation, could have severe repercussions. Unable to grow enough
food, China would likely import massive amounts of grain, sending
up prices and starving poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   - The next century's wars will be over water, a 1998 World Bank
report predicted.
</P>
<P>
   - Expecting 15 million more people in the next 20 years,
California water officials last year predicted a ``serious water
shortage'' without much stronger conservation efforts and new
storage projects.
</P>
<P>
   The last two points bring to mind one of Arizona's oddest and
boldest moves.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five years ago, Gov. Benjamin B. Moeur dispatched the
Arizona National Guard to the Colorado River during the
construction of Parker Dam in an effort to stop California from
impinging on our state's water rights. It marked the last time in
American history that one state took up arms against another.
</P>
<P>
   Moeur, a man with a flair for the dramatic, sent a 100-man
militia unit and trucks with mounted machine guns to the
construction site, and work was halted. He contended that the dam
was illegal because it hadn't been authorized by Congress. The U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in Arizona's favor, but Congress soon passed a
bill approving the dam and enabling California to drink heavily
from the river.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive as his show of force may have been, Moeur was properly
mindful of the state's future. He could see that Southern
California would outgrow its annual entitlement of 4.4 million
acre-feet and thus might ``borrow'' what it needed from Arizona's
2.8 million allotment. That's just what happened; California has
taken up to 5.2 million acre-feet. Moeur feared that Arizona might
have trouble getting its full share when it was needed.
</P>
<P>
   That fear has not been extinguished. Along with its swelling
population, California has been gaining political clout that could
be used to increase its Colorado River entitlement. Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt recently heightened that concern when he
commented on the pressing needs of California and Nevada, implying
that Arizona might have to help out.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows when Arizona will need its full share, but 30 years
from now would be a fair guess, said Rita Pearson, director of the
state Department of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
   If Southern California can't meet its demands then, and can't
get more water short of towing icebergs from the Arctic, a
political power play to cut into this state's allotment doesn't
seem far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's drought, too much growth here, a covetous
California or all three, Arizona's water future is not guaranteed.
Fighting a water war may sound like a crackpot notion, but that's
probably what people said in 1934, too.
</P>
<P>
   How much provocation would it take for Arizona to send troops
again to the Colorado River to defend its supply?
</P>
<P>
   Pearson had to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given this state's tenacious attitude toward water,'' she
said, ``not much.''
</P>
<P>
   I can see our military convoy heading for Hoover Dam. Don't get
greedy, California. Your water thieves won't see tomorrow. &QL;

<P>
   A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across
an old lamp. He picked it up, rubbed it, and out popped a genie.
The genie wasn't in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you released me from the lamp, yadda, yadda, yadda. This

<P>
   The man thought about it a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to go to Hawaii,'' he said, ``But I'm
scared to fly, and I get very seasick. Could you build me a bridge
to Hawaii so I can drive over there?''
</P>
<P>
   The genie laughed. ``Are you nuts? Think of the logistics.
Imagine trying to get the pilings all the way to the bottom of the
Pacific. Think of all that concrete and steel. There's no way.
You'll have to come up with another wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The man thought a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I've been married and divorced four times. All my ex-wives
say I'm insensitive and I don't understand women. So my wish is
that I could understand women, know how they really feel inside and
what they're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The genie said, ``You want that bridge two-lane or four-lane?''

SCIENTISTS WORK TO SAVE U.S. CONSTITUTION, OTHER FAMOUS DOCUMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The original copy of the U.S. Constitution has
survived more than 200 years. On Wednesday government engineers and
scientists will unveil the model of a set of new protective cases
they hope will preserve it and other famous documents for at least
another 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1951 the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration
of Independence have been displayed at the National Archives in
sealed, bronze-framed cases. The three documents, called ``the
Charters,'' are among Washington's most popular tourist
attractions, bringing more than 1.2 million visitors a year through
building's rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, scientists discovered that the glass in the
documents' display cases was starting to deteriorate. The changes
weren't visible to the eye, but they were detected by a special,
NASA-built camera.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cooper, an Archives spokeswoman, said the documents
themselves currently aren't in any danger but that if the problem
is ignored, they could eventually deteriorate as well.
</P>
<P>
   When the four old cases were built, air was pumped out and they
were filled with helium and some water vapor to keep the parchment
documents from becoming brittle. A sheet of glass touches the
parchment, holding it in place, which experts now say could harm
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the six new cases that will be constructed of titanium and
aluminum, the documents will be held in place with clear polyester
clips rather than glass. The cases themselves will have panes of
two layers of glass separated by a layer of plastic, and they will
be filled with argon, an inert gas, and water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   The new cases, unlike the current ones, will allow for easy
removal of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said this will give the Archives more flexibility to make
changes in the cases if any problems develop or if there are
further advances in technology that would allow the documents to be
preserved in an even better way.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists and engineers who have designed the new
enclosures expect them to last much longer than the current cases,
perhaps indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   As the restoration proceeds, the Archives rotunda will be
refurbished to accommodate the two extra cases, which will display
the two middle pages of the Constitution. Currently, the cases show
only the first and last pages of the Constitution, which was
written in 1787, as well as the 1776 Declaration of Independence
and the Bill of Rights, which was ratified in 1791.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the Archives' public exhibits will be closed shortly
after July 4, 2001, and won't reopen until 2003. The building will
still be open to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Charters aren't the only American treasures under
renovation. The Washington Monument is currently wrapped in
scaffolding. The inside of the 555-foot monument, where tourists
can ride almost to the top to see panoramic views of the city,
reopened last month after being closed for five months.
</P>
<P>
   In December the Star-Spangled Banner was removed from its
display area in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
American History. But in mid-to-late April it will return, and the
public will be able to view the restoration of the 184-year-old
flag as it proceeds over the next three years in the museum.

   NATO (Independence, Mo.) _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic Friday became the first former members of the old Soviet
bloc to join NATO, expanding the Western military alliance to 19
members. At a ceremony in the hometown of the late U.S. President
Harry Truman, the foreign ministers of the three new members signed
formal documents of accession and gave them to U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who told the ministers: ``You are truly
allies, you are truly home.'' By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-ASSESS (Independence, Mo.) _ News Analysis: A feeling of
deliverance from an implacably cruel fate suffused the little
auditorium at the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Mo.,
where the ceremony took place. It took place here, of course,
because it was Truman, with his secretary of state, Dean Acheson,
who called NATO into existence to meet the Soviet threat after
World War II. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-ASSESS (Washington) _ As they seek their way after
impeachment, congressional Republicans these last few weeks have
gone on the offensive against President Clinton on national
security and foreign policy, while taking stands on Social Security
and education that will allow them to make some claim to those
domestic concerns. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-TALKS (Undated) _ A group of major oil producers announced
Friday that they had agreed to cut oil production by 2 million
barrels a day, a move that sent depressed crude oil prices upward.
Some analysts said that if the cuts are implemented as planned by
April 1 they could lead to a steady recovery of crude oil prices,
which would lead to an increase in the price of gasoline. But
others said that even if the supply cuts stick, the increase at the
pump would be modest at first _ about 5 cents a gallon. By Agis
Salpukas.
</P>
<P>
   FBI-INFORMER (Boston) _ It began in 1995 as a simple
racketeering indictment whose defendants included two reputed mob
leaders long infamous in Irish-dominated South Boston: James
(Whitey) Bulger and Stephen (The Rifleman) Flemmi. By now, however,
the case has become what many call one of the most embarrassing
messes for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in years. And it has
called into question one of the oldest practices in law enforcement
and one of the most troublesome: the use of confidential informers
to fight organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   TRADES-SHORTAGE (Chicago) _ Faced with a shortage of
tradesworkers to meet the voracious demand for new construction in
the United States, desperate builders and eager unions have kicked
off aggressive campaigns to court new workers, attracting women and
members of racial minorities to the traditional bastion of white
men, a world where a coveted union card was handed from father to
son. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RUMORS (Washington) _ In the suspicion-rich aftermath of
Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, impeachment, and the rest of it, a
strange and ghoulish vigil has undeniably taken hold here. It's a
marital death watch, perhaps arising less from any smoke signals
that the Clintons are sending out than from Washington insiders'
presumptions about what they would do were they in Mrs. Clinton's
pumps. By Frank Bruni.

 &HT;    Catching up with my old friend Rufus
 &HT;    EMBARGOED for Sunday, March 14
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My friend Rufus and I ate cheeseburgers and
home fries and washed them down with lots of iced tea at Big T in
Kilgore the other day. We caught up on each other's lives while
inhaling the grease-and-cigarette ambience of one of our favorite
eateries, a venerable place favored by oilfield workers and those
with discerning palates in search of a cholesterol-laden meal.
</P>
<P>
   The place is always full at lunch. I haven't eaten here in
probably eight or nine years, but the waitress looked familiar. A
collection of hard hats with stickers on them adorned the wall near
us. Total tab for both of us, including tip: $8.71. It's that kind
of place.
</P>
<P>
   O Rufus Lovett, no period after the ``O'' because it doesn't
stand for anything (at least that's his story) teaches photography
at Kilgore College. He's been there more than two decades. Now he's
gaining a reputation as one of the state's finest documentary
photographers. Truth be known, he's the main reason I quit taking
pictures for a living and got into editing newspapers. It didn't
take long to figure out I was nowhere in his league when it comes
to technical skill, creativity and, more importantly, an innate
ability to establish a rapport with anybody, from a resident of
Houston's Fourth Ward to a poor butcher in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Rufus when I took a job as college photographer,
yearbook adviser and part-time teacher at KC in a misguided attempt
to wean myself from the addiction of putting out newspapers. I
lasted a year before fleeing academia for the raw comfort of
running a country newspaper out in West Texas, until I got a
reprieve and returned to the Pine Curtain. At the time, Rufus drove
a 1965 (I think) Cadillac, and he sported an earring and an
attitude. The earring and Cadillac are gone, but the attitude is
still there.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that in a bad way. Rufus just has a way about him.
He can talk to governors and poor folks living out in the middle of
nowhere and put both at ease. It's a talent that has stood him well
as he travels Texas and Asia, photographing in large format,
black-and-white prints, sending forth his version of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Once I invited him to the annual gala event at Stephen F.
Austin. He immediately buttonholed Bo Pilgrim and pretended like
they were long-lost friends, though the closest Rufus had ever been
to Bo was seeing his likeness on those 18-wheelers hauling frozen
chicken down the road. It was entertaining to watch, if a bit edgy
since he was there on my nickel. To be fair, he has a story or two
to tell on me, but you'll have to ask him.
</P>
<P>
   You've likely seen some of his photographs if you read Texas
Monthly. He shoots for them regularly, including a multipage piece
in December on Weeping Mary, a small black community just west of
Alto, behind the Indian Mounds. Rufus has been traveling out there
for about five years, documenting an insular place that now treats
him like a prodigal son. I made a few trips out there with him,
including a memorable family reunion in the middle of summer where
we feasted on barbecued hog and all the trimmings, the only white
folks in sight.
</P>
<P>
   He's spent years documenting the Rangerettes, spring break at
South Padre Island, yard art, and the land of his wife's family _
Hong Kong and mainland China. His work hangs in museums across the
state. It hangs throughout my house, too, nine photographs from
China, Weeping Mary and Kilgore. I get a discount rate.
</P>
<P>
   But as I dropped in on him last week, what struck me most is
that he is still first a teacher who still loves his work. He
carefully looked at test prints made by students, brought out from
the darkroom in trays, still dripping wet. He told them how to make
the prints better. Student work hangs about his office, and he
points out pieces he particularly likes. I've hired a gaggle of
students from Kilgore College over the years, some of whom still
work for me.
</P>
<P>
   I've about given up taking photos, but it's still my first love,
a close first over writing. Rufus has made a life for himself doing
what he's best at, and that's a precious gift, for which I envy him
at times.
</P>
<P>
   (An exhibit of O Rufus Lovett's photographs is on display
through early April at the Longview Museum of Fine Arts. Call
903-753-8103 for more information.)

   LUFKIN, Texas _ You think your job's tough? Here is a checklist
sent to me that is a good indication ``You know you work in
corporate America in the '90s if ...''
</P>
<P>
   You sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three
different companies.
</P>
<P>
   Your company's sign is attached with Velcro.

<P>
   Your resume is on a diskette in your pocket.

   You order your business cards in ``half orders'' instead of
whole boxes.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asks about what you do for a living, you lie.
</P>
<P>
   You get really excited about a 2 percent pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   You learn about your layoff on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Your biggest loss from a system crash is that you lose your best
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   You sit in a cubicle smaller than your bedroom closet.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation is something you rollover to next year, or you try to
use up three weeks between Christmas and New Year's because
otherwise you lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries of the members on the Executive Board are higher than
all the Third World countries' annual budgets combined.
</P>
<P>
   You think lunch is just a meeting to which you drive.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark when you drive to and from work.

<P>
   Fun is when issues are assigned to someone else.
</P>

   Food left over from meetings is your main staple.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends are those days your significant other makes you stay
home.

<P>
   Being sick is defined as can't walk or you're in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Art involves a white board.
</P>
<P>
   You're already late on the assignment you just got.
</P>
<P>
   When 100 percent of your time means 20 hours, with 40 more hours
on the other 100 percent of your time.
</P>
<P>
   You work 200 hours for the $100 bonus check and jubilantly say
``Oh wow, thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert cartoons hang outside every cube and are read only by
your co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss' favorite lines are, ``When you get a few minutes'' or
``When you're freed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Your boss' second favorite lines are, `` ... this isn't exactly
what we need. It may be what we asked for, but things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Your relatives and family describe your job as ``works with
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is the norm.

<P>
   The only reason you recognize your kids and friends is because
their pictures are hanging in your cube.

   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
embraced three of its former rivals, the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland on Friday, formally ending the Soviet domination of
those nations that began after World War II and opening a new path
for the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony tinged with the personal and the emotional at the
Truman Presidential Library here, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright watched the foreign ministers of the three countries sign
the documents of accession to the alliance, signed them herself and
then held them aloft like a victory trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who was born in Prague and fled just after the
Communist takeover in 1948, made no secret of her joy at her
homeland and its neighbors joining the alliance after a six year
trans-Atlantic diplomatic process led by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quote an old Central European expression, `Hallelujah,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the moment was marked
by small-scale public celebrations. In Warsaw, Poland, after dark,
as fireworks lit the sky, the Polish flag and the flag of NATO were
raised side by side near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Pilsudski Square
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, NATO members' flags were raised outside the Defense
Ministry. And in Prague, Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel
said in a statement, ``Never have we been part of such a broad,
solid and binding security alliance which at the same time respects
in its essence the sovereignty and will of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The enlargement of NATO from 16 members to 19 has been one of
the administration's foremost foreign policy goals, one that grew
out of a desire, its proponents said, to cement the democratic
gains made in the former Warsaw Pact countries after the collapse
of communism 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy also faced critics, who argued that welcoming
these three new countries would draw a new line across Europe and
antagonize the Russians. As of Friday, the border between Western
Europe and the former Soviet Union moved to the eastern border of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, in the small auditorium where dignitaries from
the three countries sat and the three foreign ministers flanked her
on the stage, Albright countered that NATO would now do ``for
Europe's East what NATO has already helped to do for Europe's West.
Steadily and systematically, we will continue erasing _ without
replacing _ the line drawn in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also used her speech to articulate a forward-looking
vision for NATO, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary in
Washington next month, and to defend NATO's potential involvement
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Cold War, she said, NATO must be ready
to face ``an aggressive regime, a rampaging faction, or a terrorist
group. And we know that if, past is prologue, we face a future in
which weapons will be more destructive at longer distances than
ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO summit, she said, would produce an initiative that
``responds to the grave threat posed by weapons of mass destruction
and their means of delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, where the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, is
resisting the deployment of NATO-led troops, including 4,000 U.S.
soldiers, Albright insisted that NATO was the best tool to enforce
a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be clear in explaining that a settlement without
NATO-led enforcement is not acceptable because only NATO has the
credibility and capability to make it work,'' she said. ``And we
must be resolute in spelling out the consequences of
intransigence,'' she added, referring to the threat of NATO air
strikes against Milosevic if he does not agree to the deployment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the day belonged to the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland, who in order to meet NATO's standards have had
to cut the size of their Soviet-style militaries, organize civilian
control of their armies and agree to buy NATO compatible equipment
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   It was the spiritual homecoming to the West that all three
foreign ministers stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poland forever returns where she has always belonged _ the
free world,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister of
Poland, who was a dissident during the Communist era.
</P>
<P>
   Geremek said he had brought some appropriate mementoes from
Poland to the Truman library, including a campaign poster from 1989
when the anti-communist Solidarity forces won against the
Communists. The poster showed a picture of Gary Cooper from the
film ``High Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us to win,'' Geremek said. ``For the people of
Poland, high noon comes today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, who lived in London from
1968, when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia, until 1989, said he
had remained buoyant during his opposition work as an emigre by
believing that communism would eventually fall. But he never
dreamed, he said, that his country would become a member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accession to NATO is a guarantee that we will never again
become powerless victims of any foreign aggression,'' Kavan said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Hungarian foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, who
remembers the 1956 uprising as a 13-year-old, said that membership
of NATO meant that Hungary was returning ``to her natural
habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been our manifest destiny to rejoin those with whom we
share the same values, interests and goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martonyi also emphasized that Hungary understood NATO
membership carried with it obligations as well as privileges. ``We
shall prove that new members can indeed add to the weight of the
alliance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The location for Friday's ceremony was chosen by Albright, who
as secretary of state is the depository of NATO's accession
accords.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary made the fairly unorthodox decision to choose a
site outside Washington because she wanted the ceremony to resonate
with the memories of President Truman, under whom NATO was founded.
On April 4, 1949, on behalf of the United States, Truman's
secretary of state, Dean Acheson, signed the Washington Treaty,
which created NATO. Acheson is Albright's favorite predecessor, her
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in reaction to the threat of the Soviet Union under
Stalin, NATO calls for the collective defense of its members and
was brought into being with an original 12 members.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has expanded three times before, adding Greece and
Turkey in 1952, West Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982. But never
before has NATO reached out to its former Eastern-bloc enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration embarked on the expansion of NATO in
1993 after Clinton met in Washington with President Havel and Lech
Walesa, who was then the president of Poland.
</P>
<P>
   These conversations are remembered by Clinton's foreign policy
team because they took place after the opening of the Holocaust
Museum and because they involved two very different Central
European leaders who brought the same message.
</P>
<P>
   Their message was that NATO should be used as the mechanism to
secure the democratic progress of their countries and at the same
dissuade Russia from any more imperial designs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Poland, Dan Fried, who was then on the
National Security Council, said Friday that he remembered being
asked to help ``turn this pious wish into a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, at a summit in Madrid, Spain, the alliance
announced it would accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Romania and Slovenia, which had tried hard to meet the standards,
were turned away, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was how to deal with the Russians, who vacillated
between outright hostility and accepting what looked like the
inevitable. In early 1997, President Boris Yeltsin told President
Clinton he could live with NATO expansion. But in order to
accommodate the Russians, NATO created the NATO-Russia Council as a
consultative body that formalized relations between Moscow and the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has been sensitive to the reactions of Russia to its
membership of NATO, and Geremek has gone out of his way to reassure
the Russians. ``We want our membership of NATO to serve as a
`catalyst' for Polish Russian co-operation,'' he said last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, on the secretary of state's plane carrying Albright and
the three foreign ministers to the ceremony Friday, the ministers
were asked whether they could ever foresee Russia as a member of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long pause among the three ministers. Then Martonyi
replied: ``Silence is your answer.''

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO SAVING NISSAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government sent the clearest signal to
date &UR;  &LR; Thursday that it would not allow the struggling Nissan Motor
Co., Japan's second-largest automaker, to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the responsibility of Japan's industries, financial
institutions and the government to assist a leading industry,''
Kaoru Yosano, the international trade and industry minister, told a
news conference after a Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government would provide adequate assistance to
Nissan and that he had not heard that the company was having
difficulty raising funds. Technically, it hasn't _ largely because
the Bank of Japan, the central bank here, has guaranteed its
commercial paper, or short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's outstanding commercial paper jumped fourfold from 1997
to 1998, securities analysts who follow the company have said.
</P>
<P>
   Another government entity, the Japan Development Bank, has
extended a $700 million loan to the company. Nissan also has a $4.6
billion line of credit from a group of banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Nissan has had to tap the government coffers
is a good indication that its traditional sources of financing, led
by the Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, have told it they
cannot provide more money. Ever since DaimlerChrysler AG announced
on Wednesday that it had decided not to pursue an interest in
Nissan, the Japanese press has predicted that Nissan will make a
deal with Renault SA, the French car company, by next week. Keiichi
Tsuboi, a Nissan spokesman, confirmed that the two companies were
in discussions, but he had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese press suggested that the company was pressing to
conclude a deal by March 31, the end of its fiscal year, although
there was no obvious reason for that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Nissan's stock price at the close of trading Friday,
the sale of a 33.4 percent stake in the company, the level that
would be required for a buyer to have a seat on the board and veto
power, would bring in somewhat more than 500 billion yen, or $4.14
billion at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, such a large piece would be difficult for
Renault, which has net cash of about $2 billion, according to
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Analysts have said that given the
limitations of Renault's own balance sheet, it is probably aiming
to buy a stake of somewhere between 20 percent and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's board is likely to be more comfortable with Renault,
analysts said. ``I'd expect Renault to be a more passive partner
than DaimlerChrysler would have been,'' said Steve Usher, an
automotive analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
</P>
<P>
   One former executive said that the board had been divided on the
issue of how much control to cede to a partner, an issue that has
emerged as perhaps the biggest obstacle in merger and acquisition
activity in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executive, several directors objected to a deal
with DaimlerChrysler because they felt they would have to resign if
Nissan surrendered a 33.4 percent stake, the minimum the German
automaker was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the board members rose through Nissan's management
hierarchy, along with the president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, and are
sensitive to the issues of saving face and protecting jobs, the
former executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company continues to chip away at its problems.
Usher, one of the few analysts who has been sanguine about Nissan's
prospects, expects Nissan to have reduced its debts by about 400
billion yen at the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   If the company used the proceeds of the sale of a stake to pay
down debt, the cash from the sale combined with the reductions
already made would bring Nissan within striking range of its goal
of reducing its debt by 1 trillion yen by the fiscal year 2000,
which starts April 1.

&HT;        STEEL UNION PRESIDENT URGES CLINTON NOT TO VETO QUOTA BILL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By C.J. Karamargin  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 12 - The leader of the nation's largest union
of steel workers urged President Clinton Friday to ignore one of
his senior advisors and embrace legislation that would impose tough
limits on the amount of foreign steel allowed into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
asked Clinton to ``override'' White House Chief of Staff John
Podesta and ``stand up for steel.'' Becker asked the President not
to veto a bill introduced this week by Rep. Pete Visclosky,
(D-In.), and Rep. Ralph Regula, (R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, in a March 10 letter to the House Ways and Means
Committee, criticized the bill as not being in the economic
interests of the nation and said he would advise Clinton to veto
it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee on Wednesday sent the bill to the full House for
consideration but urged members of Congress to reject it. A floor
debate is likely next week.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, in his own letter, told Clinton that contrary to
Podesta's assertion that progress has been made in curbing steel
imports, steel-producing countries ``show no intention of playing
by the rules'' and, as a result, the American steel industry is
reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 10,000 steelworkers have already been laid off and tens
of thousands more on the edge,'' Becker wrote. ``Steelworkers in
Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Alabama and in every state
where there are steel facilities have felt the effect of these
imports either through layoffs or reduced hours of work...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' Becker continued, ``how much more must we
bleed?''
</P>
<P>
   The Visclosky-Regula bill would require that the volume of steel
imported into the United States during any month does not exceed
the average of volume of steel products imported during the
36-month period preceding July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It would also require a monitoring system to be established and
for steel importers to obtain a special certificate before their
products could enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, a 15-term Republican from Texas who is
chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, said he shares
the concerns of the Clinton Administration about the bill's
potential ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dangers of drifting toward protectionist policies are very
real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Visclosky's office, the bill now has 204
co-sponsors, inlcuding 160 Democrats and 44 Republicans.

KANSAS HOUSE APPROVES NEW FINANCE TERMS FOR OZ PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Kansas House gave final approval Thursday to a
bill expanding the public bond financing for the Wonderful World of
Oz theme park and resort, a proposed project in western Johnson
County.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 105-17 with only one Johnson County member _ Rep.
Bob Tomlinson, a Roeland Park Republican _ voting no.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, House Bill 2166, moves to the Senate for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passing of this legislation, combined with the Salomon
Smith Barney highly confident opinion with respect to the park's
feasibility and financing, gives us every reason to believe this
Disney-quality theme park and resort will be built,'' Skip Palmer,
president of the Oz Entertainment Co., said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give Oz developers a 1 percent sales tax increase
on the 9,065-acre Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant land, bringing
the total sales tax authority to 8.375 percent. The money would be
used to pay off $250 million in bonds, or about 40 percent of the
entire project cost.
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax would apply only to purchases made inside the
theme park or anywhere within the development area, which would
include most but not all of the 12-square-mile site.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would extend the life of those bonds from 20 to
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds must be authorized by the Kansas Development Finance
Authority, a state agency, before they can be issued. The Johnson
County Commission has endorsed the Oz bill.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment added Thursday would require Oz to submit a
detailed development plan. If that was substantially altered,
project officials would have to renew their request for bonding
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Other amendments require Oz to buy insurance guaranteeing the
cleanup of pollution on the plant site and assuring the flow of
property tax dollars to the De Soto School District if Oz officials
receive a property tax abatement.
</P>
<P>
   Oz officials want to built a $771 million theme park and resort
on 3,500 acres. In exchange for ownership of most of the 9,065
acres, Oz officials have pledged part of the $250 million in bond
revenue to clean up the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson said he still was uneasy about the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt the figures added up reasonably,'' he said.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Marketplace musings for a March Madness
weekend:
</P>
<P>
   - Given the opportunity, my first official act as a television
station boss would be to fire any weather person acting gleeful at
the prospect of snow, sleet or freezing rain.
</P>
<P>
   - Studies tagging Kansas and Missouri as states with inordinate
numbers of psychopathic, sociopathic and just plain stupid drivers
only confirm what any driver arriving here from someplace else
learns very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   - Do Kansans ever notice that at the first sign of fiscal
uncertainty in Topeka, it's the taxpayers rather than state
government who are always the first choice to make any necessary
sacrifices?
</P>
<P>
   - Is it my imagination, or is e-mail spam easy to spot because
the intro almost always uses all capital letters?
</P>
<P>
   - You're getting old if you can remember when the Sports
Illustrated swimsuit offering was only a section of the regular
magazine featuring a modest collection of rather tastefully done
cheesecake photos.
</P>
<P>
   - In case you hadn't noticed, the Olympics had been giving
purity and nobility a bad name long before the recently revealed
corruption came to light.
</P>
<P>
   - Does anyone find it remarkable that Washington is the only
place in America where sleaze mogul Larry Flynt is treated with
respect and deference?
</P>
<P>
   - It's amazing that so many people who'd never dream of being
rude enough not to sign a regular letter will send e-mails without
the courtesy of identifying themselves by signing it at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   - Those who find themselves being inexorably drawn to World War
II literature and films might want to consider making a serious
acquaintanceship with the works of Ernie Pyle.
</P>
<P>
   - Intel proved itself a lot smarter than Microsoft when it opted
to settle peacefully with the trust-busters, but its capitulation
can only encourage more depredations by politically motivated
antitrusters.
</P>
<P>
   - Wake me when the NBA season is over.
</P>
<P>
   - Perhaps it's time to switch the defining labels, what with
conservatives pushing for radical change in areas such as education
and Social Security while liberals battle tenaciously to preserve
the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   - Whatever happened to F. Ross Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   - It's not an encouraging sign for the movie theater industry
when major players perceive the marketing need to combine film fare
with food fare.

<P>
   - Is the 45-point spread in the Duke-Florida A&AMP;M game the widest
in NCAA basketball history?
</P>
<P>
   - The U.S.-European dispute over banana trade qualifies as one
of the most benighted geopolitical feuds in the history of global
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   - Nothing against the two candidates in the race, but imagining
city auditor Mark Funkhouser as mayor of Kansas City is certainly
an interesting thing to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   - Why haven't liberals been more eager to prod the Kansas Senate
to go along with efforts to eliminate the state sales tax on
grocery purchases?
</P>
<P>
   - If you're a fan of the movie, ``The Quiet Man,'' watch for it
soon at your local TV tube.
</P>
<P>
   - If you like Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander, you would have
loved Harold Stassen.
</P>
<P>
   - When oil prices rise in response to OPEC threats to curb oil
production, it's a triumph of hope over experience.

UTILICORP UNIT TO MOVE HIGH-PAYING JOBS TO DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY, MARK P. COUCH and LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ UtiliCorp United Inc. plans to make downtown
Kansas City the home of a major subsidiary, bringing 415
extraordinarily high-paying jobs and instantly making the area a
national hub for energy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila Energy, the subsidiary, has 285 employees in its Omaha,
Neb., headquarters and 130 in Raytown, Mo. This summer those
workers will begin moving into three floors of Town Pavilion. When
the transfer is completed by 2001, the company expects to have 560
employees downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank (UtiliCorp) for their commitment to the urban
core,'' said an elated Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, who has
made economic development the cornerstone of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City and the state of Missouri offered about $16 million
worth of economic incentives to attract Aquila. Boosters said it
was a wise investment that would provide an economic shot in the
arm for downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the number of jobs, the average salary of Aquila
employees is expected to be nearly $170,000, more than eight times
the city's per capita income in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The total payroll is expected to reach $95 million.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown retailers and restaurants have struggled despite some
rejuvenation in the area. Aquila's well-paid work force is seen as
cornerstone in bringing back the area.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Treasurer Bob Holden said it was relatively unusual for
a company with such a high payroll to relocate to the downtown
section of an American city. Much of downtown Kansas City's recent
job growth has been lower-paying back-office and clerical workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Green, UtiliCorp's president and chief operating officer,
said the decision to bring Aquila to Kansas City was based on
business considerations, principally the need to consolidate
Aquila's growing operations in one place.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of bringing Aquila to Kansas City, just a few
blocks from UtiliCorp's headquarters, also was noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill for us today to announce this move,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   For downtown and the Kansas City area, the economic boost looks
promising, especially with an average salary of $170,000. Officials
emphasized that some employees would make much less and others much
more than that figure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kansas City's per capita income was $19,776. The area's
per capita income was $26,676 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Manager Bob Collins was delighted with the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal,'' he said. ``This is exactly the kind of
company you want in downtown. It brings in a national headquarters
and good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate agents already are salivating at the
high-salary workers that Aquila is bringing to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are my kind of people,'' said Carole Colson, Realty
Executives Professional Group. ``They are not your first-time
homebuyers. We can put them in $300,000 or $400,000 homes today,
unless they have too much debt on their BMWs.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Omaha got the bad news while Cleaver and others
were savoring the deal. Aquila was founded in Omaha 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to lose a good company like that,'' said Vicki
Krecek, spokeswoman for the Omaha Chamber of Commerce. ``On the
other hand, we have a hugely, massively strong economy with
companies begging for highly qualified workers like those at
Aquila.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Omaha Mayor Hal Daub said the city was sorry to
see Aquila go, but he noted that Omaha still was home to about
1,000 other UtiliCorp employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that there are obvious efficiencies being near
the corporate parent,'' spokeswoman Joy Schulz said. ``It was a
decision solely made by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Aquila is a trader of energy _ mainly gas and electricity. It
handles so much of the commodity that its dealings in one day would
heat and power San Francisco for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila, the second-largest energy trader in the United States,
has aggressive plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our hope we will make (Kansas City) an international hub
for the marketing of energy,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp had been thinking about a move for Aquila for about
two years. But the deal heated up over the last 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were conducted in considerable secrecy. The
proposed move had the code name Eagle's Nest.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Zimmer, president of Zimmer Cos., said Aquila would rent
about 70,000 square feet on the 31st, 33rd and 34th floors of Town
Pavilion. The company also has an option on the 32nd floor, now
occupied by the Shook Hardy &AMP; Bacon law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila signed a 10-year lease on the space, which had been
vacant about three years. The company also has an option to renew
when its lease expires. The deal is expected to bring occupancy of
the largest downtown office building to about 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer represented Aquila in negotiations with the building's
leasing agent, Copaken, White &AMP; Blitt.
</P>
<P>
   Aquila will receive about $16 million in state and local
subsidies to upgrade its office space, including improvements in
communications and computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   About half the incentive package comes from a partial rebate of
earnings and other city taxes that will be generated by the
operation over 20 years. The other half comes from an assortment of
state bonds and tax credits, said Mark Bunnell, president of
Economic Development Corp. of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Council on Thursday passed a resolution
approving the deal to move Aquila.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Aggie Stackhaus was the lone dissenter. She said
she thought the proposal should have gone to a committee for
further review and discussion, rather than to the council floor for
a quick vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the rush?'' Stackhaus asked.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Ken Bacchus said the announcement showed how Kansas
City's aggressive economic development policy and incentives to
businesses were more favorable than those in some neighboring
states.
</P>
<P>
   City and economic agency officials ``go out and catch the
biggest fish that are in the ocean and the most positive fish,'' he
said.

GIANTS' DIRT STRIKES OUT WITH LANDFILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shouts of ``Get the lead out!'' at San Francisco
Giants baseball games are usually directed at a catcher with bad
knees or some other player chugging around the bases at Candlestick
Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, it was directed at team officials in charge of
building the Giants' new ballpark in China Basin.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of Waste Management Inc. told the Giants its
lead-contaminated dirt from the Pacific Bell Park construction site
was unwelcome in its Altamont landfill and must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Toxic Substances Control had signed off
on shipping the dirt to the Altamont landfill Feb. 26, but based
its approval on the wrong environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 6,000 cubic yards of dirt shipped to the
landfill and the 12,000 cubic yards that remain at the ballpark
site have been found under tough state disposal guidelines to
contain lead at levels that could contaminate groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Toxic Substances Control confirmed ... that
the material is hazardous,'' said Douglas Sobey, senior vice
president for the western area of Waste Management. ``We don't
believe that it should be in the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to remove it as soon as possible, and send it to
Kettleman,'' a hazardous-waste landfill operated by Waste
Management in Kettleman City, Calif., Sobey said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobey wouldn't say if the company intends to bill the Giants for
costs that would run in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for
hauling the dirt to Kettleman City.
</P>
<P>
   At a San Francisco Board of Supervisors' Public Health and
Environment Committee hearing Thursday, Robert Stephens, deputy
director of the toxics department's science, pollution prevention
and technology program, said his staff examined further test
results submitted by the Giants this week.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, he said, confirmed that the lead levels of the soil
aren't low enough to be classified as nonhazardous for the purpose
of burial in a landfill such as Altamont.
</P>
<P>
   In order for the Giants to dump it at Altamont, permission would
have to be received from county and state solid waste and regional
water-quality control boards, Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bair, Giants vice president and general counsel, told the
committee members that the Giants are awaiting direction from the
state and landfill operator on how to handle the dirt dug up from
the Pac Bell site. He assured the members that it would not affect
the opening of the new ballpark in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion over the notorious dirt pile stems from a series of
letters that the Giants organization received from the state, Bair
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Toxic Substances Control on Feb. 26
approved the Giants' request to reclassify its waste as
nonhazardous.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Giants were told that they would have to comply
with a new law requiring permission from state and local agencies
to dispose of the newly reclassified dirt because it contains lead
above 350 parts per million. That level is the legal threshold
which determines whether it is too contaminated to put in a
regular, municipal landfill.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the information, the Giants didn't seek
permission themselves, Bair said Wednesday, but supplied the letter
and test samples to the Altamont landfill. The Altamont landfill
agreed to accept the waste, Bair said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, the state Toxics Department sent the Giants a second
letter, this time revoking the reclassification as nonhazardous and
citing the test result that showed that the dirt could pose a
threat to groundwater if buried in a landfill unequipped to accept
it.
</P>
<P>
   That letter immediately triggered a halt in the parade of about
350 trucks that had hauled uncovered dirt to the Altamont Landfill
between March 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County officials at Thursday's hearing were furious with
the Giants and their lead-contaminated dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common word in Alameda County is `outrage,''' said
Chris Gray, an aide to Alameda County Supervisor Scott Haggerty.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that upsets Alameda is, once the Giants saw
the lead was over 350 parts per million, instead of taking it to a
(hazardous waste) landfill, which is the safest thing, they took it
to a closer, cheaper landfill,'' Gray said.

LAWSUIT

<P>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ Shawnee on Thursday announced that it had
reached a settlement with three male police detectives who had sued
the city, accusing a male supervisor of sexually harassing them.
</P>
<P>
   By settling the lawsuit, the city avoided a series of three
trials scheduled over the next month in U.S. District Court in
Kansas City, Kan. The first was to start next week.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives, and their lawyer, will split a $250,000 payment
from the city's liability insurer. The insurance company also will
pay the city's legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives' lawyer, Harold Youngentob of Topeka, Kan., said
the trials would have attracted national attention because they
would have been among the first since the U.S. Supreme Court last
year ruled that on-the-job torment can be illegal sexual harassment
even when the offender and victim are the same sex.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, filed in January 1998, the detectives alleged
that Lt. Walter McDaniel subjected them to unwelcome homosexual
advances, unwanted touching and requests for sexual favors while he
was their supervisor in the investigations unit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives also contended that Police Chief Tom Hayselden
did not handle the complaint fairly after he was told about
McDaniel's conduct. They contended that the city did not have an
adequate anti-harassment policy.
</P>
<P>
   The city maintained that there was no basis for the lawsuit.
Sexual-harassment policies were in place and no inappropriate
conduct continued once officials were notified, city attorney
Marvin Rainey said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides said they were relieved that the case would
not go to trial. More than 15 city employees had received subpoenas
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will take a lot of stress off people in the
department,'' said plaintiff Delbert Nicholas, who retired last
year as a sergeant. ``It put a lot of people in a very
uncomfortable position because they couldn't show their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas said it was difficult for him and the other plaintiffs,
Detectives Tom Carney and John Wells, to come forward with their
allegations because no one had heard about a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me. I didn't even tell my wife,'' Nicholas said.
``I felt angry, embarrassed and humiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Charles Clark investigated complaints about
McDaniel in 1996. In a deposition, McDaniel said he would unzip his
pants, grab his crotch and show a lewd photograph of a boy as a way
to break the ice with co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clark concluded that the acts were sexual harassment, and gave
the report to Hayselden, who said in a deposition that he
considered the acts horseplay. Hayselden did transfer McDaniel from
investigations supervisor to training supervisor, but he was not
suspended, as the captain recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement announced Thursday did not address the future
employment or supervisory roles of anyone involved in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made any changes and we will certainly look at our
organization,'' City Manager Gary Montague said Thursday. ``But we
are not ready to make any statements about our personnel at this
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Shawnee hired the law firm Shook, Hardy and
Bacon to provide sexual-harassment training seminars to all city
employees, at a cost of $3,250. City officials also reviewed and
made minor changes in the city's sexual-harassment policy because
of the lawsuit, Montague said. One change allows employees to file
a complaint to officials other than their direct supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they now understand this type of conduct is not
appropriate and that it is not a joke,'' said Youngentob, the
detectives' attorney. ``And hopefully, my clients won't suffer any
retaliation for coming forward _ it took them a lot of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney said he and Wells still feared retaliation and didn't
know whether the settlement would improve the atmosphere at the
police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a safe haven in the workplace, but when you go
deal with criminals, you're on alert status and it raises the
adrenaline level,'' Carney said. ``You come back to the station to
recharge, but I haven't been able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells' wife, Terri Wells, said it's been the same for her
husband, whom she married after he complained about McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day he's come home from work, he has talked about it,''
she said. ``Even on a Cancun honeymoon, it didn't leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayselden, the police chief, said he felt ``relieved it's over
with and that we don't have to go to trial.''

DOG SNIFFS OUT MARIJUANA HIDDEN IN TRUCK FILLED WITH PEPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Turns out red chili peppers weren't the
hottest item inside the big rig authorities stopped in southern
Missouri earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   That honor would go to the 3 tons of marijuana hidden among
boxes of red peppers. Even the peppers' pungent smell couldn't fool
the drug-sniffing dog brought in by police.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Missouri Highway Patrol announced what might be
the largest seizure of marijuana in the state's history, more than
6,500 pounds taken from a tractor-trailer near Springfield. The
marijuana has a street value of about $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Highway Patrol Lt. Chris Ricks said officials at a
state weigh station along Interstate 44 in Strafford became
suspicious of a tractorload Wednesday evening and called in Highway
Patrol officers, who brought a drug-sniffing dog along.
</P>
<P>
   ``During routine questioning about the load, the driver wasn't
able to tell the weigh station officials exactly what his load
contained,'' Ricks said. ``He also said he wasn't exactly sure
where he was taking the load. On top of that, his paperwork wasn't
in order. Normally, a truckdriver has this type of information in
order. When he doesn't, it's a good sign that further inspection
might be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested Abbas Amir Shambayaty, 28, an Iranian
national, and charged him with one count of possession with intent
to distribute marijuana. He was ordered held without bond pending a
hearing March 22. He faces up to 10 years to life in prison without
parole and $4 million in fines if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks said: ``A lot of times, smugglers think the smell of red
peppers or onions will throw off police. And if you or I stepped
into the back of that trailer, the smell would probably be
overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the dog, he hit on the marijuana immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the driver had picked the load up somewhere in Texas
and was en route to the Chicago area, Ricks said. Once there, the
driver was supposed to make a phone call for instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks said the driver has been turned over to the U.S. State
Department because he's a foreign national. Next, the patrol will
investigate the source of the drugs and their destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver usually isn't the person we want the most anyway,''
he said. ``He's usually just some poor guy who's made a very bad
decision on how to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks added that a check of records indicated this was the
biggest marijuana seizure in Missouri's history.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest marked the second time in a month that authorities
have seized a huge load of marijuana at the Interstate 44 station
near Strafford. About 5,700 pounds was found in a truck there two
weeks ago.

 &HT;    IRS rulings on charitable groups linked to Gingrich cause
confusion
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two charitable organizations worked closely with
Newt Gingrich in the 1990s to help spread his political philosophy
to wide audiences through new technology.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS ruled that one group violated the prohibition against
taking part in partisan political work. The IRS revoked its
tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   The other was cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Now, tax specialists and others who have watched Gingrich's
ethics battles fear the IRS has made a muddle of the situation and
blurred the line between charity and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why they would rule differently,'' said
Frances Hill, a tax expert at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS investigation of the links between Gingrich, GOPAC (the
political group he once led) and the charities grew out of the
House ethics committee's probe of the college course Gingrich
taught at Kennesaw State and Reinhardt College in Waleska, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   That probe resulted in a $300,000 penalty and Gingrich's
admission that he violated ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   James Cole, special counsel who led the ethics investigation,
concluded in late 1996 that both the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity
Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation violated their
tax status.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable groups do not pay federal taxes and their donors may
take tax deductions for their contributions. In return, the
charities may not engage in partisan political activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Progress and Freedom Foundation case, the IRS ruled that
the charity was aiding in the dissemination of educational, not
political, material. It was a ``close case,'' the IRS said, given
the links between the foundation and GOPAC. The foundation served
as a funding source for Gingrich's Renewing American Civilization
course, principally because GOPAC did not have sufficient
resources. But the foundation was within its rights and ``did not
serve the private interests of Mr. Gingrich, GOPAC and Republican
entities,'' the IRS said.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the Lincoln Foundation, which funded earlier
broadcasts of Gingrich's ideas about government, the IRS ruled that
it was ``part of GOPAC's effort to train Republican political
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   GOPAC and the foundation shared office space and employees. Some
GOPAC employees told prospective donors they could give to GOPAC or
to the foundation, where the donations would be tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   This conduct, and other financial ties, showed that ``ALOF was
operated for the private benefit of GOPAC and other Republican
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   William J. Lehrfeld, the foundation's attorney in its appeal of
the IRS ruling, wrote in court documents that the IRS could not
treat the two foundations differently.
</P>
<P>
   Cole also concluded that the charities had behaved similarly and
should be treated the same way, although he differed with Lehrfeld
about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And Hill said the disparate rulings only confuse the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, director of the reform-minded Congressional
Accountability Project, called the rulings ``inexplicable.'' He is
calling for a Treasury Department inspector general's investigation
to determine how the IRS cleared the Progress and Freedom
Foundation, even after it acknowledged that it did not have all the
information it needed.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling was made public last month by the foundation. It
provoked worry among some tax lawyers and politicians that the IRS
had made it easier for politicians to use charitable groups to fund
some activities.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the ruling raises the possibility that candidates
could run many aspects of their campaigns through charities,
offering tax deductions and the promise of privacy to contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Foundation ruling, made public in Lehrfeld's March 5
filing in U.S. Tax Court, seems to cut the other way, reinforcing
the ban on mingling charitable and partisan aims, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, said San Francisco attorney Greg Colvin, ``is
that it's as if we're being given a picture in which half the
painting appears and other half doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``clearly, there is more room than many of us
thought for politicians to make use of (charitable organizations)
... as long as they maintain certain a amount of distance.''

 &HT;    Movie review of `Wing Commander'
 &HT;    By Hank Stuever
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I saw ``Wing Commander'' the other night, a
movie based on a video computer game, a tradition going all the way
back to ``Tron.'' I saw it with one of those ``special advance
screening'' stadium-theater crowds made up mostly of people who
call radio stations to win free tickets. As spaceships exploded in
astral ripples and yet another batch of athletic-looking Post-Xers
(led by Freddie Prinze Jr. _ astral dimples!) battled yet another
batch of neon-green-eyed, angry-kitty-cat-looking aliens, exactly
five things occurred to me:
</P>
<P>
   1) Freddie Prinze Jr. : A few light years ago, when I was a
reporter out West, I learned that the teen-age son of a famous but
tragically dead '70s TV-sitcom comedian was living a quiet life
with his mother in Albuquerque, N.M. It took some doing, but the
shy, handsome son agreed to meet me for an interview in the
cafeteria of La Cueva High School, from which he was about to
graduate. We talked about the father he never knew (he was 10
months old when Freddie Sr. shot himself) and what he planned to do
with his life. He didn't know yet, but he assured me that show
business was out, since show business was basically one big
cautionary tale. He didn't strike me as a teen idol then. Maybe he
didn't know either. Or maybe he was acting.
</P>
<P>
   2) They have to race the aliens back to Earth to warn everyone
to be ready for a surprise attack. Also, they need Freddie because
he's the descendant of an oppressed, extinct race of people who
knew about shortcut interstellar navigation. I know it's nitpicky,
but I absolutely insist in these kinds of movies that I be able to
follow it, to get a fix on the center of what matters here, and
hold on. Otherwise my mind drifts. (Which is very different from
saying the plot was complicated.)
</P>
<P>
   3) Computers: What do you think? I still believe that, just
because computers can do the heavy lifting in filmmaking these
days, it does not always mean that they should. Even if the
computers are from Austin, Texas. (No, especially if the computers
are from Austin, Texas.) I mean, there are some nice touches, but
secretly I wish for a season of adventure movies in which no mouses
were double-clicked.
</P>
<P>
   4) Litigants: What if the franchise holders of ``Star Wars,''
``Alien'' and ``Star Trek'' filed some sort of class-action
infringement suit against the next movie that manages to
shamelessly rip off (another view: pay homage to) all three? Could
a legal precedent actually encourage someone to make an original
space fantasy? I ask because I'm looking around at this sci-fi
crowd and wondering if they aren't just bored out of their
corduroys by now. (Alas, I already found a flaw in my plan: ``Wing
Commander'' is paid for by Twentieth Century Fox, which bankrolled
two of the three originals mentioned above. So what's going on is
self-plagiarizing, in a way.)
</P>
<P>
   5) Script: Toward the end, Freddie shouts to his love interest
and wing commander (Saffron Burrows), ``Hey, don't you die on me.''
These particular kinds of dude-isms have to go a long way in a
movie like this, and naturally can't quite do it. Computers do the
work in ``Wing Commander,'' and everything else gets left in the
smithereens. I'm sure it's a delightful computer game. I'm sure
that it's loud, and I'm sure I'd explode soonest.

RACKETEERING CASE SPURS FBI TO REASSESS ITS USE OF INFORMERS
</HEADLINE>

(wg) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It began in 1995 as a simple racketeering indictment
whose defendants included two reputed mob leaders long infamous in
Irish-dominated South Boston: James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen
``The Rifleman'' Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   By now, however, the case has become what many call one of the
most embarrassing messes for the FBI in years. And it has called
into question one of the oldest practices in law enforcement and
one of the most troublesome: the use of confidential informers to
fight organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The imbroglio, little-publicized outside the Boston area,
centers on accusations that for decades, FBI agents protected
Bulger and Flemmi while they committed assorted crimes because the
two also provided information about their Italian mobster rivals
that helped decimate La Cosa Nostra in New England. Defense lawyers
are essentially arguing that the government may not prosecute
crimes it effectively authorized informers to commit.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations of the FBI's practices, in pre-trial testimony in
the racketeering case, have prompted sweeping internal
investigations of the bureau and a months-long policy review by the
U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR;  Justice Department. That review is expected to end in new
rules that would require agents to share more about the
relationships with informers that have long been their most closely
guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would require the FBI and other agencies to
notify federal prosecutors whenever an informer commits an
unauthorized crime and whenever someone who is about to be indicted
is an informer.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department team has also begun to consider whether to
require the FBI and other agencies to consult with federal
prosecutors before making the sensitive decision of whether to sign
up a criminal kingpin in the first place, said Jonathan D.
Schwartz, an associate deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Any week now, a federal judge is expected to issue a ruling on
whether the government owes Flemmi immunity, which could affect
other informer-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases have raised similar questions about the slippery
agent-informer relationship, but for pure suspense, for local Irish
and Italian underworld color, and for depth of disclosure of the
murkier inner workings of the FBI, this one seems to have them all
beat.
</P>
<P>
   The most commanding figure in the case, Bulger, is the
black-sheep brother of the current president of the University of
Massachusetts; he is also a convicted bank robber, a former inmate
at Alcatraz and, according to prosecutors, the sometime head of the
closest thing to an Irish mob in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His associate, Flemmi, whose professional criminal resume is
similar, is in jail awaiting trial on the racketeering charges, but
Bulger has been on the lam with nose-thumbing success for four
years. He is a fit, 70-ish fugitive who, lament the authorities who
have picked up his trail and lost it, passes easily as a harmless
retiree and has been cruising blithely through the Sun Belt with
his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has offered a $250,000 reward for help catching him, and
he has been featured on programs like ``America's Most Wanted'' and
``Unsolved Mysteries.'' John J. Connolly Jr., a retired FBI
supervisor who worked closely with him, figures Bulger will likely
stay uncaught: ``He was a down-range thinker,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is not going quietly either. His disclosure in 1997 that
he had long been an informer _ to his own lawyer's surprise _ and
his argument that he had been authorized by the government to
commit his crimes &UR; ,  &LR;  opened the door to the metamorphosis of his
case into a virtual indictment of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-trial motions in his case took up most of 1998, and it has
been through that pre-trial testimony that a picture has emerged of
the kind of behind-the-scenes dealing the FBI &UR;  &LR; sometimes does.
</P>
<P>
   It all began back in the 1960s and 1970s, when federal
authorities saw the Mafia as a central threat to national security,
and Boston was caught in gangland warfare that killed dozens. The
word came down to Boston FBI &UR;  &LR;  agents that the No. 1 priority was
to close down the New England branch of La Cosa Nostra, and with
that directive came a new tool: the Top Echelon Informant program,
a special effort to recruit informers highly placed inside crime
groups, and thus, by definition, criminals themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To get at the Mafia, FBI agents here decided to try to enlist
the aid of Flemmi, who had useful ties to the Mafia but was not a
member. Somewhat later, they also turned to Bulger, who was then
considered a criminal leader in Irish-dominated South Boston and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, according to the picture painted in court, were
mostly their own little gang, the kind of territorial bosses who
would demand protection money, or ``rent,'' from bookmakers,
loan &UR;  &LR; sharks and other petty criminals, and who were also involved
in illegal gambling enterprises and loan &UR; - &LR; sharking themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If that were all they did, it might seem understandable that the
FBI let them keep doing it to glean information about the Mafia.
Certainly, some of the information was spectacular, including a tip
that helped lead to the first tape-recording the authorities ever
obtained of a Mafia induction ceremony, replete with finger-cutting
and the oath, ``I enter alive into this organization, and I will
have to get out dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And in general, the men helped the FBI trounce the Boston-area
Italian Mafia, putting away dozens of members.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also emerged in court that the two may have been
involved in crimes as serious as murder. In an event that casts the
agent-informer relationship in perhaps the worst light, the two men
were suspected in the killing of an Oklahoma City jai alai owner.
After FBI agents told them that another informer had fingered them
for that death, that informer was killed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi also became the targets of investigations by
the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Massachusetts State Police. But
it appears, according to testimony and court documents, that they
were repeatedly tipped off or protected by their FBI allies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) More than a decade after its doors were closed to
troubled children, the once-controversial Lester Roloff Home for
Boys and Girls is soon to be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   The facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, became notorious in the
late 1970s when its late founder refused to seek state licensing.
Roloff, a fundamentalist and leader of the People's Baptist Church
in Corpus Christi who believed the state had no right to license
his homes, even went to jail during litigation with the Texas
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question would seem to be whether Roloff would feel
vindicated or disturbed at the revival of his Rebekah Home for
Girls and Lighthouse for Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The homes, still operated by Roloff's church, are soon to be
approved by the Texas Association of Christian Child Care Agencies
Inc., a private organization created as part of Gov. George W.
Bush's ``faith-based'' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The private group inspects and approves church-operated homes
for &UR;  &LR; children with behavioral or drug problems, although the
association itself answers to the Texas Department of Protective
and Regulatory Services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had no comment this week about the application for the
Roloff home, and a spokeswoman said only that faith-based
facilities can provide ``meaningful alternatives'' for problem
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Roloff once operated one of the largest church homes in the
nation, with 200 girls housed in Rebekah and 50 boys in the
Lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   He came under fire when complaints surfaced, including claims of
severe whippings and the withholding of food by the staff. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; His real problems mounted, however, when then-Attorney General
Jim Mattox insisted that the homes apply for a state license and be
inspected by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Roloff continued to rail bitterly against the state until his
death in a private plane crash near Houston in 1982. The youth
homes were closed in 1985 and moved to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley Cameron, Roloff's former second-in-command, succeeded him
as head of the church and continued to run five homes for adults
between the ages of 18 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron refused to speak to the Houston Chronicle, referring all
questions to the Christian child care agencies, which confirmed
that Cameron was the first to apply for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll receive approval,'' said the Rev. David
Blaser, a Dallas minister and head of the child care group. ``We're
just barely off the ground, but we've made inspections. I was a
great supporter of Lester Roloff and Brother Cameron when they ran
the homes before.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaser said Cameron currently has two boys housed at the home
and plans to return the operation to its former capacity of 250.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the largest in the nation,'' said Blaser. ``It was
when Lester Roloff had it. He was a very dedicated man, and I
thought he did a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   Roloff's greatest opposition came from former Assistant Attorney
General John Odam, who was in charge of the Roloff case. Odam is
now an attorney practicing in Houston and a member of the Texas
Youth Commission board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question in my mind that those type of homes
provide a good service when they're properly run.'' Odam said.
``And the question really wasn't Roloff's operation of the homes as
much as it was his absolute refusal to get a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some complaints about severe whippings in one home,
but that could have been straightened out,'' he said. ``It was just
that Lester believed he was not subject to the state. He used to
get on the radio and pray for me personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I did the devil's handiwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Blaser nor Odam are sure whether Roloff would approve of
the new application process.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand it's an option that wasn't available to him, and
it means the homes can operate,'' said Blaser. ``On the other, our
group is subject to the state and maybe he would regard it as
licensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know.''

 BOSTON: FBI allies.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trial testimony and related interviews have verged repeatedly on
the cinematic. There was a moment, as recounted by Connolly in an
interview, when Bulger was recruited to inform on his enemies and
said: ``They want to play checkers; we'll play chess.''
</P>
<P>
   There were homey, boozy dinners shared chummily by FBI agents
and criminal informers, as described in testimony by both sides.
And there has been jaw-dropping courtroom drama as criminal after
criminal has been revealed to be an informer too, like some zany
comedy in which one actor after another pulls off a lifelike rubber
mask.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the remark that lies at the crux of Flemmi's
argument that the government owes him immunity.
</P>
<P>
   At one of those cozy dinners, Flemmi has testified, an FBI
supervisor, John Morris, told him and Bulger, ``You can do whatever
you want, just don't clip anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor says he does not recall making the remark. But it
encapsulates the sense that emerges from the case of the FBI's
willingness to resort to questionable means to achieve its end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone in their right mind really believe Jimmy Bulger
and Steve Flemmi survived the most powerful law-enforcement agency
on earth unless we fully intended them to survive us?'' asked
Connolly, who believes that the government owes both Flemmi and
Bulger immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another pivotal comment, Morris has said that he once asked
Connolly what the two men wanted in exchange for their information,
and Connolly replied, ``a head start.'' In other words, warning in
time to run if an indictment against them was about to come down.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, until the FBI guard changed and the two men's
usefulness declined, they seem to have gotten, and gotten away
with, much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   So the awkward question arises of who, exactly, was running
whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always weighing how bad are the bad guys versus how
good is the information they're providing,'' said Robert M. Bloom,
a professor of law and specialist in federal procedure at Boston
College Law School who has been following the Boston case. ``That's
the dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   But the picture here gets even worse for the FBI. Morris, who
has immunity, has admitted to acts of outright corruption: taking
several thousand dollars and cases of the wine he was so fond of
that the criminals nicknamed him ``Vino.''
</P>
<P>
   So, then, another question arises: Is all this really about a
couple of rogue agents who got too friendly with a couple of
criminals?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Kenneth Fishman, Flemmi's lawyer. If it were just that,
he argued, the Justice Department would not be talking about
changing its whole system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an aberration,'' Fishman said. ``It's an inherent
part of law enforcement that the courts have found to be
acceptable. You can make these deals with the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishman is arguing that the government must live up to its deal
with an informer like Flemmi _ a deal that he describes as
effective immunity for the racketeering crimes of which he stands
accused.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Callaghan, former assistant special agent in charge of
the Boston FBI office, said that dealing with criminals was
naturally a significant part of the bureau's job. ``You don't go to
the local church pastor for information,'' he said. ``We use
criminals. Do we think at certain times they do certain things they
don't tell us about? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But agents are already obligated to follow up leads on
unauthorized crimes by criminal informers, he said. He decried
Morris' corruption, but said of Connolly, ``You hate to see people
who are out there trying to get the job done whose reputations are
destroyed simply because they handled those people.''
</P>
<P>
   To Flemmi's arguments that he is owed immunity, the government
is arguing back strenuously, through its team of federal
prosecutors, that no such deal was ever made and that Flemmi was a
criminal who happened to find it advantageous to inform on his
enemies but received no legal promise of protection from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   A government brief filed recently accuses Flemmi of ``trying to
rationalize a life of heinous crime and duplicitous treachery into
the actions of some super federal undercover agent imbued with the
license to commit crime purportedly in the service of his
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Boston, Donald K. Stern, emphasized the
importance of informers for fighting everything from hate groups to
drug dealers. ``We're not suggesting everything here worked the way
it should have,'' he said, ``but we'll strongly defend the ability
of law enforcement to develop and nurture informants _ within
carefully constructed guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Connolly says Flemmi and Bulger ``were no angels,'' he
disagrees with the government's position on whether it owes them
immunity. He says his superiors did in fact make a deal with the
two informers, at least concerning gambling and loan &UR; - &LR; sharking.
And a deal is a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, however, that ``It was always understood they could
not commit violent acts.'' Brought up on the same South Boston
territory as Bulger, it was Connolly who helped Bulger turn
informer, and he does not regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business decision, pure and simple,'' said Connolly,
who retired a highly commended agent. ``We were going to use a gang
of two to get rid of a gang of 42.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you were a victim of Flemmi and Bulger, a victim of
criminals given virtual carte blanche by the government?
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the matter is, what if you're one of the Mafia's
victims?'' Connolly countered. ``The 42 people we put away were
probably responsible for 200 murders over 30 years, maybe more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the name of the game,'' he said. ``It all depends on what
your investigative priorities are. A decision was made by the
Department of Justice and FBI to go after the Mafia, and that's
what I did. My only crime is doing my job and doing it too well.''

ANALYSIS: 3 NATIONS' DAY OF DELIVERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NATO, NATO-POLAND-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., born a Hungarian,
long since naturalized as an American, could scarcely contain his
joy as he flew west Friday morning for the ceremony here marking
the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a thousand years of desperate craving to be part of the
West, today it's official _ we're in, we get the imprimatur of
NATO,'' the silver-haired Lantos, 71, said.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a history lesson by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pagan Hungarian king, St. Stephen, embraced Western
civilization in 1001 by accepting a crown from Rome,'' Lantos said.
``But it has taken a millennium to complete the process. In the
interim, we missed the Renaissance because we were occupied by the
Turks. We spent centuries as an appendage of Vienna, clinging to
the West through the hyphen that connected us, humiliatingly, to
Austria. We stumbled through the 20th century, cut off from the
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling of deliverance from an implacably cruel fate
suffused the little auditorium at the Harry S. Truman Library where
the ceremony took place.
</P>
<P>
   It took place here, of course, because it was President Truman,
with his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, who called NATO into
existence to meet the Soviet threat after World War II. Truman was
unpopular then; now he is revered, and modern administrations
identify themselves with his achievements and his matter-of-fact,
middle-American style.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 52 years ago Friday, on March 12, 1947, Truman delivered
a special message to Congress, enunciating the Truman Doctrine and
seeking legislative support for American aid to Greece and Turkey.
It was, he said, ``a fateful hour,'' in which ``the free peoples of
the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains true, but delivering the support has become harder,
quite aside from the enlargement of NATO. There is no agreement
among its members as to what action to take in Kosovo. There is no
agreement on what the criteria should be for action in future
crises in Europe or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, support for possible U.S. military action
in Europe, absent Russian aggression, is shaky. The House of
Representatives voted only narrowly on Thursday, 219-191, to
support President Clinton's plan to send troops to Kosovo. Former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told a House committee on
Wednesday that the whole idea made him ``extremely uneasy,'' and
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said Friday that if a Kosovo operation
was bungled, ``NATO could turn out to be a collateral casualty.''
</P>
<P>
   Other developments also threaten Atlantic equilibrium as the
50th anniversary celebration of the NATO pact in Washington next
month approaches. A seriocomic little trade war has broken out over
bananas. The presence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops in
Europe, a decade after the end of the Cold War, reassures European
political leaders but sometimes infuriates the European public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will no doubt try to ease such concerns in April, as
well as the worries of the Russians that NATO expansion is aimed at
them. But he chose not to avail himself of Friday's event to get a
head start. Truman stood at Acheson's side as the secretary of
state signed the original NATO treaty, but for whatever reason,
Clinton did not accompany Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
Missouri to stand beside her as she signed enlargement documents.
</P>
<P>
   The signing marked the achievement of a major foreign-policy
goal of the Clinton administration, as State Department briefers
were eager to proclaim. It put an exclamation mark to the end of
the Cold War, as Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek of Poland
suggested. It validated the deeds of those who revolted against
Soviet domination in the Budapest uprising of 1956, the Prague
spring of 1968 and the Solidarity movement that was born at Gdansk,
Poland, in 1981.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But for the Central Europeans, it did much more.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three nations that joined NATO Friday has struggled
for centuries to find and preserve its national identity. To them,
membership in the alliance symbolizes success at long last in that
endeavor, not just military protection from the United States.
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek spoke for them all when he said last
month in the Polish Parliament that belonging to NATO would enable
Poland ``to overcome the geopolitical curse laid on us since the
17th century.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that there have been no connections across the
Atlantic in the past. Casimir Pulaski, whose homeland, Poland, had
been partitioned in 1772, fought on the side of the colonists in
the American Revolution. Lajos Kossuth, a Hungarian nationalist,
was acclaimed in the United States in the 19th century. Eduard
Benes and Jan Masaryk, Czech democrats, were widely admired here.
Indeed, as Jan Kavan, the Czech foreign minister, noted Friday,
Czechoslovakia was founded after World War I on treaties for which
Woodrow Wilson was primarily responsible.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Poles fought furiously against the
Nazis, in their own army until it was crushed, then in brigades and
divisions attached to British or American commands in Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But for centuries, as Western Europe flourished and the United
States grew to maturity, Central Europe was unable to throw off the
yoke of misery for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Poles, whose king, Jan Sobieski, had ridden at the head of
Christian armies that beat back the Muslims at the gates of Vienna
in 1683, found their lands split up among the Russians, the
Prussians and the Hapsburg Empire. Risings in 1830 and 1863 and
1905 came to nothing. And when independence was finally restored in
1918, it lasted only two decades, ending in joint German-Russian
occupation in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign rule was a way of life for the Czechs. Even their
greatest leader, Charles IV, who built Prague's unforgettable
bridge, was a Luxembourger whose native language was French. Things
got worse in 1620; defeated at White Mountain, the Czechs fell
under the sway of the Hapsburgs for 300 years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hungarians, they were ruled by foreigners for 600
years, almost without interruption _ Frenchmen and Poles, Turks and
Bavarians, Luxembourgers and Russians. They have suffered at the
hands of dictators of the left and dictators of the right, with
only fleeting moments of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Janos Martonyi, the Hungarian foreign minister, made the point
about 1956, 1968 and 1981. But he also put Friday's events into the
larger context. For a long time, he said, his country had dreamed
of belonging to what he termed ``the community of Western
democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary has come home,'' he said. ``We are back in the
family.''

 &HT;    POTENTIAL CANCER DRUG SEEN FROM BRYOZOANS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    NOTE: FACT BOX ON 'PROMISING NATURAL SUBSTANCES' AT END OF STORY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Bryostatin-1, a potentially valuable anticancer
drug found in the gut of an obscure sea creature from a family of
animals known as bryozoans, has helped throw a monkey wrench into
efforts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ``renourish'' an
eroded Fort Pierce, Fla., beach.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows where bryostatin-1 comes from, whether from a
stringy little sea creature known as ``Bugula neritina'' or from
bacteria that live in the creature's stringy gut.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugula neritina's distant kinship to several species of
bryozoans discovered in sand the corps was dredging from the ocean
floor in the renourishment project was a factor in a federal
judge's decision to temporarily halt the Fort Pierce project.
</P>
<P>
   In granting a temporary restraining order sought by scientists
and south Florida environmental groups, Judge Henry Kennedy
specifically cited a court affidavit in which one of the plaintiffs
noted that Bugula neritina is a relative of the newly discovered
Florida bryozoans.
</P>
<P>
   In the document, bryozoan expert Judith E. Winston said she had
discovered 13 new species of the creatures in an area called Capron
Shoal, from which the corps has started dredging sand to use in
rebuilding Fort Worth's South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medicinal properties of the newly discovered bryozoans
have not yet been explored,'' said Winston. She added that if the
creatures were not protected, ``the opportunity to conduct such
research may be lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   In an animal kingdom that includes such impressive creatures as
great whales, elephants and Florida alligators, bryozoans don't
ordinarily get a lot of attention. They just grow on sand, rocks,
boat bottoms and other supports in the sea -- and in some case, in
fresh water. They gulp down whatever nourishing micro-morsels
happen to float by.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   If the bryozoans discovered by Winston are unpopular with
officials of Florida's St. Lucie County, which was helping pay for
the beach restoration, hope and money ride on their California
cousin, Begula neritina, and the drug it has provided.
</P>
<P>
   Drug trials aimed at obtaining a Food and Drug Administration
license for bryostatin-1 are underway, and a southern California
marine biotechnology company, CalBioMarine Inc., says it has
perfected a technique of growing bryozoans by the ton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just are waiting for call from a pharmaceutical company
that would contract with us to produce it,'' said Dominick Mendola,
president of CalBioMarine. ``We have developed a system for growing
them. We have tested it for many years, and it works.''
</P>

 &HT;    POTENTIAL CANCER DRUG SEEN FROM BRYOZOANS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    NOTE: FACT BOX ON 'PROMISING NATURAL SUBSTANCES' AT END OF STORY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Bryostatin-1, a potentially valuable anticancer
drug found in the gut of an obscure sea creature from a family of
animals known as bryozoans, has helped throw a monkey wrench into
efforts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ``renourish'' an
eroded Fort Pierce, Fla., beach.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows where bryostatin-1 comes from, whether from a
stringy little sea creature known as ``Bugula neritina'' or from
bacteria that live in the creature's stringy gut.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugula neritina's distant kinship to several species of
bryozoans discovered in sand the corps was dredging from the ocean
floor in the renourishment project was a factor in a federal
judge's decision to temporarily halt the Fort Pierce project.
</P>
<P>
   In granting a temporary restraining order sought by scientists
and south Florida environmental groups, Judge Henry Kennedy
specifically cited a court affidavit in which one of the plaintiffs
noted that Bugula neritina is a relative of the newly discovered
Florida bryozoans.
</P>
<P>
   In the document, bryozoan expert Judith E. Winston said she had
discovered 13 new species of the creatures in an area called Capron
Shoal, from which the corps has started dredging sand to use in
rebuilding Fort Worth's South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medicinal properties of the newly discovered bryozoans
have not yet been explored,'' said Winston. She added that if the
creatures were not protected, ``the opportunity to conduct such
research may be lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   In an animal kingdom that includes such impressive creatures as
great whales, elephants and Florida alligators, bryozoans don't
ordinarily get a lot of attention. They just grow on sand, rocks,
boat bottoms and other supports in the sea -- and in some case, in
fresh water. They gulp down whatever nourishing micro-morsels
happen to float by.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   If the bryozoans discovered by Winston are unpopular with
officials of Florida's St. Lucie County, which was helping pay for
the beach restoration, hope and money ride on their California
cousin, Begula neritina, and the drug it has provided.
</P>
<P>
   Drug trials aimed at obtaining a Food and Drug Administration
license for bryostatin-1 are underway, and a southern California
marine biotechnology company, CalBioMarine Inc., says it has
perfected a technique of growing bryozoans by the ton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just are waiting for call from a pharmaceutical company
that would contract with us to produce it,'' said Dominick Mendola,
president of CalBioMarine. ``We have developed a system for growing
them. We have tested it for many years, and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Although contractors working for the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch, which sponsors searches for drugs in
obscure plants and marine creatures, have collected and sent in
samples of over 60,000 species for evaluation, only bryostatin-1

THE MYSTERIOUS WAYS OF THE LORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lord works in mysterious ways, as does Rev. Pat Robertson,
so who's to say the wealthy preacher-politician-plutocrat is not
doing God's work?
</P>
<P>
   We have learned from campaigns past that the Deity is strongly
in favor of voting Republican, lowering the capital gains tax,
laying off the oil lobby, and staying the dead hand of government
from the leathery necks of our tobacco farmers, those horny-handed
sons of the Sun Belt whose votes are highly sensitive to any
government linkage of cancer to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But news that pilots from Rev. Robertson's private, tax-exempt
air force are ferrying equipment to his diamond mine in the Congo
led me to reaffirm my conviction that the Lord does indeed work in
mysterious ways.
</P>
<P>
   If Rev. Pat can have a big say in selecting the GOP's
presidedntial nominee, then why can't he cop a little informal
taxpayer subsidy for his little old diamond mine in the Congo?
Pilots from Robertson's ``Operation Blessing'' relief outfit
apparently said they were ferrying freight for Pat on the side.
Can't you see it? The crinkly-eyed Pat, dressed in old miner
clothes like Humphrey Bogart in ``Treasure of the Sierra Madre,''
staring into the fierce African sun, eyes fastening on the slivery
glint of the supply plane as it touches down with the stuff needed
for diamond extraction?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, the guy has his own TV network, and his own political
movement, why not a diamond mine? Jesus may have been the
unemployed son of a carpenter, but Pat, the son of a US Senator, is
a real go-getter. His Christian Coalition has more or less
supplanted Rev. Jerry Falwell's old political machine, The Moral
Majority, as the noisiest of the right-wing religious-political
fund-raising and vote-brokering combines.
</P>
<P>
   Tune in to Pat's nightly revival show on cable, and there's the
Grand Master himself, squinting soulfully into Camera 3, curing a
goiter in Arizona, an overactive-thyroid in Tennessee, or someone
with a bad back, constipation or a severe limp in any hamlet where
the cable TV linemen strung the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Televangelism is his game, but politics is his hobby, and Pat
takes on the Devil, two falls out of three, every night of the
week, with reruns sprinkled in for holidays and weekends. So far,
Satan has not made an appearance, but the devil's chief lieutenant
is often invoked, in the guise of the incumbent president, who sits
in the chair Pat campaigned for himself 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yessir, Bill Clinton might as well be old Beelzebub hisself to
hear Pat talk. And that Al Gore, why, he might as well be
Beelzebub's No. 2. Because the public, via the polls, and the
Congress, via the impeachment result, have failed to fulfill God's
commandments, as interpreted by Rev. Pat, the bossman of the
Christian Coalition, is rallying his flock around the notion of
ejecting the Democrats from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With the $15 million he vows to raise _ it always seems to come
down to money, when Rev. Pat gets involved, and the sum is always a
large, round, number _ the Christian Coalition will march forward
to smite the Godless foe, and install a new generation of
Born-Again Christian leaders (Pat seems to downplay the idea of a
non-Christian running mate) at the nation's helm.
</P>
<P>
   He's into television, televangelism, telemedicine, teleconomics
and tell-a-voter-what-to-think. The Devil can't keep up with him. A
pipeline to the Lord is what Pat has, a 1-800-Call-Pat dedicated
line to the Almighty, and if the Lord could figured out this
Internet thing, Pat would be on that too.
</P>
<P>
   The great religious-right takeover of the public political
process was first proclaimed the 1978 off-year election, when
fundamentalist Christians organized at the pastoral level dumped
five incumbent Democratic senators. Two years later, they drew a
bead on one of their own, Born Again Jimmy Carter. Carter was
weakened by Ted Kennedy (stubborn, costly primary challenge) and
the Ayatollah Khomeini (54 US hostages imprisoned for 444 days) and
the Moral Majority crowd had its biggest scalp _ the hair that
belonged to James Earl Carter. It was Reagan's lot to deal with his
brawny Born Again bretheren, which he did the way he dealt with
everybody else: winking, blinking, fudging, cajoling, getting by
with a smile and a shoeshine.
</P>
<P>
   But the religious right agenda _ banning abortion, smiting
liberalism wherever it raised its head, and cossetting conservative
Republicans on economic issues wherever that kind of thing could be
done by consenting adults in private, like screwing around with the
tax code _ never prospered as much as the congressional Republicans
and Reagan-Bush promised it would.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment crisis brought everything to a head for the
religious right. Not only were they not going to get to ban
abortion, steer tax money from public schools to religious schools,
and re-jig foreign policy to their preferences, but they were not
going to sever the Clintonian noggin from the Clintonian neck, and
parade said head on a platter down Pennsylvania Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to nail Clinton seems to have exhausted and
emasculated the religious right. The movement's sternest political
theologican, the redoubtable Paul Weyrich, was so despondent after
the impeachment debacle that he suggested like-minded souls turn
away from the political process and focus instead on separating
from the crass, materialistic, society-at-large and withdraw into
their own religious communities.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out that historians point to the House vote
impeaching Clinton as the high tide mark of religious
fundamentalism in the late 20th century, and the Senate's failure
to convict as the beginning of the receding tide. America has
weathered similar religious storms: the Scopes trial, Prohibition,
the McCarthy era. Religious fundamentalists make a certain amount
of headway, and then they founder, on factional divisions,
personality clashes, or some shift in sentiment sparked in the
larger population.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right claims about 15 percent of the electorate,
in some academic estimates, and while that number may vary, the
Christian fundamentalist vote can be magnified in low-turnout
elections, like primaries, caucuses, or off-year contests. But what
Weyrich concedes, and Robertson rejects, may be the gradual,
eventual, and predictable ebbing of the tidal surge that was first
discernable in the Senate races of 1978. If tides did not reverse,
after all, we'd all be under water _ or rowing Noah's Ark.

TOP SCORER SCHMIDGALL LEADS US INTO SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPOO, Finland _ Wiped out from a bout with the flu last
weekend, Jenny Schmidgall might have been forgiven for not playing
her best hockey the past few days. But thanks, rather than
forgiveness, has been in order: The 20-year-old center has been
playing her best hockey, leading all scorers in the Women's World
Championships as the top-seeded United States heads into its
semifinal game Saturday against No. 3 Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really coming on center stage now, and it's great to see
because she's such a gifted player,'' said US coach Ben Smith after
Schmidgall figured in the first five of Team USA's six goals in its
win over China Thursday night. ``She loves the game so much, with
so much passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivor of the US-Finland matchup will meet the winner of
Saturday afternoon's Canada-Sweden game in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidgall, who made her national team debut with the 1998
gold-medal Olympic squad, scored 11 points (4 goals, 7 assists) in
the three preliminary-round games. The rest of the scoring leaders
list reads like an all-star roster: Canada's Jayna Hefford is
second with 9 points, while Cammi Granato (US), Karyn Bye (US), and
Hayley Wickenheiser (Canada) each have 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun,'' said Schmidgall, a freshman whose 66 points
(32 goals, 34 assists) for the University of Minnesota, just a
half-hour from her hometown of Edina, put her fourth in the nation
in collegiate scoring. ``I just came out here ready to play, trying
to play the best hockey I can and if it goes in, it goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The US likely will need her to produce to find its way to the
gold-medal game. Finland barely lost to Canada Thursday night, 1-0,
and has maintained _ or even improved _ its bronze-medal Olympic
form despite the loss of Riikka Nieminen, who is second only to
Granato all time in scoring at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a formidable foe,'' said Smith. ``They like to play a
kind of transition game where they let you attack and like to
counter off that if you make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a tough power play, especially effective when
defenseman Kirsi Hanninen gets into the slot, and the US will face
by far its toughest opponent so far in the tournament. In the
preliminaries, Team USA outscored Russia, Sweden, and China, 27-2.

<P>
   ``That's why we scrimmaged so hard today,'' said Smith.
``They've got a bit of an advantage because they've had a serious
game and we haven't. We wanted to get ourselves in that frame of
mind, because it will be a much different pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Erin Whitten will be in goal for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the crowd. The just-opened Lansiauto Tapiola Arena
was rocking with 4,601 partisan fans for Finland's game against
Canada, and it's likely to be no different when their hometown
heroines meet the Olympic champions.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Schmidgall. ``It just pumps me up,'' she said.
``Sometimes it pumps me up more when they're cheering against you,
because you kind of want to put it back in their face.''

MENUHIN BEGAN AS PRODIGY, BECAME EDUCATOR, HUMANITARIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yehudi Menuhin died Friday of heart failure in Berlin; the
violinist, conductor, educator, and humanitarian had been
prominently before the public for 75 of his 82 years. Mr. Menuhin,
who lived in Switzerland and England, was in the German capital to
conduct a concert by the Warsaw Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Menuhin may have been the most astonishing of all
instrumental prodigies. Born in New York April 22, 1916, of
Russian-Jewish parents, Mr. Menuhin started studying the violin at
the age of 4 and made his debut playing the Mendelssohn Concerto
with the San Francisco Symphony at 7. His teachers included Sigmund
Anker, Louis Persinger, Adolf Busch, and Georges Enesco. In later
life, he himself became a leading force in musical education,
particularly in Great Britain, where he created the Yehudi Menuhin
School for talented young musicians in 1963 and later served as
president of the Trinity College of Music.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Mr. Menuhin, famously photographed in short pants,
played in a state of grace that moved all who heard him, including
the greatest musicians of the era, like conductor Wilhelm
Furtwaengler and composer Edward Elgar. In 1932, when Elgar was 75,
he conducted the 16-year-old violinist in a recording of his Violin
Concerto that has seldom since been absent from the catalog. Bartok
composed his Sonata for Solo Violin for Mr. Menuhin, and Walton his
Sonata for Violin and Piano.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Mr. Menuhin intermittently faced violinistic and
emotional difficulties, including depression, which he wrote
candidly about in successive editions of his autobiography,
``Unfinished Journey,'' first published in 1977. His second
marriage in 1948, to dancer Diana Gould, helped to restore his
balance, along with his discovery of Indian religion and the
practice of yoga.
</P>
<P>
   His most frequent recital partner until her death in 1981 was
his pianist sister Hepzibah, with whom he toured the world for
decades. He appeared repeatedly in all the musical capitals of the
world and played eight engagements with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra between 1934 and his last appearance at Tanglewood in the
Beethoven Concerto in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his bow arm became shaky and his intonation
unreliable, Mr. Menuhin had embarked on a notable career as a
conductor and organizer of concerts, orchestras, and music
festivals, and he was an active recording artist throughout most of
his life, amassing one of the largest discographies of any
classical artist. His recordings of many of the standard concerti,
particularly those of Mozart, for which he wrote his own cadenzas,
and Beethoven, remain points of reference. Among his best-selling
discs were crossover albums with sitarist Ravi Shankar and jazz
violinist Stephane Grappelli that were made because of Mr.
Menuhin's artistic convictions and not for commercial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Menuhin did not shirk controversy. During World War II, he
had played hundreds of concerts for American and Allied troops,
sometimes in dangerous situations, but after the war he became the
first Jewish musician to appear with Furtwaengler and the Berlin
Philharmonic, an act for which he was fiercely criticized, and
which he fiercely defended. Mr. Menuhin wrote, ``Music creates
order out of chaos; for rhythm imposes unanimity upon the
divergent, melody imposes continuity upon the disjointed, and
harmony imposes compatibility upon the incongruous.'' Mr. Menuhin
was laden with official honors throughout his life because of his
musical citizenship. He was an eloquent speaker and writer on
musical and humanitarian matters and the relationship between them.
His essays were collected in the book ``Theme and Variations'' in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor and retired Boston Symphony violinist Harry Ellis
Dickson first heard Mr. Menuhin in Berlin in 1932. ``Mothers of
people like me used to use him as an example. In 1932, I heard him
play three concertos with the Berlin Philharmonic in one night, and
it was overwhelming. Later he began to analyze himself, and he did
not play as well; I remember one time with the Boston Symphony he
spent the intermission standing on his head. It was sad to hear him
struggle with the violin, because he had really been a magnificent
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based violinist Peter Zazofsky said Friday, ``Mr. Menuhin
was one of the most important musicians of the century, and never
satisfied with just playing the violin. As a musician, he felt he
was a spokesman for humanity in the largest sense. There was an
aura of expansiveness and humanity about him that came through in
his playing, even when he was not at his best. The audience never
noticed, because they saw him in short pants again, and when they
heard him, they were listening to memories of their own youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Violinist Daniel Stepner also fondly remembered Mr. Menuhin's
influence. ``Mr. Menuhin was one of the three most influential
violinists in my growing up, the other two being David Oistrakh and
Henryk Szeryng. Mr. Menuhin represented the Apollonian ideal, a
very high-minded and idealistic approach to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to me to discover that he was an American,''
said the Boston-based musician. ``I played for him once, and he was
very unassuming, but also encouraging; he had all sorts of ideas
and represented a whole world of violinism that I had had little
contact with besides recordings. He was very close to Nadia
Boulanger, who was a teacher of mine; with her he shared a high
idealism about music-making and about teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   This writer heard Mr. Menuhin play only on troubled occasions in
the late '60s and early '70s, but even then there were glimpses of
the qualities one cherished in his great recordings. When Mr.
Menuhin was at his best, his playing represented a unique
configuration of insight, sweetness, nobility, and fire.
</P>
<P>
   I well remember a rebuke from former Boston Symphony
concertmaster Joseph Silverstein. Once in complimenting Silverstein
on the awesome standard of consistency he maintained throughout a
long and busy career, I asked him how he had done it, mentioning
the erratic standard of Mr. Menuhin's playing. ``Well, let's put it
this way,'' Silverstein said, ``I never had the problem of playing
as well as Yehudi Menuhin did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Menuhin is survived by his wife and four children: sons
Gerard and Jeremy (a pianist), from his marriage to Gould; and a
son, Krov, and a daughter, Zamira, from his first marriage, to Nola
Nicholas.

DOLE FINDS GRANITE STATE HARD TO CRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Elizabeth Dole came to New Hampshire Friday
looking for momentum for her developing presidential campaign, but
ran into some political headwinds instead.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party Chairman Steve Duprey said Dole risks
squandering the goodwill of local political activists unless she
quickly revs up her effort here.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's late getting into the race. There's still enthusiasm for
her potential candidacy, but other candidates are starting to take
little jabs and point out that she isn't organized here yet,''
Duprey said. ``She needs to get organized fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, one prominent party official said, the Dole
organization couldn't even provide the name of who interested
activists and voters could contact if they wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like throwing out liquid gold,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   One apparent result was that Friday's hastily arranged
appearance _ including a word-for-word repeat of the speech she
gave in Iowa Wednesday _ was marred by blocs of empty chairs in the
room at the C.R. Sparks conference center. Dole aides, fearing a
poor turnout, had made a last-minute plea to the state Republican
committee to help turn out a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is running the least organized presidential campaign I've
ever seen,'' said one seasoned Republican who would speak only
without attribution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dole's leading potential rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, has not visited the state and says he will not visit until
the Texas Legislature has adjourned for the year on May 31. But an
informal, underground network of supporters has sprung up, calling
potential volunteers with a simple message: Keep your powder dry.
The phone calling is designed to freeze activists from joining
other candidates until a Bush organization forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten calls from my politicos out there saying don't
worry, he's coming, don't commit to anyone else,'' said Duprey, who
is remaining neutral. ``The goal of the Bush effort is to keep as
many activists uncommitted till he gets in. I think that's
succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither Bush nor Dole has set up the sort of campaign
organizations here that some other candidates have put into place,
Duprey said Dole is more likely to be hurt by the slow ramping up
of her effort.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara J. Russell, the assistant Republican chair, said
activists are anxious to pick a candidate and start working.
Although Dole is not organized, Russell said she does have one
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been campaigning for her husband here for years and
years and years,'' said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Dole urged her polite, noontime audience to help her
raise money and to send suggestions to her internet site:
www.edole2000.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hear from you and get your thoughts and concerns,''
she said. ``And I'm certainly going to have to raise a lot of money
by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said the governor
is keeping his promise to the people of Texas by focusing on the
biennial meeting of the Legislature before he visits New Hampshire
or Iowa, the premier early campaign states.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he will be late, but he promises that he will work
hard to overcome his late start once he gets there,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Bush has already begun courting the state's two
congressmen, Charles Bass and John E. Sununu, and US Senator Judd
Gregg _ all of whom have extensive political contacts and
organizations likely to boost any presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dole event Friday, friends of the former director of the
American Red Cross said they have been inundated by phone calls
from people who would like to help her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Alec J. Koromilas, a Dover attorney, said his secretary
threatened to quit because his phone would not stop ringing after
Dole stepped down from the Red Cross. He said people from across
the state were calling to offer support.
</P>
<P>
   With a year to go until the primary here, some Republicans
believe that Bush and Dole have plenty of time to meet with people
around the state and set up strong organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their name I.D. is such that they're not late at all,'' said
Hugh Gregg, the former governor. While many activists have already
committed to another candidate, Gregg said, Bush still has plenty
of friends and supporters through his father, and Dole still has
contacts from her husband's campaign days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them haven't gone anywhere,'' said Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dan Wensley, the Strafford County Republican
chairman, said Bush and Dole should not forget the true nature of
the state's presidential political scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, New Hampshire is unique in that we do expect to a
certain extent, politicians who ask for our support to demonstrate
their willingness to come and engage us to one degree or another,''
said Wensley.

NORTH CAROLINA-CHARLOTTE UPSETS RHODE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Lamar Odom sat on the Rhode Island bench and stared
blankly out at the court as North Carolina-Charlotte was putting
the finally touches on its 16-5 overtime run and 81-70 victory in
the first round of the NCAA Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was I thinking?'' asked Odom afterward. ``I was thinking
how close we came. How we had the game nearly won. How we let it
get away.''
</P>
<P>
   That they did.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island played a solid first half. The Atlantic 10 champion
shut down 3-point threat Diego Guevara (he make a shot in the
opening 20 minutes) and forced the 49ers into taking bad shots
(34.4 percent from the floor and 25 percent from beyond the 3-point
arc). The Rams also survived an eight-minute span when Odom sat on
the bench following three early fouls. If it was a boxing match,
Rhody was one punch away from putting it away.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Rhode Island, North Carolina-Charlotte has
fared well this season when on the ropes. Seven prior times they
trailed at halftime and won. They knew trailing, 36-31, at
intermission was not a herculean deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we didn't play our best,'' said UNCC coach Bobby
Lutz. ``In fact, it's the worst we've played in a while. But you've
got to give Rhode Island credit. They did some nice things
defensively. I'm extremely pleased to survive an overtime game.''
</P>
<P>
   The box score will show Odom finished with a team-high 16
points, taking just 12 shots in 37 minutes. Teammates Antonio
Reynolds-Dean and Luther Clay had 12 each and Tavorris Bell 11.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina-Charlotte's Galen Young, who fouled out with five
minutes remaining, had a game-high 17 points and Kelvin Price 15.
Marlon Thomas threw in 13 and Guevara had 11, all in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   What the box score will not show is how Young did a masterful
job guarding Odom one-on-one and so did Thomas, who inherited the
job when Young fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be out there real bad, but I have confidence in my
teammates,'' said Young. ``They came through once again. That's one
thing I can credit to our team, when somebody goes down, we're all
there to pick each other up. Marlon did a terrific job. I knew he
could do it because he and I go at it all the time in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he pulled out all the stops. ``I'm a senior and
every game can be my last game so I played it as such,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who is quicker than Young, stripped Odom of the ball
late in regulation. In fact, Odom didn't score after Young left the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Even after North Carolina-Charlotte caught Rhode Island near the
end of regulation, the Rams had a chance to put it away.
</P>
<P>
   URI led, 63-60, with 2:33 to play when Reynolds-Dean hit a
3-pointer that would have given URI a 6-point bulge. Instead, it
was disallowed because he was called for traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't travel. It was a crucial call. It ended our season,''
said Reynolds-Dean, who also saw his career conclude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had the game won but it got away from us,'' said
URI coach Jim Harrick. ``From our standpoint, we had enough shots
to win the game. We just didn't make them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the extra session, North Carolina-Charlotte went on a 12-0
run, helped along by five missed URI shots and two turnovers. It
was a quick death for the Rams (20-13), who return to Kingston,
R.I., wondering if Odom will return for another season, while the
49ers advance to play Oklahoma in Sunday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 50-50 whether I return or turn pro,'' admitted Odom after
the game. ``If I return, it will be because I love my teammates.
It's a decision I'll have to make, but I don't have to make it
right away.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Jerry DeGregorio has been a mentor to Odom and
guided him to Rhode Island. A year ago, Odom asked DeGregorio if he
was ready for the NBA. DeGregorio told him he wasn't prepared
physically or emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   What does DeGregorio say now? ``He can't make a wrong choice.
Whatever he does is a right choice.'' Translation: Odom is ready
for the NBA.

OHIO STATE FACES FAMILIAR FACES ON BC TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Ohio State women's basketball coach Beth
Burns has a pretty good idea what's in store for her team when it
faces Boston College in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's Eagles guard Alissa Murphy of San Diego, whom
Burns tried to recruit when the latter was a coach at San Diego
State.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's freshman guard Brianne Stepherson, whom Burns heard
about through Scoonie Penn, a current Buckeye transfer from BC and
former neighbor of Stepherson's.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's coach Cathy Inglese, who used to work alongside
Jim O'Brien, the men's basketball coach at Ohio State who used to
be at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the irony of it all,'' Burns said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About Murphy, Burns said, ``I know she's great, so she doesn't
have to show me (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   About Stepherson, Burns said she told Penn: ``Just don't tell me
she's got your game, because we're in deep trouble if that's the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   And she said O'Brien, ``who has been nothing but complimentary
about Cathy,'' gave her great advice. ``I think he said, `Don't
screw it up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State (17-11, 9-7 in the Big Ten) last went to the NCAA
Tournament in 1996, when it got knocked out in the second round by
eventual champion Tennessee. The Buckeyes, seeded ninth, were
ranked as high as 19th in the Associated Press national poll, and
finished tied with Wisconsin for fourth in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have been hearing about being on the bubble for
their whole careers, and boy, we were on the bubble; we were the
last bracket announced,'' Burns said. ``But we felt we should be
here. We're excited not just to play a good Boston College team,
but in an environment that is probably unequal to anywhere in the
country in the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the winner of Saturday's game has the unenviable task
of facing the winner of the later game between Appalachian State
and heavily favored Tennessee, which is seeking its fourth straight
national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles come into their first-ever NCAA Tournament looking
much like they did all season _ banged up and bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Senior cocaptain Paula Bacso, who was hobbled most of the season
with a stress fracture in her right foot, was starting to practice
more last week when she developed a stress fracture in her left
foot. Freshman forward Becky Gottstein just started practicing
after suffering a sprained ankle against Seton Hall two weeks ago.
Senior center Whitney Steele has suffered from back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese said she keeps hearing that her players ``are just glad
to be here,'' but she doesn't want them to assume they should just
go through the motions tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is, `Don't just be happy to be here,' '' she said.
``We want to have fun being here, but realize that we're here to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the Eagles made their way to the University of
Tennessee for practice Friday, it's understandable if they were
overwhelmed. They drove past a billboard in downtown Knoxville
congratulating coach Pat Summitt on her 25 years at Tennessee,
drove across a road on campus renamed for the coach, and went into
the gym and saw six NCAA championship banners hanging from the
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking onto the court, the whole feeling, the whole
atmosphere,'' said Stepherson, shaking her head. Not to mention the
25,000 seats painted in the Lady Vols' color. ``There was a whole
lot of orange out there.''

CINCINNATI HAS LITTLE TROUBLE WITH GEORGE MASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jason Miskiri talked the talk before Friday's matchup
with Cincinnati. The George Mason guard said he saw nothing special
about the Bearcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just another team that wears Cincinnati on their
jerseys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, after the Bearcats administered an across-the-board 72-48
thrashing of George Mason, Miskiri had a somewhat different view.
He may have talked the talk, but he _ and his teammates _ walked
the plank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little more than that,'' he conceded. ``They have
the whole package.''
</P>
<P>
   They had too much, way too much, for starry-eyed George Mason,
making its second NCAA appearance and first in 10 years. Team star
George Evans, who was all-Everything in the Colonial Athletic
Association, had that deer-in-the-headlights look all game. He
posted a big doughnut (0 for 6) in 25 frustrating minutes as
Cincinnati swarmed him in the post and ran different guys at him
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a good defensive game,'' Evans said. ``Not just on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati dominated inside, built a 41-17 lead at the break,
and cruised into a Sunday matchup with without breaking much of a
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big load off of us,'' said guard Melvin Levett,
referring to the 3-14 seeding matchup and Cincinnati's status as
the heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Added Pete Mickeal, who led Cincinnati with 18 points, ``We
jumped on them. We didn't come out soft. We played good defense and
they didn't get any confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The peril of being a prohibitive favorite was nothing new to
Cincinnati. If it needed a reminder, it merely had to look at the
previous night's game between North Carolina and Weber State. The
Bearcats also struggled last year in the opener against Northern
Arizona and coach Bob Huggins gave his team a little pep talk
Thursday night to bring it all back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit home for me, I know that,'' Levett said of Huggins's
talk. ``Guys were ready to play. We didn't have that situation that
we had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   It took 10 minutes for Cincinnati to flex its many muscles.
Leading, 15-11, the Bearcats went on a game-breaking 26-6 run over
the final 8:13 of the first half. Mickeal had 8 points in the run
and Kenyon Martin (10 points, 6 rebounds) added 4. That accounted
for the 41-17 halftime score and the second half became a
made-for-television enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats were simply overpowering inside _ the halftime
rebounding advantage was 37-17 _ and of their 14 first-half
baskets, 10 were dunks or layups. George Mason, meanwhile, was 5
for 31 in the half, going more than six minutes without a hoop. The
Patriots also were 4 for 10 from the line in the half. Nothing
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, you're nervous before the game,'' said
George Mason coach Jim Larranaga. ``We got more nervous as the game
went on . . . They put tremendous pressure on you. Everything is
contested. Even if you're open, you have a sense of someone
attacking you. And you rush. We found ourselves doing that early.
We haven't been in this situation before and we didn't know how to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins's season-long concern has been Cincinnati's shooting.
``We can beat anybody when we make open shots,'' he said. ``We've
got really good shooters on some days. But we defend well enough
and we rebound well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati shot only 40.3 percent Friday and missed most of its
outside shots. It didn't matter. When the other guy shoots 16
percent from the field in the first half, everything is relative.
The Bearcats simply relied on their old staples _ defense and
rebounding _ until they could get their layups and dunks. George
Mason got nothing, all day, at least not when it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with Cincinnati adopting its business-as-usual
approach and the George Mason fans standing for the final two
minutes, applauding a team that came a long way in a short time.
The team that got them here is the one the coach, the fans, and the
players will remember. The one that came unglued Friday is one that
is best left forgotten.

`PAYNE' LACKS PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, March 15)   By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
PAYNE 
Starring: John Larroquette, JoBeth Williams, Rick Batalla, Julie
Benz 
On: CBS 
Time: Premieres Monday at 9:30. Another episode airs Wednesday at
8:30, then the series moves to a regular Wednesday at 8 timeslot. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there any pleasure in ``Payne''? Let's just say the new CBS
sitcom is pretty painless, as in toothless and declawed and
watered-down. A remake of ``Fawlty Towers,'' the 12-episode BBC
series that was replayed here on PBS, ``Payne'' wants to be as
brilliantly farcical as the original, with John Larroquette trying
his own sly version of John Cleese's bold rudeness. But the show,
which premieres Monday night at 9:30 p.m., plays out more like a
mildly sexualized adaptation of classic soft-hearted American
sitcoms like ``Newhart'' (the one set in Vermont) and even
``Petticoat Junction'' (the one set in, alas, Hooterville). Despite
it's fast pace and able cast, ``Payne'' is just another familiar
network comedy about the quirky characters at a country inn _ this
time, though, with a bit of randy repartee.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-to-late 1970s England of ``Fawlty Towers,'' there was
some glee to be had in unmasking the hostility behind the polite
hotelier veneer. The show had an outrageous energy, fueled by class
tension, the battle of the sexes, and Cleese's unapologetic
contempt and fits as Basil Fawlty. In 1999 America, on the other
hand, we are nothing if not unmasked. There are so many nasty
characters on TV right now, including Ted Danson's ``Becker,''
which ``Payne'' replaces, that the duplicity of a sour inn owner
isn't particularly novel or juicy. And comically nasty characters
on American TV are required to have a lovable quality, one that can
dull the fun as it sands down the abrasiveness. No matter how gruff
and fake Larroquette is in ``Payne,'' his lanky charm generally
wins out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne'' isn't helped by the writers, whose dusty plot devices
reach back to the sneaky-spouse gags of the ``I Love Lucy'' era.
The setup of the premiere is so old and predictable you may wonder
how the writers even kept themselves interested enough to finish
the script. Basically, Larroquette's Royal Payne gives his wife,
Constance, an anniversary gift pin that he secretly lifted from the
inn's lost and found. But then the pin's owner shows up. Yikes! The
only show I can imagine adding freshness to such a hack storyline
is ``Frasier,'' which still manages to stretch from subtle comedy
of manners to farce effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual material in ``Payne'' is also curiously dated.
Constance wants to make love with Royal, but as she pulls him into
bed she doesn't know the bellhop is hiding in the room. The scene
crosses the line from bedroom-farce staple to bedroom-farce cliche,
and it offers only a tinge of fascination when you realize that the
show's creators have the Paynes sleeping in twin beds. ``Payne''
may be trying to offer a more adult alternative to the sort of
singles sexuality that fill shows like ``Just Shoot Me'' with sassy
attitude. But twin beds? What's that about?
</P>
<P>
   There are four main characters running the Whispering Pines inn
in Northern California: Royal Payne; his wife, Constance; a
goody-goody chambermaid; and a very thick bellhop. As the couple,
Larroquette and JoBeth Williams have a good sense of timing and
chemistry. Larroquette, with his snowy-slopes head of white hair,
is an especially compelling TV presence, as viewers of ``Night
Court,'' ``The John Larroquette Show,'' and ``The Practice'' will
remember. He deserves a fresher vehicle that doesn't require him to
be the henpecked husband calling out, ``Yes, my delicate flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Another episode of ``Payne'' airs Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. Next
week, the series moves to its regular timeslot of Wednesday at 8
p.m.

GAZA YOUTHS DIRECT IRE AT PALESTINIAN POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAFAH, Gaza _ With black smoke billowing from burning tires for
the third day in this Palestinian town, 27-year-old Mahmud
struggled Friday to explain what has brought him and hundreds of
residents into the streets in clashes with Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are unfair and people can't take it,'' said Mahmud, a
tailor and veteran of years of street protests against Israeli
occupiers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the anger is directed at their own:
Palestinian authorities who took control of this southern Gaza city
as part of the Israeli-Palestinian peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmud took part in the stone-throwing attacks this week that
injured scores of Palestinian police, who responded with tear gas
and live ammunition. Friday, he waited to see whether the flaming
tires would spark a demonstration that he could join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when the Israelis were here I used to throw stones at
them because we wanted them out . . . they're out and now we want
to live freely, and if anything blocks this, we will stand against
it,'' said Mahmud, who refused to give his last name.
</P>
<P>
   Above his head was one of hundreds of black-and-white posters
plastered overnight on cinderblock walls throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook the land under the feet of the Israeli Zionists and
we will make it a hell against the traitors,'' said the posters.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the protesters were demonstrating against the ruling
Palestinian Authority, viewed as heavy-handed and corrupt. Against
the Palestinian police, which fatally shot two teenage protesters
Wednesday. Against the special Palestinian security court, which
sparked the riots when it sentenced a former Islamic activist to
death.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, which tapered off Friday into a relatively
quiet march, have raised fears the situation could intensify into
civil war. With the peace process with Israel frozen and the local
economy desperate because of corruption, mismanagement and Israeli
restrictions, frustration against the Palestinian Authority is on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police tried to calm the situation Friday by staying
out of sight. But when a Palestinian Cabinet minister, Abu Ali
Shaheen, came to speak to the relatives of the two boys killed, he
was shouted at and told to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not between any organization and the
Palestinian Authority, but between the people and the Palestinian
Authority,'' said Ghazi Hamad, editor of an Islamist weekly
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people mistrust the Authority, they mistrust the judicial
system and what erupted in Rafah is not just a reaction to the
death sentence, but a reaction to the violations they see all the
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting started after a local man, Raed al-Attar, was
sentenced to death for killing a Palestinian police officer who was
trying to arrest Attar and two other former Islamic activists.
Attar was a member of a different security force and he allegedly
was planning an attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But to many people in Rafah, Attar is seen as a Palestinian
nationalist unjustly sentenced to death by a court that is already
under heavy criticism from human rights groups for lack of due
process and hasty trials that end with death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration in Rafah was sparked by the court verdict, but
the fervor appears to have been fueled by a general frustration
with the way things have turned out since Palestinian Authority
took over in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the two teenaged boys on the first day only
inflamed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better during the Israeli occupation,'' claimed
55-year-old Shaban Mugari, whose son was out demonstrating this
week. ``Because then if you were killed, it was your enemy doing
the killing, but now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will deal
with this problem. Political groups, including the Islamic Hamas
and Arafat's Fatah organization, have pleaded for Arafat to review
Attar's death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Arafat has shown himself responsive to pressure
from the street, but in this case it might be more difficult for
him to solve things. While many in Rafah are clamoring for the case
against Attar to be reopened, the family of the police officer he
allegedly murdered wants revenge. Meanwhile, the families of the
two boys killed in the rioting this week also want revenge on the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of their relatives have been staging a sort of sit-in.
Plunked on blue plastic chairs pulled out on a side street, they
say they will wait there until they have justice. In this case,
justice means punishing the people who shot the boys, but one man
said Arafat needed to take steps to address some of the more
fundamental complaints as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is doing his best to establish an independent state,
but without justice and democracy it won't work,'' said a
50-year-old relative of Hamis Salameh, one of the slain
17-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has achieved a lot since 1994 and all his achievements are
being destroyed by bloodsuckers,'' said the man, who would not give
his name.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola stock jumps 10 percent
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Big Red appears to be on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. stock jumped 10.4 percent over the last two days
on heavy volume.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Friday at $69.43 3/4, up $3.06 1/4 for the day
and $6.56 1/4 from Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new in the near-term fundamentals,'' analyst
Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney said Friday. ``I think
people are realizing that it's Coke. ... It's still an excellent
business model and has a great management.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, analyst Skip Carpenter of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette Securities raised his rating to ``buy'' from ``market
perform,'' citing the company's ``unrivaled'' global reach.
Carpenter expects Coca-Cola's stock to reach $79 within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, Solomon upgraded the stock to ``buy,''
predicting that it would hit $73 in about six months to a year. On
Feb. 23, she reiterated her position.
</P>
<P>
   Since hitting a 52-week high of $88.93 3/4 July 15, the company
has seen its stock fall to as low as $53.62 1/2. Investors have
been concerned about its exposure overseas, where a number of
economies have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Coca-Cola's Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas
Ivester delivered several speeches to business groups stressing the
company's long-term strategy of staying the course in turbulent
markets so it can capitalize when the good times return.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has more than 1.5 million shareholders who own the
stock directly or through their brokers.

 &HT;    Dow continues surge toward 10,000
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Dow Jones industrial average resumes its10K run
Monday after twice coming within a whisper of a landmark close
above 10,000, only to drop back both times.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow came within 41 points of 10,000 on Friday, or 23 points
closer than on Thursday. But the effort fizzled immediately and
never seriously threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   A gain by each of the Dow's 30 blue chip stocks would have been
enough to push the index over the top after Thursday's
record-setting close at 9,897.44.
</P>
<P>
   But two Dow stocks were responsible for postponing that
achievement: Caterpillar, the manufacturer of earth-moving
equipment, which fell $6.18 3/4 to $44.68 3/4 after warning of
lower than expected first quarter sales, and computer giant IBM,
which fell $4.87 1/2 to $178 on general market concern about
technology profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of lackluster earnings releases, particularly from
the technology sector, has sparked the current selloff,
particularly given the market's recent worries over a possible PC
sales slowdown,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst David Kim.
</P>
<P>
   A disappointing third quarter sales report by Oracle Corp. put a
damper on the market in general.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-loaded Nasdaq composite index posted the biggest
decline on Friday _ 1.3 percent _ followed by a 0.7 percent decline
in the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip indexes _ the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 _ posted
declines of about 0.2 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street analysts scoff at the attention that 100-point
and 1,000-point advances receive as being mostly a psychological
phenomenon. But others say such attention can have an impact in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of enthusiasm for Dow 10,000 and it almost seems
like it's built-in now,'' Peter Cardillo, director of research at
Westfalia Investments, told Dow Jones News Service.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for the Dow to reach that milestone by the end of next
week, which is the next ``triple witching'' session for the stock
market. That once-a-quarter event is when stock options, stock
index options and stock futures expire on the same day, and
typically add to the market's volatility.

   NEW YORK _ With the Dow Jones industrial average threatening to
top 10,000, stock market investors may want to break out a bit of
the bubbly and celebrate their good fortune. If so, better to
uncork some of the cheap stuff and leave the Dom Perignon on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a Dow 10,000 is a downer. By no means. It would be
another in a long line of historic, if psychological, milestones
that the decadelong bull market has blown past.
</P>
<P>
   But the ascent of the Dow does not at all reflect what is
happening in the overall market. The 30 stocks that make up the Dow
represent just 20 percent of the entire stock market's value. By
comparison, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stocks account for 79 percent
of total value, and the Wilshire 5000's represent nearly 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Dow is soaring, the rest of the market is snoring.
In fact, fewer and fewer stocks have been rising. Most are well off
their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the data, courtesy of Salomon Smith Barney's equity
research group: 92 percent of NASDAQ stocks and 86 percent of New
York Stock Exchange issues are below their highs by 10 percent or
more. Stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 are doing better, but the majority _ 70
percent _ are still 10 percent or more off their highs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's what Salomon calls its laggards indicator, which
measures the number of common stocks that are lagging behind the
S&AMP;P index by 15 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three out of four companies are in that category, putting
the indicator at its highest level since it began in 1971. As a
comparison, in the bear market of 1973-74, fewer than 60 percent of
stocks were laggards. In the bear market of 1990, around half of
all domestic stocks underperformed the S&AMP;P by 15 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been four times when the indicator broke 50
percent, and three of them were right before significant market
corrections,'' said Jeffrey M. Warantz, an equity strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``The market cannot continue for an extremely
long time when it is supported by such a narrow base.''
</P>
<P>
   And the market's advance is getting narrower all the time. For
the 12 months ended in December, the top 10 stocks in the S&AMP;P
accounted for 43 percent of the index's gains. For the 12 months
ended Feb. 28, the top 10 S&AMP;P stocks contributed 49 percent of the
index's performance.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the market was dominated by so small a group of
hot stocks was in 1973, the era of the Nifty 50. While the rest of
the market fell apart, the favored stocks _ Avon Products, Levitz
Furniture and Eastman Kodak, to name three _ climbed ever higher.
Then, one by one these faddish stocks fizzled. By December 1974,
the Dow had lost 45.1 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Warantz thinks that a similar event is happening to today's
Nifties. Dell Computer disappointed investors with its earnings
report earlier this month; Intel, Cisco Systems, Lucent
Technologies and Microsoft have all taken hits. As these stocks
pulled the market up, so, too, can they drag it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imperative that investors not get lured into this narrow
trap,'' Warantz said. ``When I see the market broaden, I'll break
out the Champagne.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Chrysler Corp. broke the rules when it brought out
the first-generation Neon in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While American and Japanese auto makers offered homely
econoboxes, the Neon had a style that was funky and unpretentious.
While the Big Three were struggling to attract 18-to-25-year-olds
to their showrooms, the Neon quickly developed a youthful
following.
</P>
<P>
   While some competitors had small, anemic engines producing less
than 100 horsepower, the Neon was available with as much as 150.
The peppy, responsive Neon was also relatively fun to drive, and
there was even a weekend racing model _ the Dodge Neon R/T with a
special race package. Owners could participate in
Chrysler-sponsored competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Neon was designed to earn a profit, in contrast
to most small cars, which are often loss leaders aimed at drawing
customers into showrooms _ and helping to improve corporate economy
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually identical Neons were sold through both Dodge and
Plymouth dealers, an industry first. The move saved money that
otherwise would have been spent to differentiate similar models
with slightly different trim, and it eliminated huge marketing
costs by advertising a single Neon instead of two distinct cars.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising also took a fresh and memorable approach. Who
could forget the simple ad campaign in which the Neon was presented
like a friendly pet, its grinning face filling the television
screen with only a single word _ ``Hi'' _ underneath?
</P>
<P>
   The Neon has suffered a sales slump lately along with the entire
small-car segment, which still accounts for nearly a third of all
United States car sales. At times, Chrysler has offered hefty sales
incentives to move Neons, and production has been occasionally cut
back because of bloated inventories. Still, the Neon has been an
unqualified success; Chrysler has sold 1.5 million in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The second-generation Neon is now arriving in Dodge and Plymouth
showrooms. Developed by Chrysler before its merger with
Daimler-Benz, the 2000 Neon retains many of its original features,
including style, value and a fun-to-drive character. But like its
prospective owners, it has grown up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Neon rides on the same basic chassis as the previous
model, though the wheelbase is an inch longer, the car's overall
length is 2.6 inches longer and the roof is slightly higher. The
most significant structural change is the addition of steel frames
around the door windows. Along with some other beefing up, this
makes the body more rigid.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon wears new skin over its old skeleton, though its
distinctive face, with headlamps resembling a toddler's wide-eyed
gaze and a grille like a child's grin, has not changed much.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Neon looks a little less cute and a little more
grown up, to appeal to the Generation X consumers who are settling
down and the Baby Boomers whose nests are emptying _ the two groups
most likely to buy the car. From the rear, the Neon resembles its
much larger sibling, the handsome Dodge Intrepid.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon also retains Chrysler's cab-forward design, which
plants the wheels out near the corners of the car for increased
interior room. In fact, the 2000 Neon has grown a bit inside, and
trunk space has expanded to 13.1 cubic feet from 11.8.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrics and materials are significantly upgraded and more
sophisticated. A new instrument panel features circular white-faced
gauges under a wide brow. Features like power switches have been
repositioned on the door for easier access. There are storage
compartments for coins, cellular phones, sunglasses, compact disks
and tissues, as well as large map pockets in the front doors.
</P>
<P>
   The locking glove box has holders for pens and a tire gauge.
Four cup holders can hold large cups, mugs or juice boxes. The
front seating position is higher than its predecessor for improved
visibility, though it still felt as if it were designed for
youthful bodies. My middle-age frame found the front seats still
uncomfortable, lacking back support on long drives. The back of the
rear seat is split and either part, or both, folds for increased
cargo capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The original Neon was the first small car to have standard
driver and passenger air bags and to offer anti-lock brakes as an
option. The new Neon has adjustable head restraints including ones
in the rear seat. But like all other Chrysler-developed models, the
Neon does not have side air bags; some competitors, including the
Chevrolet Prizm, do offer them.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon does have more standard equipment than its predecessor.
Standard now are an AM/FM radio with a cassette player and six
speakers; a rear defroster; floor mats; a battery saver that shuts
off the dome light if it is left on, and gradual theater-style
dimming for the interior lights. The door handles are now
body-colored.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A number of options are grouped in packages for easy ordering.
For instance, one $1,760 package adds air-conditioning, keyless
entry, a tilt steering wheel, power windows and power door locks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sophisticated appearance, the Neon's youthful,
fun-to-drive character remains intact. This has has long been among
the sportiest of the small economy cars, and its chassis is better
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon continues to be powered by a 2-liter, 4-cylinder engine
with a fairly modern single-overhead-cam design. Rated at 132
horsepower, this engine is at the high end of the class and is one
of the Neon's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Neon was available with a 150-horsepower,
dual-overhead-cam engine. To the chagrin of enthusiasts, that
potent but noisy power plant has been eliminated. DaimlerChrysler
says a higher-performance Neon is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon comes with a standard five-speed manual transmission,
my preference, or a three-speed automatic. Unlike most other small
cars, the Neon doesn't have a four-speed automatic, which in theory
would provide better mileage and smoother performance. But even the
tested Dodge Neon with the three-speed provided plenty of zip from
a dead stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Neon's brakes have been redesigned for shorter stopping.
Front disks and rear drums are standard, but four-wheel disk brakes
with an anti-lock system and traction control are available as a
single $595 option _ one that is worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   Despite attempts to quiet the noise _ the latest of which
includes triple seals on the full-frame doors and extra
sound-deadening material, the Neon remains noisy, especially
compared with, say, a Toyota Corolla. (The Saturn suffers similarly
from a high noise level.) But hey, that's where those six speakers
on the audio system come in handy. Just crank it up and drown out
the noise.
</P>
<P>
   The first Neon initially suffered from many quality problems,
with several recalls in its early months on the market. With the
2000-model test car, I encountered only a single glitch, though a
significant one. On occasion, I would shift the automatic
transmission into reverse to back out of a parking spot, and it
would behave as if it were in neutral. Throwing it into park and
trying the process again resolved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce costs, DaimlerChrysler not only dropped
the dual-cam engine, it eliminated the two-door model entirely.
(The coupe's share of Neon sales had recently fallen to 18 percent,
from 25 two years ago.) Only two trim levels are now offered: a
basic version and a fancier model called LX by Plymouth and ES by
Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite various cost-cutting measures like these, the Neon's
price has gone up. When it was introduced in 1994, the base price
of the entry-level model was under $10,000. The base price of the
2000 Neon, albeit with more standard equipment, is $13,390 when
destination charges are added. Options quickly push the price to
$15,000 and beyond _ into the realm of considerably larger cars
like the Nissan Altima and DaimlerChrysler's own Plymouth Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   While the original Neon stood out for its perky character and
sporty performance, the new version faces much tougher competition.
In particular, Ford promises a real battle this fall when it brings
its new Focus, which replaces the Escort, to North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus is designed to raise the bar in the small car class
for bold styling, interior roominess, responsive driving dynamics
and engines that rival the power of Neons. Already voted European
Car of the Year by a panel of auto writers, the Focus will be
available in three body styles _ a coupe, sedan and wagon _ with a
choice of five trim levels and two engines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 2000 Neon owns the neighborhood. But a prodigy, the
Focus, will soon be the new kid on the block. &QL;

A DARK SIDE OF PROSPERITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The surging prosperity over the past three
years has lifted a lot of boats, and has left the water rather
choppy for many others.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and James Stogdill are in the latter group. They own a
television and appliance store on Franklin Avenue here, in a mixed
commercial and residential area. And their troubles are the
troubles of many small retailers, who find themselves at the wrong
end of an American boom that has spread its benefits unevenly.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for small retailers is labor. The shining
characteristic of the 1990s expansion, in contrast to those of the
1970s and 1980s, is that wages have risen faster than inflation for
most workers. The raises for people at the low end, earning $6 to
$9 an hour, have been particularly strong. These are workers that
the Stogdills hire, and the rising labor cost, while a happy
circumstance for the workers, is squeezing the Stogdills.
</P>
<P>
   They can't raise prices to offset higher payroll costs _ too
much competition. Inflation is all but dead in the late 1990s, for
small retailers and for everyone else. Big companies, however, have
aces up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   They can deflect higher labor costs by moving operations to
lower-wage cities, for example, or by automating. Such tactics are
not really an option at Stogdill's TV and Appliances, the family
business founded by James Stogdill's father in 1957 and profitable
ever since, although less so lately because of the wage pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Selling TVs, VCRs, audio equipment, refrigerators, washing
machines, dishwashers and other appliances off the floor is
labor-intensive. So are the repairs done in a back shop and the
service calls to customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I belong to a small-business organization,'' Mrs. Stogdill
said, ``and at meetings, when I bring up my problems, the whole
room chimes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages are one face of the problem. The other is a
shortage of workers. During slack times, lower-wage workers count
on small companies like Stogdill's for jobs. But the unemployment
rate in Des Moines today is less than 3 percent. Available workers
are hard to find, and larger companies, offering better pay and
better benefits, are drawing down Stogdill's normal pool of
potential hires.
</P>
<P>
   After much searching, the Stogdills recently filled vacancies
for a bookkeeper and a clerk, the bookkeeper at $11 an hour and the
clerk at $8. The previous occupants had earned $8.50 and $6.50,
respectively. ``I had used an employment agency to try to fill the
clerk job,'' Mrs. Stogdill said. ``I had never used an agency
before, and that's an extra expense right there. Luckily, through a
friend, I got someone for $8 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stogdills normally run their operation with 21 people,
including themselves. They have managed to keep their labor cost at
a steady $35,000 a month, despite wage increases averaging 10
percent a year since 1996. That is a sharp departure from the
cost-of-living raises that had been standard practice at
Stogdill's, and still are for the higher earners on the staff. But
holding labor costs steady at $35,000 entails a sacrifice: the
staff has dwindled to 17 people, and that creates another problem.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen people are not enough hands to build up revenue, Mrs.
Stogdill said. Times are good and people are spending, and that
requires a bigger staff to exploit the opportunity. She and her
husband would like, for example, to hire another repair person.
Repair work, which now accounts for only 20 percent of the
company's revenue, generates the highest profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't raise prices on the product side, so we are going to
have to do it on the service end,'' Mrs. Stogdill said. ``Even now,
we are implementing job pricing, which is a flat rate rather than
an hourly rate for a service job. It's like car dealers who for
years have charged flat prices to change brakes, although an
experienced mechanic can do it in 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stogdills are offering $10 an hour for that additional
repair person, a wage that is no longer high enough to land one
quickly. ``I could attract someone for $15 an hour,'' Mrs. Stogdill
said, ``but only by stealing from a competitor, and I don't want to
get to that point. We would get into a free-for-all that would hurt
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience at Stogdill's is reflected in the surveys of the
National Federation of Independent Business, which has 600,000
members, including Stogdill's. One-quarter are retailers, and most
of the members have fewer than 40 employees. Like Stogdill's, a
significant percentage report that their profits are under pressure
and that they are having trouble filling jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Such strains skew the economic expansion, accentuating its
uneven nature. These are prosperous days. Wages are rising and
unemployment is falling. That is certainly good. But in the absence
of almost any inflation, boom has come to mean squeeze for
Stogdill's, and for tens of thousands of companies like it in
America.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, with the arrival of the new single European currency
and forecasts that the American economy would slow down in 1999,
European stock markets seemed as though they would be a pretty good
choice for American investors.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not been the case so far this year. Although
Europe's major markets other than Germany have done nearly as well
as the United States for local investors, the returns for Americans
in those markets are smaller or even negative.
</P>
<P>
   This disappointing performance is the fault of the new currency,
the euro. Most forecasters, especially those in Europe, predicted
that the euro would rise smartly against the dollar and other
currencies after its debut. Instead, it has slumped since its first
week of trading. This decline erodes the year's gains on European
stocks when they are translated into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For American investors, the euro's performance is a stark
reminder that currency moves can still play a major role in the
value of an international portfolio, despite assurances that the
new euro, by combining 11 currencies, would make investing in
Europe less complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency can really make a difference,'' lamented Joe Rooney,
global strategist for Lehman Brothers Securities in London and one
of many analysts who had expected the euro to rise in value. ``What
really caught us was the euro,'' he said. ``We thought the good
local stock returns would have been re-enforced'' by a rally in the
new currency.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the CAC index of 40 stocks is up 5.9 percent in euro
terms. But after accounting for the 7 percent fall in the value of
the euro against the dollar, that gain reverses to a 1 percent
decline. The 3.8 percent increase in Italy's Milan index of 30
stocks becomes a 3 percent decline in dollars. Ireland's overall
index is up 8.2 percent in euros but only 1.1 percent in dollars.
Only in Finland, where the main stock index has soared 14.8
percent, is the dollar return _ 7.3 percent _ a match for Wall
Street's performance.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has even undermined a remarkable turnaround in the
German stock market. The DAX index of 30 stocks shot up 5.1 percent
Friday on news of the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine, the German
finance minister, who had alienated business leaders in part by
calling for tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   That surge left the DAX up half a percentage point for the year
in euros, back in the plus column after a sharp selloff from its
January high. But American investors are still in the red in
Germany, by 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the dollar has also hurt Americans investing
elsewhere, although that rebound was better anticipated. The dollar
is now up 4.5 percent against the yen this year and has cut sharply
into one of the better recent performances of the Japanese stock
market. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 11.9 percent in yen
but 7.1 percent in dollars. (Given Japan's recent track record,
American investors are probably not complaining.)
</P>
<P>
   Rooney thinks the euro will rebound later this year, wiping out
the currency losses and then amplifying gains that investors
receive from the stock market. By the end of the year, Rooney is
forecasting a 10 percent increase from current levels, to $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   That would make a big difference for American investors. With
the euro worth $1.20, the 1 percent decline in the French stock
market in dollars so far this year would be transformed, for
example, into an attractive 8.9 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   But will Rooney prove to be correct? The euro rallied last week,
rising three-quarters of a percent, to $1.0905. But its biggest
daily gain _ an almost 1 percent jump on Thursday, when the German
Finance Minister resigned _ evaporated on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Karen E. Parker, the currency strategist at Chase Securities,
who predicted a fall in the new euro, still does not think it will
rally this year, although Lafontaine's resignation may stem its
near-term decline. She thinks an interest-rate cut to spur sluggish
European growth is more likely, a move that would weaken the euro.
</P>
<P>
   And she is betting that the relatively stronger American economy
will keep investors more interested in holding dollars than euros,
leaving the new currency at about the same weakish level in 12
months that it is now.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Reared in the poverty of a bleak housing project,
Arthur Murray, 29, had kicked around for years with two boyhood
pals _ ``Now one's dead and one's in prison'' _ before finding his
way to the carpenter's union hall. Now an apprentice, he is headed
toward a $27-an-hour job.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Alex, 43, searching for a job after a recent divorce, knew
that supporting two children on the wages of a secretary or a
waitress would be daunting. Always handy around the house, she
pursued a job in the building trades as a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Giron, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico as
a boy, once viewed plumbers, carpenters and bricklayers as ``just
big white guys.'' But now he wears the hard-hat and steel-toed
boots of a carpenter, and the union people tell him that his
ability to speak Spanish as well as English will be a help on the
construction site, not a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a shortage of trades workers to meet the voracious
demand for construction in the United States, desperate builders
and eager unions have begun aggressive campaigns to court new
workers, attracting women and members of racial minorities to the
traditional bastion of white men, a world where a coveted union
card was handed from father to son.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Chicago-area carpenters union opened a $3.5
million training center in a poverty-scarred neighborhood on the
city's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   Besides broadening the labor pool, leaders in the construction
field are working to enhance the image of the trades worker, a
career path that has often lost out to the prestige of a college
education or the dazzle of the high-technology field. But many
school counselors are starting to urge some students to give a
second look to the trades, jobs that often pay $50,000 a year to
workers with a high school education, offer a sense of
accomplishment, and have family-friendly work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we have come to view these as hard, dirty
jobs,'' said Jim Turffs, a high school career counselor in Oregon,
Ill. ``There's a stigma that if you wear jeans and a T-shirt,
you're not as intelligent. But these are good jobs, paying good
money. And you know, there are some drawbacks to being stuck at a
desk for 10 hours a day, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the unemployment rate among skilled trades
workers has fallen below 6 percent, the lowest level on record. A
shortage of skilled workers ranks as the most serious problem
facing contractors, according to a survey by the National
Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the No. 1 problem all over the country,'' said Tom Woods,
a builder in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., who leads the
association's new task force on the labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   He said the worker deficit had driven up labor costs, especially
in overtime wages, and often forced customers to wait six months,
or even a year, to move into a new house, compared with the
traditional 60-day wait.
</P>
<P>
   As just about anyone knows who needs to build an addition,
renovate a kitchen, or even fix a dripping bathroom faucet, it is
sometimes nearly impossible to get through to a trades worker. They
are overwhelmed with work.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the builders group in December found that 87
percent of contractors reported shortages of carpenters, and that
the situation was worst in the Midwest and Northeast. The report
also found that 75 percent of contractors reported ``significantly
higher costs of labor'' in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Graham, a project manager for a New York City builder,
said his customers must wait at least 12 weeks for work to begin. A
few years ago, people sometimes waited only a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electricians are so busy they don't have time to bid jobs,''
said Graham, who works for 3-D Laboratory. ``And you can't find
anybody down at the union hall. They're all out working.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the builders surveyed expressed concerns
about the quality of available skilled trades workers. Some
builders said they had absorbed higher labor costs because work had
been done improperly and needed to be redone.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Klein, a builder in Tulsa, Okla., said his company, Kleinco,
had been forced to turn away business, because it lacked enough
skilled workers, and he worried that the problem could worsen, as
the average age of trades workers increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out at my carpenters, and they're mostly in their
40s,'' he said. ``This used to be a young man's game.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to attract more young people into the building
trades, in the view of industry and labor officials, stems partly
from the decline of vocational education in public schools. High
schools that once offered courses in automotive work or building
trades, for example, have increasingly come to measure themselves
in terms of the percentages of students they send to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat into their heads that unless you get a college
education, you're a failure,'' Woods said. ``We, as a society, have
failed young people by giving them that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools that retained the industrial arts, in some cases, used
the shop floor as a place to send misfits. ``If you had an unruly
kid,'' Woods said, ``there was this idea, `We'll just make a
bricklayer or a carpenter out of him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in appeal of working in the trades, all sides of the
construction field agree, stems in large part from the plebeian
image of manual labor in American society, where the work force
increasingly sits in front of a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   On television and in movies, industry and labor leaders say,
trades workers have often been lampooned, depicted as overweight
men in ill-fitting clothes, speaking in fractured grammar and
holding benighted social views.
</P>
<P>
   The reality on the construction site today is far more diverse.
Aleia Cherry, 28, a carpenter apprentice who was framing metal
studs at one of the union's training facilities on a recent
afternoon, teaches English at night at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was a carpenter,'' Ms. Cherry said, adding,
with a laugh, ``Of course, he probably wouldn't think a woman
should be doing this kind of work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Her love of books, she said, hardly meant that she could not
also find gratification in the construction of roof trusses. For
centuries, the artisans in the building crafts were among the most
highly regarded workers in Europe, she noted. She said she would
continue to teach after becoming a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Another apprentice in the carpenter's program, Steve Wilson, 27,
is a social worker with a degree from Illinois State University. He
worked with young men who were offenders, and simply grew weary of
the stress, and the long odds of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I start work at 6 a.m. and I'm done at 2:30 p.m., and I
can look at something and say, `I built that,''' Wilson said.
``Besides that, it pays better.''
</P>
<P>
   For some young people of working-class backgrounds, it is the
very success of the building trades that has propelled them in a
different direction. They are the children of carpenters, plumbers
or bricklayers who were able to give their families the comforts of
middle-class life, and the aspirations to go even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ball, a high school senior in Oregon, Ill., is the son and
grandson of tool-and-die tradesman, a young man who has great
respect for the craft that pays more than $40,000 a year. But he
will be enrolling in a private college this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a lawyer,'' said Ball, who is drawn to history,
government and politics. ``It was just always assumed that I would
go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders and unions are making greater efforts to speak to high
school students at career days, hoping to portray a life in the
trades in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said builders were emphasizing the appeal of the working
hours, noting that it is the carpenters and plumbers who have time
to coach Little League and soccer games in the early evening. In
addition, he said, young people need to know that technological
advances have made construction worker a bit less physically
taxing. Carpenters often use nail guns, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical labor is still involved, but not nearly like it used
to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Isaacson, the vice president of the district that
governs unions for 32,000 carpenters in the Chicago area,
meanwhile, stresses the benefits of trade union work. He noted that
carpenters now receive pensions of about $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In its apprenticeship program, the union even gives trainees a
$300 tool allowance. Apprentices start training at an indoor
facility for nine weeks, practicing before going out to jobs. As
trainees, they earn about $10 an hour. Their wages increase
gradually over five years to the journeyman level, now about $27 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   For young workers like Murray, who recalls the scarcity faced
growing up in the Robert Taylor Homes housing project, the
apprenticeship program amounts to a chance at the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to build a new house,'' said Murray, who is married and
has four children. ``It's my goal. And I'm going to reach it.''

FREED FROM IDEOLOGY, RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHERS EXPLORE LIMITLESS
POSSIBILITIES

 By   PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Fedorovich Titov is not bitter. True, he was
chairman of the department of Marxist-Leninist philosophy at the
prestigious Moscow State University when the faculty voted in 1991,
as he put it, to ``liquidate completely'' his department.
</P>
<P>
   But as he explains: ``We decided the question pacifically.
Professors understood the political situation.'' He offers a gentle
smile, revealing a gold tooth. His large ears and thick,
rectangular glasses seem to have outgrown his cropped gray-haired
head. This 60-year-old Marxist is now teaching existentialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great mistake,'' he says of his department's
elimination. ``Marx was a great thinker. Without him you can't do
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrow faculty room with its mismatched chairs in neon-aqua
tints is cold, and Titov warms himself with a cup of English
breakfast tea. Gazing down from a photograph hanging above a tall
wooden bookcase is Karl Marx, his face partly obscured by a plant.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years Russian philosophy was Marxism-Leninism. It was
more than a dusty schoolroom requirement; it was the national
religion, the source of the state's political authority and
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Mironov, the chairman of Moscow University's philosophy
department, remembers a teacher once telling him, ``You get paid a
high stipend not because you know philosophy, but because you're
going to be an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   These days ideological work doesn't pay that well, and the
benefits aren't great either. But no one knows yet what will
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the old guard, professors like Titov, still have
their teaching jobs, and some of the textbooks have changed nothing
more than their titles. But Russian philosophy, freed from the
Marxist straitjacket, is clumsily stretching its arms, testing its
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking at every problem through the lens of
scientific socialism, philosophers can now reinvent themselves:
they can be analytical or mystical, try logic or phenomenology. The
ethics of political and economic success are suddenly acceptable
subjects for ethicists, as are abortion and organ transplants. In
epistemology, the study of knowledge, scholars can now examine a
subject once off-limits, like the religious roots of science.
</P>
<P>
   This freedom has pitched Russian philosophy both backward and
forward. In some cases Russians have looked inward, sifting through
their own past to rediscover the philosophical heritage that was
suppressed during most of the Soviet period.
</P>
<P>
   Some have turned to the religious philosophy of the Christian
Orthodox church, while others are re-examining the 19th-century
notion of the ``Russian idea,'' the nation's unique historical
mission. Still others have looked outside, to Europe's and
America's postmodernists.
</P>
<P>
   What philosophical school is most popular now? ``What day is
it?'' Mironov responded with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The ``all of the above'' option is, to some degree, precisely
the point of a post-communist world. Yet as these and other ideas
rush to fill the vacuum left by communism, the question is whether
Russians will be tempted by a substitute orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understood Marx very dogmatically,'' explained Ruben
Apresyan, who teaches at the Institute of Philosophy in Moscow,
historically a more autonomous institution than Moscow State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``they are replacing one set of axioms with another.'' In
this sense, how the born-again field of philosophy develops is a
bellwether of Russia's intellectual life in general, and of its
ties to the country's politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most predictable impulse after the fall of communism was
Russian scholars' desire to fill in the gaps of their history.
Although some of the writings of homegrown philosophers like
Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolai Berdyaev and Ivan Ilian began to be
available in the Khruschev era, they were often carefully
controlled. You could talk about them, says El'mar Sokolov (whose
parents chose E for Engels, L for Lenin, M for Marx), but you
couldn't write about them.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov's thin face, gray hair and weathered pin-stripe suit are
illuminated by St. Petersburg's iron-tinted afternoon light.
Outside is the snowy garden he ran through as a boy during the Nazi
siege of Leningrad; inside this professor's study are
black-and-white photos of his family, Czars Alexander II and
Nicholas II, and Berdyaev.
</P>
<P>
   Even though small public lectures on Berdyaev were allowed in
the mid-1980s, ``a friend had problems because he said Berdyaev was
more important that Lenin,'' Sokolov remembers. ``He was fired,
then sent to a bad university to teach. Then he emigrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Berdyaev, one of the best known Russian philosophers, turned his
back on Marxism in 1922 and was deported to Paris, where he wrote
about Russia's destiny as the new Jerusalem. The Russians, he said,
were a special spiritual, organic people with a mission to
transform society.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other intellectuals and writers he was deeply
influenced by Solovyov, the 19th-century philosopher whose complete
works are now being published for the first time. Solovyov, who
coined the term ``the Russian idea,'' had a mystical bent and saw
Christianity as the repository of supreme wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The return of ``the Russian idea'' worries those who fear that a
belief in Russia's exceptionalism could turn into a dangerous
messianism. When many Russians feel humiliated, the notion of a
divine mission offers psychological compensation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It also seems to set the stage for a replay of the tug of war
between nationalist, conservative Slavophiles and progressive,
secular Westernizers, a struggle that Dostoevsky savagely satirized
in his 1872 novel ``Demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this opposition between East and West has often been
exaggerated. The simple idea that Russia has a unique character, a
particular ``Russkii mentalitet,'' appeals not only to fierce
nationalists, but to religious leaders, poets, anti-communists (who
see Marx as a Western import), as well as young, liberal
Western-educated scholars who don't want to see Russia's form
squished into a one-size-fits-all American-style suit.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true at the moment, when Western-style
liberalism has taken such a battering here. Instead of rose-colored
glasses, many Russians now see the West through what Apresyan calls
``gray glasses.'' Intellectuals in Moscow and St. Petersburg
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disenchantment with Western liberal ideology,''
said Vladimir Lektorsky, editor of the leading philosophy journal,
Voprosy Filosofii (Problems of Philosophy). ``Liberalism was
reduced only to minimal government and private property, with
disastrous results.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory and practice liberalism itself had turned into a kind
of dogma. Corruption, poverty, a dwindling industrial base and
agricultural system, and governmental chaos hadn't exactly help
salvage the capitalist dream.
</P>
<P>
   One Western import that has captured the imagination of the
younger generation of scholars, however, is French postmodernism.
``Every second person considers himself a postmodernist,'' Mironov
said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways postmodernism seems the perfect philosophy for a
post-communist society. After years of listening to the ruling
party dish out the ``Truth,'' postmodernism's insistence on
competing notions of truth is a refreshing change.
</P>
<P>
   Its skepticism of authority extends to Western assumptions about
the straight path of progress and common attributes. Thus, those
who hold on to a sense of Russia's uniqueness are drawn to it as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kostikova, 34, teaches at Moscow State University and has a
ready giggle. She chose contemporary French postmodernism as her
speciality even before the Soviet Union was disbanded.
Postmodernism is not necessarily the most popular field, she said,
but it does characterize the country's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't not be a postmodernist in contemporary Russia,'' she
said, her dark brown hair haphazardly tied back. ``Our country is
very unstable both economically and politically, and no ideology
can be adequate to the situation. In this sense postmodernism is
being realized not as a popular philosophy but as the acceptance of
various philosophies and their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Svetalan Shakirova, 31, also considers herself a postmodernist.
She got interested in philosophy after reading ``Das Kapital'' in
the eighth grade, but she wrote her thesis on the idea of male and
female in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophy is the ``science of elderly men,'' she says through a
translator. Perhaps. Yet she and 10 colleagues also from Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan (formerly part of the Soviet empire), nonetheless
traveled 1,500 miles to St. Petersburg for a seminar on gender
theory.
</P>
<P>
   This unfamiliar intellectual stew has fed anxiety about the
future of Russian intellectual life. This generation of scholars is
a transitional one; what will the next one bring?
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual life has suffered from the loss of state support.
Gone are the comfortable salaries, subsidized journals, research
grants and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior professor now earns $100 to $200 a month; circulation
of the once subsidized Viprosy Filosofii has fallen to 7,000 from
85,000 in 1990. At St. Petersburg University the philosophy
faculty's phone service was cut off for several months in 1997
because no one paid the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet intellectuals have also suffered from the loss of an
authority to fight. In a repressive society, defiant writers and
thinkers carried moral authority; they were prophets who could
speak truth to power. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already a crisis of confidence in intellectuals,'' Ms.
Kostikova said. ``People don't trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikita Pokrovsky, a Jefferson scholar and sociologist who, like
most professors in Russia has had to stitch together three teaching
jobs to survive, is pessimistic. ``In about a decade or earlier,
the quality of teaching and research will decline dramatically,''
he said. Only 1 or 2 percent of his students end up pursuing a
career in academia. ``You can make 10 times as much as a secretary.
We're seeing the degradation of the intelligentsia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokrovsky repeats the litany of complaints: Students are
blockheads; juicy pulp fiction has replaced serious literature;
jobs are scarce and money more so; talk of the ruble has replaced
the ``kitchen discussions,'' philosophical nights at which shots of
vodka, cigarettes and rich conversation would be consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Students ``can buy abridged versions of Tolstoy and
Dostoevsky,'' said Mironov of Moscow State University, ``You have
speed-reading courses everywhere; but how can you read Heidigger
that way?''
</P>
<P>
   To others, such gloomy ruminations are more suited to Russian
literature than life.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta Stepaniants, 63, who heads the Oriental Philosophy
Department at the Institute of Philosophy, says intellectual life
is still vital and more expansive.
</P>
<P>
   Over tea in her uncommonly bright office, with its varnished
wooden floor and new computer, she said that when she published a
book on Sufism in 1987, it was the first on the subject; people
stood in line to buy a copy. Now there are several in print. If
Russians don't queue up for serious books today, she says, ``all it
means is we didn't publish enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because she saw how her own thinking evolved in
difficult times, she is more optimistic. As a teen-ager she cried
when Stalin died, almost getting trampled in the scramble to see
his coffin. A trip to India in 1959 and a stay in the United States
in 1961 with Quakers introduced her to unaccustomed ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a revolutionary or a dissident,'' she explained,
adding a description that could also be applied to the coming
generation of Russian intellectuals, ``but I developed.''  &QL;

   NATO (Independence, Mo.) _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic Friday became the first former members of the old Soviet
bloc to join NATO, expanding the Western military alliance to 19
members. At a ceremony in the hometown of the late U.S. President
Harry Truman, the foreign ministers of the three new members signed
formal documents of accession and gave them to U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who told the ministers: ``You are truly
allies, you are truly home.'' By Jane Perlez.

   OIL-TALKS (Undated) _ A group of major oil producers announced
Friday that they had agreed to cut oil production by 2 million
barrels a day, a move that sent depressed crude oil prices upward.
Some analysts said that if the cuts are implemented as planned by
April 1 they could lead to a steady recovery of crude oil prices,
which would lead to an increase in the price of gasoline. But
others said that even if the supply cuts stick, the increase at the
pump would be modest at first _ about 5 cents a gallon. By Agis

the case has become what many call one of the most embarrassing

 &HT;    Action against IOC members falls short of expulsion
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Insisting that his corruption investigation was not a
``whitewash,'' the head of an International Olympic Committee panel
said Friday severe public rebukes are recommended for many members.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Vice President Dick Pound said the penalties fall short of
expulsion, however, for all the members still under investigation
save one, Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   IOC investigators recommended severe censure for the two
highest-profile members implicated in the corruption scandal, Kim
Un-yong, an executive board member from South Korea and Phil Coles,
a longtime IOC member from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A third leading member, Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, was
recommended for a ``very serious'' warning in a report from a
six-man inquiry that examined the conduct of 17 IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a whitewash at all,'' Pound said of the report. ``It
is a very serious rebuke to the members that is being made public
throughout the world. I think that is very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Less-severe warnings also were proposed for Louis
Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast, Willi Kaltschmitt of
Guatemala, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, Anani Matthia of Togo,
Austin Sealy of Barbados and Mohamed Zerguini of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations must be acted upon by the IOC's executive
board before final action by a special general assembly in
Lausanne, Switzerland, next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nine IOC members already have resigned or been expelled in the
corruption scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation dealt with 14 members in its first
phase and reconvened to consider another 16 members implicated last
month in a Utah ethics board report. Six of those cases, involving
unidentified members, were considered insignificant and dropped
without any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably as tough on IOC members as any outside body
would be,'' said Pound, responding to criticism that the IOC was
not capable of investigating its own members.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation alleged that Kim used his Olympic position to
help land lucrative jobs in telecommunications and music for his
two children _ daughter Kim Hae-jung, a concert pianist, and son
Kim Jung-hoon, a satellite television executive also known as John
Kim.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel issued a recommendation on Kim, however, his
case remained open. The report said allegations still to be
completely investigated could lead to a recommendation for
expulsion ``if what's alleged turns out to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, who resigned Friday from the Australian Olympic
Committee, was cited for accepting some $60,000 in travel to ski
resorts and the Super Bowl from Salt Lake bidders. Coles has
repeatedly denied wrongdoing but conceded he had been ``careless''
in handling the lavish perks.
</P>
<P>
   The Pound report determined that Coles ``did not exercise his
best judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov was cited by the Salt Lake report for involvement in a
scholarship at the University of Utah for the daughter of the head
of a leading Russian recording company. Kim Jae-hung signed her
first major recording contract with the company Melodiya.
</P>
<P>
   Wallwork came under investigation after it was revealed his
wife, Julia, had borrowed $30,000 from Tom Welch, the former head
of Salt Lake's Olympic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also recommended the IOC set up an ethics
committee, including outside members, and establish a code of
conduct; create a reform commission including outside experts to
study structural changes of the IOC; and adopt a new Olympic
bidding and site-selection process.

 &HT;    Gov. Barnes: Olympic records should be publicly released
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt and Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes said Friday he will ask the state
attorney general to determine whether documents related to
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Centennial Olympics should be publicly
released.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who helped craft Georgia's open records law and pushed
legislation this year to strengthen it, said he would release the
documents if they were in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made my position pretty clear from the beginning. I
believe the documents are subject to open inspection,'' Barnes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments followed a request from The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution seeking his support, as well as that of Mayor
Bill Campbell, in efforts to gain access to the Georgia Amateur
Athletics Foundation's records. Nick Gold, a spokesman for
Campbell, said the mayor ``absolutely'' supports opening the
records to public inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he will reiterate his position in asking Attorney
General Thurbert Baker for a legal opinion. He said he expects
Baker to be sympathetic. ``He's been generally very sensitive to
Open Records also,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAAF, a nonprofit organization created by Billy Payne in
1987 to direct Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics,
maintains the documents are the property of a group of private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, however, said the fact that the foundation started off
as a private entity isn't enough to shield the records. ``The
intent of the law was clear. If there is a private group that
performs public functions, then that private group is subject to
the Open Records-Open Meetings acts,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's officers were not all private citizens. Andrew
Young pledged his support to the bid effort and was chairman of the
foundation while he was mayor of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And the foundation's bid pledged the use of city and state
facilities, government services and construction of a
state-financed Olympic Village at a public university.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GAAF will gladly work with the attorney general's office
and the governor's office on this matter,'' said Lee Echols,
foundation spokesman. ``However, we have made it clear that we
believe the Georgia Open Records Act does not apply to the private
records of GAAF.''
</P>
<P>
   GAAF lawyers did not return calls Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bid effort has come under scrutiny during
investigations into a million-dollar vote-buying scheme surrounding
Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``GAAF is currently creating an archive of the documents that
are in question,'' Echols said. ``And these are documents to which
the public will have access once they are properly archived.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he has no reason to believe improprieties
occurred. ``I know all these folks, they're honorable folks,''
Barnes said. ``I don't have any knowledge there was anything
substantially done wrong. But that's not the issue here. The issue
here is whether the public has a right to information to make a
decision on their own.''

 &HT;    Ligtenberg may be lost for season
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ In another stunner that could effect
the Braves for the rest of the season, Kerry Ligtenberg was found
Friday to have a partial tear of the medial collateral ligament in
his right elbow that could require season-ending surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg, who recorded 30 saves as a rookie last season, has
been shut down for the next three-to-four weeks, when his condition
will be re-evaluated. If the ligament has shown improvement, he
could rejoin the club as early as mid-April. If it has not
improved, he would require ``Tommy John'' ligament transplant
surgery that would end his season before it ever begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real happy it happened the way it has,'' said
Ligtenberg, who finished sixth in the National League Rolaids
reliever standings after replacing Mark Wohlers as the Braves
closer last season. ``I've never been injured before so it's kind
of a shocker.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz alerted the club's scouting
staff to Ligtenberg's injuryFriday morning, so that the team would
have it's ``antennas up'' for a possible trade for a closer. But
the GM estimated such a deal would come later in camp and singled
out Rudy Seanez, rookie Kevin McGlinchy and foremost John Rocker as
possible successors to Ligtenberg's closer role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a substantial blow,'' Schuerholz said. ``You can't
minimize that, but there are a lot of people in our organization
who have felt strongly about Rocker's ability to handle a job like
that, if the opportunity ever came. Well, it's come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who already lost first baseman Andres Galarraga this
spring, suspected Ligtenberg had a problem Wednesday, after he
allowed five runs in the ninth inning to the Astros. He told
trainers something caused a burning sensation in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like in my head I could loosen up my forearm a little
bit but that just wasn't the case,'' Ligtenberg said. ``It was only
after the inning was over and I'd stopped throwing that basically,
my forearm was in a knot. And that's when I knew something was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg underwent an MRI Thursday and was examined by team
orthopedist Joe Chandler again Friday morning before the diagnosis
was confirmed.

AT NATO EVENT, ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER CALLS FOR JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ROME _ Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, in Poland to mark the
expansion of NATO, warned Friday that Italy may someday want to
make some other changes to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we demand that justice be done,'' D'Alema said. If not, he
said, Italy might have to reconsider some aspects of a 1951 NATO
agreement. D'Alema, like the rest of Italy, was outraged by the
acquittal of the U.S. pilot who flew into a ski lift cable in
Northern Italy last year, killing 20 people. Under NATO rules, the
United States had jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating at the NATO gathering what he had told President
Clinton and the Italian Parliament, D'Alema said that he expected
the United States to find those who were responsible for the
disaster. If not, the prime minister said that Italy might have to
reconsider how jurisdiction is awarded in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that D'Alema, a former Communist who has
consistently defended the presence of U.S. troops at NATO bases in
Italy, has any intention of altering Italy's commitment to the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But since the verdict came out at Camp Lejeune, he has
repeatedly said that if no culprit is ever found, then Italy may
try to reopen negotiation of the 1951 multilateral treaty that
allows governments to claim jurisdiction over cases in which their
soldiers are accused of a crime while serving overseas. But he has
been careful to say he does not want to scrap that provision,
merely adapt it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Italy has also availed itself of that agreement,
most notably in 1988, when an Italian stunt plane crashed at an air
show at Ramstein, a U.S. air base in Germany, killing 70 people.
The squadron commander and pilots were tried in Italy, and
acquitted in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that while the principles of jurisdiction as
they are formulated in those accords remain firm,'' D'Alema told
the Italian Parliament on Wednesday, ``it is possible, first, that
in practice, the accord will be applied only in exceptional cases.
And second, when the jurisdiction is carried out by the country
that claims it, then there should be guarantees for the country in
which the alleged crimes took place, including the possibility of
filing a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say it is unlikely that the 16 NATO countries that
signed the agreement in London in 1951 would all agree to alter it,
and that may not be D'Alema's real goal. His comments are mostly
aimed at appeasing domestic public opinion, which remains
infuriated by the acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   They are also part of a campaign to pressure the United States
to keep investigating the accident. And they are also intended as a
warning to the U.S. military to take seriously its pledge to
cooperate fully with Italy in improving safety at U.S. bases here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, D'Alema turned over to Italian prosecutors two
bilateral agreements that had previously been classified. Both deal
with the rules governing the presence of U.S. forces and the use of
installations.
</P>
<P>
   One is a 1954 accord, and the other a 1995 memorandum of
understanding, that says, among other things, ``planning and
execution of all training and operational activity will be in
respect of civil and military regulations of the host nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents were requested by military prosecutors in Padua,
who are investigating whether to bring charges against Col. Orfeo
Durignon, the Italian commander of the Aviano base, for failing to
ensure that proper procedure was followed there.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that Durignon will be given a court
martial in Italy. Civil prosecutors in Trento had already decided
against bringing him to trial on involuntary homicide charges.
</P>
<P>
   The chief military prosecutor in Padua, Maurizio Block, said
Friday that the Italian military was unlikely to put Durignon on
trial. ``All the documents and testimony we have seen so far in our
investigation suggest that his authority at the base was empty,''
Block said. ``He had some formal responsibility, but in reality, he
did not have the power to say no.''

   Wide Yield Premiums For Less-Risky Bradys &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's natural enough that Latin American government bonds trade
at prices that translate into double-digit yields these days: With
turmoil in Brazil's finances and lingering worries that it will
spread, Latin bonds summon up ``risky'' in many a mind the way Tito
Puente does salsa. Investors demand high yields to compensate for
high currency and credit risk.
</P>
<P>
   It's less obvious why yields should now be so high on
collateralized Brady bonds. Though issued by Latin American
governments, these bonds are denominated in dollars, and repayment
of all or part of the principal (though not interest) is
effectively guaranteed by the United States Treasury. Yet the yield
spreads between these Bradys and comparable Treasuries are now
temptingly wide.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gray, head of emerging-markets debt research at Rogge
Global Partners of London, points to one example of a Brady,
Mexican par bonds due in 2019, which were trading last week at
around 77 cents per dollar of face value, giving them a yield of
8.6 percent. That is more than 3 percentage points more than
Treasuries of the same maturity, which finished the week yielding
5.4 percent. Some similar Brazilian par bonds due in 2024 traded at
about 57 cents on the dollar, yielding 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For yield-hungry investors, though, a caveat: Not all Bradys are
collateralized, and those that are may be only partly covered. On
those Brazilian pars, for instance, 28 cents on the dollar is
guaranteed, reckons Umran Demimirors of the Templeton Emerging Debt
fund. And the big denominations of Bradys, usually $250,000 or
more, put them beyond the reach of many individual investors. &QL;

   Fidelity Opts Out Of New S&AMP;P Rankings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You might expect mutual fund managers to jump at the prospect of
inclusion in Standard &AMP; Poor's new select list of top funds. S&AMP;P, a
unit of McGraw-Hill, wants to grab some of the market for fund
ratings and data now dominated by Lipper Inc. and Morningstar Inc.
by publishing regular lists of the top 10 percent or so of funds in
more than 15 style categories.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for any Fidelity Investments funds in the lists
anytime soon, even though the Fidelity family has been performing
well lately. Fidelity objects to an S&AMP;P requirement that it
disclose its portfolio holdings quarterly, instead of twice a year
as the Securities and Exchange Commission requires.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P starts by using three-year performance results, accounting
for risk, to find roughly the top one-third of funds. Then it
reviews holdings and conducts interviews with portfolio managers to
assess each fund's clarity and consistency of philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot get that from performance data,'' said Philip
Edwards, a managing director in S&AMP;P Ratings Services' Managed Funds
unit. ``You only get that from talking'' to fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   The first list, of the 24 best large-cap growth funds, includes
big names like Janus Growth and Income and Putnam Investors, and
smaller funds like Accessor Growth Portfolio, Alleghany Chicago
Trust Growth and Income and Papp America Abroad. A small-cap growth
list is due in April, and mid-cap growth in May.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the S&AMP;P ratings are available free on the World Wide
Web, at www.standardandpoors.com/onfunds. Eventually, S&AMP;P hopes to
make money from subscriptions and reprint fees. &QL;

   Among Stock Funds, Small is Beautiful &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While bigger has certainly been better lately when it comes to
stocks, that's apparently not true of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Research Corp. of Boston studied the past decade
and found that the smallest domestic stock funds _ meaning those
with the fewest total assets, not those that invest in the smallest
stocks _ were the funds that most often outperformed the average
for their categories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, funds in the bottom fourt, ranked by total assets,
beat their category averages for the quarter seven times out of
eight, the study found, and had annual returns one percentage point
higher than the average. (The study's author concedes that these
figures are inflated a bit because poorly performing small funds
tend to shut down and disappear from the statistics.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest quarter of funds beat their category averages just
48 percent of the time, even though many, by dint of how much money
they attracted, were investors' favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larger funds that had enjoyed periods of outperformance saw
their returns revert to the mean as assets continued to balloon,''
Financial Research reported. ``Clearly, the investment flexibility
or `nimbleness' enjoyed by smaller funds provides a significant
performance advantage.''

   When Downsizing Moves Up the Ladder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lowest jobless rate since the Nixon administration isn't
translating into job security in American executive suites.
Corporate cost-cutters are increasingly aiming at the
well-compensated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an outplacement firm
based in Chicago, managers who lost their jobs to downsizing in the
final quarter of 1998 had a median salary of of $92,000, up 18
percent from $78,000 in the third quarter and the highest since the
firm started keeping track in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The high pay that made them targets also made it harder for them
to find new jobs: the median search time rose to 3 months, from 2.6
months.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate survey, covering the overall work force, just 2
percent of job holders expect to be dismissed because of downsizing
or other reasons this year, according to Lee Hecht Harrison, an
outplacement firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. ``While there is every
indication that companies will continue to downsize,'' said
Bernadette Kenny, chief operating officer, ``most people feel it
isn't going to happen to them.''

   Giving in North Carolina &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having succeeded in business, particularly in high technology,
entrepreneurs have been teaming up to form ``giving circles,''
supporting local charities by pooling dollars and expertise. Such
groups are already operating in Seattle and Silicon Valley, but a
new one is starting in the Research Triangle of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Warner, who sold his software company, the Atwork Corp.
of Chapel Hill, for $240 million in 1995, and Fred Hutchison, a
lawyer for local entrepreneurs, are forming a new givers' group,
not yet named. ``With entrepreneurs, what we are getting is not
just dollars but tremendous brainpower, and that has the likelihood
of changing the face of our communities,'' said Shannon St. John,
executive director of the Triangle Community Foundation, which
through its Catalyst Project is helping to organize the group.

   I live in a secondhand house, wear secondhand clothes and eat

money for charitable donations, wonderful vacations and summer
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Without the need to fret about $75 jeans and $300 blazers ($3
and $6, respectively, and in perfect condition at my local thrift
shop), I've had the luxury of working only part time, and my
husband has been able to pursue a management career with a
nonprofit organization instead of practicing law. Yet we've been
able to maintain a comfortable, middle-class life style.
</P>
<P>
   I have my mother to thank for instilling these pecuniary skills
and values in me. She finds enlightenment and treasures by sorting
through other people's discarded artifacts. Once, her remarkable
skills brought her a 14-karat gold panther-link bracelet _ for only
25 cents at a tag sale.
</P>
<P>
   Mom wasn't able, though, to teach me the value of keeping quiet
about my own shopping victories. She still shudders every time I
crow about some bargain I picked up at a yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why tell anyone?'' she'll ask. ``Then, when you do buy
something new, they'll think you only spent a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I've tried to refrain from telling my friends how little
I paid for something they admire, but the temptation to revel _ my
own form of reverse snobbism _ is too hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Like my mother, I've never understood the fascination with
newness. I've always believed that if I buy something for a scant
percent of what it cost originally, not only am I recycling but I
am also changing the psychic equation that makes us enjoy something
in proportion to what we pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If a new jacket sets me back $300, I surely want to get $300 of
use and pleasure from it; if I pay only $3 for the same _ albeit
slightly used _ jacket, the joy-to-dollar ratio will be much
greater. And if I decide I don't like the jacket, at least I know
my mistake is inexpensive; I can simply give the item away with few
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   I'm grateful that my children don't care if their Gap clothes
come from the Gap store or from the sale at the church down the
street _ or, for that matter, whether they bear the Gap brand at
all.
</P>
<P>
   By now, they're indoctrinated; they rarely think of doing what
most people would call normal shopping. And they understand the
value of a dollar, not to mention a mother whose schedule allows
her to be home to ask them how their day was.
</P>
<P>
   I'm aware that many people may cringe at the very thought of
using certain personal items that are secondhand. But I like to
remind these folks that if they have ever spent a night in a hotel,
they have slept on secondhand sheets and have dried themselves with
secondhand bath towels. And if they have ever been to a restaurant,
they have surely eaten with forks and spoons that have touched the
lips of countless other people.
</P>
<P>
   So let's face it: There is no genius or superiority in buying
retail. I must acknowledge, however, that I've been enticed lately
by those dollar-discount and odd-lot stores, discovering the joys
of almost-out-of-date spices, candy and juice _ not to mention
remaindered books, candles and children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   Secondhand or cut-rate does not mean inferior. A secondhand pair
of jeans never needs to be prefaded, and secondhand furniture is
imperfect enough to allow you to neglect it.
</P>
<P>
   And secondhand husbands are especially good at making pancakes. &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea, as always, is to buy low and sell high _ but that
doesn't mean that William V. Fries looks only at stocks with tiny
price-to-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
   A low ratio can sway him, of course, but Fries, who runs the
$297.4 million Thornburg Value fund, has a more elastic definition
of ``value'' than many of his peers. And investors tend to take
notice: Thornburg Value had an annual average return of 29.7
percent in the three years through March 5, compared with 28.5
percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, placing it in
the top 2 percent of mid-cap value funds, according to Morningstar
Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The fund returned 14.2 percent in the 12 months through March 5,
below the 22.6 percent of the S&AMP;P but still in the top 4 percent of
its peer group.
</P>
<P>
   Thornburg Value has achieved such performance in part by
thinking small _ in portfolio size. The fund holds just 42 stocks,
compared with 111 in the average value fund, according to
Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Fries, who is 60, favors three broad categories of stocks: the
basic-value companies that are the bread and butter of his trade,
but also what he calls ``consistent growers'' and ``emerging
franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   He chooses basic-value stocks _ which account for 56 percent of
the fund's assets _ by using traditional yardsticks like low
price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios and high dividend
yields. For these stocks, which tend to be clustered in the
financial services, energy and telecommunications industries, he
aims to pay no more than two-thirds of the market multiple _ the
average price-to-earnings ratio of all S&AMP;P 500 stocks _ or about
22, lately.
</P>
<P>
   The consistent growers, including pharmaceutical and consumer
products companies, are 20 percent of the fund. ``Typically these
companies will be less cyclical or have more reliable top-line
earnings growth,'' said Fries, who is willing to pay the market
multiple for them.
</P>
<P>
   He is willing to pay a premium, however, for his emerging
franchises _ generally fast-growing companies that are not yet
well-established in new or changing industries. ``These stocks are
a lot more risky and tend to grow much faster,'' he said in a phone
interview from his office in Santa Fe, N.M. For these companies in
the portfolio, he projects average earnings growth of at least 15
percent to 20 percent. (Emerging franchises account for 17 percent
of the fund; most of the remainder is in cash.)
</P>
<P>
   Fries sets a target selling price for each stock in his
portfolio and veers from it only if the outlook for the company
shifts significantly. For example, he has raised his target price
for Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. _ he won't specify how much _ because it
has become a big force in Internet stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Most value-fund managers favor stocks with P/E ratios in the
single or low double digits, but Fries can scour for bargains at
much higher elevations. ``We have a couple of positions in
companies that haven't produced much in the way of earnings, like
semiconductor manufacturers, and that drives up the P/E,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks account for more than 20 percent of the
portfolio _ unusually high for a value fund. But he said prices
were so cheap for some of these stocks last summer that he couldn't
resist buying shares of Intel, Brooks Automation and Lam Research. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite basic-value stocks is El Paso Energy, a
natural-gas company. Because of the company's extensive holdings
overseas, the stock weakened last fall, when Fries began buying
shares at $25 each. It closed on Friday at $35.75, or 17 times his
1999 earnings estimate of $2.10 a share. He predicted a three-year
earnings growth rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fries also sees big potential in American Home Products, a
pharmaceutical company in which some other investors see mostly a
dearth of blockbuster drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very good at making acquisitions, taking the costs
out and boosting the revenues of acquired products,'' he said. He
began buying the stock at $49 last June and projects a three-year
earnings growth rate of 12 to 15 percent. It now trades at $65.375,
about 33 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $2.
</P>
<P>
   In the emerging-franchise category, Fries likes Advent Software,
which produces software used by investment advisers to track,
report and reconcile stock trades. In his view, Advent's software
is the most popular and economical on the market. Given the aging
of America and all those retirement nest eggs to be managed, he
projects that Advent's earnings will climb 20 percent to 30 percent
a year, on average, over three years.
</P>
<P>
   He began buying Advent shares in November 1997 at $24 and
recently added to his holdings. The stock now is at $48.875, or
31.5 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $1.55.

GERMAN MARKETS SOAR FOLLOWING DEPARTURE OF FINANCE MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also GERMANY-EICHL) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ One day after the abrupt resignation of
Germany's most powerful left-wing political boss, German financial
markets soared in euphoria Friday while Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder struggled to keep his five-month-old government from
melting down.
</P>
<P>
   The German stock market surged 5.4 percent in a torrent of
trading as investors concluded that the departure of Oskar
Lafontaine, the finance minister, meant that Schroeder would be
forced to dilute or even abandon plans to raise taxes on business,
shut down nuclear plants and increase regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders jubilantly announced that a new era was at hand
and that Schroeder's entire agenda was suddenly up for grabs. The
stock prices for insurance companies and electric utilities, which
would have been threatened with enormous tax increases, jumped more
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the happiest day of my professional life,'' said Hans
Schreiber, chief executive of the insurance company Mannheimer AG
and head of Germany's federation of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly calm, Schroeder moved quickly to fill the gap left
after Lafontaine, who was both his ally and rival, abruptly quit
both his post as finance minister and his chairmanship of
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   To replace the bombastic Lafontaine at the powerful Finance
Ministry, Schroeder named Hans Eichel, a relatively colorless
Social Democrat who is the lame-duck prime minister of the state of
Hesse, where Social Democrats were trounced in local elections
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder then put himself in charge of the Social Democratic
Party, a move that gives him control of both the government and the
powerful machinery of the political party. Until Friday, the
comparatively pragmatic chancellor had been locked in an uneasy
dependence on Lafontaine's organizational strength in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the sense of chaos and shock was pervasive in both the
Social Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the
environmental Green Party. And political experts said it was far
from clear that Schroeder could repair the damage to his party.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine himself remained silent, staying behind the shuttered
windows of his house in the city of Saarbruecken near the French
border. An outspoken and ideologically passionate left-wing
traditionalist who had enraged central bankers with blustery
demands for lower interest rates, Lafontaine handed in a
one-sentence resignation on Thursday and has offered no hint about
his motive for resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Uwe-Karsten Heye, Schroeder's spokesman, said the chancellor had
been unable to reach Lafontaine on the telephone. Chancery
officials said Schroeder was as surprised and mystified as anybody
by Lafontaine's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an event that is hard to come to terms with,'' said Otto
Schily, the interior minister and a longtime friend of
Lafontaine's. ``It would be valuable to know what led him to this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt Friday that Schroeder would amend some of his
biggest projects. His tax reform plan, drawn up by Lafontaine,
would have added billions of marks in extra taxes on corporations
while giving a slew of new breaks to lower- and middle-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has drawn enormous criticism from industry as well as
from Germany's most respected independent economists. In their
view, the plan did little to reduce Germany's overall tax burden,
which consumes about half the country's entire economic output.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Corporate executives were furious at the prospect of huge new
burdens without much offsetting relief. Insurance companies would
be particularly hard-hit, because of a provision that would have
required them to pay taxes on vast sums of reserves that had been
shielded from tax liability under current law. Electric utilities
would have been forced to pay heavy taxes on money set aside for
shutting down nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, insurance and electric utility stocks were the
biggest winners in an extraordinary day. Shares of Allianz, the
giant Munich-based insurance carrier, went up 15 percent. Munich
Re, the big re-insurance conglomerate, jumped more than 10 percent.
Conglomerates with big electric utilities like RWE and Viag AG rose
nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't get carried away, but the euphoria is to a large
extent justified,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Warburg
Dillion Read in Frankfurt. ``A major barrier to corporate profits
has left today.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger question was whether Schroeder and his ``red
green'' political coalition would be able to regain its balance or
even survive in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, a self-styled pragmatist who is a master at
projecting charisma on television, remains personally popular. But
the nature of power in Germany requires control of the major
political parties, and it was the much more left-wing Lafontaine
who could muster discipline on that level.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a struggling coal-mining area near the French
border, Lafontaine had long been Schroeder's rival in seeking the
Social Democratic nomination for chancellor. But he played a
crucial role in organizing Schroeder's support among unions and
party traditionalists, and he had ambitions of becoming tantamount
to a vice chancellor in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine's departure gives Schroeder much more free rein. But
political experts said Schroeder faced brutal problems ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schroeder may have been the winner, but this was no victory,''
said Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at Dresden University of
Technology. ``I believe Schroeder is in a more difficult position
now than before. Schroeder has been the darling of the mass media,
and Lafontaine has been the darling of the Social Democratic Party.
But in Germany, politics is based on political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   An equally serious problem lies with the chancellor's coalition
partners in the Green Party. Even before Friday, the Greens had
capitulated on all their top priorities, from much higher fuel
taxes to much more rapid closing of nuclear plants, in order to be
part of a governing coalition. But rank-and-file members had
already become depressed and disillusioned, and many political
experts wondered Friday whether the Greens would be willing to
concede even more to industrial interests.

 &HT;    Internet security isn't a dream
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Think somebody's watching you?
</P>
<P>
   You're not just being paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, despite its cryptic user names, anonymous e-mail
accounts and extensive use of passwords, is still very much a
wide-open prairie in which everything you do _ from Web browsing to
buying _ is subject to somebody else's prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When you are on the Web, you are vulnerable. If somebody sets
their mind to it, they can steal your credit card information,
usurp your identity or just monitor your frequent visits to
furby-fetish.com.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the technology that keeps snoops out of
your business and keeps your private information private is
improving, and within a few years, an infrastructure and set of
tools will be in place that will make it much harder to break into
a person's virtual life.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s recent inclusion of security ID features on its
Pentium III and some Pentium II processors generated protests from
groups concerned about privacy. Intel says the feature is meant to
make electronic commerce more secure, but privacy advocates say the
chip allows Intel to monitor people's Internet use and habits _ a
violation of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The protests show that privacy and security are big concerns to
both users and to companies as use of the Internet becomes more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thompson, an independent security analyst working in
Austin, says security that protects privacy and transactions is
better than a lot of people think. And it keeps getting better.
Thompson, who's advised IBM Corp. and Intel on security, says he's
optimistic that security enhancements will become invisible parts
of communication and transaction software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty close,'' Thompson said. ``A lot of
security concerns are being addressed (by software makers) and
biometrics and voice recognition are going to revolutionize
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Biometric readers _ which would identify a user through
fingerprints, a retina scan or a facial scan _ would be many times
more secure than a password or PIN-code based transaction system.
</P>
<P>
   And voice-recognition passwords, which would identify a user by
the unique characteristics of their voice pattern, would also
tighten up security and could be simply implemented through a
microphone and the right software.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said these methods of identification will speed along
Internet commerce, allowing transactions of up to billions of
dollars at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Other privacy concerns _ unsolicited e-mail and unwanted
snooping of a user's information _ may also become things of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Software that filters unwanted e-mail is becoming increasingly
sophisticated as is security on basic Web browsing and online
buying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, using a credit card on the Internet on a secured,
encrypted connection is one of the safest things you can do on the
Net. Giving a credit card number on the Net, Internet experts such
as Thompson say, is safer than giving up your credit card for
billing at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds a little too bright and trouble-free, it may
be. As home networking _ hooking up multiple computers through a
single high-speed Internet connection in the home _ grows, home
users will have to use some of the same security measures used by
large companies such as Dell Computer Corp. today.
</P>
<P>
   Firewalls, which allow information to come into a local network,
but block access from the outside, will have to be implemented if
home users want to keep their data private. But users will have
greater options about what content comes through their network
connection and what information they want to make available.
</P>
<P>
   As more of our daily lives _ the things we buy and the
information we use _ originate online, it'll be more important than
ever to guard our information vigilantly as the tools to do it
become available.

 &HT;    Author of `Burn Rate' started a firestorm
 &HT;    By Tim Green
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wolff
</P>
<P>
   Who: Author of `Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on
the Internet'
</P>
<P>
   What: Keynote speaker at South By Southwest Interactive
</P>
<P>
   When: 10 a.m. Monday
</P>
<P>
   Where: Austin Convention Center
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wolff tried to get an Internet business going way back
in the early years of the World Wide Web. It was 1996, and he was
in a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about his adventures in dealing with venture
capitalists, media barons, old and new, and other Internet gold
seekers in a book, ``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn rate is the term for how much money a startup goes through
in excess of its income. It seems to be the hallmark of an Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wolff is a journalist who writes about the Internet for
New York magazine and The Industry Standard. He'll be in Austin on
Monday as a keynote speaker at the South by Southwest Interactive
Festival. He'll also part of a panel on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin American-Statesman spoke with Wolff last week. Here
is an edited transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the gold rush years on the Internet over?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are very much still going on. The gold is just
apparently pouring out of those hills.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The people you dealt with didn't seem to have a good idea of
why they wanted to be on the Net or what to do there. They just
thought that's where they should be.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a very fair statement. The same thing still holds
true. People still haven't figured out where it's going, but they
are still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why can't anyone grab hold of the Net and what's going on
there?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are in this period where every nine months everything
changes. Every phase of this business from online services to push
technology to whatever is the flavor of the moment. Now it's
e-commerce. That will change.
</P>
<P>
   No model, no real business solution has lasted more than nine
months. The more logical way to look at that is that e-commerce
will peter out in a given number of months. To be replaced by
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, how do you make money on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know the answer to that. No one knows the answer to
that. This is the major question. What are the benefits of the
Internet? How do you protect, at the very least, your downside?
That we can't even begin to imagine how big the upside will be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you write the book?
</P>
<P>
   A: This book was for me very much two things. I wanted to tell a
story that was very compelling and that a lot of people were
experiencing. I also wrote the book because these guys that I dealt
with were bums. They deserved the harsh light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was their reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The people I wrote about were furious. It was beyond fury;
they were murderous. It never really occurred to most of the people
in the book that someone would really set down the conversations
they had in business meetings. It just had never happened to them.
Maybe it had never happened to anyone before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you feel reliving all that as you wrote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For one thing, I guess I was taken about how funny this was.
When I was going through it, it didn't seem funny. It was all
extraordinarily painful. In hindsight, though, it was pretty funny.
No one knew what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will your keynote be about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The experiences I recount in the book. About writing the
book. About what it's like to really record a piece of this very
odd history that we've all been experiencing. And I'll make some
predictions about what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the predictions I've been making recently is that
there will be a time when the Internet goes away. It really becomes
transparent. It is part of every business. Every transaction and
part of all aspects of everybody's life. Therefore we don't notice
it anymore. Amazon.com becomes part of the books business. AOL
becomes part of the media.

JUDGE SAYS FLORIDA UTILITY CAN'T BACK OUT OF MAINE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in New York has ruled that a Florida utility
can't renege on its $845 million deal to purchase Central Maine
Power Co.'s generating facilities, a decision that is expected to
lower the electric bills of Central Maine's customers by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   FPLEnergy Inc., a subsidiary of FPL Group Inc., which is both
Florida's largest utility and an investor in independent power
projects in other states, attempted to cancel the Central Maine
Power contract 10 months after it was signed in January 1998,
citing changes in federal regulatory policies for connecting new
power plants to the electric grid in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, US District Court Judge John Martin Jr.
rejected FPL's argument. His decision is expected to put Maine back
on track to launch statewide electricity deregulation next March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the court's ruling,'' said Michael
Yackira, president of FPL Energy. ``However, we accept the court's
decision and we will proceed accordingly.'' The acquisition is
scheduled to be completed April 7.
</P>
<P>
   FPL's lead attorney in the case was David Boies, the key lawyer
for the Justice Department in its ongoing antitrust case against
Microsoft Corp. Boies argued that revised regulatory rules for
connecting new electric generation facilities to the electric grid
in New England might be very costly and were unforeseen when the
Florida utility won a competitive bid.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, after two hours of oral arguments, ruled that the
contract FPL signed contained no guarantees on transmission
policies, and that FPL participated in the bidding with the full
knowledge that utility rules were changing.
</P>
<P>
   David T. Flanagan, president of Central Maine Power, called the
decision ``a victory for Maine consumers.'' Central Maine Power is
the state's largest electric utility with 530,000 customers in
central and southern Maine. The utility's case was strongly
supported with friend-of-the-court briefs from the Maine Public
Utilities Commission and the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities around New England, including New England Electric
System and BEC Energy Inc., the parent company of Boston Edison,
have sold their nonnuclear electric generating assets at
higher-than-expected prices. But the $845 million FPL offered for
Central Maine's four power plants and 27 hydroelectric stations was
well above the $550 million bid some industry observers expected.
</P>
<P>
   FPL was anxious to gain a foothold in New England as part of its
expansion plans to own and operate independent power plants. The
Florida utility's pursuit of Central Maine Power's generation
facilities followed an unsuccessful bid to acquire New England
Electric System's extensive fossil fuel and hydroelectric
facilities. FPL lost out to PG&AMP;E Corp., which bid $1.6 billion for
New England Electric's plants.

MEET THE X-FACTOR TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is supposed to be nothing more than the Duke Invitational,
is it not?
</P>
<P>
   It's Duke this, and Duke that. Mike Krzyzewski's Blue Devils are
being compared to the greatest teams of recent times, and it's a
given that they will be in the Final Four. They are heading for a
coronation in St. Petersburg, Fla., while everyone else is simply
praying to get into the Final Four, where, God-willing, they will
have the honor of losing to Duke. The word ``invincible'' is even
being tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is good, real, real, real good. But it is not invincible,
and we've got a team right here in our torn-up town to prove it.
Duke is (itals)32 and 1(unitals), and the 1 was administered by the
University of Cincinnati Bearcats back on Nov. 28 in the finals of
the Great Alaska Shootout. Those would be the same Bearcats who
will be playing Temple in the second round of the tournament Sunday
at the Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game tells everyone else that we are capable of beating
anyone,'' argues Cincinnati senior Melvin Levett, who had 11 points
during his team's perfunctory dispatch of terrified George Mason
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Huggins also believes his team can beat anyone _ if.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat anyone if we make shots,'' explains the
controversial Cincinnati mentor. ``If we can make open shots, we
can beat anybody. We have good shooters on certain days.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even days when Cincinnati can win without making a
single outside shot, and this was one of them. The Colonial
Athletic Association champs were helpless against the combination
of Cincinnati's inside and transition prowess. The Bearcats had 25
field goals, and 17 of them came on layups or dunks.
</P>
<P>
   But George Mason was seeded 14th for a reason. One of these days
the Bearcats will have to demonstrate some outside shooting
proficiency against a very good team. Huggins would not like to bet
his weekly paycheck on that happening.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, his reaction to a postgame inquiry as to
``what was wrong,'' when, over 10 minutes into the game, his
third-seeded squad was only ahead, 15-11. ``Sometimes that is our
game,'' he shrugged. ``Sometimes we have a hard time scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   This team adheres to the basics of what we have come to know as
a typical Huggins aggregation. Cincinnati is loaded with aggressive
athletes. There is no seeming end to the size, quickness, leaping
ability, and just plain on-court meanness of a team that knows
there are many folks out there who don't like them, and which
embraces the role of National Villain.
</P>
<P>
   To be blunt, Coach Hug ain't no Huggy Bear. He routinely
recruits kids who make people nervous. He works the Juco trail as
well as anyone, and there are still people around who are blatantly
hostile to those kids. He'll take a shaky transfer or two. He
seldom has a player graduate, and so he is viewed as the
anti-Christ by another set of breast-beaters. In case he hasn't
done anything else to aggravate people, he has now taken to wearing
black on black. Oh, and let's not forget that quasi-Fonz hairdo.
Just another reason to hate Coach Hug.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. He can, as Dicky V would say, flat-out coach.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 10th year at Cincinnati, Bob Huggins is 246-80.
Overall, he is 415-153, and, at age 45, is on target to win
700-plus if he so chooses. He also wins with an identifiable style.
Year-in and year-out, no team routinely plays any harder in general
or is more ferocious on defense. He almost always has a fleet of
guys from 6 feet 5 inches to 6-9 who snack on glass while making
the other guys routinely enjoy the taste of leather.
</P>
<P>
   Once Cincinnati made a few mental adjustments, George Mason
simply had no chance in this game. The Patriots shot an execrable 5
for 31 in the first half, leading to a 41-17 state of affairs.
George Mason center George Evans, the CAA Player of the Year, went
for the ultra-bagel. He was 0 for 6 from the floor. ``We can really
guard the post,'' declares Huggins.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rebounding . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Their major strength is rebounding,'' said George Mason coach
Jim Larranaga, ``and they were able to flex their muscles against
us. They had 37 rebounds in the first half, and that's as many as
our opponents usually get in a game. We could not keep them off the
boards, and they knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cincinnati was good enough to beat Duke (77-75, on a
buzzer-beating hook-and-ladder long pass play leading to a Levett
dunk), why is it only a No. 3 seed? Is that your question?
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple answer. The Bearcats lost some games they had
no business losing. A February three-game losing streak tarnished
their image, but they were still in the running for a No. 1 seed
until they lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in the semifinals of
the Conference USA tournament. Let the record show that in their
five losses, Cincinnati shot a combined 40 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   So we are back in the intellectual clutches of Coach Huggins,
who says no one needs an advanced course in Hoopology in order to
figure out the '98-99 Bearcats. ``We (itals)can(unitals) beat
anyone,'' he reminds us. ``In the 10 years I've been at Cincinnati,
this is one of the better half-court defensive teams I've had.
We've had better pressing teams, but not many as good in the
halfcourt. I know we're going to defend, and I know we're going to
rebound. What I don't know is if we're going to make shots.''
</P>
<P>
   They shot 57 percent at UNLV, and won by 13. They shot 58
percent at Louisville and beat them by 26. On that long ago night
in Anchorage, they shot 57 percent from the floor and the Duke Blue
Devils came tumbling down. Seeds be damned. This is the scariest
X-factor team in the entire tournament.

VINATIERI GETS $2 MILLION, 3-YEAR DEAL FROM PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In what has been a rather grim offseason,
the Patriots finally got some good news Friday when kicker Adam
Vinatieri, a restricted free agent, said he would return to the
team, agreeing to a three-year contract worth more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest goal was to remain with the Patriots,'' said
Vinatieri. ``When I hired my agent (Neil Cornrich) I told him that
was my first preference and Neil acted accordingly. I'm glad things
worked out. There might have been other opportunities to earn more
elsewhere, but I'm happy with my deal and happy to remain here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri had been wooed by the Cleveland Browns, who made a
verbal offer of $2.5 million over three years. The New York Jets
also expressed interest but didn't make an offer, and the Browns
never raised their initial offer.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said he wasn't bothered by the Patriots bringing in
veteran kicker Norm Johnson for a visit Thursday. ``I understood
the reasons they brought Norm in,'' he said. ``Obviously, they had
to have a backup plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri had a career-high 127 points last season, hitting 31
of 39 field goals for a 79 percent success rate. For his career,
Vinatieri is 83 for 103 (80.1 percent). He was voted AFC special
teams player of the week twice and special teams player of the
month in October.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri's one shortcoming, however, is kicking off. He had
only six touchbacks last season and will be pressed by new punter
Lee Johnson, signed as a free agent, for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to (new special teams coach) Brad Seely and I told him
I'd be in agreement with whatever is best for the team,'' said
Vinatieri. ``Lee and I will compete for it in training camp. Brad
didn't rule out the possibility of using both of us. I'd love to be
the kickoff guy again.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said lengthening his kickoffs is his major goal in the
offseason. He plans to look at tapes he made with his former
kicking coach, Doug Blevins, who is now kicking coach with the
Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said he's looking forward to working with Seely, who,
like Vinatieri, went to South Dakota State. ``I admire Brad
tremendously,'' said Vinatieri. ``(Former Patriots special teams
coach) Dante (Scarnecchia) spoke highly of him even last year. He's
definitely one of the best in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said he will miss punter Tom Tupa, one of his best
friends, who departed for the Jets. ``He's a great friend and he
did an unbelievable job here,'' said Vinatieri. ``But I think Lee
will fill those shoes nicely. He's an experienced punter who should
add a lot to us.''

SADLER MAY FIT IN AT SECOND FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Could lightning strike twice for Donnie
Sadler? Don't bet against him being the Red Sox starter at second
base for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Sadler, 23, has performed so well this spring that
he has pulled away from the competition, which includes Jeff Frye
and Lou Merloni. And don't forget Jose Offerman, the much talked
about free agent signee who started 152 games for Kansas City, all
at second base, and had his finest year in the majors last season.
</P>
<P>
   But all things being equal, Sadler would seem to have as good a
chance as anyone. Frye, who missed all of last season with a knee
injury, has a pulled rib muscle and has missed all nine exhibition
games this spring. Merloni suffered a knee injury last June and
must prove he is ready. Offerman's role remains the great unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to play second?'' Williams said before Friday
night's game against the Phillies. ``Where does Sadler fit in with
us? I really can't say. We'll figure this out between now and the
end of spring training. But I'd love to see him out there. I really
would.''
</P>
<P>
   One area in which Sadler is way ahead of the pack is speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hitter can go out and learn to hit home runs,'' said
Williams. ``But you can't teach speed. Either you have it or not.
Sadler is invaluable because he can do so many things. He can run.
He has arm strength. He has a shortstop's arm. But there is no
substitute for speed. So far, we've exposed him to three different
positions. Second, third, and short. He's shown us that he's a
gamer with good skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler has been on the Red Sox horizon since 1996, his third
year in pro ball. He is a natural shortstop but with Nomar
Garciaparra around, there is no future at that position in Boston.
In 1996, Sadler was asked to play 28 games in center field at
Double A Trenton, where he hit .267. The following year at
Pawtucket, he took a step back, hitting just .212. He struck out
121 times in 121 games and seemingly lost his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But the confidence was restored in 1998. With Frye out of the
picture, the Sox signed free agent Mark Lemke just before the end
of spring training. But Lemke wasn't ready when the season opened,
so the Sox broke camp with Sadler as their starting second baseman.
After six games, however, he was sent to Pawtucket, where he still
hit only .221. Even so, his strikeouts were down and he was playing
with more confidence. In May, Lemke suffered a concussion and
Sadler was recalled. He played in 61 games, gaining valuable
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turned out, I got to play quite a bit last year,'' said
Sadler. ``I was surprised that (Williams) was still putting me in
there during the stretch in the wild-card race. Jimy showed a great
deal of confidence in me. The experience I got there helped me out
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being there, I was able to get an idea of what being in the
big leagues was all about. Coming into last year, I knew it was a
place that I wanted to be but I didn't have any experience. To be
out there with Mo, Valentin, Nomar was fun. So was playing against
guys like Ripken, Belle, Thomas, and the Alomars. It helped me a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he is confident Sadler, who hit .226 with Boston,
will come around at the plate. Sadler agrees that it's only a
matter of time and hard work. There are no short cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, I need to be more consistent at the plate and
put the ball on the ground and utilize my speed,'' said Sadler. ``I
have to get on base and score some runs ahead of the other guys.
Once I perfect that, I could project to be in the big leagues for
10 or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, including Sadler, is expecting miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got here quick, but I still don't feel that they pushed
me,'' he said, ``But I don't feel I was ever overmatched. The bad
year I had at Pawtucket was my fault. I was trying to do too much.
I went out there pressing instead of trying to play my game. I was
thinking if I hit .300 or tried to do this or that by the All-Star
break, I had a chance to be called up to the big leagues. It didn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second or short, it doesn't matter. I'm starting to get
comfortable, but I'm still learning the position.''

NEW GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER KNOWN AS CONCILIATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With GERMANY-ECON) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Germany's former finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, was a blustery, bumptious political boss who managed to
provoke outrage among bankers and business leaders almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   The man chosen Friday to replace him, Hans Eichel, is almost a
complete opposite. Eichel, 57, is a low-key seeker of consensus who
has spent eight years leading a Social Democrat government in a
state that includes Frankfurt, the biggest banking and financial
center in Germany. Eichel is prime minister of Hesse. But he is now
a lame-duck, after his party was defeated by the center-right
Christian Democratic Union in state elections several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was apparently attracted to
Eichel's experience in financial issues and his experience in
working with conservative bankers, who wield great power in Hesse.
Though far less known and far less charismatic than Lafontaine,
Eichel has won praise for his quiet ability to get things done _
valuable qualities in the wake of Lafontaine, a man that the
British tabloid The Sun has denounced as ``the most dangerous man
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichel was born in the town of Kassel, 90 miles northeast of
Frankfurt. He joined the Social Democratic party at age 23, while
he was studying philosophy and history. He campaigned against
nuclear proliferation and for environmental causes, and became
mayor of Kassel in 1975 at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   His politics have moderated since then. Eichel was considered a
business ally during the years he governed Hesse state, which has
the highest per-capita gross domestic product in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel lost the post in February when Christian Democrats won a
state election by capitalizing on concerns over the federal
government's plans to grant some foreigners double citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Although his position on Lafontaine's tax reform is unknown,
Eichel in practice promoted only minor changes in taxation.
</P>
<P>
   As finance minister, Eichel is unlikely to pose any policy
challenges to Schroeder or to pressure the European Central Bank to
lower interest rates, as his predecessor did. As the governor of
Hesse, he already has a working relationship with Wim Duisenberg,
the president of the European Central Bank, who was one of the
first to congratulate Schroeder on the choice of Eichel as finance
minister.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo Liberation Army leaders decided
Friday to accept a European-sponsored peace plan and directed the
leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation to sign the accord ahead
of peace talks that are planned to resume on Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in a village deep in rebel-controlled mountains in
central Kosovo, the guerrilla commanders and leaders of the
political directorate gathered to discuss the plan, which would
give ethnic Albanians self-rule and deploy NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the head of the delegation, Hashim Thaci,
confirmed that he had received approval to sign the pact, a source
close to the delegation said. Other members of the team have
expressed support for the plan. But it had not been clear how the
rebels would act.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci is expected to sign the pact over the weekend. The
delegation is scheduled to fly from Pristina to Paris on Saturday,
although Serbian arrest warrants issued last week for three
delegation members, including Thaci, could pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, 31, a former commander, slipped back into Kosovo three
days ago to be present at the meeting. Western mediators have been
pushing the rebels to accept the accord. But despite promises to do
so, they kept delaying the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the rebels said Thaci had a difficult time
convincing some hard-line commanders, who would have to accept
disarmament and forgo their aim of full independence.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia said he
firmly opposed foreign troops in Kosovo.

   Yehudi Menuhin, the legendary violinist who came to prominence
in his childhood as a virtuoso in velvet knee-pants and later
became a respected conductor, organizer of festivals and schools
and an idealistic supporter of hundreds of charities, died Friday
at Martin Luther Hospital in Berlin. He was 82 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   When Menuhin was at his best, his playing had a grandeur and
personal intensity that made his sound instantly recognizable, both
in the concert hall and on disk. He recorded prolifically,
beginning in 1928 when he was 12 and even after he stopped playing
the violin publicly, in the early 1990s, he continued to perform
and make recordings as a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Though an American by birth, Menuhin lived in Europe for most of
his life. He described himself as an internationalist, and in the
1950s, he contended that peace would be achieved only under a
single benign world government. After he accepted honorary Swiss
citizenship in 1970, tendered because of his services in founding
the Gstaad Festival, the State Department threatened to revoke his
American citizenship, but later relented. In 1985, Menuhin became a
British subject. He had been given an honorary knighthood by
Britain 19 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and visions of a utopian future often seemed to be as
much on Menuhin's mind as music-making. A devotee of yoga and
health food, he regularly warned against the dangers of white rice,
white bread, refined sugar and red meat, and advocated
vegetarianism. He spoke about the dangers of pollution long before
ecology was a chic topic of discussion. He championed inventions of
all sorts, including electric cars. He put forward his own notions
of city planning, including a vision of New York City with all
traffic moving underground.
</P>
<P>
   Musically too, his interests ranged widely. He performed and
recorded most of the standard classical repertory, and he gave the
premiere performances of Bartok's Unaccompanied Sonata, Bloch's
Suites 1 and 2, Walton's Violin Sonata and pieces by Georges
Enesco, Vaughan Williams, Lennox Berkeley and Paul Ben-Haim.
</P>
<P>
   He also recorded jazz albums with Stephane Grappelli, and, as an
early and eloquent Western advocate of Eastern music, he made a
series of ``East Meets West'' recordings with Indian musicians,
including Ravi Shankar, the sitarist, and Ali Akbar Khan, the sarod
virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in his career, personal and technical crises
forced Menuhin to stop playing. But as a child violinist in the
1920s Menuhin stunned listeners with his pure tone, virtuosic
technique and interpretive insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem ridiculous to say that he showed a mature
conception of Beethoven's concerto, but that is the fact,'' Olin
Downes wrote in The New York Times in November 1927, when Menuhin,
at age 11, made his first New York appearance as an orchestral
soloist, at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   By then, young Menuhin was famous. In 1924, when he was 8, he
played Beriot's ``Scene de Ballet'' with the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra. The next year, he was the subject of a silent-screen
newsreel that showed him alternately playing the violin and riding
on a swing.
</P>
<P>
   Yehudi Menuhin was born in New York on April 22, 1916. His
parents, Moshe and Marutha, were Russian-Jewish immigrants who had
met in Palestine in 1909, and married in New York in 1914. They
named their son Yehudi, which means ``Jew,'' after a landlord
showing them an apartment told them that a benefit of living in the
building was that there were no Jews in residence there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, the Menuhins moved to San Francisco, where Moshe
Menuhin, after a brief and unsuccessful attempt to run a farm near
Oakland, Calif., supported his family by teaching Hebrew. Menuhin
asked for a violin when he was 3, and was taken to Sigmund Anker, a
teacher who specialized in very young players. Four years later he
became a student of Louis Persinger, a renowned teacher and chamber
player.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's parents were wary of the prodigy syndrome, in which
musicians who were hailed as geniuses during childhood proved
unable to sustain the originality of their early performances into
adulthood. They limited their son's public appearances, and they
insisted that he and his two younger sisters _ Hephzibah and
Yaltah, both pianists _ undertake a rigorous course of home study.
Their father taught them math, history and Hebrew; their mother was
their French, German, Italian and Spanish tutor.
</P>
<P>
   During the Menuhins' visit to Europe in 1927, Menuhin played for
the great Belgian violinist Eugene Ysaye, who was astonished to
discover the extent to which Menuhin's technique was intuitive.
Although he could play difficult works like Lalo's ``Symphonie
Espagnole,'' he had bypassed the traditional technical exercises
and studies. When Ysaye asked him to play a three-octave arpeggio,
Menuhin didn't understand the request.
</P>
<P>
   On the same trip, Menuhin played for the violinist and composer
Georges Enescu, with whom he studied informally, both in Paris and
at Enescu's home in Romania. Menuhin also studied with Adolph
Busch.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin made debuts in Berlin in 1928 and London in 1929, and
soon began making recordings as well. His 1932 recording of the
Elgar Violin Concerto, with the composer conducting, remains a
classic. The same year, he made the first of many recordings with
his sister Hephzibah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played almost automatically, as if we were one person,'' he
told The New York Times soon after her death in 1981. After several
years in Europe, the Menuhins moved back to California in 1934 and
had a family compound built in Los Gatos. Two years later, at age
19 and with more than a decade of concert experience behind him,
Menuhin experienced his first crisis of confidence. Canceling all
his concerts and withdrawing to his home in Los Gatos, the young
virtuoso came to terms with the fact that his early training had
been deficient.
</P>
<P>
   But technique may not have been his only problem. Robert
Magidoff, in ``Yehudi Menuhin: The Story of the Man and the
Musician,'' a biography written with Menuhin's cooperation and
published in 1955, said Menuhin's problems were psychological, and
could be traced to the overprotectiveness of his parents,
particularly his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Palmer, in a 1991 biography and television documentary,
``Menuhin: A Family Portrait,'' made a similar point, using
interviews with Menuhin's sister, Yaltah, and his children, to make
his case. They maintained that when Menuhin married Nola Ruby
Nichols in 1938, Marutha Menuhin wrote letters to her
daughter-in-law instructing her on everything from what to feed
Menuhin to when to abstain from sex.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's first marriage produced a daughter, Zamira, and a son,
Krov, and ended in divorce nine years later. In 1947, Menuhin
married Diana Gould, a dancer who had worked with George
Balanchine. They had two children, Jeremy, who became a concert
pianist and often performed with his father on the podium, and
Gerard. His wife and children survive him, along with a sister,
Yaltah, and four grandhildren.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By then, Menuhin had come through a second crisis, caused by the
tensions in his marriage and by the devastation he saw in Europe
during World War II, when he gave more than 500 concerts for U.S.
and Allied troops, often in combat zones. After the war, he
performed in displaced persons camps (sometimes with the composer
Benjamin Britten as his accompanist) and visited concentration
camps soon after their liberation. He continued touring in Europe
until 1948, but when he returned to the United States, critics
began to note that his playing had lost some of its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin soon found himself embroiled in political problems as
well. Jewish groups denounced him for performing with Wilhelm
Furtwangler and the Berlin Philharmonic soon after the war, because
Furtwangler had remained in Germany and prospered during the war.
When a Jewish relief organization in Berlin boycotted one of his
concerts, soon after his appearance with Furtwangler, Menuhin
called a meeting to argue that Furtwangler had never joined the
Nazi party and had helped Jewish musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to bind the wounds,'' he said, adding that ``love,
and not hate, will heal the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He supported Furtwangler again in 1949, when the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra was considering hiring Furtwangler as its music
director. A group of illustrious musicians _ among them, Isaac
Stern, Nathan Milstein, Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz and
Lily Pons _ said that in that case they would never play there
again.
</P>
<P>
   Furtwangler eventually withdrew his candidacy, but Menuhin's
support of him drew fire from Jewish communities all over the
world, including Israel, where there was a bomb threat at one of
his concerts in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   He played countless benefits for Israel and its charities during
its early years and after the 1967 war with the Arabs, even though
his father had become a strident anti-Zionist in the 1930s and
refused to attend his son's concerts in support of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, just as he played benefit concerts for Israeli
organizations, he also played concerts to benefit Arab refugees. He
found himself under attack in 1975, when Leonard Bernstein and 100
musicians and dancers asked him to join a boycott of cultural
activities connected with the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, which had refused to admit Israel as a
member. Menuhin, who at the time was president of the
organization's International Music Council, responded that he
considered boycotts cowardly, and that he agreed with UNESCO's
criticism of Israel's archeological digs in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's personal life and musical career took new turns in the
1950s. On a trip to New Zealand, in 1951, he became fascinated by a
book on yoga he found in a doctor's waiting room, and began a daily
regimen that included 15 or 20 minutes of standing on his head.
When he visited India in 1952, he was introduced to B.K.S. Iyengar,
who became his guru. He also persuaded executives at Angel Records,
EMI's classical label, to make recordings with Indian musicians
like Shankar and Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin began his association with a string of festivals around
this time. He founded the Gstaad Festival in Switzerland, in 1956,
and he was appointed music director of the Bath Festival in
England, two years later. At Gstaad, he established a chamber
orchestra, where he made his first recordings as a conductor, among
them a notable set of Bach's ``Brandenburg'' Concertos and a
traversal of the Schubert symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin actually made his conducting debut more than a decade
earlier, with the Dallas Symphony in 1942; but it was at Gstaad and
Bath that he began his conducting career in earnest. At Bath he
conducted opera for the first time, and it was in a dispute about
opera _ the board considered it too costly, Menuhin considered it
essential _ that Menuhin resigned in 1968. He took over the Windsor
Festival the following year.
</P>
<P>
   He also increasingly became interested in musical pedagogy. In
1963, he established the Yehudi Menuhin School for music students
beginning at 6, at Stoke d'Abernon, in England. Two of his books _
``The Violin: Six Lessons With Yehudi Menuhin'' (1971), and ``The
Compleat Violinist'' (1986) _ were meant for student violinists. He
was appointed president of Trinity College of Music in London in
1971, and in 1977 he founded the Menuhin Academy at Gstaad.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin started several musical outreach programs, including
Live Music Now, which began offering concerts in hospitals and
prisons in 1974 and was sponsoring more than 2,000 events a year by
the mid-1990s, and Mus-E, which was started in 1994 to bring music
educational concerts to primary schools in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the organizations that he started or was actively
involved with, he lent his name, as a sponsor, patron or board
member, to hundreds of cultural and charitable organizations. A
list of his involvements, compiled in the late 1980s, ran to six
single-spaced pages. Included among the predictable _ festivals,
music schools, associations devoted to specific composers _ were
organizations as varied as the African Music and Drama Trust,
Friends of Animals and the Good Gardeners' Association, all in
England; the North Africa Ashram in Tangier, and the Catgut
Acoustical Society and the Grenville Clark Institute for World Law,
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, Menuhin was conducting regularly, and by the
1980s he had led most of the world's great orchestras and had
recorded with many of them. In 1985 he undertook his first American
tour solely as a conductor, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
But except for a sabbatical in 1976, when he was 60, he continued
to tour and make recordings as a violinist. Although critics noted
his technical flaws in these years, they also found a
communicativeness and devotion in his playing.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, he stopped playing the violin in public and
concentrated on conducting. Although he concentrated mostly on the
standard orchestral repertory, he could surprise listeners with his
adventurousness. As part of his 80th-birthday celebration in 1996,
for example, he conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's at the
Lincoln Center Festival in a program of 14 new works composed in
his honor. The composers were a strikingly diverse group, among
them Lukas Foss, Karel Husa, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Somei
Satoh, David Del Tredici, Guya Kancheli and John Tavener.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his books on violin playing, Menuhin published two
volumes of memoirs, ``Theme and Variations'' (1972) and
``Unfinished Journey'' (1977). Another volume, ``The Music of
Man,'' which he co-wrote with Curtis W. Davis (1979) was based on a
television series in which Menuhin visited 27 countries and
examined music from ancient times to punk rock.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his British Knighthood, he was made a commander of the
Legion of Honor and of the Ordre des Arts and Lettres, by France, a
knight commander of the Order of Merit, by Germany and a knight
commander of the Royal Order of the Phoenix, by Greece. He also
received the Order of Leopold and the Ordre de la Couronne, from
Belgium, the Kennedy Center Honors, from the United States, and the
Handel Medallion, New York City's cultural award.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed. Yehudi Menuhin kept up his enthusiasms, his
aura of innocence and his often complicated visionary way of
engaging the world to such an extent that, as Donal Henahan wrote
in a profile of Menuhin for The New York Times, ``One still seems
to discern, under the mask of the graying adult, the child wonder
who made his New York recital debut at age 10 ... and to whom
Einstein himself, a fiddler of famously modest talent, once said:
`Today you have again proved to me that there is a God in
heaven.'''

 Molly Ivins, a syndicated columnist for The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram and the author of several books, has flown Southwest
almost as often as some of its pilots. 
By MOLLY IVINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Can a yee-haw! airline from Texas find happiness
in or even near New York City? Southwest Airlines commences its
famously zany but low-cost, high-frequency service today out of
Islip, on Long Island. Texans generally consider Southwest their
finest export since barbecued brisket and the betting here is that
Yankees will like it, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's cheap and it's fun. It is not, however, luxurious.
Southwest will get you and your luggage where you're going, but we
don't call their planes cattle cars for nothing. It's a mercy that
Southwest is a short-haul airline, because you can get pretzelated
on their planes p.d.q.
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest does have ``je ne sais quoi,'' as we say in
Lubbock. The airline actually has a corporate sense of humor, as
contradictory as that sounds. Herb Kelleher, the founder and chief
executive, encourages his employees to make flying fun.
</P>
<P>
   If many flights are routine, some are anything but Southwest
employees are apt to dress as leprechauns on St. Patrick's Day,
rabbits on Easter and almost anything on Halloween. I have heard
flight attendants sing the safety lecture as country music, blues
and rap; I have heard them compare the pilot to Rocky Raccoon and
insist that passengers introduce themselves to one another, then
hug, then kiss, then propose marriage.
</P>
<P>
   This could be hard on New Yorkers, who assume that any stranger
who speaks to them in a public place wants their money, their body
or their time.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday afternoon ``zoo flight'' from Austin to Dallas,
favored by legislators and lobbyists, there is a regular
peanut-toss competition, with peanut bags arcing gracefully up and
down the plane, to see who can best catch them (litigious
Northerners, watch out). Peanuts are usually all you'll ever get
from Southwest in the way of food.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, too, Southwest will test the limits of New
Yorkers' camaraderie. Why, even in Chicago and Providence, R.I.,
passengers who just didn't get it almost came to blows with
Southwest employees.
</P>
<P>
   There's no such thing as a reserved seat. You get a numbered
boarding card _ first-come, first-served _ and you are herded onto
the plane in groups of 30. If your card number is over 90, resign
yourself to a middle seat. There is no place for snobs and nabobs,
either: no first class.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder Southwest has been the most New York-phobic major
airline, even steering some flights out to sea to avoid the whole
area.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Southwest haters, however, are the other airlines.
Fares always drop as soon as it shows up. Because it does not
bother with hub-and-spoke patterns, it can concentrate on the
short-haul, point-to-point trips that suit it best.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the pre-boarding entertainment is to watch frenzied
fuel, baggage and refreshment crews getting the planes ready in
just 20 minutes, less than half the industry average _ and a big
source of savings. The seating and peanuts-only policies also lower
expenses: The average trip on Southwest, at 446 miles, costs just
$76.
</P>
<P>
   Low fares also result from employees whose enthusiasm has made
them stock characters in Texas mythology. In 28 years, the airline
has never had a layoff or lost an hour to labor disputes, even
though it has the most unionized work force (85 percent) in the
business. Kelleher, pro-union and pro-employee, insists the
customer is (italics)not(end italics) always right. ``Goodbye, Mrs.
Grump, we'll miss you,'' he wrote one complaining customer.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest likes employees who break the rules for the right
reasons. Its official policy is, ``No employee will ever be
punished for using good judgment and good old common sense when
trying to accommodate a customer _ no matter what our other rules
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher himself sets the example. A teacher friend of mine in
Dallas wrote him to say that none of her students had ever flown.
He sent the class on a free round-trip to Austin, Capitol tour and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are praised, celebrated and cheered _ in the employee
newsletter, in the in-flight magazine, on the walls of the Jetways.
Every Thanksgiving, Kelleher works alongside the Dallas ground
crews. As a result of such rapport, more than 150,000 people apply
to work at Southwest every year; the company hires about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher is such a Texas-style character that it's hard to
believe he was but a barefoot boy from New Jersey who got his law
degree from New York University. He was smart enough to marry a
Texas girl and follow her home to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he confounded a group of Wall Street types in
New York by claiming his two greatest achievements were a talent
for projectile vomiting and never having had a really serious
venereal disease. For those who prefer more specific measures of
success, the airline has been the most consistently profitable and
most highly rated in baggage handling and on-time performance, with
the fewest customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   So how will these cheerful Texans who sing and crack jokes while
they take you for cheap plane rides make it in Joey
Buttafuocoville? It will be an interesting cultural confrontation.
If Missouri is the ``Show Me'' state, Long Island must be the
``Prove It'' capital. I say, bet on the Texans.

 CATERPILLAR PREDICTS 1st-QUARTER PROFITS BELOW EXPECTATIONS  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. _ Citing a sales slowdown in Latin America and
stiff competition in North America, Caterpillar Inc., the world's
largest maker of construction and earth-moving equipment, on Friday
warned that its first-quarter profits would be far below
expectations. The news caused the company's stock to tumble 12.2
percent, pulling down the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was just the latest in a series of blows to
Caterpillar, which has been suffering through a gradual decline in
sales and profits over the last year, largely because of the global
economic crisis that began in Asia in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caterpillar fell $6.1875, or 12.2 percent, on the New
York Stock Exchange on Friday, to $44.6875. The stock was the
biggest decline among the 30 stocks in the industrial average,
which finished the day with a decline of 21.09 points, or 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release issued Friday morning, the company said it
expected earnings per share to decline by as much as 50 percent
from the same quarter a year ago, well below the estimates of Wall
Street analysts. Business is expected to strengthen in the second
half of the year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts are projecting an earnings-per-share decline of
10 to 15 percent in 1999, and Caterpillar officials say they are
comfortable with those estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar said it would temporarily idle plants here and
abroad in the coming months and cut back on administrative costs
and on research and development. Reductions in the work force are
also being considered.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's North American business is suffering from
stiff competition and pricing pressure, most of its problems are
related to recessionary forces in Asia and Latin America. And that
has many analysts worried that the same forces could spread to the
United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We knew that Asia was quite depressed, and now Latin America
is sinking like a stone and Europe is flattish,'' Robert McCarthy,
an analyst at ABN Amro in Chicago, said. ``This means they are very
vulnerable to any slowdown in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   While sales of construction and earth-moving equipment remain
strong in the United States, sales of agricultural and mining
equipment are slumping because of weakness in those sectors. Sales
of engines and solar turbines are also depressed, Caterpillar said,
which could force temporary plant shutdowns in Europe and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Latin America accounted for about 9 percent of
Caterpillar's sales. The company said its sales in Brazil were
particularly bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said before that Brazil and Latin America were going to be
in recession, and that's definitely the case,'' said Marsha
Hausser, a spokeswoman for Caterpillar. ``But we're anticipating
that the second half is going to be better than the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, analysts say, is that Caterpillar and other
companies have introduced a broad mix of new agricultural tractors,
but the agricultural sector _ even in the United States _ is in a
slump because of plummeting commodity prices. Those tractors are
being aggressively priced, and as a result profit margins are
shrinking throughout the industry, particularly at companies like
Case Corp., which is based in Racine, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   For Caterpillar, one of the companies that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average, the economy in the United States has been
strong enough to offset some losses in other markets. But the
construction industry here has not been strong enough to bring
healthy profits to a global company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said Friday's announcement was not very
surprising, but it did force some of them to trim back their
expectations for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pretty well cements the fact that this will be the second
down year for Caterpillar, even though North America remains
strong,'' McCarthy of ABN Amro said.

ACADEMY RECOGNITION OF KAZAN REOPENS AN OLD WOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, March 14 by NYTimes News Service) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite all the talk of wide-open Oscar races this
year, the most suspenseful moment at the 71st Academy Awards
ceremonies March 21 will come when 89-year-old Elia Kazan accepts
an honorary award for his distinguished body of work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a very good chance that the director of such acclaimed
movies as ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``On the Waterfront'' and
``East of Eden,'' the stage genius who was probably more
responsible than any other individual for making the naturalistic
Method the dominant acting style in American movies, will be
greeted by silence, by only scattered applause or, even, by
catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, while few if any would question that Kazan was a
great and highly influential filmmaker, many have never forgiven
him for naming names to the House Un-American Activities Committee
in 1952, at the height of Washington and Hollywood's anti-communist
witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of film-industry careers were damaged during the
McCarthy era. Those accused of, to paraphrase the government's
official question, now or having ever been members of the American
Communist Party, were given the damnable choice of either naming
colleagues and friends who had also been party members or, by not
informing, being blacklisted. Landing on the latter, secret roster
meant that individual would no longer be employed in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, whose brief membership in the party in the mid-1930s
genuinely soured him on communism, was the highest-profile liberal
to name names. Like many who cooperated with HUAC, he surely
despised the horrors of Stalinism and was concerned about America's
safety at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike others who buckled before the committee in order to
save their careers, Kazan has refused to apologize for his actions
since. Indeed, the day after his testimony, he took out an ad in
The New York Times that rationalzed his decision on political
grounds. The first film Kazan made after testifying was the
anti-communist ``Man on a Tightrope.'' The next one, ``On the
Waterfront,'' for which he won his second directing Oscar (the
first was for the 1947 expose of anti-Semitism ``Gentleman's
Agreement''), makes the most indelible case for whistle-blowing in
all of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that while the academy maintains the honorary
award was (and should be by others) considered purely in the spirit
of artistic merit, its action has rekindled 50-year-old animosities
and detonated a mushroom cloud of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that the academy _ which, normally, goes out
of its way to avoid controversy, particularly politically related
controversy _ is willing to stick its neck out in this instance,''
observes ``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic Leonard Maltin.
``Obviously, in doing so, they are trying to say that there are two
separate issues here. I kind of think they're right. But at the
same time, I wasn't around then, my life and career were not ruined
as a result of that witch hunt. I don't take lightly at all the
still-smoldering emotions that go with this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand why they feel compelled to do this;
all they're doing is opening old wounds,'' adds Rick Jewell,
associate dean of the Universty of Southern California's Film
School. ``If Kazan had never won an Oscar, then it would be a
different story because his artistic output is certainly worthy of
this kind of recognition. But since he won two of them, I just
don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while there certainly have been exceptions to the rule,
by far the majority of honorary Oscars have been given to the likes
of Alfred Hitchcock and Charlie Chaplin, major talents who
unaccountably failed to win competitive Oscars during their
distinguished careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do, I guess, is to put a period to this
whole, inflammatory history,'' Jewell says of the academy's Board
of Governors, which reportedly voted unanimously to give Kazan the
honorary award at the urging of the director's longtime friend and
collaborator (and past academy president), Karl Malden. ``Instead,
they've just caused it to flare up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky and Edward Dmytryk were deeply affected by the
blacklist. Polonsky, whose script for the 1947 ``Body and Soul''
was nominated for an Oscar, made his directing debut with the
highly acclaimed film noir ``Force of Evil'' a year later.
Blacklisted for refusing to divulge his political connections to
HUAC, he didn't direct again for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dmytryk was a member of the Hollywood Ten, a group of writers,
producers and directors whose refusal to cooperate with the
committee led to their being imprisoned for contempt of Congress.
But Dmytryk had a change of heart, became one of HUAC's star
witnesses and resumed his directing career, during which he made
such admired '50s films as ``Broken Lance,'' ``The Caine Mutiny''
and ``The Young Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky, 88, is among a group of blacklist survivors who are
encouraging Oscar ceremony attendees not to applaud when Kazan is
feted at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave in to the House committee, gave them the names of
friends and people he knew so he wouldn't be blacklisted, but they
were,'' Polonsky says of Kazan. ``I consider that immoral conduct.
But they say the award has nothing to do with a person's moral
conduct. In other words, if you are a mass murderer but you write a
good picture, the academy a right to give you an award for deeds
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's illogical that a great artist doesn't have a
morality and a point of view that goes into his work. That's why I
think the whole thing is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The 91-year-old Dmytryk argues that Kazan, like himself, was
indeed operating on moral principle when he told HUAC all that he
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long past time to (give Kazan) this award,'' Dmytryk
says. ``And I think the academy is being very courageous because I
know how much courage it takes. It's great in all ways; I don't
have any exceptions like so many people do, great work but lousy
politics. His politics were also good; he helped to undermine the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I want to make clear: The producers met on Nov. 25,
1947, and laid out the proposition, which they adopted, that nobody
who was a communist or an ex-communist could work in the business
at all unless they recanted. Now, that's long before Kazan
testified. In other words, the blacklist was not his fault or my
fault or anybody else's fault. So the constant blame that's been
made about the horrible things that happened to these families
because of the blacklist has been directed at the wrong people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been a quagmire of conflicting recriminations.
Hollywood communists often did support, or at least made excuses
for, Stalin's brutally repressive Soviet regime. Still, to
persecute members (or, more so, former members) of a legally
constituted political party, was, well, un-American in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole system of government is based on the whole idea that
you don't shut people up this way, that you have a right to have
your opinion,'' Polonsky notes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, the politically
conservative author of the highly critical study of communism in
the film community ``Hollywood Party,'' points out, ``Let's not
forget, this is the movies, this isn't the government. There's no
constitutional right to a lifelong, lucrative job as a screenwriter
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   And then again, as the widespread public disdain for Linda Tripp
proves, Americans have a fundamental revulsion for snitches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are reasonable rebuttals to the more
hyperbolic claims of both the left and the right. It's doubtful,
for example, that the eight people Kazan named before the committee
were hurt any more, at that point, than they already were. Most
historical accounts agree that these individuals were already known
to HUAC's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the fact that, at the time, America was strongly
anti-communist takes the wind out of the argument that justified
the whole Hollywood inquisition: that red influence in the movies
was somehow subverting the republic from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask Kazan, `Do you really think these people were
dangerous, a threat to this country?' '' says Richard Walter,
chairman of the screenwriting program at the University of
California, Los Angeles. ``They were self-important and, probably,
incredibly pompous, but a threat to this nation? Where is the
damage that they did?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever damage the Kazan honor does _ to individuals for whom
its brought back painful memories, to the academy's reputation or,
perhaps, to whomever agrees to present the honorary Oscar (noting
that it never reveals who will present which award, the academy
would not confirm widespread rumors that impeccably credentialed
liberals Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are the designated
presenters) _ there could be a silver lining to the whole
imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the recent, agonizing impeachment proceedings and Orange
County video store protests triggered extensive examinations of
freedom, morality and law, the highly publicized Kazan controversy
could lead to a wider and deeper understanding of those troubled
blacklist times _ a period which, as Hollywood Ten member Dalton
Trumbo famously noted, produced only victims.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ulu Grosbard (``The Deep End of the Ocean''), who
worked with Kazan in the 1960s, expresses an objective attitude
shared by many who appreciate the devastating complexities of that
trying time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him very charming. I got a good deal out of working
with him. I liked him,'' Grosbard says of Kazan. ``Yet you were
always aware of what he did. It's difficult. I'm conflicted about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Reisman, a past president of the Writers Guild of America,
currently sits on the guild's Blacklist Credits Committee. The
committee has researched and assigned proper credit to 82 films
that were written under pseudonyms or through a front by
blacklisted writers between 1948 and 1961. Six new corrections were
announced last week to somewhat more media attention than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really timed (to capitalize on the Kazan
controversy); however, people make that implicit connection, which
is fair,'' Reisman says. ``It's just there. I think that there will
be more public awareness about the blacklist now. It does bring it
to the fore because of Kazan's prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may, in the long run, be good for society. Although of
course, some would understandably rather forget, if not forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm irritated, but not cast down by this,'' Polonsky says,
``because I know, having lived a long life, that one of the things
I can always count on is that whatever happens will be
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky laughs, but there's no mistaking the sad resignation in
his voice when he says, ``I thought the blacklist was over with.
Now I find out it's still alive.''

STUDIO LEADS INDEPENDENTS' GOLDEN GRAB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, March 14 by NYTimes News Service) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Next Sunday, if the Hollywood soothsayers are
correct, Miramax Films may well lose another big battle to Steven
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   But 20-year-old Miramax, a onetime low-budget art-house upstart
turned Hollywood juggernaut, gradually seems to be winning the war
for the hearts and minds of Oscar voters.
</P>
<P>
   With a total of 23 nominations this year, including best-picture
nods for ``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,''
Disney-owned Miramax is leading the Oscar field for the second time
in the last three years. In 1996, the company scored 20
nominations, winning for best picture (``The English Patient''),
best director and in several other major categories.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Spielberg's World War II
epic, remains the odds-on favorite to cart home the best-picture
prize this year, Miramax co-chairman and brothers Harvey and Bob
Weinstein have waged an expensive, aggressive bicoastal ad campaign
to boost their films' chances, particularly those of ``Shakespeare
in Love,'' whose 13 nominations are the most for any film this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The current campaign echoes 1994, when Miramax's ``The Piano''
was duking it out for best picture with another Spielberg project,
``Schindler's List,'' the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, independent film companies, with Miramax
at the forefront, have steadily been gaining ground on the major
studios as the unofficial arbiters of Oscar taste. That trend seems
likely to continue, whatever happens March 21 at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, where the 71st annual Academy Awards will be
held.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rice, president of marketing for October Films, which
received two nominations this year for the feature film ``Hilary
and Jackie'' and one for the documentary ``The Last Days,'' says
the Weinsteins' Oscar success has helped other independents make
inroads in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they're big, I think their heart and soul,
certainly with the Miramax label, will always be independent,''
Rice says. ``It doesn't hurt to have a well-capitalized company
that can provide you with a marketing war chest, like they have
now, to raise the consciousness of the public and of the academy
members to the kinds of pictures that they make and the kinds of
pictures that we make.''
</P>
<P>
   What this success bodes for the future of independent film is a
more complex question. A central issue is whether Miramax, whose
high-end movies such as ``Shakespeare in Love'' now cost tens of
millions of dollars, still can be called an ``independent'' film
company in any meaningful sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess independent conveys a certain sort of edginess and a
certain subversiveness and a certain challenge to mainstream cinema
or mainstream ideas, a certain toughness, or a film that takes
risks,'' says critic Peter Biskind, author of ``Easy Riders and
Raging Bulls,'' a study of Hollywood filmmaking in the 1960s and
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these are all cliches, but taken altogether, I think
that, for me, to some extent, is what I expect from an independent.
And I don't think you can say anything like that about `Shakespeare
in Love.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hoberman, chief film critic of the Village Voice, says he
``doesn't really regard'' Miramax as an independent company, as he
did when it was distributing such movies as ``The Crying Game''
(1992) and Errol Morris' controversial documentary ``The Thin Blue
Line'' (1988), which resulted in a Texas Death Row inmate being set
free.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gill, president of Miramax L.A., says he agrees that
``Shakespeare in Love'' is not a cutting-edge film. But he points
out that Miramax continues to release many films every year made
for $3 million or less that deal with controversial subjects, in
languages and styles as far removed from the mainstream Hollywood
vernacular as Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which stars director Roberto
Benigni as a father attempting to shield his son from the horrors
of a Nazi death camp, Gill says, ``If you know a (riskier) film
last year, I'd like to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you, we are in no way shaping Oscar's tastes,''
Gill says. ``We are making more of the kind of movies that Oscar
voters like, so if you want to use the baseball analogy, we're up
to bat more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film
Festival Group, believes that both ``Life Is Beautiful'' and
``Shakespeare'' were ``more adventurous than your standard studio
(fare) in terms of the subject matter'' and ``the risks they
took.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miramax is a very interesting company because it still has a
very broad mandate, and I still think that Harvey (Weinstein) is
trying to fight the good fight in terms of an art cinema, an
art-house cinema,'' Handling says. ``But he's involved now with
films that are grossing $100 million a year, which takes the energy
of that company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at `Good Will Hunting,' which is far less
experimental than some of Gus's (director Gus Van Sant's) early
work,'' Handling continues. ``At the same token, you look at
`Jackie Brown,' which is a pretty adventuresome commercial film,
which didn't quite succeed, and I really have great respect for
(Miramax) financing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Miramax has had a number of breakout
movies, including ``sex, lies, and videotape'' (1989), ``The Crying
Game'' (1992), ``The Piano'' (1993) and ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1996, when ``The English Patient'' won the
Oscar for best picture and only one of the other four nominees
(``Jerry Maguire'') was distributed by a major studio (TriStar),
that newspapers and entertainment publications proclaimed the
``Year of the Independents.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Miramax's Harvey Weinstein demurred that the
success of the independents was only ``the luck of the draw,'' and
that the studios might well be back on top in 1997 _ as they were,
to an extent, with James Cameron's ``Titanic'' blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ``year of the independents'' tag was questionable to
begin with, given that many independents are now owned by major
studios, such as Fine Line (Time Warner).
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in that `year of the independent,' the four
nominated films were so disparate that they reflected nothing,
other than corporate bylaws,'' says Mark Urman, co-president of
Lions Gate Films Releasing in New York, whose ``Gods and Monsters''
and ``Affliction'' received a combined five nominations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood observers say that the major studios no longer
particularly care about winning Oscars the way they did 30 or 40
years ago. Miramax and smaller independents, some say, have been
able to fill a void created when the majors stopped making as many
prestige pictures and turned their attention more to adolescent and
action fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad overview is, the studios are largely out of the
Oscar game,'' says one veteran industry observer who requested
anonymity. ``They're in it to oversee those special films that come
along once in a while, a la `Titanic' or `Braveheart,' that are
tied to a major filmmaking talent that they're in business with.
That's why they're in that business at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Vogel, a veteran New York media analyst, believes the
majors ``do care, sure, on a studio level'' about winning Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you'd have to say that, in the greater scheme of things,
it means less and less from an investor standpoint, because these
companies are so huge,'' Vogel says. ``Look, Time Warner gets over
40 percent (of its revenues) from cable. So it's more important
what happens with AT&AMP;T and Time Warner cable than what happens if
one film wins a second award on Oscar (night). It really doesn't
have that much of an impact on the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly makes a film ``independent'' has become
increasingly hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Gilmore, director of programming for the Sundance
Festival, says that expensive movies with fairly big-name casts,
such as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' represent one end of an
independent spectrum that has been and will continue to be highly
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not simply a question of the amount of money involved in
a picture, or it's not simply a question of where that money comes
from, but it's really a complex of issues, and it's very hard to
define,'' Gilmore says.
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate's Urman says that a number of so-called ``small
films'' _ ``and not just via Miramax'' _ have begun to go far at
Oscar time. That, he believes, will create more opportunities for
independents next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly you have a very large population exposed to a film in
which the female lead has a penis (`The Crying Game'), or exposed
to a film in which an Australian pianist experiences some sort of
redemption (`Shine') and on and on and on,'' Urman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, whenever a film does 10 times what a successful
independent film should do, it increases the possibilities for all
of the films. And it creates, as we all must be concerned with, an
audience that is more receptive to trying it again.'' &UR;

<P>
   Pursued by lawyers and politicians, tobacco companies have found
it difficult the last few years to be proactive on behalf of what
most likely is a nervous base of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as something of a surprise last week when RJR Nabisco
announced that it would separate its tobacco and food businesses, a
variation on a step that some shareholders have advocated
strenuously.
</P>
<P>
   By peeling off tobacco from the rest of the company,
management's thinking went, liability for smoking-related lawsuits
could be concentrated in the stand-alone R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
shielding the food business.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street evidently doesn't believe that the lawyers and
politicians will leave the food company alone: RJR Nabisco's stock
has barely budged since the plan was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert D. Crary, a lawyer and securities analyst at the
Westport, Conn., firm of Crary, Onthank &AMP; O'Neil, looks for
investment opportunities created by lawsuits. He surveyed the legal
and financial landscape confronting RJR Nabisco and the industry. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Investors don't seem to appreciate the moves that
RJR Nabisco proposed last week. What is your view?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To me, the strategy looks pretty darn good. Both companies
will be out there to take claims of tobacco plaintiffs. But the
only way plaintiffs could go after the assets of Nabisco Group
Holdings, the food company's holding company, is if the assets of
RJR Tobacco are exhausted. And the holding company represents some
interesting opportunities for shielding liability.
</P>
<P>
   The holding company's sole asset is an 80.6 percent stake in
Nabisco Holdings, the food company. So its assets are limited.
Conceivably, Nabisco Group Holdings could go bankrupt and still
have a nonbankrupt subsidiary, Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for all practical purposes a tobacco case is an
ongoing tort. Separating the tobacco company from the food company
insulates the food company from torts committed after the date of
the split. That makes it more complicated for the plaintiff. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Has the freestanding tobacco company's position been
improved by this move?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the company got nearly $8 billion for their foreign
tobacco business, which is a great price. They will be able to use
that money to pay down a lot of their debt, which means that
Reynolds Tobacco will be able to generate a tremendous amount of
cash over time. That might make the company attractive to a buyer,
like British American Tobacco, that would assume their liability
risk. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are there any new legal developments that might
limit the size and scope of lawsuits against the new tobacco
company?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Reynolds Tobacco could try something called a limited fund,
non-opt-out class action settlement. Liggett &AMP; Myers is using it,
and it has been upheld at the trial court level with a number of
other companies. The idea is if a company feels it has too many
claims pending against it and can't pay all of them, it will agree
to settle at a set amount. The Supreme Court has a case before it
which will decide whether these actions are appropriate, and if so,
under what circumstances. If many of these cases, including
Liggett's, are resolved favorably, then Reynolds would probably
adopt a similar strategy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is civil litigation the greatest threat to RJR
Nabisco and the tobacco industry?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think regulation is a much bigger risk.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it appeared likely that the Justice Department
might bring a broad criminal case against the tobacco companies. If
news reports are accurate, the chances of that happening have
diminished. But a civil lawsuit is still a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments
this fall about whether to reverse the Fourth U.S. District Court
of Appeals and give the Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction
to regulate cigarettes. I think the Supreme Court will reverse that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans lose control of one or both houses of
Congress in next year's elections, it will be very bad news for the
tobacco companies. On the other hand, if the Republicans win the
White House and sustain their congressional majorities, tobacco
company stocks will fly before the returns are even in. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do the political and legal risks make tobacco stocks
unattractive?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Personally, I think RJR Nabisco is a great buy here,
particularly if it is seen as a takeover candidate. I think the
stock will trade at a speculative premium.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Reynolds Tobacco will make money. So
will Philip Morris. But tobacco will be much more controlled and,
in my view, will be phased out over a generation. But money can be
made in that environment, particularly if ``safe cigarettes'' can
be developed. Both Philip Morris and Reynolds are going to get very
active in that area once they get litigation problems behind them.

 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yehudi Menuhin, the legendary violinist who came to prominence
in his childhood as a virtuoso in velvet knee-pants and later
became a respected conductor, an organizer of festivals and schools
and an idealistic supporter of hundreds of charities and causes,
died Friday at Martin Luther Hospital in Berlin. He was 82 and
lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   When Menuhin was at his best, his playing had a grandeur and
intensity that made his sound instantly recognizable, both in the
concert hall and on disk. He recorded prolifically, beginning in
1928 when he was 12, and even after he stopped playing the violin
publicly, in the early 1990s, he continued to perform and make
recordings as a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Though an American by birth, Menuhin lived in Europe for most of
his life. He described himself as an internationalist, and in the
1950s he contended that peace would be achieved only under a single
benign world government. After he accepted honorary Swiss
citizenship in 1970, tendered because of his services in founding
the Gstaad Festival, the State Department threatened to revoke his
American citizenship, but later relented. In 1985, Menuhin became a
British subject. He had been given an honorary knighthood by
Britain 19 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and visions of a utopian future often seemed to be as
much on Mr. Menuhin's mind as music-making. A devotee of yoga and
health food, he warned against the dangers of white rice, white
bread, refined sugar and red meat, and advocated vegetarianism. He
spoke about the dangers of pollution long before ecology was a chic
topic. He put forward his own notions of city planning, including a
vision of New York City in which all traffic moved underground.
</P>
<P>
   Musically too, his interests ranged widely. He performed and
recorded most of the standard classical repertory, including the
major contemporary works, and he gave the premiere performances of
Bartok's Unaccompanied Sonata, Bloch's Suites 1 and 2, Walton's
Violin Sonata and pieces by Georges Enesco, Vaughan Williams,
Lennox Berkeley and Paul Ben-Haim.
</P>
<P>
   He also recorded jazz albums with Stephane Grappelli and as an
early and eloquent advocate of Eastern music, he made a series of
``East Meets West'' recordings with Indian musicians, including
Ravi Shankar, the sitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in his career, personal and technical crises
forced Menuhin to stop playing. But as a child violinist in the
1920s _ a time when Fritz Kreisler, Mischa Elman and Jascha Heifetz
were the instrument's reigning elite _ Menuhin stunned listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem ridiculous to say that he showed a mature
conception of Beethoven's concerto, but that is the fact,'' Olin
Downes wrote in The New York Times in November 1927, when Menuhin,
at age 11, made his first New York appearance as an orchestral
soloist, at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Yehudi Menuhin was born in New York on April 22, 1916. His
parents, Moshe and Marutha, were Russian-Jewish immigrants who had
met in Palestine in 1909, and married in New York in 1914. They
named their son Yehudi, which means ``Jew,'' after a landlord
showing them an apartment told them that a benefit of living in the
building was that there were no Jews in residence there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, the Menuhins moved to San Francisco, where Moshe
Menuhin, after an unsuccessful attempt at running a farm near
Oakland, supported his family by teaching Hebrew. Menuhin asked for
a violin when he was 3, and was taken to Sigmund Anker, a teacher
who specialized in very young players. Menuhin's parents insisted
that he and his two younger sisters _ Hephzibah and Yaltah, both
pianists _ undertake a rigorous course of home study. Their father
taught them math, history and Hebrew; their mother was their
French, German, Italian and Spanish tutor.
</P>
<P>
   During the Menuhins' visit to Europe in 1927, Menuhin played for
the great Belgian violinist Eugene Ysaye, who was astonished to
discover the extent to which Menuhin's technique was intuitive.
Although he could play difficult works like Lalo's ``Symphonie
Espagnole,'' when Ysaye asked him to play a three-octave arpeggio,
Menuhin didn't understand the request.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin made debuts in Berlin in 1928 and London in 1929, and
soon began making recordings. His 1932 recording of the Elgar
Violin Concerto, with the composer conducting, remains a classic.
That same year, he made the first of many recordings with his
sister Hephzibah.
</P>
<P>
   After several years in Europe, the Menuhins moved back to
California in 1934, and had a family compound built in Los Gatos.
Two years later, at age 19, Menuhin experienced his first crisis of
confidence. Canceling all his concerts, the young virtuoso came to
terms with the fact that his early training had been deficient.
</P>
<P>
   But technique may not have been his only problem. Robert
Magidoff, in ``Yehudi Menuhin: The Story of the Man and the
Musician,'' a biography written with Menuhin's cooperation and
published in 1955, said Menuhin's problems were psychological and
could be traced to the overprotectiveness of his parents,
particularly his mother. Tony Palmer, in a 1991 biography and
television documentary, ``Menuhin: A Family Portrait,'' made a
similar point, using interviews with Menuhin's sister, Yaltah, and
his children, to make his case. They maintained that when Menuhin
married Nola Ruby Nichols Marutha Menuhin wrote letters to her
daughter-in-law instructing her on everything from what to feed
Menuhin to when to abstain from sex.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's first marriage produced a daughter, Zamira, and a son,
Krov, and ended in divorce nine years later. In 1947, Menuhin
married Diana Gould, a dancer. They had two children, Jeremy, who
became a concert pianist and often performed with his father, and
Gerard. His wife and children survive him, along with a sister,
Yaltah, and four grandhildren.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he performed in displaced persons camps and
visited concentration camps soon after their liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups denounced him for performing with Wilhelm
Furtwangler and the Berlin Philharmonic soon after the war, because
Furtwangler had remained in Germany and prospered during the war.
He supported Furtwangler again in 1949, when the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra was considering hiring Furtwangler as its music director.
</P>
<P>
   Furtwangler withdrew his candidacy, but Menuhin's support of him
drew fire from Jewish communities, including Israel, where there
was a bomb threat at one of his concerts in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   He played countless benefits for Israel and its charities and he
also played concerts to benefit Arab refugees. As the years passed.
Yehudi Menuhin kept up his enthusiasms, his aura of innocence and
his visionary way of engaging the world to such an extent that, as
Donal Henahan wrote in a profile of Menuhin for The New York Times,
``One still seems to discern, under the mask of the graying adult,
the child wonder who made his New York recital debut at age 10 ...
and to whom Einstein himself, a fiddler of famously modest talent,
once said: `Today you have again proved to me that there is a God
in heaven.'''

`FAR FROM PERFECT' CLINTON GOES HOME TO A PLACE CALLED HOPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPE, Ark. _ On a chill, wet late-winter afternoon, President
Clinton told adoring home folks Friday that he was ``far from
perfect'' but determined to complete the complex personal journey
he began in this small town 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the newly restored house where he lived from
birth to age 4, Clinton told an audience of several hundred that he
learned in Hope, a county seat about 30 miles northeast of the
Texas border, the lesson of taking the good with the bad.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that some years ago he was seeking to comfort
a great uncle, whose wife had Alzheimer's disease. ``This is really
hard,'' Clinton recalled telling the relative, who replied: ``Yeah,
it is. But I signed on for the whole load _ and most of it's been
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I learned _ to sign on for the whole load,''
Clinton said, without mentioning the personal and political trials
that have marked his more than six years in the White House.
``Though far from perfect, I have tried to do just that for my
family and my friends, for our beloved state and nation. If I had
not learned that lesson here ... we wouldn't be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came as he dedicated, and toured for the
first time in more than 40 years, his childhood home. It has been
refurbished by a private foundation and was opened to the public
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly relished the nostalgic interlude and
full-throated praise from supporters after a year of scandal that
led to his impeachment by the House and acquittal in the Senate.
The impeachment resulted from his attempts to cover up a sexual
affair with White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The visit also came during what increasingly appears to be a new
rough patch in his marriage to Hillary Rodham Clinton. The first
lady, who had skipped her husband's trip earlier in the week to
Central America, did not accompany him on the sentimental journey
to Hope. The first lady's staff said she remained at the White
House with back trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Arkansas, Clinton's staff announced he would
not, as previously planned, stay overnight Saturday in Little Rock
at the home of his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham. Clinton instead
will return to Washington after two Democratic fund-raising events
in the state capital. Aides said Clinton decided to return to
Washington because he is tired after his four-day international
trip.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have refused to respond directly to reports of
trouble in the White House family quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In their public comments, Hope residents were dismissive of
scandal talk about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for Bill, regardless,'' said Carlene Feild Barron, who now
lives in Nacogdoches, Texas, but maintains her house behind the
Clinton childhood home. She remembers the president as a precocious
toddler who by age 3 or 4 was pointing out words in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded in kind, telling the crowd: ``Thank you for
being there for me through this whole wonderful ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope residents have come to treasure Clinton's references to his
boyhood hometown and the president closed his speech with a line he
used in the 1992 campaign, a line the crowd clearly wanted to hear:
``I still believe in a place called Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But even among the faithful there was private acknowledgment of
longstanding reports of Clinton's womanizing during his political
career in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew he had a problem,'' said a longtime political
activist who has known Clinton since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about nothing quite so heavy. He referred jokingly
to breaking his leg at Miss Mary Perkins' kindergarten, ``in the
first of many major mistakes I was to make in my life, jumping rope
in my cowboy boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a covered podium, Clinton reminisced about the white
clapboard house with freshly painted green trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this house, I learned to walk and talk,'' Clinton said. ``I
learned to pray. I learned to read. I learned to count from the
playing cards my grandparents tacked up on the kitchen windows.
Though I was only 4 when I left this place, it still holds very,
very vivid memories for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Clinton on his tour of the house were a number of
family members, including his young nephew, Tyler, whom the
president raced up the waxed wooden stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story house, built 82 years ago in the American
foursquare style, has been outfitted with period furnishings,
although none are pieces that were in the home in 1946-50 when
Clinton lived there.
</P>
<P>
   On a living-room table, a young Clinton beamed out from a
photograph in front of a Christmas tree. Nearby an Emerson
phonograph was open, with a Decca 78 rpm disc of ``Star Dust'' by
Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians on the turntable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke first to several hundred people who had awaited
his arrival in a drenching rain at Hope's airport. It was an open
event as opposed to the invitation-only ceremony at the boyhood
home. He flew from Washington on a small Air Force passenger jet,
as there is no airport within 100 miles that could accommodate his
747s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter where you came from in life,'' Clinton told
the crowd, ``it matters what you do with your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proclaimed the day the coldest March 12 in Hope in a
hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I made a lot of money for the hospitals in the
area,'' Clinton joked in his remarks at the house. ``There will be
people being treated for flu for three or four week after this.''
</P>
<P>
   More soberly, Clinton noted: ``Rain makes this thing more
poignant for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's father died in an auto wreck in Missouri three months
before he was born. Over the next few years, Clinton's mother was
often in Louisiana for nursing studies.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Clinton spoke at two fund-raising events in the
border city of Texarkana for Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Texas, which were
expected to net more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The second Sandlin event was at the home of Truman Arnold, a
wealthy Democratic contributor who has been questioned by a
Whitewater grand jury about arranging for about $90,000 in payments
to Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry concerned whether the payments, from Arnold and
other wealthy Democrats with Texas ties, were an attempt to buy
silence about the Clintons from the former deputy attorney general.
After Hubbell resigned from the Justice Department, he was
convicted on charges of doctoring fee records at the Rose Law Firm
in Little Rock, where he was a partner with Hillary Clinton.

 &HT;    Wohlers regains a whiff of success
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ In a sublime piece of timing, the
Braves threw Mark Wohlers into the fire Friday. His response was
almost perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Relieving Tom Glavine in the third inning with one out, the
bases loaded and Los Angeles' Gary Sheffield at the plate, Wohlers
struck out one of the game's best fastball hitters before ending
the inning on a soft line-out to center by Dave Hansen. Less than
hour after the club learned of Kerry Ligtenberg's elbow injury,
Wohlers recorded his first strikeout in three spring outings,
allowed no runs for the second straight appearance and looked
suspiciously like his former self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty darn close. I really am,'' Wohlers said afterwards. ``I
don't want to jinx myself or get too far ahead, but I think today
was a pretty good step. To be as erratic as I was last year and to
come in with one of the premiere hitters in the game, even though
it's spring training, my frame of mind isn't spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers set up Sheffield with a first-pitch slider which was
taken for a strike, before coming back with three consecutive
fastballs, Sheffield whiffing on the last two. Having opened camp
by handling his deposed closer with kid gloves, manager Bobby Cox
no longer speaks cautiously about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's back-to-back,'' Cox said. ``He keeps going, man, that's
really bright news after getting bad news today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a lot to prove,'' Wohlers said. ``I knew I would
get to this point. I didn't know if it would be April or May or
July or when. I'm surprised I'm throwing the ball as well as I am
and feel as good as I do on the mound and carry myself as well. But
we still got three or four weeks down here. A lot can happen
between then and now.''
</P>
<P>
   SICK LIST
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux will attempt to pitch again today against Kansas
City after being sent home early with stomach flu he believes he
picked up from his children. He is expected to follow John Smoltz
against the Royals in Baseball City. ... Right fielder Brian Jordan
rebounded strongly after tweaking his right ankle Thursday, feeling
frisky enough after therapy to even trying to beat out a bunt
against the Dodgers. (He failed.) ... The infected cut on Glavine's
left thumb improved enough to allow him to start against Los
Angeles, though the left-hander insisted it had little to do with
his inconsistency (three hits and two walks in 2 1/3 innings). ``It
felt good, actually,'' he said. ``It bothered me a little on my
change-up but outside that, no. It was just I kind of lost my
location a little bit. Not that it was great before that.''
</P>
<P>
   SKORPUT DIES
</P>
<P>
   Pete Skorput, who for more than 30 years ran the Braves old
spring training complex in West Palm Beach, died Wednesday night
after a long bout with cancer. A former minor-league pitcher who
was hired by the Braves while Municipal Stadium was still under
construction in the early 1960s, Skorput passed away at his
residence in West Stockbridge, Mass., at 80. ``Things don't work
unless you have a nuts-and-bolts guy. He's the original,'' said
Cox, who first met Skorput in 1967. ``He kept everything working.''
</P>
<P>
   TURNER FIELD OPEN HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will hold an open house at Turner Field this morning,
where fans can stake out seating for 1999 season ticket sales.
Ticket plans, which start at $462, are available on half- and
full-season basis and full-season options are available in most
areas of the park. The open house runs from 9 a.m. to noon.

 &HT;    Jirsa remains mum on firing
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If anyone is wondering how Ron Jirsa really feels
about his recent firing as Georgia's basketball coach or the
ill-fated season that led to it, they'll have to keep on wondering
because Jirsa is still not talking.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley announced
Jirsa would not be retained after just two years as the Bulldogs'
coach, Jirsa was not talking to the media Friday. When contacted
Friday afternoon, Jirsa's wife Laura said that her husband ``has
nothing to say'' to the media, referring them instead to a
statement released through Georgia's sports information office.
</P>
<P>
   Other than to thank the players and say his firing was a
surprise, little was revealed in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit that I was surprised to be dismissed
(Thursday),'' the statement read, ``but that's the nature of the
coaching business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa's biggest regret is ``that I will be unable to complete
this recruiting class and coach the young men who have already
committed to the university.'' He also said that he intended to
remain in coaching.
</P>
<P>
   That Jirsa had nothing to say was only fitting because his team
certainly made no statements the final few weeks of the season. The
Bulldogs lost 11 of their last 14 games, including four straight to
end the season.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's weaknesses were glaring. The Bulldogs got virtually no
offensive or defensive production out of the center position and
were often reduced to a jump-shooting conglomerate. If their bombs
weren't hitting their targets, they were dead. Georgia was
out-rebounded in 10 of its last 11 games by an average of 7.8 a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as good as Jumaine Jones is, the 6-foot-7 sophomore
forward could not create on his own. Opponents simply put their
best defender on Jones and controlled the rest of the team with a
mixture of zones and man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley, who never claimed to be a basketball expert, aptly
summed up Georgia's struggles this way: ``Who knows what one good
Larry Brown would have meant to this team. It's obvious to
everybody we didn't have enough muscle on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of the season
</P>
<P>
   _ Best win: The Bulldogs defeated College of Charleston 84-63 on
Nov. 16, one of just two defeats the Cougars suffered this season.
Georgia also beat Texas on the road in November. Both teams are
made the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst loss: The 70-66 overtime loss at South Carolina in the
regular-season finale was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turning point: An overtime loss at Georgia Tech on Dec. 13 in
which the Bulldogs blew a 15-point lead in the game's final 10
minutes to lose 84-79.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key players: Jumaine Jones led the SEC in scoring with an 18.8
average and the Bulldogs in rebounding with 9.4, but at times was
more a distraction than he was an asset. Freshman guard D.A. Layne
(12.9 ppg) emerged as a potential star.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Regardless of who is hired as coach, he'll be
rebuilding from the loss of five seniors and likely Jones to the
NBA. Unless the Bulldogs can sign an athletic big man who can make
an immediate impact, they'll continue to struggle.

 &HT;    Big games are a family tradition for Szczerbiaks
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Wally Szczerbiak scored 43 points Friday. In any
other family, this would seem a big deal. In the Szczerbiak
household, it meant only that young Wally came within 23 of
bettering Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Szczerbiak holds the scoring record for Spanish
professional basketball _ 65 points for Real Madrid against a team
from Lugo. His son can cite the pertinent numbers: ``He was 25 of
27 from the field, 15 of 17 from the line. It's an unbelievable
record; it'll probably never be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unless Wally Szczerbiak spurns the NBA to play in the
Catalans.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the NCAA Tournament a rumor, a big scorer from the
smallish Mid-American Conference who'd played but once, not well,
on national TV. Today Wally Szczerbiak (pronounced ZER-bee-ack)
stands as the author of the most stunning NCAA performance since
Bill Walton went 21-for-22. Szczerbiak scored 73 percent of his
team's points. He had 12 rebounds, two assists. He blocked Greg
Clark's shot at the buzzer. Szczerbiak's little team, Miami (Ohio),
toppled big-time Washington 59-58.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for people to get to see this,'' said Mike
Ensminger, Miami's sixth man. ``Before today, everybody undoubtedly
had mixed opinions. They'd say, `Oh, you play in the MAC.' ``But
for the next two days CBS will show the clips.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the off-the-ball work, the curling around screens, the
textbook shooting form. Of the 25-foot trey with four minutes
remaining, the flashing drive with 1:10 left. Of the game-saving
block. Here, America, is wall-to-wall Wally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity to play on the big stage,'' Szczerbiak
said. ``This is where you separate the men from the boys. The boys
went home, and the men are playing ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated had ventured to Oxford, a bucolic burg 45
minutes north of Cincinnati, to tell the tale of this transplanted
Long Islander, but before Friday the evidence regarding Szczerbiak
was uncorroborated. In a way that helped. Washington appeared to
have no idea who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of times down, I was as open as I've been all
year,'' Szczerbiak said. ``Whenever I drove, there weren't two or
three guys to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies refused to double-team Szczerbiak, a decision can
stand alongside the rollout of New Coke. He had 21 of Miami's 29
first-half points, 22 of 30 thereafter. ``This won't sound right,''
said Charlie Coles, the RedHawks' coach, ``but this was a team
effort.'' He was correct. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Szczerbiak watched from Row 1 of the Miami section,
literally leading cheers, even coaching a bit. ``Wally looked over;
I sort of told him to follow through on his shot.'' Walt Szczerbiak
knows a bit about watershed games: In addition to the 65 in Spain,
he had 31 points and 21 rebounds for George Washington in Madison
Square Garden against a UMass sophomore named Julius Erving. (Who
had, Szczerbiak cheerfully noted, 35 and 17 himself.)
</P>
<P>
   Said Walt Szczerbiak: ``This is what Wally does. He just steps
up. He's the type of player that it's killing him he missed his
last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wally Szczerbiak: ``My dad tends to think a little
pessimistically. But he's right. I was mad. It was one of the best
looks I had all day.

 &HT;    Oklahoma State not intimated by Auburn
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Thursday's glorified blue-and-orange scrimmage is
over. Having flicked away Winthrop like so much lint, Auburn begins
this NCAA Tournament in earnest today as an 11 1/2-point favorite
over Oklahoma State in the second round of the South Region. That
spread startled Cowboys' coach Eddie Sutton and bemused Adrian
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the (underdog) role,'' said Peterson, the senior guard
who scored 21 points in a 69-61 first-round win over Syracuse. ``It
let's you go out and play loose. You've got nothing to lose.
Auburn, they're the team that's got everything to lose. The No. 1
seed is expected to advance to the Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked hard all season and the hard work paid off for us
to receive a No. 1 seed,'' said Auburn's Scott Pohlman, the
sophomore guard from Roswell who had 14 points in the 81-40 blowout
of Winthrop. ``Seeds don't matter when you get this far in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly are deserving of the No. 1 seed,'' said Sutton,
who admitted that he was ``a little surprised when I picked up the
newspaper (Friday) morning and saw'' the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for an experienced team like Oklahoma State, in its
second straight NCAA and seventh in nine years under Sutton, the
only coach to take four different schools (Creighton, Arkansas,
Kentucky and Oklahoma State) to the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess us being here last year, we know the ropes now,'' said
the Cowboys' Joe Adkins, whose only basket of the Syracuse game
gave Oklahoma State the lead for good, 60-57. ``Auburn has not been
here (since 1988), so I guess you can give us an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet teammate Brian Montonati warns, ``Just because they haven't
been here, they're not going to show up dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sutton feels, ``They're the type of ballclub that could end
up in St. Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Final Four. So Sutton must combat Auburn's superior
depth, athleticism and size with his typically tight defense and a
slower-paced, half-court offense orchestrated by junior point guard
Doug Gottlieb. The nation's assists leader (8.6 per game), Gottlieb
had 11 versus Syracuse but didn't attempt a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Sutton himself. ``I think we have a great advantage
because coach Sutton (29-19 in NCAA play) has been here so many
times,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' said Sutton. ``Cliff Ellis is a
great coach. I don't know why Pete would say that, but I appreciate
the compliment. I'm one of the dinosaurs left in college
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   TITANIC TRIUMPH
</P>
<P>
   ``This was important for the city of Detroit,'' Detroit's
Jermaine Jackson said of the Titans' thrilling 56-53 upset of UCLA
Thursday. ``It showed that we can play with any team in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Including No. 4 seed Ohio State tonight. But then, 12th-seeded
Detroit (25-5) beat two-time Big Ten champ Michigan State the
previous three seasons and upset St. John's in last year's NCAA's
before claiming the greatest win in school history Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would see us as small but mighty,'' said senior forward
Bacari Alexander. ``It's like the elephant and the mouse scenario.
The elephant comes right at you. It's real big. But the little
mouse comes at you, you run away. That's what Detroit's about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So am I Cinderella?'' wondered Detroit coach Perry Watson
after ousting the most fabled name in NCAA annals. Now Ohio State
(24-8) must solve a Detroit defense that's No. 2 nationally
(allowing 54.7 points a game).

 &HT;    McDonald, UGA put ambitions to the test
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Quite often it's the little things that get
freshmen in trouble as they learn to adjust to the college game.
For Georgia center Tawana McDonald, it may be as innocuous as
raising her hands short of vertical while playing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, she's getting one or two fouls a game for doing
that,'' Georgia coach Andy Landers said. ``She doesn't get her
hands all the way up. It's due to inexperience, a lack of defensive
intensity and some bad habits that aren't glaringly bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But they have been tough enough to break thus far for McDonald,
who has fouled out of eight games and has gotten in early foul
trouble in some of Georgia's most important contests. It's what she
has been able to do when she does play that has Landers salivating
about the postseason prospects for the Lady Bulldogs, who play
Liberty today in their NCAA Tournament opener.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Landers had to be convinced of McDonald's potential
before she put on a Georgia uniform. He has favorably compared the
6-foot-4 Parade All-American from Flint, Mich., to former Georgia
greats Katrina McClain, Janet Harris and Tracy Henderson, post
players who took the Lady Dogs to Final Fours and national
championship games.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has the same ambitions with an underclass-dominated
squad that reached the NCAA first round last year but was missing
consistent post play. McDonald, who sat out the first seven games
of the season after suffering a sprained knee, has been trying to
catch up ever since. She leads the team with 46 blocked shots, but
often that has been her undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone out there at times being anxious and wanting to go
after people,'' McDonald said. ``I'm learning that I don't have to
block every shot. There aren't many people who can shoot over me,
so I might as well try not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half against Tennessee in the SEC Tournament finals
two weeks ago, she demonstrated her ``presence,'' as Landers calls
it. She scored nine points, getting most of them on impressive
drives to the basket from the top of the key, and grabbed seven
rebounds as Georgia led the Lady Vols.
</P>
<P>
   But after halftime she was whistled for two quick fouls and
eventually fouled out. Without her, Georgia's guards were stranded,
and Tennessee rolled to a 16-point win. For the season, McDonald
averages 8.8 points and a team-high 6.8 rebounds, but raising her
21.8 minutes-per-game average could be a critical factor for the
Lady Dogs in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a big key to our success,'' point guard Kelly Miller
said. ``It's really important to our team that she's able to stay
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, a high school teammate of Georgia reserve forward
Deana Nolan, brushes off the lofty comparisons. ``I really don't
think about it that much, I'm just trying to continue to do what I
need to get better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Landers thinks she's well on her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just keeps getting better and better,'' he said. ``She's a
great person with a great work ethic. Tawana McDonald's gonna be a
great player.

 &HT;    Georgia's Garr in welterweight title bout
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The only Atlanta boxer in a title fight tonight is
not predicting a round. Just a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they think this is going to be an easy fight _ I'm sure
that's what they think,'' said Stone Mountain, Ga., welterweight
Sam Garr, who fights for the welterweight title tonight against WBA
champion James Page on the undercard of the Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis at Madison Square Garden. ``But this is my
time to shine. When I go in there, I'm leaving with that belt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder the 29-year-old Garr isn't dizzy from the
altitude. He has never been in a fight of this magnitude, despite
an impressive 25-2 record and 23 knockouts in seven years of
boxing. Only two years ago, he was spending most of his time
supporting his wife and son in landscaping jobs. Boxing was a
secondary occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd work 60 hours a week, then go to the gym at night,'' said
Garr, a native of Quincy, Ill., and Atlanta resident since 1991.
``When I was working, I really couldn't get into the shape I am
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Garr said he had no problems making the 147-pound limit, even
though he generally has fought in the mid-150s. But even superb
conditioning doesn't make it any less surprising that Garr is here.
Last September, in a club show at the Roxy, he was stopped by
little-known Stephan Johnson in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   But Garr recently signed a four-year deal with promoter Don
King, and magically, a title shot developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a powerful man,'' said Garr, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He has fought once since the loss to Johnson, stopping James
Mullins in the second round.``I just took it as a way to grow,''
Garr said of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Page, who possesses good power, won a title elimination after
the belt was stripped from Ike Quartey.Other bouts:
</P>
<P>
   The other featured undercard bouts have heavyweight contender
John Ruiz (33-3) meeting Mario Cawley (21-1) and IBF junior
middleweight champion Fernando Vargas (15-0) meeting Howard Clarke
(26-10-2). Heavyweight Nate Jones (7-0), a 1996 Olympic teammate of
Vargas and Wells, also is on the card.

 &HT;    Holyfield's showdown with Lewis is personal
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man's entire career seemingly has been like one
big double take. So the fact that Evander Holyfield should once
again do something unexpectedly extraordinary is not itself
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the surprises don't usually come long before the
opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield steps into the boxing ring at Madison Square
Garden tonight, he will try to wrest the WBC title from Lennox
Lewis and fuse it with his WBA and IBF belts, unifying the
championship for the first time in over six years. Strangely, that
all has become a subplot.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to call his shot or ridicule his opponent, Holyfield
has continuously vowed to knock out Lewis in the third round and
minimize the talents of a heavyweight who is three years younger,
towers over him by three inches and has won 34 of 35 fights. The
reaction has been one collective ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be embarrassed,'' Holyfield said when asked if
he was concerned about the possibility of his vision not being
realized. ``But how can you be embarrassed by saying something you
know you can do. I don't feel any pressure. I know I'm capable of
taking this guy out in the first round. It's not like I even use
all the (weapons) I have when I fight. Sometimes I take the easy
way out. The whole thing is, I know how this man fights. I know
he's easy to hit. I know that if I hit him with the right
combinations, he's not gonna wanna take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been speculation that Holyfield is either, 1)
trying to pump pay-per-view sales, or, 2) shake Lewis' confidence,
he is not one to play mind games. When he says something, it's
because that is what he feels. As to why Holyfield maintains some
animosity against Lewis, it has far has less to do with Lewis's
crack about Holyfield being a Christian hypocrite than his Lewis'
previous charges that Holyfield was ducking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mike) Tyson always had that respect for opponents,''
Holyfield said. ``Lennox always wants to cheap-shot somebody. He
wants to make it more personal than it is. My whole thing is, it's
time to pay the piper. He'll pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis doesn't suffer, as Holyfield has forecast, the
British-born heavyweight will win over a number of critics who have
slammed him for not previously facing the division's strongest
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight is everything for him,'' said Emanuel Steward,
Lewis' trainer. ``His whole career will be defined on one night. If
he doesn't win and win aggressively, he'll never be considered a
great fighter or even a good fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis acknowledges he is perceived as a fighter who rarely
displays much heart or enthusiasm, but said, ``This particular
fight, Evander will bring out certain things in me the public
hasn't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield will try to get in close to Lewis, who has a 6
1/2-inch reach advantage, and counter his shots quickly with
combinations to the body and uppercuts. Lewis will try to keep
Holyfield on the outside with a punishing jab that he seldom has
showed, and attempt to physically dominate Holyfield inside by
grabbing his arms and behind the neck when the two are in clinches.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who Holyfield believes has the advantage?
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy, his power is his weakness,'' Holyfield said. ``He
leaves his hands out there (after the punch) so you can smash him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson couldn't stand pain so he had to fight back. Your chance
of knocking him out was greater. Lennox is another one of those
guys who just can't stand to get hit. He's going to come out
swinging, and by him being bigger than Tyson, that just makes him a
bigger target.

COMMENTARY: A HEEDLESS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It is the year 2002, and violence has erupted again
in Northern Ireland. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service decides to target for deportation all resident aliens who
have endorsed or contributed to Noraid, an American support group
for the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   One of those targeted is Padraig Phelan. He came to the United
States legally 22 years ago from Ireland and has a green card; his
wife and three children are American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he has attended some rallies for a united
Ireland, and given money to Noraid drives for schools and
hospitals. Citing those activities, the INS takes him into
detention. He goes to court, but the court says it is powerless to
intervene. He is deported.
</P>
<P>
   That could not happen here, could it? Yes it could, thanks to a
Supreme Court decision last month. It was a decision with great
potential impact, yet the court reached it almost off-handedly, in
a way that mocked its judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved eight aliens, resident in Los Angeles, whom
the INS has been trying to deport for 12 years. Various grounds for
deportation were asserted. But the underlying point was that the
eight were connected to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The PFLP is a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization
that has opposed peace deals with Israel and carried out terrorist
acts. But the INS did not assert that the eight had anything to do
with terrorism. The claim, rather, was that they had distributed
PFLP literature and raised money for such things as schools and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The eight asked the federal courts to stop the deportation
process on the ground that they had been selectively targeted in
retaliation for political activities protected by the First
Amendment. The trial judge, after extended hearings, found that
they had been, and enjoined the INS. A Court of Appeals panel
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The INS asked the Supreme Court to review the lower court
decision, asserting two claims: (1) that the First Amendment rights
of the eight had not been violated, and (2) that they had gone to
court too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court refused to hear the first but granted limited
review of the second claim, saying it would consider whether the
Immigration Act of 1996 barred the eight from going to court until
they were under final orders of deportation. The parties, following
the rules, briefed and argued only that question.
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court decided the case, it held that the 1996
law did bar the eight's lawsuit. That won the case for the INS. But
the court went on to address the question it had told the parties
it would not consider.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for a 6-3 majority, said an
alien against whom the INS moved had ``no constitutional right to
assert selective enforcement as a defense against his
deportation.'' In other words, targeting a group of aliens because
of their politics did not violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia went further, saying that the government could pick out a
group of aliens for political reasons but keep the reasons secret.
``The executive,'' he said, ``should not have to disclose the
`real' reasons for deeming nationals of a particular country a
special threat _ or indeed for simply wishing to antagonize a
particular foreign country by focusing on that country's
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   That sweeping language gives the government unreviewable power
to target legal immigrants for political reasons. In the time of
Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the administration could have
deported Chilean exiles who demonstrated against the dictatorship
of Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Even legal immigrants who have done nothing political can be
targeted to ``antagonize'' their country of origin. The INS would
deport them for technical violations of their status.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said selective targeting by the INS was not a
constitutional problem because deportation is not criminal
punishment. But the Supreme Court has held that a government agency
violates the First Amendment when it fires employees on a political
basis. That point would have been argued by counsel if the court
had not misled them by saying it would not consider the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's great power in our system is justified by a
process of decision that is principled and fair. In this case the
court subverted its process and broke its word. For those of us who
revere the institution, it was a depressing performance.

ACADEMY RECOGNITION OF KAZAN REOPENS AN OLD WOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, March 14 by NYTimes News Service) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite all the talk of wide-open Oscar races this
year, the most suspenseful moment at the 71st Academy Awards
ceremonies March 21 will come when 89-year-old Elia Kazan accepts
an honorary award for his distinguished body of work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a very good chance that the director of such acclaimed
movies as ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``On the Waterfront'' and
``East of Eden,'' the stage genius who was probably more
responsible than any other individual for making the naturalistic
Method the dominant acting style in American movies, will be
greeted by silence, by only scattered applause or, even, by
catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, while few if any would question that Kazan was a
great and highly influential filmmaker, many have never forgiven
him for naming names to the House Un-American Activities Committee
in 1952, at the height of Washington and Hollywood's anti-communist
witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of film-industry careers were damaged during the
McCarthy era. Those accused of, to paraphrase the government's
official question, now or having ever been members of the American
Communist Party, were given the damnable choice of either naming
colleagues and friends who had also been party members or, by not
informing, being blacklisted. Landing on the latter, secret roster
meant that individual would no longer be employed in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, whose brief membership in the party in the mid-1930s
genuinely soured him on communism, was the highest-profile liberal
to name names. Like many who cooperated with HUAC, he surely
despised the horrors of Stalinism and was concerned about America's
safety at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike others who buckled before the committee in order to
save their careers, Kazan has refused to apologize for his actions
since. Indeed, the day after his testimony, he took out an ad in
The New York Times that rationalzed his decision on political
grounds. The first film Kazan made after testifying was the
anti-communist ``Man on a Tightrope.'' The next one, ``On the
Waterfront,'' for which he won his second directing Oscar (the
first was for the 1947 expose of anti-Semitism ``Gentleman's
Agreement''), makes the most indelible case for whistle-blowing in
all of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that while the academy maintains the honorary
award was (and should be by others) considered purely in the spirit
of artistic merit, its action has rekindled 50-year-old animosities
and detonated a mushroom cloud of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that the academy _ which, normally, goes out
of its way to avoid controversy, particularly politically related
controversy _ is willing to stick its neck out in this instance,''
observes ``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic Leonard Maltin.
``Obviously, in doing so, they are trying to say that there are two
separate issues here. I kind of think they're right. But at the
same time, I wasn't around then, my life and career were not ruined
as a result of that witch hunt. I don't take lightly at all the
still-smoldering emotions that go with this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand why they feel compelled to do this;
all they're doing is opening old wounds,'' adds Rick Jewell,
associate dean of the Universty of Southern California's Film
School. ``If Kazan had never won an Oscar, then it would be a
different story because his artistic output is certainly worthy of
this kind of recognition. But since he won two of them, I just
don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while there certainly have been exceptions to the rule,
by far the majority of honorary Oscars have been given to the likes
of Alfred Hitchcock and Charlie Chaplin, major talents who
unaccountably failed to win competitive Oscars during their
distinguished careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do, I guess, is to put a period to this
whole, inflammatory history,'' Jewell says of the academy's Board
of Governors, which reportedly voted unanimously to give Kazan the
honorary award at the urging of the director's longtime friend and
collaborator (and past academy president), Karl Malden. ``Instead,
they've just caused it to flare up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky and Edward Dmytryk were deeply affected by the
blacklist. Polonsky, whose script for the 1947 ``Body and Soul''
was nominated for an Oscar, made his directing debut with the
highly acclaimed film noir ``Force of Evil'' a year later.
Blacklisted for refusing to divulge his political connections to
HUAC, he didn't direct again for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dmytryk was a member of the Hollywood Ten, a group of writers,
producers and directors whose refusal to cooperate with the
committee led to their being imprisoned for contempt of Congress.
But Dmytryk had a change of heart, became one of HUAC's star
witnesses and resumed his directing career, during which he made
such admired '50s films as ``Broken Lance,'' ``The Caine Mutiny''
and ``The Young Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky, 88, is among a group of blacklist survivors who are
encouraging Oscar ceremony attendees not to applaud when Kazan is
feted at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave in to the House committee, gave them the names of
friends and people he knew so he wouldn't be blacklisted, but they
were,'' Polonsky says of Kazan. ``I consider that immoral conduct.
But they say the award has nothing to do with a person's moral
conduct. In other words, if you are a mass murderer but you write a
good picture, the academy a right to give you an award for deeds
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's illogical that a great artist doesn't have a
morality and a point of view that goes into his work. That's why I
think the whole thing is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The 91-year-old Dmytryk argues that Kazan, like himself, was
indeed operating on moral principle when he told HUAC all that he
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long past time to (give Kazan) this award,'' Dmytryk
says. ``And I think the academy is being very courageous because I
know how much courage it takes. It's great in all ways; I don't
have any exceptions like so many people do, great work but lousy
politics. His politics were also good; he helped to undermine the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I want to make clear: The producers met on Nov. 25,
1947, and laid out the proposition, which they adopted, that nobody
who was a communist or an ex-communist could work in the business
at all unless they recanted. Now, that's long before Kazan
testified. In other words, the blacklist was not his fault or my
fault or anybody else's fault. So the constant blame that's been
made about the horrible things that happened to these families
because of the blacklist has been directed at the wrong people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been a quagmire of conflicting recriminations.
Hollywood communists often did support, or at least made excuses
for, Stalin's brutally repressive Soviet regime. Still, to
persecute members (or, more so, former members) of a legally
constituted political party, was, well, un-American in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole system of government is based on the whole idea that
you don't shut people up this way, that you have a right to have
your opinion,'' Polonsky notes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, the politically
conservative author of the highly critical study of communism in
the film community ``Hollywood Party,'' points out, ``Let's not
forget, this is the movies, this isn't the government. There's no
constitutional right to a lifelong, lucrative job as a screenwriter
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   And then again, as the widespread public disdain for Linda Tripp
proves, Americans have a fundamental revulsion for snitches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are reasonable rebuttals to the more
hyperbolic claims of both the left and the right. It's doubtful,
for example, that the eight people Kazan named before the committee
were hurt any more, at that point, than they already were. Most
historical accounts agree that these individuals were already known
to HUAC's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the fact that, at the time, America was strongly
anti-communist takes the wind out of the argument that justified
the whole Hollywood inquisition: that red influence in the movies
was somehow subverting the republic from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask Kazan, `Do you really think these people were
dangerous, a threat to this country?' '' says Richard Walter,
chairman of the screenwriting program at the University of
California, Los Angeles. ``They were self-important and, probably,
incredibly pompous, but a threat to this nation? Where is the
damage that they did?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever damage the Kazan honor does _ to individuals for whom
its brought back painful memories, to the academy's reputation or,
perhaps, to whomever agrees to present the honorary Oscar (noting
that it never reveals who will present which award, the academy
would not confirm widespread rumors that impeccably credentialed
liberals Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are the designated
presenters) _ there could be a silver lining to the whole
imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the recent, agonizing impeachment proceedings and Orange
County video store protests triggered extensive examinations of
freedom, morality and law, the highly publicized Kazan controversy
could lead to a wider and deeper understanding of those troubled
blacklist times _ a period which, as Hollywood Ten member Dalton
Trumbo famously noted, produced only victims.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ulu Grosbard (``The Deep End of the Ocean''), who
worked with Kazan in the 1960s, expresses an objective attitude
shared by many who appreciate the devastating complexities of that
trying time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him very charming. I got a good deal out of working
with him. I liked him,'' Grosbard says of Kazan. ``Yet you were
always aware of what he did. It's difficult. I'm conflicted about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Reisman, a past president of the Writers Guild of America,
currently sits on the guild's Blacklist Credits Committee. The
committee has researched and assigned proper credit to 82 films
that were written under pseudonyms or through a front by
blacklisted writers between 1948 and 1961. Six new corrections were
announced last week to somewhat more media attention than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really timed (to capitalize on the Kazan
controversy); however, people make that implicit connection, which
is fair,'' Reisman says. ``It's just there. I think that there will
be more public awareness about the blacklist now. It does bring it
to the fore because of Kazan's prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may, in the long run, be good for society. Although of
course, some would understandably rather forget, if not forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm irritated, but not cast down by this,'' Polonsky says,
``because I know, having lived a long life, that one of the things
I can always count on is that whatever happens will be
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky laughs, but there's no mistaking the sad resignation in
his voice when he says, ``I thought the blacklist was over with.
Now I find out it's still alive.''

Texas Tech tightens defense for NCAA voyage 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In quiet moments, the tormenting demons resurface for Texas Tech
guard Rene Hanebutt. She'll be walking to class or resting in bed
when visions of leprechauns dance in her head.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly leprechauns. More like Notre Dame basketball
players, firing in long-range jumpers over the top of Tech's
matchup zone defense. Or scoring at will inside, when Hanebutt and
friends scramble to stop the onslaught from outside.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 51 weeks since Notre Dame put the brakes on Tech's
1998 NCAA Tournament run with a shocking, 74-59 upset in Lubbock.
As the Red Raiders (28-3) prepare for today's opening-round game of
the 1999 tournament against Stephen F. Austin (17-11) at Lubbock
Municipal Coliseum, they are determined to use last year's
surprising second-round exit as fuel toward the program's sixth
trip to the Sweet 16 since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have nightmares about that game,'' said Hanebutt, a
senior from Bowie. ``That was one of the most disturbing losses of
my career. It's definitely been in the back of our minds all year
that, once we get to the NCAAs, we won't let something like that
happen to us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players echoed similar vows. In fact, the Notre Dame loss
hit such a nerve with Tech coach Marsha Sharp that she used it as
the springboard to overhauling her defensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Fighting Irish hit 50 percent from the field
in that contest, Sharp switched her team's primary defensive
alignment from zone to man-to-man. Tech, the No. 2 seed in the NCAA
Midwest Region, has limited opponents to 40.1 percent shooting this
season, with an increase of two turnovers per game by its foes.
</P>
<P>
   The change, Sharp said, ``makes me feel safer'' in matchups
against teams with top-notch perimeter shooters. In the estimation
of rival Big 12 coaches, it also makes Tech a more versatile and
more dangerous team than at this time last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, they're better,'' said Iowa State coach Bill
Fennelly, whose team fell to Tech, 73-59, last week in the final of
the Big 12 tournament in Kansas City, Mo. ``It takes a lot of
courage for them to make a change like that to try and get to the
next level. But it's worked out well and it's been a great step for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska coach Paul Sanderford said: ``I think it's one of the
best stories this season, from a national standpoint. Texas Tech
had a great team last year. But Marsha was disappointed in what
they did in the NCAAs. So she vowed that this team was going to be
better on defense and be able to play more than a zone. Believe me,
they've done it. We couldn't do anything against them.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 77-59 loss to Tech in the semifinals of the Big 12
tournament, Nebraska's top scorers, guards Nicole Kubik and Brooke
Schwartz, combined to shoot 25 percent from the field. In the first
half of a regular-season meeting on Jan. 20, Tech limited Iowa
State's starters to a combined 1 of 23 from the floor while
amassing a 28-9 lead en route to a 71-47 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers, Sharp said, are encouraging. But even more
encouraging might be the resolve of the Lady Raiders to capitalize
on lessons learned against Notre Dame. Of the nine members of
Tech's regular player rotation, eight suited up in last year's loss
to the Fighting Irish. All are eager to begin making amends for
that debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still in the back of our minds and it's been there all
year,'' point guard Melinda Schmucker said. ``It's not going to go
away until we do something about it. The lesson we learned is to
take one game at a time and not take anyone lightly. Because of
that game, we realize how critical every possession in each game
is. Last year, we weren't ready to go out and play that type of
game.''

TAPE STICKS B. LABONTE TO POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Bobby Labonte used a fresh qualifying engine, and
mass quantities of tape, to get inside Mike Skinner's head at the
Atlanta Motor Speedway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The grille on his Pontiac Grand Prix taped tight to cut down on
wind resistance, Labonte toured the 1.54-mile quadoval in 28.437
seconds and 194.957 mph to win the pole position for tomorrow's
NASCAR Cracker Barrel 500.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, whose 1998 early-season nose-dived after he crashed in
the rain-delayed event here last March, was taking notes as Labonte
exited the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that thing taped way, way off,'' said Skinner, who
subsequently secured the No. 2 qualifying position with a hot lap
at 194.226 mph. ``It was pretty intimidating when he ran that lap.
It probably made me drive a little harder, and our car got really
loose in turns 1 and 2. We just couldn't get the balance good
enough to tape it up solid. I know that if you tape it up close to
solid, you get a lot more straightaway speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte had enough horsepower to become the first two-time
pole-winner of the 1999 Winston Cup season. Labonte also qualified
first last week at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway en route to a
fifth-place finish on Sunday. But this is AMS, where Labonte has
won three of the past five races. The native Texan captured last
spring's Primestar 500 after starting 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things on this race car I don't know about,'' said
Labonte, driver of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac owned by
Joe Gibbs. ``But I'm confident enough when I get into the car I
don't have to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that this place here takes a lot of power. For down
here, \Rengine builder\S Mark Cronquist and all the guys in the
motor room, they had a qualifying motor that was really stout.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs' in-house engine program has allowed Labonte to qualify in
the top 10 for the first four events of 1999. Jeremy Mayfield, who
qualified fifth yesterday in the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus, is the
only other driver to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Labonte is the man here,'' said Skinner, the series
points leader and driver of the No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet Monte
Carlo. ``But Atlanta is not a bad racetrack for me. When we got
hurt here, it was a freak thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 25 drivers secured starting spots in what will be a
43-car field. Rookie Tony Stewart _ Labonte's teammate _ qualified
the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac third at 194.192 mph. He was followed
by Dale Jarrett, Mayfield, Geoffrey Bodine, rookie Buckshot Jones,
reigning Cup champion Jeff Gordon, Joe Nemechek and John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   Among those failing to make the first-day cut were seven-time
Cup champion Dale Earnhardt (30th) and Las Vegas 400 winner Jeff
Burton (33rd). They are among 22 drivers who will have the option
of either standing on their speeds or requalifying today.

   But 20-year-old Miramax, a onetime low-budget art-house upstart
turned Hollywood juggernaut, gradually seems to be winning the war
for the hearts and minds of Oscar voters.
</P>
<P>
   With a total of 23 nominations this year, including best-picture
nods for ``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,''
Disney-owned Miramax is leading the Oscar field for the second time
in the last three years. In 1996, the company scored 20
nominations, winning for best picture (``The English Patient''),
best director and in several other major categories.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Spielberg's World War II
epic, remains the odds-on favorite to cart home the best-picture
prize this year, Miramax co-chairman and brothers Harvey and Bob
Weinstein have waged an expensive, aggressive bicoastal ad campaign
to boost their films' chances, particularly those of ``Shakespeare
in Love,'' whose 13 nominations are the most for any film this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The current campaign echoes 1994, when Miramax's ``The Piano''
was duking it out for best picture with another Spielberg project,
``Schindler's List,'' the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, independent film companies, with Miramax
at the forefront, have steadily been gaining ground on the major
studios as the unofficial arbiters of Oscar taste. That trend seems
likely to continue, whatever happens March 21 at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, where the 71st annual Academy Awards will be
held.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rice, president of marketing for October Films, which
received two nominations this year for the feature film ``Hilary
and Jackie'' and one for the documentary ``The Last Days,'' says
the Weinsteins' Oscar success has helped other independents make
inroads in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they're big, I think their heart and soul,
certainly with the Miramax label, will always be independent,''
Rice says. ``It doesn't hurt to have a well-capitalized company
that can provide you with a marketing war chest, like they have
now, to raise the consciousness of the public and of the academy
members to the kinds of pictures that they make and the kinds of
pictures that we make.''
</P>
<P>
   What this success bodes for the future of independent film is a
more complex question. A central issue is whether Miramax, whose
high-end movies such as ``Shakespeare in Love'' now cost tens of
millions of dollars, still can be called an ``independent'' film
company in any meaningful sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess independent conveys a certain sort of edginess and a
certain subversiveness and a certain challenge to mainstream cinema
or mainstream ideas, a certain toughness, or a film that takes
risks,'' says critic Peter Biskind, author of ``Easy Riders and
Raging Bulls,'' a study of Hollywood filmmaking in the 1960s and
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these are all cliches, but taken altogether, I think
that, for me, to some extent, is what I expect from an independent.
And I don't think you can say anything like that about `Shakespeare
in Love.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hoberman, chief film critic of the Village Voice, says he
``doesn't really regard'' Miramax as an independent company, as he
did when it was distributing such movies as ``The Crying Game''
(1992) and Errol Morris' controversial documentary ``The Thin Blue
Line'' (1988), which resulted in a Texas Death Row inmate being set
free.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gill, president of Miramax L.A., says he agrees that
``Shakespeare in Love'' is not a cutting-edge film. But he points
out that Miramax continues to release many films every year made
for $3 million or less that deal with controversial subjects, in
languages and styles as far removed from the mainstream Hollywood
vernacular as Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which stars director Roberto
Benigni as a father attempting to shield his son from the horrors
of a Nazi death camp, Gill says, ``If you know a (riskier) film
last year, I'd like to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you, we are in no way shaping Oscar's tastes,''
Gill says. ``We are making more of the kind of movies that Oscar
voters like, so if you want to use the baseball analogy, we're up
to bat more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film
Festival Group, believes that both ``Life Is Beautiful'' and
``Shakespeare'' were ``more adventurous than your standard studio
(fare) in terms of the subject matter'' and ``the risks they
took.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miramax is a very interesting company because it still has a
very broad mandate, and I still think that Harvey (Weinstein) is
trying to fight the good fight in terms of an art cinema, an
art-house cinema,'' Handling says. ``But he's involved now with
films that are grossing $100 million a year, which takes the energy
of that company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at `Good Will Hunting,' which is far less
experimental than some of Gus's (director Gus Van Sant's) early
work,'' Handling continues. ``At the same token, you look at
`Jackie Brown,' which is a pretty adventuresome commercial film,
which didn't quite succeed, and I really have great respect for
(Miramax) financing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Miramax has had a number of breakout
movies, including ``sex, lies, and videotape'' (1989), ``The Crying
Game'' (1992), ``The Piano'' (1993) and ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1996, when ``The English Patient'' won the
Oscar for best picture and only one of the other four nominees
(``Jerry Maguire'') was distributed by a major studio (TriStar),
that newspapers and entertainment publications proclaimed the
``Year of the Independents.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Miramax's Harvey Weinstein demurred that the
success of the independents was only ``the luck of the draw,'' and
that the studios might well be back on top in 1997 _ as they were,
to an extent, with James Cameron's ``Titanic'' blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ``year of the independents'' tag was questionable to
begin with, given that many independents are now owned by major
studios, such as Fine Line (Time Warner).
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in that `year of the independent,' the four
nominated films were so disparate that they reflected nothing,
other than corporate bylaws,'' says Mark Urman, co-president of
Lions Gate Films Releasing in New York, whose ``Gods and Monsters''
and ``Affliction'' received a combined five nominations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood observers say that the major studios no longer
particularly care about winning Oscars the way they did 30 or 40
years ago. Miramax and smaller independents, some say, have been
able to fill a void created when the majors stopped making as many
prestige pictures and turned their attention more to adolescent and
action fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad overview is, the studios are largely out of the
Oscar game,'' says one veteran industry observer who requested
anonymity. ``They're in it to oversee those special films that come
along once in a while, a la `Titanic' or `Braveheart,' that are
tied to a major filmmaking talent that they're in business with.
That's why they're in that business at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Vogel, a veteran New York media analyst, believes the
majors ``do care, sure, on a studio level'' about winning Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you'd have to say that, in the greater scheme of things,
it means less and less from an investor standpoint, because these
companies are so huge,'' Vogel says. ``Look, Time Warner gets over
40 percent (of its revenues) from cable. So it's more important
what happens with AT&AMP;T and Time Warner cable than what happens if
one film wins a second award on Oscar (night). It really doesn't
have that much of an impact on the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly makes a film ``independent'' has become
increasingly hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Gilmore, director of programming for the Sundance
Festival, says that expensive movies with fairly big-name casts,
such as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' represent one end of an
independent spectrum that has been and will continue to be highly
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not simply a question of the amount of money involved in
a picture, or it's not simply a question of where that money comes
from, but it's really a complex of issues, and it's very hard to
define,'' Gilmore says.
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate's Urman says that a number of so-called ``small
films'' _ ``and not just via Miramax'' _ have begun to go far at
Oscar time. That, he believes, will create more opportunities for
independents next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly you have a very large population exposed to a film in
which the female lead has a penis (`The Crying Game'), or exposed
to a film in which an Australian pianist experiences some sort of
redemption (`Shine') and on and on and on,'' Urman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, whenever a film does 10 times what a successful
independent film should do, it increases the possibilities for all
of the films. And it creates, as we all must be concerned with, an
audience that is more receptive to trying it again.'' &UR;

 &HT;    Doctors' office offers environmentally friendly design, but at a
price
 &HT;    By Lawrene Trump
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ In a marriage of development and
conservation, local builders are starting to think green.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentally friendly building techniques and materials are
improving every day. They still cost more than traditional
practices, but the difference is shrinking and some customers are
starting to demand them, builders said.
</P>
<P>
   At the owner's request, the Rocking Horse Center, a new doctors'
office across from South High School, includes some recycled
materials, extra insulation and geothermal heat, said its designer,
Springfield architect Stephen L. Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The carpet is made from recycled carpet fibers; the vinyl
wallpaper used no heavy metals in its processing, and the restroom
stall doors and enclosures are made from recycled milk jugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 11 years I've been in business, this is the first client
who said this is a priority,'' Sharp said. ``It's not something
people think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp designed the building, but his colleague, architect Ken
Shook, did the leg work to find the materials and make them work.
</P>
<P>
   Shook found the restroom stalls _ Hiney-Hiders, the Santana
Company cheerfully dubbed them _ in Scranton, Penn.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus he found Semco, a window manufacturer that uses some
recycled wood inside its window frames. Homasote, Inc., which
produces message boards from post-consumer recycled paper, is based
in West Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The recycled plastic stalls cost 30 percent to 40 percent more
than new plastic ones, but the premium seemed worth it to Rocking
Horse founder Dr. Jim Duffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to be aware of how we use our nonrenewable
resources,'' Duffee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to provide an example for businesses in Springfield
and Ohio. We're putting up a building as energy-efficient as we can
make it in an area that traditionally has a high density of
hazardous environmental exposure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Old, multiunit rental houses, such as those replaced by the
Rocking Horse Center and still surrounding it, often have peeling
lead paint and crumbling asbestos, Duffee said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical offices will attempt a paperless system; records
transferred there will be scanned into the computer, then shredded
and recycled. Some other Ohio doctor's offices use the method,
Duffee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any doubt this is the way of the future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,500-square-foot building is the largest commercial
building in the area to use geothermal heat.
</P>
<P>
   Danco Enterprises, the Springfield company installing the
building's geothermal heating system, has installed nearly 500
geothermal systems in homes all over southwest Ohio, owner Dan
Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's company had a booth at the recent home show at the
Upper Valley Mall, and public interest seems to be growing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that turns people off is the price. It's about
$5,000 more than anything else, but the operating cost is so low in
three or four years that difference is paid back'' through utility
bill savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About $30,000 of the Rocking Horse building's $1 million cost
was for the heating system.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen wells, each 300 feet deep, hold hoses that allow the
heating system's water to go down, up, down, up and back to the
furnace, where, warmed to the earth's year-round temperature of 55
degrees, its heat is electrically boosted to run a hot-air blower
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the next four years you'll see some major changes''
in building choices, Lehman said. ``Fuel prices are cyclical, and
they will go back up. That's why I got in the business in '76.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago Danco dropped everything else and went only to
geothermal installations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've converted some all-gas customers to all-electric and
actually cut their utility bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until alternatives to burning fossil fuels cost the same as
conventional systems, homeowners won't choose them, said David
Bohardt of the 1,000-member Homebuilders Association of Dayton and
the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to sell the value of what's inside the walls of the
house. It's not at all from a builder's unwillingness to build
houses with these features,'' Bohardt said. ``It's that, if a buyer
has to choose between a hot tub or increasing the insulation,
they'll end up soaking in the tub.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty to 30 percent of new homes have more than the minimum
recommended insulation, he said, but many are putting in
super-efficient gas furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Sherry, president of the 80-member Clark County Builders
Association, said some local developers are pioneering green
practices.
</P>
<P>
   A superinsulated masonry home built by Springfield developer
Randy MacGillivray is one of two in the country being reviewed by
the Research Institute of the National Association of Homebuilders,
Sherry said.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Hibner, program manager at Dayton Power and Light's Energy
Resource Center, said about 20 percent of the 2,000 calls each
month to the company's 1-800-WAYTOGO energy hot line are from
homeowners concerned about energy efficiency in their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest is growing. Not at a tremendous rate, but it's
growing steadily,'' Hibner said.

GREENE BRACES FOR SPRING TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The Anaheim Angels' Todd Greene will get his
first start at catcher in a Cactus League game next week, a chance
to test his surgically repaired right shoulder _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Greene hasn't caught in a regular-season game with the Angels
since 1997, the shoulder injury preventing him from making a throw
to second base. He tried to catch last season in a minor-league
rehab assignment, but the pain persisted and the club decided to
use him at DH, first base and in the outfield after he was called
up in August.
</P>
<P>
   Greene went through an extensive rehab program during the
offseason and has been careful not to try to do too much this
spring. The Angels are hoping the shoulder will be strong enough to
allow him to catch a couple of times a week once the season starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being smart about it,'' said Greene, who has been used
exclusively as a DH this spring. ``I'm definitely eager, but this
is a marathon, not a sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the first baserunner attempts to steal on Greene next
week?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to throw him out ... I'm going to try to, anyway,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will also have to deal with the long layoff from
catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be rusty, I'm sure,'' he said. ``I'm catching as
many bullpens as I can, even though that's not the same as a game
situation. But I'm getting my work in.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher feeling great: Starter Tim Belcher allowed three runs
(two earned) and four hits in four innings Friday in the Angels'
10-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Tucson Electric Park. The
Angels fell to 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who made 62 pitches and plans to get up to 75 in his
next start, said he's feeling great physically and is getting his
work in, ``except for putting guys away with two strikes. Every run
I've given up was driven in after I had the guy 1-2 or 0-2 at some
point during the at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chuck Finley recovering from a muscle strain in his upper
back/neck, Belcher is one candidate to be the opening-day starter
if Finley can't go. Belcher has started on opening day two times in
his career, but both were in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A., Orel (Hershiser) had an emergency appendectomy one
week before the season,'' Belcher said. ``And last year in Kansas
City, Kevin Appier was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to be lucky ...: The Angels had only two hits Friday, and
both should have been caught by White Sox center fielder Tyrone
Pendergrass. Pendergrass lost Reggie Williams' fly ball in the sun
in the sixth inning, the ball landing on the warning track and
Williams reaching third with a triple. Mo Vaughn hit a fly ball to
the same area in the seventh, only Pendergrass slipped and fell
while retreating for the ball, Vaughn reaching second with a
double.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox starter Jim Parque (Crescenta Valley High) pitched
four perfect innings.

IN NABISCO'S RETURN TO ITS OLDER SELF, MEMORIES OF A BUYOUT
STRATEGY'S FLAWS

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)  
 (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When RJR Nabisco Holdings' plan to split itself into two
companies made headlines last week, a notorious chapter in the
history of corporate restructuring came closer to an end. But no
one waxed nostalgic for the good old 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a collective sigh could be heard as RJR, a symbol of
that era's daring experiment in financial engineering, began its
transformation back into two companies, as was the case 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The leveraged buyouts of that decade _ when financiers like
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. took over established companies using
immense issues of high-yield debt, hoping to whittle them into lean
operations and sell them for a profit _ did little for the target
companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to KDP Investment Advisors, a Montpelier, Vt.,
research firm, of the 25 cases between 1985 and 1989 where
companies were saddled with more than $1 billion in high-yield
debt, almost half defaulted on their loans. Even more filed for
bankruptcy or sold off substantial assets. Meanwhile, bond holders
who got stuck with the junk watched its value drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was called `the Debacle,''' said Kingman Penniman,
president of KDP, referring to the number of companies that could
not pay their debts. ``A lot of these investors were not creators
of new companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The debacle was due, in part, to a slowing domestic economy
early in the 1990s. Companies burdened with billions in loans and
faltering earnings stumbled under the strain _ perhaps most notably
RJR Nabisco, which might have split up sooner, or grown its food
business faster, were it not for its big interest payments, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
   Many debt-laden companies emerged as more efficient operations,
but not without great personal and social costs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, companies and investors learned several lessons. And
experts say it is questionable whether the United States market
will again see the types of deals that were common a decade ago.
The percentage of junk bonds borrowed by leveraged-buyout firms
hovers at 15 percent of all high-yield offerings, said Dwight
Sipprelle, co-head of global high-yield operations at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, down from 50 percent peak levels in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Companies today are less apt to borrow without good reason.
``It's cheaper for companies to issue stock than debt,'' Penniman
said _ though, of course, interest rates are lower on today's junk
bonds. And corporate managers have greater personal incentives, in
the form of stock option packages, to increase shareholder value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond issuers, too, have become more disciplined as the
high-yield market has matured. ``Some things are just too risky and
won't get done,'' Sipprelle said. Still, high-yield debt is one of
the few remaining investments that can deliver double-digit
returns, so many investors will snap up bonds representing even the
most aggressive financing.
</P>
<P>
   Another change from the 1980s is that corporations are now more
likely to use junk bonds to finance expansion as well as
acquisitions, particularly in hot growth areas like
telecommunications, cable and media. This harkens back to the
period before the leveraged-buyout boom, when respected companies
like MCI Communications and Time Warner used junk bonds to
jump-start their growth in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Viatel, a fledgling global long-distance provider that went
public in 1996, borrowed $900 million through high-yield debt in
1998 and is raising more money that way to help expand its network.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, consolidation, the major theme in this decade's
merger wave, is still a driver of the leveraged market. Last week,
Allied Waste Industries, along with two financial buyout firms,
announced a friendly acquisition of the trash hauler
Browning-Ferris Industries, financed in part by borrowing $9.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, too, is discovering American-style merger financing.
Consider Olivetti's $60 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia.
Such a bold move would have been unthinkable a few years ago, in
part because continental Europe essentially had no high-yield
market.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the biggest risk in this era's high-yield lending?
The same one that caused the last debacle: a downturn in the
economy or an industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market is humming along, things are great,''
said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance in the graduate
school of business at the University of Chicago. ``The risk is _
and this has not yet been tested in this market _ if there is a
downturn and companies have to make interest payments. If you can't
make it, you've got a problem.''

10TH MEMBER TO BE FORCED OUT IN SALT LAKE CITY SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's executive board voted
Friday to force out a 10th member and censured two others involved
with the Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not prepared to stand for improper behavior on the part
of our members,'' said vice president Richard Pound of Canada,
after the board decided to expel Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa, censure board members Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Phil
Coles of Australia, and warn seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Four members have already resigned amid the worst corruption
case in modern Olympic history and five others have been expelled
pending a formal vote of the full IOC next week at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   After the Salt Lake ethics panel last month added 10 names to
the list of alleged wrongdoers and more than three dozen bid cities
from other years provided additional information, it seemed
possible that the IOC would purge as much as a fifth of its 114
members.
</P>
<P>
   But the six-member investigative panel concluded that only
Wallwork, whose wife obtained a $30,000 loan from Salt Lake
committee chief Tom Welch, deserved expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who chaired the panel, denied that one expulsion among 13
cases amounted to a whitewash. ``It isn't a whitewash at all,'' he
said. ``It is a very serious rebuke that has been made public
throughout the world. This is unprecedented, as far as I can
recall, in any sports organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the IOC's rules allowed for a range of punishments between
expulsion and a warning, Pound said some of the wrongdoers would
have been more harshly disciplined. ``I wish our charter had a
series of escalating sanctions in it, but it doesn't,'' he said.
``It's either one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   So the panel devised three levels of warnings _ severe censure
(Kim and Coles), a ``serious'' warning (Vitaly Smirnov of Russia,
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Mohamed Zerguini of
Algeria, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, and Anani Matthia of Togo),
and a less severe warning (Austin Sealy of Barbados and Willi
Kaltschmitt of Guatemala). The panel exonerated three members _
Henry Edmund Olufemi Adefope of Nigeria, Ashwini Kumar of India,
and Rampaul Ruhee of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the highest-ranking IOC member punished, still could be
expelled if the IOC concludes that he knew that Salt Lake
subsidized his son's telecommunications job in Utah. ``We believe
there's outstanding evidence still out there,'' said Pound. ``We
deliberately left that case open.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first group of members forced out in January, most of
whom took cash payoffs or subsidies for family members, those
punished Friday were guilty of lesser offenses such as accepting
paid vacations and plane tickets, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were on the hospitality or the gift side,'' he said.
``It seemed clear nobody on either side (the Salt Lake bidders or
the IOC members) was taking these things seriously. They should
have been, but they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging that those punished Friday were at least
guilty of poor judgment, the IOC panel said that the Salt Lake
bidders had targeted certain members, especially those from
warm-weather countries, as likely voters and urged them to accept
trips and gifts as tokens of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to think we're ducking this
responsibility,'' said Pound. ``We're taking it on. We just did not
want it to go unnoticed that not all off the blame can be placed at
the IOC's doorstep.''

ANALYSIS: REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HOPE CORE ISSUES CAN BRIDGE A
DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (wg) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they seek their way after the impeachment trial,
congressional Republicans have gone on the offensive against
President Clinton on national security and foreign policy, while
taking stands on Social Security and education that they hope will
give them some claim to these popular domestic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   This balancing act is reflected in the issues that Speaker
Dennis Hastert has identified as the four ``pillars'' of Republican
policy in the 106th Congress: Social Security, tax relief,
education and national defense. In two of these areas, Republicans
admit they are playing defense; Democrats have long had the
public's trust on education and Social Security. So the Republican
aim is to look interested and responsible enough in these issues to
shield from attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cutting and national security, by contrast, are still issues
on which Republicans hold a slight edge, an advantage they hope to
rebuild into the potent political force of a decade ago when they
were twin tenets of Reaganism. But the Republican leadership's
decision to wall off Social Security funds from budget pressures
has limited its ability to propose large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   So congressional Republicans have turned a laserlike focus to
national security as a way to distinguish themselves from Clinton.
The Senate has passed a military pay hike bill. The House Thursday
debated _ and narrowly supported _ the president's policy toward
Kosovo. Both chambers plan to consider measures next week to
promote a national missile defense. Republicans are calling for
large increases in military spending. And on several fronts they
are investigating the administration's response to suspicions that
China stole nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly stand for a far, far different foreign policy
than the one that is now going from embarrassment to near
humiliation in places like Kosovo and our China policy,'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., said this week on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Reagan presided over the end of the Cold War. Public
interest in foreign policy has waned since the collapse of the
Soviet Union. And the foreign policy consensus of the last
half-century has been unraveling. Still, national security is an
arena that appeals to congressional Republicans for several
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they sense that it is an area of vulnerability for a
president who has repeatedly bested them on domestic issues but has
had trouble articulating a compelling vision of a post-Cold War
foreign policy. ``There's a very strong sense in Congress that the
administration has conducted an episodic foreign policy that
careens from area to area,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   National security is also an area that resonates with the
Republicans' conservative base without alienating moderates and
swing voters the way social issues do. ``Missile defense is a great
issue with our base, but also a decent issue with the public and a
very good fund-raising issue as well,'' said one Republican
strategist, saying that the old Reagan dream of a defense shield
can still pull in direct mail contributions for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Republicans see national security as an area that
can give them the unity of purpose they lack right now on domestic
issues. ``It's really seen as one of the core beliefs,'' Lazio
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is whether Republicans can really gain traction
on national security.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating their push, Clinton responded by trying to co-opt
the issue the same way he did with Republican initiatives to
balance the budget and overhaul welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Pentagon and trying to head off the
Republican Congress, Clinton this year proposed the first real
increase in military spending since the Persian Gulf War. He also
proposed a 4.4 percent across-the-board increase in pay for the
military in December along with other raises and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans one-upped him by approving a 4.8 percent
across-the-board increase and other benefits in the first bill they
considered after the impeachment trial _ a bill so expensive that
no one quite knows how Congress will be able to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Republicans are nowhere near as united on foreign
policy and national security issues as they might wish. The last
Congress brought a tug and pull between Republican
internationalists and populists over issues like trade and funding
for the IMF and for the United Nations. And Thursday's debate on
whether to authorize U.S. troops in Kosovo, far from showing
Republican unity, instead displayed a deep Republican divide over
America's role in the world.
</P>
<P>
   While Hastert supported the president's proposal to send troops
to Kosovo as part of a NATO force until a peace settlement is
reached, his majority leader and whip did not.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who had invoked the memory of the
nations' war dead during Clinton's impeachment trial, made a strong
appeal to the party to recognize the importance of the U.S. role in
NATO. ``We have had more years of continuous peace in Europe since
the days of the Roman Empire,'' he said. ``NATO is not only worth
it. It works, and the United States of America is the leader of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a moral obligation on those people who have
the resources to intercede when people are being wantonly,
atrociously killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said ``there is genocide
all over the world.'' He asked, ``Are we going to send troops
everywhere where genocide is committed? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans, he said, ``should be the job of the Europeans. It
is their job now that the Cold War is over. The United States of
America shouldered its share of the burden for stability in the
whole world in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like that left Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader, accusing the Republicans on Friday of being more
isolationist than internationalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for politically attractive issues,'' he said.
``A more isolationist, `defend America first,' fortress America
stand, to many of their constituents is a politically popular place
to be.''

AS LONG AS HE KEEPS HIS HEAD, LEWIS HAS LITTLE CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gary Bell has had his bell rung by both men so when
he chimes in with an opinion on the outcome of Saturday night's
heavyweight title unification fight between Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis, it is a learned one.
</P>
<P>
   Bell knows Holyfield and Lewis because he's been hit by them
both, which is the best way to understand what they will be about
when they square off at Madison Square Garden to settle the issue
of who is the real heavyweight champion of the world. Bell has
prepared Lewis for fights with Tommy Morrison and Ray Mercer and in
recent years he has sparred regularly with Holyfield, although he
did not work with him for this fight because his height did not
approximate Lewis's 6 feet 5 inches. Still, Bell knows what each
man will carry with him into the Garden and he says the choice is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield,'' Bell said. ``Keep your eye on his left hook.
That's what will do it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is a big man, but you can walk through his left hand.
I'm not going to lie to you. His right hand is a hammer but his
left hand is nothing. So I believe Holyfield will be able to get
inside Lewis's jab and when he does his hand speed will decide the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Lewis will come out and try to jump on Evander the
way he did (Andrew) Golota (whom he KOd in one round), but Evander
doesn't throw one punch at a time like Golota. He throws four,
five, six punches at a time and they can overwhelm you. I don't
think he can do it in three rounds, like he said. I think six
rounds myself. By a left hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has nearly as many supporters as Holyfield with many of
the predictions of doom for Holyfield centering on a belief that he
is finally at the end of his fistic rope. This had been said after
he lost to Michael Moorer and before he defeated Mike Tyson and if
it is said often enough about a 36-year-old fighter it eventually
will come true. But it shouldn't on this night unless Holyfield
gets so wrapped up in his talk of a third-round knockout that he
forgets who he has always been _ a professional.
</P>
<P>
   A professional prize fighter adjusts to situations and
opponents. He does not get angry when he is called a hypocrite, as
Lewis has called Holyfield repeatedly by challenging his religious
beliefs with the reality of the five children Holyfield has
fathered out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   A professional prize fighter ignores the personal differences
and does not go for knockouts that are not there. He does not
become involved in the hype of a big fight. If Holyfield can
maintain that professionalism he will win, unless his legs suddenly
to stone and his arms to dead weight because he has faster hands,
more skill, and a stronger will. But if he tries to turn the fight
into a brawl, he could lose because Lewis brings with him a right
hand like the hammer of Thor.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has 27 knockouts among his 34 wins and most of them have
been the result of that clubbing right. It lands not with an
exquisite snap but a dull thud. It does not explode on a man, it
dents him and sends him to the floor the way a piledriver sends a
steel rod into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Such a weapon is dangerous and Holyfield has to understand that
or he will find out the hard way. In the past, Holyfield has been
able to get inside even his biggest opponents, such as Riddick Bowe
and George Foreman, and throw hooks and uppercuts in close, two
punches Lewis doesn't particularly like to see coming. It is likely
he will be able to get inside against Lewis as well because his jab
is not formidable despite trainer Emanuel Steward's insistence that
it will be Saturday night. If Holyfield gets inside, he will be
able to negate the power of Lewis's long right, which has to be
thrown at a distance to be most effective, and slowly carry the
day.
</P>
<P>
   But what Holyfield must avoid is rushing headlong into one of
those right hands or being kept at long range, where Lewis can paw
him with his jab and slam him with the right behind it. At a
distance, Lewis has the advantage, as Steward has been telling him
for 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is very determined to be aggressive but not reckless,''
Steward said. ``One of my concerns is that he'll go out and be
overly aggressive. He has to press the fight but be alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox knows what this fight means to his career. If he loses,
he'll be just a kid with dreadlocks who came over here and through
vacations (vacant titles) won two (World Boxing Council) titles.
He's going to have to live the rest of his life on this
performance. Lennox has to win this fight or he's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do that he has to get his feet under him and stay balanced
to fire a hard jab. Not a pawing jab like he throws sometimes but a
hard jab. If he does, Holyfield will have to make great alterations
in his style to get inside.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis can do that, Holyfield will have a hard time hitting
him and a harder time avoiding the right hand that has turned so
many nights to Lewis's advantage. That may be why Holyfield has
made such a point of predicting a third-round knockout _ to lure
Lewis into the kind of attack he can counter.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has clearly been irked by Holyfield's dismissive
prediction but some believe it is just part of a psychological
battle designed to get Lewis to come out throwing his most potent
weapon in order to make a point. If Lewis does that, Holyfield
believes he is fast enough to counter it and land first, as Shannon
Briggs did in the first round of his fight with Lewis when Briggs
stunned Lewis with a counter punch that had him in trouble until
Lewis regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes three rounds, it can't be nothing but a slugfest,''
Steward said. ``Emotions are running pretty high. This could turn
into Hagler-Hearns. I think that's what Evander wants. He wants to
come out like Hagler.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, he may end up like Hearns _ unconscious _ because
that is not his fight. Holyfield has spoken often about his
knowledge in the ring and how it has led to many victories. That is
what he must focus on Saturday night because the one clear edge he
has is that he is more skilled and more willful than Lewis. He must
turn the fight into a test of skills and wills because he can win
on both counts. What he cannot win is a test of raw power, which is
the fight Steward hopes it will become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would you pick if you had Sandy Koufax pitching to Ed
Kranepool?'' said Don Turner, Holyfield's wise, old trainer. ``I've
got the better fighter. This isn't about the trainers. The fight is
decided by the fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is, the best fighter needs to remember who he is. He is a
wise guerilla warrior who wins the battle by winning many small
skirmishes first. If Holyfield is content to do that, he will wear
down Lewis, who has always shown signs of fading in the second half
of his fights, and stop him late.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Holyfield could get hit and suddenly turn into an old
man victimized on a dark street corner, which is what happened to
his longtime stablemate and old friend, Pernell Whitaker, several
weeks ago against Felix Trinidad. But what people seem to forget is
that Lewis keeps talking about how he will finally have the stage
to make the world see his greatness that has been long hidden.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters speak as if Lewis is 23 and Holyfield Methusela
as they discuss how Steward has been working the rough edges off
his fighter. What needs to be remembered is that Lewis is 33, not
23. If he still has rough edges after five years and nine fights
with Steward, they are not going to be polished off. They are
permanent flaws. If Lewis was a great heavyweight, would we not
have seen a hint of it by now?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is we have not and we will not. If he wins by knockout
Saturday night, we will not see the greatness of Lennox Lewis
finally shining through. We will have witnessed the greatness of
Evander Holyfield finally fade away.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bet on that. Not on this night anyway.

A PROUD BUT PENSIVE MOMENT IN WARSAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NATO, NATO-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ In what will hardly be the last adaptation the
Polish military will have to make, an honor guard performed an
unusual flag-raising ceremony after dark here Friday night to mark
the moment that Poland became a member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In a simple affair by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Pilsudski Square, timed to the official ceremony in Independence,
Mo., the red-and-white Polish flag went up alongside NATO's
blue-and-gold, marking the end to a generation of ideological
division.
</P>
<P>
   As fireworks exploded over the vast square, Boleslaw
Siematkowski began to cry. Now 75, he was a captain in the Polish
Home Army that fought alongside the Allies in World War II, then
saw his family deported to Siberia by the victorious Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we stand a chance as a nation,'' he said. ``We stand a
chance not to be taken into captivity, to be imprisoned or
threatened, so we can live in human dignity in a free country that
has earned its freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Siematkowski gestured to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where
many of Poland's battles for sovereignty are chiseled on plaques.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, when Polish soldiers imposed martial law on the
Solidarity trade union and much of Polish society, passers-by would
sometimes spit when they passed the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   But since the end of the Communist regime, the list of battles
on the tomb has been expanded, to include the struggles against
Moscow, the battles of the Polish Home Army and even the uprising
of the Warsaw ghetto in October 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of us fought for freedom and our pilots flew for
Britain, and then at Yalta they just gave away this land to
Stalin,'' Siematkowski said. ``It was a betrayal of Poland.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he have confidence in NATO now? ``It means a lot,'' he
said. ``It means our security.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall Polish captain, with a red beret sitting jauntily, said
he felt that Poland's new alliance ``is generally positive.'' Asked
if he was ambivalent about it, he laughed and said: ``No, not
ambivalent. What's happened has happened, and I suppose it's better
like this. Any time you get a strong ally, it helps. But after all,
it's only the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wieslaw Prokop, bearing his own Polish flag, said he was
disappointed that only a few hundred people had come to the
freezing square, still marked by the morning's snow. ``This should
be celebrated more,'' he said. ``I suppose it's the weather. But
anyone who thinks about Poland's future is happy today.''
</P>
<P>
   A medium-sized country like Poland, ``stuck between Russia and
Germany,'' he said, ``cannot afford to stay on its own, to stay
neutral.'' At last, he said, ``we are with the West, with the
Americans, whom we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Piotr, 22, an engineering student, said he had come to the
square ``because this is a historic event.'' No one really fears
the Russians now, he said, but NATO is an ``important psychological
guarantee, and it helps us forget the awful period under Russia.''
Anyway, he said, ``the Polish army could do with some help.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an important theme in the Polish press Friday, with the
daily Zycie, or Life, running a long and depressing analysis of the
poor discipline and drunkenness in the heavily conscript Polish
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wait to be proud of their army,'' said Tomasz
Wroblewski, who edited the paper's special NATO section. ``They're
tired of being ashamed of our soldiers, of seeing them drunk and
not well equipped.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Poles, Wroblewski said, NATO membership is an important
symbol ``of security and prestige.'' He described some journalists
as walking around the newsroom Friday with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few think war is feasible,'' he said. ``But this helps this
complex of ours: We feel like we are in the West and feel we are no
worse than Austrians or Germans, but we are considered Easterners.
And now we are on the other side.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's most successful and influential
newspaper, had a typically wry headline: ``If Today Is Friday, Then
We're in NATO.'' But the paper also ran a front-page article that
it had solicited from President Clinton, in which he, or his speech
writers, praised Polish aid to the American Revolution and Polish
courage through the centuries, saying that now ``we are not only
friends but allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper also ran an article by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the
Polish-born national security adviser to President Carter, in which
he suggested that the current round of NATO enlargement might be
the last for a long while. All three new members have urged NATO to
keep expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Marek Ostrowski of the weekly Polityka said some Poles still
mistrusted any security guarantee, misunderstanding how the world
had changed since 1939, when British and French guarantees of
Polish sovereignty proved hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly there is satisfaction that we have definitely changed
camps,'' he said. ``We were forced to be part of the Soviet camp
against our will. Then we were sort of liberated, but in this gray
zone not belonging to anyone, and now we are somehow raised to this
Western camp under American protection. That is the mood. We
remember that it was you Americans who pulled Europe out of the
mire in 1944, not anyone else, so we want NATO to remain strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations in Hungary and the Czech Republic were also
low-key. NATO members' flags were raised outside the Hungarian
defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague there was a small rally Friday, and President Vaclav
Havel, who had pushed the Czechs into NATO, said in a statement,
``Never have we been part of such a broad, solid and binding
security alliance which at the same time respects in its essence
the sovereignty and will of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Havel is to be host at a celebratory ball in Prague Castle on
Saturday night, but the only official ceremonies Friday were local
ones in the North Bohemian town of Liberec. That is the home of the
Czech unit that specializes in defense against chemical weapons. It
is the only unit of the Czech army thus far that is fully
integrated into NATO's rapid reaction forces.

 &HT;    Carmike CFO steps down
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carmike Cinemas Inc. announced Friday that Chief
Financial Officer John O. Barwick, who has been with the company
for 22 years, is resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Barwick said he plans to focus on other business activities. The
company has not named a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is difficult to leave something that I have been a
part of for so long, it is time to take a new direction,'' Barwick
said. He also resigned as treasurer and senior vice president of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Carmike's stock closed down 50 cents Friday at $16. The stock is
down 21 percent year to date and well off its 52-week high of
$33.18 3/4, set in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of the nation's largest movie theater
operators, with 2,752 screens at 488 locations in 36 states. But it
has been hurt by lower attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Carmike said it expects to suffer in the first
quarter of 1999, but the second quarter should get a boost from the
release of ``Star Wars, Episode I Phantom Menace,'' which is the
latest in the ``Star Wars'' series.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, the company reported a
loss of $43.6 million, or $3.87 per share, after restructuring
charges totaling $73 million.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber analyst Christopher Dixon says Barwick's departure
should not have a major impact on the company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmike certainly has a very strong management team going
forward,'' Dixon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's basic strategy is to serve ``secondary markets,''
or cities of 75,000 to 200,000 population. Its multiplex theaters
consist of 15 or 16 screens vs. the giant theaters of as many as 30
screens rising in larger cities.

WADLEY OVERCOMES INJURY TO LEAD DEFEAT OF KENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Temple coach John Chaney wasn't going to play Quincy
Wadley, the junior guard who hasn't been able to touch a basketball
with his left hand for the last two weeks without feeling
breath-stealing pain, the result of a deep bruise he sustained
against the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   What changed Chaney's mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept beating my ear to death,'' Chaney said after Temple's
61-54 win over Kent State University, the kind of smallish team
Chaney said he dreads playing.
</P>
<P>
   When Chaney finally relented and inserted Wadley into the game
90 seconds into the second half, Temple led by only 4, 31-27.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Owls guard Rasheed Brokenborough had given up on seeing
Wadley on the floor. ``Nobody knew he would play,'' Brokenborough
said. ``Coach wouldn't let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quincy went over to our trainer, asked him to tell the coach
that he was all right to play. Then he went to Coach and said,
`Coach, this is our last game of the year if we lose. If I get
hurt, I'll have all summer to heal.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it make a difference he was in the game? We were up by 4
when he came in. The next time I looked up at the clock, we were up
by 15.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wadley hitting his first shot, a 3-pointer, and flummoxing
Kent with his harassing defense, the Owls pulled away with a 17-2
run in which the Golden Flashes scored just one basket in a
five-minute stretch. ``He was everywhere, man,'' Chaney said of
Wadley. ``He was like one of them (Kent guards). A little
leprechaun.
</P>
<P>
   Wadley said the pain was tolerable. ``It feels all right,'' he
said, ``except when there's contact. But I just had to suck it up
and play through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   During Temple's run, Kent turned the ball over three times and
had a shot blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a big impact in our zone,'' said Brokenborough, who
matched fellow guard Pepe Sanchez for a game-high 15 points, while
grabbing seven rebounds in 39 minutes, one fewer than Sanchez
played in a turnover-free wire-to-wire performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the back of our zone, and could react to their
guards quicker than our big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent State coach Gary Waters, whose Mid-American Conference
champions lost in their first-ever tournament visit, said that
Wadley's play ended the hopes of the 11th-seeded Golden Flashes
meeting in-state rival Cincinnati in a second-round game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put pressure on us at the right time in their zone, and I
thought it took us out of the things we needed to do,'' Waters
said. ``They do such a good job of helping down inside that it's
really hard to score in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent trailed by only 4 at the half, 31-27, as guard Andrew
Mitchell hit all three of his 3-point attempts, including one at
the buzzer. But Nate Meers, the team's most dependable long-range
scorer, couldn't shake a shooting slump (1 for 15 from behind the
arc in three games) until he made three shots in the last 2:27. And
freshman Trevor Huffman, the team's top scorer off the bench, had a
sprained ankle and was scoreless in his seven minutes of action.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the third time in the last five years, the Owls will be
facing the Bearcats. In each of their previous two meetings, they
were bounced from the tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Brokenborough is the only Owls player still on the roster from
the last time Cincinnati eliminated them, in Orlando, and he wasn't
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Prop 48, man,'' Brokenborough said. ``I could have gone
to the game. There was a school raffle to go there, and I won it,
but Coach didn't want me to go. He didn't want anybody to say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokenborough said he didn't think Chaney would use history as a
motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't ever use anything as a motivator,'' Brokenborough
said. ``He tells us what we've got to do. He knows our defense is
going to keep us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Brokenborough said, this Cincinnati team doesn't have
the shooters that its predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you say,'' Chaney said when asked about the
Bearcats. ``But they'll find a way to shoot over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadley said his hand hurt most when he dived on the floor after
a loose ball. He also accused a Kent player of trying to hurt him
deliberately. He wouldn't name the player, but he threw a nasty
elbow at Kent forward Geoffrey Vaughn that led to some serious face
time before referees intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to,'' he said. ``I had to protect myself. I'm not out to
hurt anyone intentionally, but when somebody is trying to hurt me,
he's telling me, `I'm going to do such-and-such to your hand,' I've
got to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have the basketball. There was no reason for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for at least another game, the basketball still belongs to
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tough guys,'' Chaney said of Cincinnati. ``They play
tough, with a confidence bordering on arrogance. But our chances of
winning that game are a lot better than winning against Kent State,
playing against the little guys.''

CENSURE OF TOP DELEGATE RAISES DOUBTS ON REFORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: South Korea, Samoa)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee on Friday censured the most
powerful delegate implicated in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal,
but stopped short of recommending his expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC issued a severe warning to Kim Un-yong of South Korea,
whose son and daughter received jobs at the behest of Salt Lake
City bid officials. Kim is an influential member of the IOC's
executive committee who has been mentioned as a successor as
president to Juan Antonio Samaranch. Kim had vowed to vehemently
fight an attempt to expel him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will most likely leave the committee vulnerable to
accusations that it was setting a double standard in disciplining
its members. The Kim case has been scrutinized by Olympic
officials, sponsors and investigators as a measure of the IOC's
seriousness in reforming itself after 30 delegates _ more than a
quarter of the entire assembly _ had been implicated in the Salt
Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC invited further doubt about its intentions to reform by
shifting the blame in a report issued Friday, saying that its
delegates fell prey to insistent gift-givers from Salt Lake City
and that the U.S. Olympic Committee should have provided better
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Reports previously issued by Salt Lake City and the USOC harshly
criticized the IOC's culture of expecting extravagant favors and
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any notion that arms were twisted to accept cash payments or
other gratuities is pretty transparent,'' said Jeff Benz, a San
Francisco lawyer, who was a member of the USOC commission that
investigated Salt Lake City. ``The whole notion of entrapment
appears to be created by an organization that has run out of viable
explanations for why its members failed to follow their own
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten IOC members have resigned or been ousted, including Paul
Wallwork of Samoa, who was recommended for expulsion Friday because
his wife received a $30,000 loan from Tom Welch, who was president
of the Salt Lake City bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   That Wallwork and a handful of African delegates, who were
relatively powerless, face expulsion while an influential member
such as Kim received merely a warning has struck some observers as
a sign that the IOC is not dealing equally with all members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy is insignificant compared to Kim; they get rid
of him instead of the big shots,'' said John Lucas, an Olympic
historian and retired Penn State professor. ``Many will rightly say
there's a double standard. The IOC is going to have to live with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior IOC member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that Friday's decision was ``worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up with a double standard, big fish, little fish,''
the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for one of the 11 worldwide corporate sponsors of
the Olympics, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
his company was monitoring the Kim case with particular interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been told to go as far as they can,'' the spokesman
said. ``That implies expelling the people they've already
recommended. There are also expectations that they will take care
of the hard ones.''
</P>
<P>
   An IOC commission, headed by Richard Pound of Montreal, found
Friday that Kim had created an unacceptable appearance of conflict
of interest in arranging for his daughter, Kim Hae-jung, to play a
paid performance with the Utah Symphony Orchestra during Salt Lake
City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The commission also
criticized Kim's involvement in obtaining a college scholarship for
a Russian woman whose father was the director of a record company
that issued recordings by Kim's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegation against Kim is that his son, known
as John Kim, was hired by a Salt Lake City satellite communications
firm and that his salary of $75,000 to $100,000 was paid by the bid
committee. The senior Kim has denied knowing of the reimbursement
by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's IOC report said it was highly unlikely that Kim was
unaware of the arrangement with Salt Lake City, but that the
available evidence is not conclusive. The case remains open, Pound
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm carefully reviewing the report and I look forward to
continuing to work with my colleagues in the IOC and the Olympic
family toward advancing the goals of the Olympic movement,'' Kim
said in a statement.

CALHOUN FIGHTING STOMACH VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ First, a coaching update: University of Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun is expected to be on the sideline Saturday when
the top-seeded, third-ranked Huskies (29-2) face ninth-seeded,
25th-ranked New Mexico (25-8) in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who sat out UConn's first-round victory over Texas-San
Antonio Thursday night because of a stomach virus, attended the
team's morning practice but returned to his hotel afterward without
speaking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   In a taped interview conducted at McNichols Arena after the
practice, Calhoun said aside from being fatigued from medication,
he felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Saturday's contest, he said, ``I just need to get
more rest, and I will probably get another shot (Friday night) but
I 100 percent plan to be there when we face a very good New Mexico
basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   As for New Mexico, Lobos coach Dave Bliss said Friday he saw
UConn's victory over St. John's in the Big East tournament
championship game, and added the Huskies' efforts in the first two
minutes made him sick to his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known at that time we would face them in the NCAA
Tournament I would have thrown up right there,'' said Bliss, whose
team defeated Missouri, 61-59, in the first round. Friday he
rendered unyielding praise for the tem that stands in the way of
the Lobos' first trip to the Sweet 16 since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a difficult task for us,'' said Bliss. ``Connecticut
is arguably one of the best teams in the nation,'' said Bliss.
``They have high-profile players and are on a mission to accomplish
that which a lot of good teams try and accomplish at this time of
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is without question the most formidable opponent New
Mexico has faced. The Lobos lost to Western Athletic Conference
opponent Utah three times and also suffered setbacks to Washington,
Texas-El Paso, and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they feature two of the best players in the nation in
center Kenny Thomas (18.5 points per game, 9.9 rebounds) and guard
Lamont Long (16.9, 6.5). The latter hit a pull-up jump shot with
6.1 seconds left to lift the Lobos past Missouri. The former, a
potential NBA lottery pick, is very difficult to defend one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of similarities of certain people in the Big
East,'' said UConn associate coach Dave Leitao. ``He can take you
outside and face-you up like (Notre Dame forward) Troy Murphy does.
He has a post game that's extremely effective like (Miami forward)
Tim James does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presents a real prowess, because if it was one thing, if he
were a back-to-the-basket guy, we could prepare for that. But if we
stop that he has an answer. He's going to face-you up and take you
outside, so we really have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Leitao said UConn's interior players Kevin Freeman and Jake
Voskuhl will be key against Thomas. The latter had four of UConn's
10 blocks against UTSA. ``Interior defense has been their
specialty, especially Jake,'' he said. ``They take it as a
challenge, whether it's a Thomas or a James or a Murphy, they zero
in on how best to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten Huskies played against Texas-San Antonio, eight 17 minutes
or more. UConn's depth and fast-break attack wore down the pesky
Roadrunners, particularly in the second half, and it will try to do
the same against New Mexico, which relies heavily on its starting
lineup (four of its five starters average at least 33 minutes a
game).
</P>
<P>
   ``We know their backcourt can definitely shoot the ball,'' said
UConn guard Khalid El-Amin. ``We just figure if we get our press
going early and get the ball out of their hands _ and get the
forwards bringing up the ball and keep it out of their guards'
hands _ that will work into our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seed Arkansas (23-10) will meet No. 5 seed Iowa (19-9) in
the other second-round game in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas will try to wear down Iowa with its athleticism and
3-point shooting. Iowa is riding an emotional wave as it tries to
extend the career of coach Tom Davis, whose contract is not being
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has repeatedly said he hasn't had time to think about his
final game with the Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope it lasts, but you know it could end any time,'' Davis
said Friday. ``You know the end is near and you just don't know how
and when.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which beat Alabama-Birmingham, 77-64, Thursday, also likes
to run and press. But the Hawkeyes will probably try to slow the
tempo down a little after the Razorbacks' 94-80 win over a Siena
team that tried to run with Arkansas in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in a street fight with (Arkansas coach)
Nolan Richardson,'' said Iowa forward Jess Settles.

10TH MEMBER TO BE FORCED OUT IN SALT LAKE CITY SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's executive board voted
Friday to force out a 10th member and censured two others involved
with the Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not prepared to stand for improper behavior on the part
of our members,'' said vice president Richard Pound of Canada,
after the board decided to expel Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa, censure board members Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Phil
Coles of Australia, and warn seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Four members have already resigned amid the worst corruption
case in modern Olympic history and five others have been expelled
pending a formal vote of the full IOC next week at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   After the Salt Lake ethics panel last month added 10 names to
the list of alleged wrongdoers and more than three dozen bid cities
from other years provided additional information, it seemed
possible that the IOC would purge as much as a fifth of its 114
members.
</P>
<P>
   But the six-member investigative panel concluded that only
Wallwork, whose wife obtained a $30,000 loan from Salt Lake
committee chief Tom Welch, deserved expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who chaired the panel, denied that one expulsion among 13
cases amounted to a whitewash. ``It isn't a whitewash at all,'' he
said. ``It is a very serious rebuke that has been made public
throughout the world. This is unprecedented, as far as I can
recall, in any sports organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the IOC's rules allowed for a range of punishments between
expulsion and a warning, Pound said some of the wrongdoers would
have been more harshly disciplined. ``I wish our charter had a
series of escalating sanctions in it, but it doesn't,'' he said.
``It's either one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   So the panel devised three levels of warnings _ severe censure
(Kim and Coles), a ``serious'' warning (Vitaly Smirnov of Russia,
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Mohamed Zerguini of
Algeria, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, and Anani Matthia of Togo),
and a less severe warning (Austin Sealy of Barbados and Willi
Kaltschmitt of Guatemala). The panel exonerated three members _
Henry Edmund Olufemi Adefope of Nigeria, Ashwini Kumar of India,
and Rampaul Ruhee of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the highest-ranking IOC member punished, still could be
expelled if the IOC concludes that he knew that Salt Lake
subsidized his son's telecommunications job in Utah. ``We believe
there's outstanding evidence still out there,'' said Pound. ``We
deliberately left that case open.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first group of members forced out in January, most of
whom took cash payoffs or subsidies for family members, those
punished Friday were guilty of lesser offenses such as accepting
paid vacations and plane tickets, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were on the hospitality or the gift side,'' he said.
``It seemed clear nobody on either side (the Salt Lake bidders or
the IOC members) was taking these things seriously. They should
have been, but they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging that those punished Friday were at least
guilty of poor judgment, the IOC panel said that the Salt Lake
bidders had targeted certain members, especially those from
warm-weather countries, as likely voters and urged them to accept
trips and gifts as tokens of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to think we're ducking this
responsibility,'' said Pound. ``We're taking it on. We just did not
want it to go unnoticed that not all off the blame can be placed at
the IOC's doorstep.''

WISTFUL CLINTON DEDICATES BOYHOOD HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPE, Ark. _ President Clinton took a sentimental journey to one
of his boyhood homes here Friday, but a driving rain and a chilly
wind dampened the turnout and cast a dispirited pall over the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain makes this day more poignant for me,'' the president
said as he stood under a tent in front of the modest white
clapboard house where he lived until he was 4. He did not explain
that remark, but his comments were filled with references to family
and old friends that seemed melancholy and reflected a sense of
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember throwing a pocketknife into the ground on that
backyard I shared with my friend Vince Foster,'' Clinton said,
invoking the name of the boyhood friend who later, as Clinton's
White House counsel, committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching the old telephone when it rang, always
hoping that it was Mother calling from New Orleans,'' Clinton said.
After he was born, his mother left him here for two years with her
parents while she went to train as a nurse-anesthetist in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to take special meaning from a conversation he
recalled having with his late Uncle Buddy, who was having a hard
time coping when his wife developed Alzheimer's disease. It is
hard, the uncle had said, ``but I signed on for the whole load, and
most of it's been pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rain soaked the crowd of a couple of hundred of Clinton's
most stalwart supporters, and bounced off several empty folding
metal chairs, Clinton added: ``In this town, from my family and
friends, that's what I learned _ to sign on for the whole load.
Though far from perfect, I have tried to do just that for my family
and my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here alone _ Mrs. Clinton stayed in Washington _ to
dedicate his home, called the ``Clinton birthplace'' although he
was actually born in a hospital. The dedication was to be held last
fall, but Clinton's impeachment hearings in the House interfered
with the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton was sending a message about loyalty in the aftermath
of his impeachment and his admission that he lied about having an
affair with a White House intern, a few of those who have known him
a long time responded.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Thompson, 49, an optometrist who has known Clinton since
high school, said in an interview: ``In my life, my family and my
friends _ a lot of them have disappointed me. But when you're
family and friends, we try to stick together so we can get over it.
And I feel like I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of his oldest confidants, Thomas F. McLarty III, a
boyhood chum who served as his first chief of staff in the White
House, said: ``You feel a sense of disappointment, but growing up
you're taught to support your friends in good times and bad. I
think he's paid a heavy price personally, certainly with his
family, but I think he's accepted full responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people declined to comment after the brief ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 1992 campaign for president, Clinton has mythologized
Hope in the Lincoln tradition of humble origins, and he has used
this tiny town in southwest Arkansas as a personal touchstone. He
stood Friday before a banner proclaiming ``I still believe in a
place called Hope'' and listened to a chorus of children sing a
hymn to him with that refrain.
</P>
<P>
   The house has been restored and was opened to the public on June
1, 1997. It was stocked with '50s-era furnishings and a few old
photos of Clinton. The only item that Clinton actually owned that
is on display is a book called ``The Kitten's Surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the timing of the dedication Friday, Beckie Moore, executive
director of the Clinton Birthplace Foundation Inc., said: ``This
was the first time he was able to arrive in Hope for a happy
occasion. He's returned to Hope four times _ three times for a
funeral and once when one of his relatives was very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   He had also scheduled four fund-raising events in the area, two
Friday night and two on Saturday night in Little Rock.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The foundation, begun in 1993, had a goal of raising $1.5
million for the restoration but has raised about $900,000. The
Arkansas Legislature earlier this week rejected a bill allocating
$500,000 for the project, apparently because of an unrelated
budgetary argument.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the contributions to the foundation, which is
tax-exempt, have come from unusual sources. These include Nina Wang
of Hong Kong, reputed to be Asia's richest woman with an estimated
worth of $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wang reportedly gave $50,000 for the Clinton birthplace at
the behest of Mark Middleton, a former White House special
assistant who lost his access to the White House in 1995 after
allegations that he had improperly used the White House restaurant
to entertain business clients. Middleton was part of a network in
Little Rock that aggressively solicited Asian business for Arkansas
when Clinton was governor and became embroiled in the controversy
over campaign donations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After his sentimental journey through Hope, and a stop by his
mother's gravesite on his way out of town, Clinton was headed over
the Arkansas border into the Texas half of Texarkana. There, he
planned to help Rep. Max Sandlin, a second-term Democrat, raise
more than half a million dollars at a $100-a-person reception and a
$1,000-a-person dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the dinner was Truman Arnold, the Texas oil magnate
and former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Arnold left the committee after suggesting it publish a brochure
outlining how much access financial contributors would receive to
the White House in exchange for donations of certain amounts.
Clinton planned to spend Friday night at Arnold's home.

PACKER HAS NCAA DYNASTY OF HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Packer's first Final Four championship game also was John
Wooden's last. As it happened, that March day in 1975 turned out to
be a particularly meaningful one for both men.
</P>
<P>
   In defeating Kentucky, the Wizard of Westwood won his final NCAA
title as coach at UCLA. The game marked the end of college
basketball's greatest dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Packer began his own amazing streak that day, however; this year
he will call his 25th consecutive NCAA men's basketball
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden's finale, Packer said, ``was special in the history of
college basketball.'' But, he added, many other championships in
the last quarter-century have stood out as he has watched from his
seat at center court.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova coach ``Rollie Massimino's upset win over Georgetown
\Rin 1985\S,'' Packer said, was equally special. North Carolina
State coach ``Jimmy Valvano's win \Rover Houston in 1983\S,'' was
another.
</P>
<P>
   One game sticks out for an entirely different reason. That was
the Indiana-North Carolina final in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember walking into the arena in Philadelphia,'' Packer
recalled, ``and someone telling me that President Reagan had been
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Which just goes to show that if you hang around the gym as long
as Packer has, you can put even a simple game like basketball into
a context of historic importance.
</P>
<P>
   Packer's context dates to his days on the court when he was a
star guard at Wake Forest. He played in the 1962 Final Four, where
Wake Forest fell in the semifinals to an Ohio State squad led by
John Havlicek and Jerry Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Not many basketball fans watching CBS' tip-to-buzzer coverage
this weekend and next will remember Packer the player, but they'll
surely recognize Billy the broadcaster. Having worked the
tournament, both for NBC and CBS, with announcers such as Curt
Gowdy, Dick Enberg, Gary Bender, Brent Musburger and, now, Jim
Nantz, Packer is an institution, even if he doesn't see himself
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think they are the game, that they're the story,''
he observed. ``I get a kick out of that. When I'm not broadcasting
the NCAA Tournament anymore, there still will be a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer said he has never been comfortable being the star of the
show. He recalled the time he spent on air with Enberg and former
Marquette coach Al McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where we were bigger than the game,'' he
said. ``I would rather it be like three good referees, where some
fan says, `Man, that was a great game.' Then the other guy asks,
`Who were the refs?' And his response is, `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Packer hardly shrinks from stating his views, however, and that
has always gotten him his fair share of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have opinions,'' he stated. ``It's because of my
position. And I do feel I'm knowledgeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer is confident enough, or maybe just honest enough, to
admit that he doesn't have the game plan on every one of the 64
teams entering the annual madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not smart enough to really sit down and watch tapes of a
hundreddifferent teams,'' he said. ``You do your research on the
games you're assigned to.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament has changed plenty over the years, evolving into
college sports' biggest event, one that has earned the moniker
March Madness. Asked to name the most significant changes to the
tournament in the past 25 years, Packer cites the expansion of the
field to 64 teams and the balancing of tournament brackets.
</P>
<P>
   A more subtle, but no less significant factor, he added, was the
increased racial integration of teams in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, ``A major talent pool \RAfrican-American
players\S had been prevented from participating,'' Packer said.
``We're not talking about a hundred years ago, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer hasn't been around for quite a century, but he is old
enough and experienced enough to have been involved in the
desegregation of college basketball in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Such personal experience is a big piece of the Packer package,
and is reflected in his philosophy of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say what you see,'' he said, ``and have as much research and
background available that you can tie things together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older,'' he adds, ``you do get a little bit of
perspective.''

IS BENTLEY HIDING A GRIN BEHIND ITS STIFF UPPER LIP?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Few things in business are more delicate than the
mystique of a luxury automobile brand. So one might have expected
Volkswagen AG and its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, to handle last
year's takeover of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, after all, remains most famous for the homely but
inexpensive ``people's car'' now known as the Beetle, while
Rolls-Royce is revered for regal limousines once driven by the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   But if evidence at the Geneva Motor Show this week is any guide,
the gloves are off. In a startling glimpse of what may lie ahead,
Piech proudly introduced a new ``concept car'' for Rolls' Bentley
line that looks as if it came from a different planet.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the Bentley of today is a sober and somewhat boxy sedan
that amounts to a sportier version of a Rolls-Royce, the
``supercar'' being shown this week is a sleek and low-slung muscle
car with a 623-horsepower engine lodged right behind the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The car is only a prototype. But it signals an aggressive new
direction for what had been Britain's most prestigious car maker.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley executives say Piech personally began pushing for a sexy
new design last September, shortly after VW acquired Rolls-Royce
from Vickers PLC. Piech reviewed a collection of ideas from
Bentley's sketchbooks and immediately seized on the idea of a
futuristic high-performance sports car that in some ways would
harken back to Bentley's roots building some of the sleekest racing
cars of the 1920s. Volkswagen engineers rushed to turn the drawings
into a working prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from Piech, Volkswagen also designed an entirely
new 16-cylinder engine to be mounted in the middle of the car, a
departure from anything Bentley has done before.
</P>
<P>
   All this is in sharp contrast to the deferential, hands-off
approach that the Ford Motor Co. took when it bought Jaguar in
1989, or that BMW followed when it bought Rover Group in 1990. Each
took pains to preserve their acquisitions' Britishness and gave
them great autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In BMW's case at least, the kid-glove strategy backfired. BMW
invested more than $4 billion in Rover, but the company kept losing
hundreds of millions of dollars a year, prompting the ouster last
month of BMW's chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder. New BMW
management is tightening its grip on Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Piech's challenges with Rolls-Royce and Bentley are different
and in some ways more perplexing. Among the thorniest is what to do
with the Rolls-Royce brand. VW will own the name only until 2003,
when it must be surrendered to BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen won a bidding war with BMW for the Rolls-Royce
company, which produces both the Rolls and Bentley lines, but the
rights to the Rolls brand name and the coveted double-R logo
remained in a legal quagmire. Rolls Royce PLC, a separate company
that makes aircraft engines, had veto power over transferring the
name to a foreign company, and it sided with BMW, with which it has
a joint venture to produce jet engines.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive wrangling, Piech agreed to settle the fight by
giving up the Rolls-Royce name after five years.
</P>
<P>
   At the Geneva Motor Show, the results were a striking contrast
between the two brands' exhibits. The Bentley concept car, which
the company calls the Hunaudieres Project, for a stretch on the Le
Mans race circuit, attracted great attention; the Rolls exhibit
nearby, with little new to offer, remained a lonely outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Piech seems intent on injecting new electricity into the
venerable brand he gets to keep, but he doesn't want to alienate
traditional customers with designs that are too modern, too trendy
or perhaps simply too German. In a sign of how seriously he takes
that problem, Piech has arranged to fly a half-dozen members of
Britain's Bentley Drivers' Club to VW headquarters in Wolfsburg,
Germany, this week for a two-day peek at his latest projects, and
to have their cars shipped there for the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dr. Piech wants to know from us is what we perceive to be
the historical values of Bentley motor cars,'' said Michael
Sanders, a businessman who is also chairman of the Bentley Club. He
said a radical new look might be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a move in the past 10 years to move Bentley
into more of a sporting vein,'' Sanders said. ``If you ask a school
child what kind of car he'd like when he grows up, it will always
be a Porsche or a BMW or a Ferrari _ they never say Bentley. If you
are going to be successful, you have to capture that kind of
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, industry experts believe Piech's real aim
is to develop a less expensive line of cars _ Baby Bentleys _ and
to bolster volume to 8,000 cars a year, from fewer than 2,000. But
until those new cars are ready, Piech appears to be testing the
waters for guidance on what will and will not sell with a trademark
Bentley mesh grill on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is offering up an idea of the directions we
could go in,'' said John Crawford, a spokesman for Bentley. ``We
want to know what people think of this.''

WISCONSIN LOSS BASICALLY POINTLESS
</HEADLINE>
 REGION-WISCONSIN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ And here's a partial score from the East
Regional: Southwest Missouri State 43, Wisconsin 32.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, wait a minute. Hold it. That's a ``final'' score.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, fifth-seeded Wisconsin scored the fewest points in half
a century of NCAA Tournament play. The 43-32 victory in an East
Region first-round contest puts the 12th-seeded Bears (21-10) into
Sunday's second round against Tennessee, a 62-52 winner over
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers shot 25.5 percent from the field, making 12 field
goals in 47 attempts. Their 32 points was the fewest since Oregon
State's 55-30 loss to Oklahoma State in the 1949 national
semifinals. Wisconsin's total was the lowest in NCAA Tournament
history for a first or second-round game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very embarrassed,'' Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett said.
``Our February has been like this; we've seen this before. I hoped
and prayed it wouldn't happen on a day like this. Now we've got to
live with this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fewest points by a Badgers' team since 1948. A new
fight song could be in the works: Off Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Mason, the Badgers' leading scorer, had 11 points on
4-of-12 shooting; the Badgers' perimeter players were a combined
5-for-27. Mason was badgered most of the game by Southwest Missouri
State's Ken Stringer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my defense was OK on him,'' said Stringer, prone on
the locker room floor with an ice bag on his lower back to treat a
bruise. ``I didn't play up to my full potential. I just wanted to
make him work for his shots. I guess I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State won despite scoring a season-low. The
Bears shot 39.4 percent, but that was good enough when the
opposition couldn't hit water if it fell out of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an offensive player, but when you start coaching, you
emphasize what you didn't do well as a player,'' Southwest Missouri
State coach Steve Alford said. ``We followed our defensive game
plan to an absolute T.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears took control late in the first half. Back-to-back
3-pointers by Ryan Bettenhausen and Allen Phillips helped provide a
21-12 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers scored a season-low 12 first-half points, but in a
two-minute period of the second half, Wisconsin scored seven points
on three possessions to pull to within 28-22 with 12:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the game, the Badgers missed 13 of their
final 17 shots. And two of their field goals came in the final
minute after the Bears' defense had gone into hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really embarrassed,'' Wisconsin center Charlie Wills
said, noting the Bears' 35-18 rebounding edge. ``We got beat to
loose balls and it didn't feel like we were aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for defense, embarrassment for the losing coach and
humor for the winning coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we would have focused more on the defensive end,''
Alford said.
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding. Kind of like someone who tries to pass off the
final as a halftime score. nn

SCIENTIST'S CASE CASTS LIGHT ON CHINESE ESPIONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, New Mexico _ Within two weeks, Peter H. Lee, a
Taiwan-born physicist who once worked at the nuclear weapons
laboratory here, will complete a one-year sentence to a halfway
house in California, winding up a murky case that speaks of the
ambiguities surrounding resurfaced suspicions of Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Lee returns to normal life, Wen Ho Lee, another
Taiwan-born physicist, is starting life in limbo. On Monday, he was
dismissed from the Los Alamos National Laboratory for security
violations. He has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   No relation to each other, the two are linked only by official
investigations seeking to determine how China may have gained
access to U.S. nuclear secrets. With lab approval, both made trips
to China and addressed groups of scientists.

   Peter Lee's involvement with China dates back to 1981, federal
prosecutors say, when he began a correspondence with Chinese
scientists that mounted to more than 600 letters and e-mail
messages by 1997, the year of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, he pleaded guilty to passing classified
national defense information to Chinese scientists on a visit to
Beijing in 1985. He also pleaded guilty to lying to a government
agency after he described on a security form a May 1997 visit to
China as a pleasure trip.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Lee, then a researcher for a U.S. military
contractor, met extensively with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence analysis indicates that the data provided by
Dr. Lee was of significant material assistance to China in their
nuclear weapons development program,'' the Department of Energy
said in a pre-sentencing statement submitted last year to U.S.
District Judge Terry J. Hatter in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a possibility of 10 years in prison, Lee pleaded guilty
under an arrangement with the court and was sentenced to one year
in the halfway house, ordered to pay a $20,000 fine, and to perform
3,000 hours of community service. He lost his security clearance.
At the sentencing, Hatter said, `You cannot leave to a scientist
the discretion of what should be classified.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, James Henderson Sr., said in an interview: ``My
guy was at a conference of scientists, and he ended up talking too
much. His offense was tied to information that was subsequently
declassified.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as part of a sweeping opening of weapons laboratories
after the end of the Cold War, most of the information that Lee was
accused of giving the Chinese in the 1980s had been declassified by
the time of his arrest years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee was a little ahead of his time,'' said Christopher Paine,
an arms control specialist for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a public policy group. ``Today if he discussed those
things, there would be no penalty at all. After the Cold War the
Department of Energy and the laboratories made a unilateral
decision to declassify a large amount of information. Time had
overtaken his crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Lee was one of dozens of American scientists who
traveled to China on trips authorized by officials of the
laboratory here. Lee is an expert in using lasers to create fusion,
a field that can be used for simulating nuclear explosions, but
also for generating electricity through nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   A naturalized American citizen, he received his doctorate from
California Institute of Technology, and worked at the Los Alamos
lab from 1981 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Now 59, he is expected to return to living full-time at his
family home in Rancho Palos Verdes, near Los Angeles. He did not
return a telephone call left at his family home, and his lawyer
said he would not talk to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Lee told the judge that he had been carried away by ``scientific
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On his 1997 trip to China, Lee had discussed his work using
satellite radar imaging to track submarines, an area of interest to
the Chinese. Lee was conducting this work for TRW Space &AMP;
Electronics Group, a Redondo Beach, Calif., company, where he was
employed from 1991 until his plea, in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Lee was the target of an FBI investigation and agents
tailed him in China, wiretapped his telephones in California and
surreptitiously searched his computers for incriminating
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a highly respected physicist, working on secret
projects that had weapons applications, giving up the secrets,''
recalled Jonathan S. Shapiro, who prosecuted the case. Noting that
the science was classified when Lee discussed it in Beijing in
1985, he added, ``It is not up to individual scientists, on their
own, to waive their oath on behalf of a foreign country.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the reaction was ``no harm, no foul, because the
stuff had been declassified'' recalled Shapiro, who added that he
was disappointed last year by the lack of press interest in the
case and the light sentence handed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received phone calls and letters from physicists and
scientists who were offended that I prosecuted the case,'' said the
former prosecutor. ``The case represented the inherent tensions
between the scientists' desire for free and open exchange of
information, and the need to keep information classified and secret
for the nation's security.''

DISSIDENT SAYS HE CAN BLOCK LYCOS-USA DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The largest shareholder in Lycos Inc. says he has
rallied enough dissident investors to block the Internet firm's
proposed merger with elements of USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell, chief executive of the CMGI Inc., an Andover,
Mass. venture capital firm, said in an interview Friday that almost
every other large institutional investor in Lycos shares his view
that the deal doesn't value its shares sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those conversations, ``We've received ample evidence
that if a vote were held today, it would not pass,'' Wetherell
said. Earlier this week he resigned from the Lycos board of
directors and vowed to work against the completion of the present
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell's CMGI now holds the single largest stake in Lycos,
with about 18.5 percent of total shares outstanding. Wetherell said
he has spoken with major fund managers who represent an additional
24.5 percent of the company's shares and said that none of them
would support the agreement under its present terms either.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell said at least four other parties have expressed an
interest in assembling a rival bid for Lycos, though he declined to
name them. Industry observers say likely candidates include General
Electric Co.'s NBC broadcast unit, CBS Corp., and Time Warner Inc.
CMGI also could purchase Lycos outright with its own stock, or
structure a more complex arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for USA Networks declined to comment on
Wetherell's remarks. Executives of Lycos, whose headquarters are in
Waltham, mass., could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, both companies reiterated their expectation to
complete the agrement under its terms announced Feb. 9. According
to Wetherell, a vote could take place up to four months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Lycos said it would merge with
elements of USA Networks Inc., the New York company controlled by
broadcast veteran Barry Diller. Major units of the company include
the Home Shopping Network and the Ticketmaster event-seating
service.
</P>
<P>
   As a board member of Lycos and one of its earliest investors,
Wetherell had voted for the deal, though he now says he did so with
reservations. But after the agreement was announced Lycos shares
plunged from 137 to as low as 83 7/8 as investors realized the
terms didn't value the search engine with the same premiums that
other so-called Internet ``portal'' sites such as the Netscape and
InfoSeek services had received in their own recent mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Lycos have continued to support the proposal,
arguing that the agreement will provide the portal site with
substantial revenue it can use to build new electronic commerce
services.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell said Friday he had tried to renegotiate the terms of
the agreement with Diller in early February to account for the
decline, but that the head of USA Networks rejected the suggestion.
According to Wetherell, Diller said Internet stocks are overvalued
and that he didn't wish to lose money in a coming downturn.
</P>
<P>
   But by the same token, Wetherell said the agreement put too high
a valuation on Diller's own USA Networks. According to Wetherell,
the agreement values the Lycos network at around $6 billion _ about
$1.5 billion less than the smaller portal Excite Inc. received in a
stock deal in January. As the last major portal site without an
alliance with a bigger media partner, Wetherell said, Lycos should
command a far higher premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believe that Lycos is worth far more, because it's
the last kingmaker left among all the portals.'' Wetherell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of respect for Diller and what he's
accomplished,'' Wetherell said. ``But this has everything to do
with the economics. We disagree.''

AUTO TECHNOLOGY: VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WINS NEW DISCIPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ While driving the Honda Civic HX coupe, one
immediately senses that something is missing. Step hard on the
accelerator when a stoplight turns green, or press the pedal to the
floor to pass on a freeway, and there is no jerk as the
transmission shifts gears. Nor does the sound of the engine rise
just before a shift, along with its speed, and then fall off. The
tachometer's needle holds steady.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the car feels as though its transmission is not shifting
at all.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Civic HX has a continuously variable
transmission, or CVT, the only one currently available on a
production model in the United States. It will certainly not be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Ford Motor Co. and ZF Friedrichshafen AG, the German
company that is Europe's largest supplier of transmissions,
announced a joint venture that is expected to eventually produce a
million CVTs a year at a Ford transmission plant in Batavia, Ohio.
The transmissions will show up in cars from Ford and from other
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of CVTs is simple. Aside from their smoothness, they
allow an engine to operate at optimal efficiency nearly all the
time, improving economy and saving wear and tear. They offer the
convenience of an automatic transmission with the better mileage of
a manual shift. Indeed, the Civic HX has been the only car without
a stick shift to earn a place on the Environmental Protection
Agency's list of the 10 mileage leaders, achieving a rating of 34
miles a gallon in the city and 38 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer gets improved fuel economy because the vehicle
spends more time in areas of good efficiency,'' said Gordon Willis,
Ford's chief engineer for automatic transmissions. Although
gasoline prices are now around their all-time lows, Willis
acknowledges that fuel economy will matter again someday. And
global giants like Ford are already building plenty of cars for
countries where fuel economy is indeed important because gasoline
is very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and ZF expect the new CVT they will produce in Ohio to
raise fuel economy by 10 to 15 percent. In addition to better
mileage, the customer has the benefit of feeling and hearing no
gear changes. ``Every transmission causes you to feel the gear
change to some degree, and customers say they would rather not feel
those events,'' Willis said. ``They worry about those events if
they feel they are not always shifting exactly the same _ if it
shifts different today than it did yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while a driver perceives that a CVT-equipped car is not
shifting at all, it is actually shifting much of the time, though
not in the specific increments of a traditional transmission.
Shifts on a car with an automatic transmission are based on
specific ratios between the speed of the engine and the speed of
the vehicle. First gear is one ratio, and second, third and fourth
gears are others; there are no possible settings between the gears.
As a result, the engine is sometimes operating extremely
efficiently, and sometimes quite inefficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But a CVT shifts continuously as the engine speed and vehicle
speed change, allowing an infinite number of possible gear ratios.
ZF executives say this should result in less strain on the engine
and longer life for other vehicle components.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's CVT works like the gearing on the two sprocket rings of
a 10-speed bicycle. Computerized sensors constantly adjust the
diameters of pulleys _ the drive pulley from the engine and the
driven pulley that sends power to the wheels _ at each end of a
steel drive belt, pushing the belt closer or farther away from the
center of each pulley. Every possible position of the belt on the
two pulleys represents a gear ratio. On acceleration, for instance,
the drive pulley will have a narrow diameter for more torque, like
a low gear. At cruising speed, the drive pulley widens and acts
like a high gear.
</P>
<P>
   CVTs are not new. The earliest automobiles operated on a similar
principle, and a Dutch car, the DAF, had a CVT in the years after
World War II, using sturdy drive belts developed by Van Doorne's
Transmissie of the Netherlands for such a purpose. In the United
States, Subaru offered a CVT on its Justy subcompact in the early
1990s. And they are used in foreign markets on several Nissan
models, including the diesel Micra sold in Europe; on the Microcar
of France, and on other vehicles. Snowmobiles have always used CVTs
to transfer power from their high-revving, low-torque engines.
</P>
<P>
   But while CVTs have been mainly used in small cars with small
engines, that seems likely to change. The University of Michigan's
Delphi studies on future automotive trends suggest rapid growth for
CVTs in the next 5 to 10 years because of increased pressure on
automakers to raise fuel economy, in part because they are selling
so many low-mileage vehicles, which lowers their corporate
fuel-economy averages.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford and ZF joint venture is a big step toward the
proliferation of CVTs. The first transmission from that venture
will make its debut on a 2002 model; company officials said that
would not be a Ford product, though Ford will not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Technical issues are the focus of much attention. Improved
materials, larger belts and better control systems should help make
CVTs practical with larger engines. ZF has introduced a CVT aimed
at engines of up to 3 liters. And Nissan is working on what it
calls a toroidal CVT, which does not use belts. That CVT has been
tested with a 300-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   Low volume and limited availability of parts have make CVTs
expensive to produce, though Willis of Ford predicts that they
could ultimately prove cheaper than traditional automatic
transmissions as production increases, because they contain fewer
parts. &QL;

 (For release Sunday, March 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowhere are the intimate relations between economics and the
real world more clearly glimpsed than in measurement _ beginning
with the measurement of prices. Prices are no simple matter, as
Andrew Court found out when in 1938 he tried to get a handle on the
changing cost of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Court worked for the Automobile Manufactuers Association. The
Depression was grinding on. A clamor had arisen to force General
Motors to drop its prices whenever sales lagged, in order to keep
production and employment constant. To reformers there seemed to be
plenty of room to cut. Offical indexes showed that prices had risen
45 percent between 1925 and 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Court knew that quality was changing. This was the heyday of
marketing wizard Alfred Sloan, after all. Not only was GM offering
``a price for every pocketbook'' (a strategically differentiated
line,) but new features were being added to all cars every year:
safety glass, automatic transmissions, more powerful and reliable
engines and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Court knew, too, that the Bureau of Labor Statisics made some
attempt to compare the underlying characteristics of farm tractors
and trucks in order to get a better idea of what was quality change
and what was ``pure'' price change. But when it came to cars, they
didn't even try; they simply reported the average list prices of
the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   So he devised a method he called ``hedonic'' pricing, a terrible
name for characteristics-based indexes. He zeroed in on particular
attributes of cars _ their speed, safety, window area, seat width,
and so on _ in order to get a standardized measure of the pleasure
that they yielded their users. Then he divided the price per
vehicle by its ``hedonic content.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, he found that prices for something like a
``standard auto'' actually had decreased by 55 percent in those ten
years. (On the same basis, computation prices today fall as much in
a single year, even though the price of the computer itself stays
more or less the same.) It was industrial work, but enough to blunt
the initiative against GM. (For a full account, see Ernest
Berndt's, ``The Practice of Econometrics: Classic and
Contemporary,'' from which this brief account is drawn.
</P>
<P>
   And there the matter rested until 1960, when a 30-year-old
immigrant economist named Zvi Griliches (pronounced GRI-lick-es)
picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches was interested in hybrid corn _ not unreasonably,
coonsidering that the ``green revolution'' had begun to increase
yields dramatically. His 1957 dissertation, subtitled ``An
exploration of the economics of technical change,'' had traced the
rate of adoption of new varieties of corn in various states. By
addressing the econonomic units side-by-side, there emerged a
yardstick for gauging ``what spills over to whom'' (as economist
Ariel Pakes puts it) _ and therefore a means of calculating rates
of return to investments in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to get out of the figures on seed prices, crop
yield and cash prices as much information as were in them, it was
necessary to address the same problems for hybrid corn _ as well as
arable land, fertilizer, and farm implements _ as Andrew Court had
tinkered with for cars. Indeed, productivity measurement of every
sort depended upon reliable price indexes.
</P>
<P>
   And so a fully-trained first-rate economic mind went to work for
the first time on hedonic pricing _ as it happened, in the context
of the automotive industry itself. Griliches had signed on to the
Stigler Commission, which was then investigating government price
indexes for the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Using modern statistical methods, Griliches built the simple
techniques of adjusting for quality change into a powerful tool for
interrogating the economy about almost anything under the sun: real
estate prices, wages and how education, environmental amenities,
new products, and so on, affect them. Strictly speaking, he did not
invent a whole new branch of research on price and quality,
measurement don Robery Lipsey of Queens College says, but ``he was
certainly was the crucial entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   So if these topics interest you _ if you like to think about
productivity and hear others talk about it _ there was no better
place on earth for you last Saturday than a hotel meeting room in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cream of the world's measurement community gathered
there, ostensibly to commemorate Griliches' 20 years as director of
the National Bureau of Economic research program on Productivity
and Technical Change.
</P>
<P>
   In fact they were saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Griliches was just 11 years old when Germans occupying Lithuania
herded his family into the Kaunas ghetto. In 1944, he and his
father were sent to Dachau. He survived; his father didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Orphaned, Griliches made his way to Israel, via Cyprus, in 1947.
By night he taught himself English and math; by day he worked on a
series of kibbutzim. In 1951 he won a scholarship to the University
of California at Berkeley _ in agricultural economics, because it
was deemed essential.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954 he had moved to the hotbed of high-tech methods that was
the University of Chicago in those days. His adviser: the great
agricultural economist Theodore Schultz, who in 1979 was awarded
the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   It was during 15 years at the University of Chicago that
Griliches developed his distinctive style of trying to do
measurement ``right,'' or at least better than it was being done at
the time. He collaborated extensively; alongside his friend Dale
Jorgeson, he picked a fight with theorists of growth over
measurement that resonates to the present day. He married; Diane
Asseo Griliches provided, he says, ``the warmth, the stable home
base and the emotional support'' that enabled the work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he joined Jorgenson, Kenneth Arrow, and Martin
Feldstein in the rescue mission that eventually returned the
embattled economics department of Harvard University to a place
near the top of the heap. His first student was the young Robert
Barro (only the second-best conservative economist he taught, says
Griliches; at Chicago he had given a grade of C to the
undergraduate Robert Lucas _ a future Nobelist). He worked closely
as well with young radicals like Stephen Marglin, Samuel Bowles,
and Herbert Gintes.
</P>
<P>
   With Gary Chamberlin, he showed how the idea of human capital
could be used to assess the effect of schooling on the labor force.
Then a trio of remarkable students _ Mark Schankerman, Manuel
Trajjtenberg, and Pakes _ returned him to the topic of technical
change, just in time for the beginning of the productivity slowdown
of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, Feldstein had taken charge of the National Bureau of
Economic Research; he was intent on turning it into the nation's
premier (virtual) laboratory of applied economics. He asked
Griliches to tackle the productivity slowdown. Couldn't be done,
said Griliches, who narrowed the topic and took the job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an explosion of exciting new work on the
economics of the high-tech age. The work on spillovers and
characteristic-based models found a whole new generation of
students eager to devise new models and apply policy issues. Do
patent suits distort research incentives? Can patent citations and
firms' market value be used as a measure of the value of the stock
of knowledge? Do network effects drive the rate of diffusion of new
drugs? These were some of the topics Griliches' students brought to
their meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because of shifts in the direction that took place
during the 1980s, an interest in technical change was returned to
economics' center ring. Griliches abundance of deep, sustained,
high-quality work on the topic made him an odds-on favorite in the
betting for a Nobel Prize sometime in in the next few years _
perhaps with his colleague Jorgenson, or Columbia University
theorist Kelvin Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem. Last summer Griliches took a
persistent itch to his doctor _ and discovered he had pancreatic
cancer. As MIT's Frank Fischer said, presiding over a poignant
dinner last week, ``What Dachau couldn't accomplish, the cancer
may.''
</P>
<P>
   So his students took no chances. They rallied and presented him
with a survey of the field in his 67th year. Stanford's Tim
Bresnahancq, the government's chief economist in its case against
Microsoft, said, ``So, Zvi, what do you think now of this field
that you made?'' Schankerman put aside his otherwise technical
paper to say, ``You have given us roots _ and wings.'' Some years
ago, the historian Jurg Niehans noted that ``Histories of economic
doctrines often convey the notion that the past was an age of
giants, shaking the world with their deeds, and the present is an
age of pygmies engaged in agitated babble.'' Nothing, of course,
could be farther from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century has been the golden age of economics _
Griliches is a prime example of why. From one perspective, anyway,
it almost doesn't matter what happens now. Economics has few other
communities as deeply rooted as this one.

 &HT;    Trump Superspeedway planned for New York area
 &HT;    By Al Levine and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Real estate developer Donald Trump and Bill France,
chairman and chief executive officer of the International Speedway
Corporation, revealed plans Friday to build a superspeedway in the
New York area, with an exact site to be chosen by summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big day for either New York, New Jersey or
Connecticut,'' Trump said. ``We are looking at five sites and we'll
probably have another five. A final decision on one will be made in
the next couple of months. In eight to 12 weeks, we'll have a
pretty good idea where it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump Superspeedway would have a minimum of 75,000 seats, at
least a one-mile track and a road course on about 750 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton Smith, who owns Atlanta Motor Speedway and tracks in
Charlotte, Texas, California, Las Vegas and Bristol, Tenn., offered
a whimsical reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe in 15 years I would want to build a speedway
around Manhattan,'' Smith said. ``That way you'd already have eight
million people in the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith once tried to buy $60 million of land on Long Island to
build a speedway but ran into environmental problems. A plan to
build a track in New Jersey was undone by asbestos. ``The first bid
for moving the asbestos was $5 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's all for stock car racing moving closer to the world's
biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be great for NASCAR,'' Smith said. ``I'm for anything
that pushes our sport on up the ladder. I think you've got two
great partners there. If anybody can get it done, I think they can.
They'll face numerous environmental and bureaucratic problems in
that part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   B. JONES REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker qualified for his first Winston
Cup race in last week's Las Vegas 400, but setup problems left him
with a 29th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones came to Atlanta Motor Speedway on Friday armed with a
Pontiac built by Richard Childress Racing.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start in the first practice _ Jones was
eighth-slowest in the morning session _ he rebounded in the second.
He had the 18th-fastest average speed in the second practice, and
then turned in the seventh-best qualifying speed, 192.654 mph.
He'll start inside the fourth row in Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just seemed to flow,'' Jones said. ``I think it's
the new chassis, but it's the guys on the crew, too. (Crew chief
Tony) Barclay has a really good setup for here. It feels awesome to
come home and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   BAIRD WINS ARCA EVENT
</P>
<P>
   Bill Baird of Sturgis, Ky., pushed his No. 52 Chevrolet in front
of Darrell Lanigan's No. 29 Ford on a one-lap shootout to win the
EasyCare 300, his first ARCA series victory. The last-lap finish
was set up when leader Mike Swaim Jr. hit the wall coming out of
turn four with seven laps to go, bringing out a caution. Swaim was
unhurt but was transported to Atlanta Medical Center for a
precautionary examination. Baird was the ARCA rookie of the year in
1998, fourth in points, but without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RUN FOR THE ROSES
</P>
<P>
   The red flying horse on Jeremy Mayfield's No. 12 Ford Taurus
will be replaced by a thoroughbred for the California 500 May 2 at
Fontana, Calif., in honor of the 125th Kentucky Derby. The Derby
will be run the day before at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of commemorative cars,'' Mayfield said,
``everything from an Elvis car to a Batman car. But nothing is
cooler than me, being from Kentucky, being in a Kentucky Derby
car.'' The announcement was made concurrently by Mayfield's team,
Churchill Downs and Action Performance, which manufactures model
cars. Think this has anything to do with selling more souvenirs?

FIVE AIRLINES' FARE INCREASES MAY BE SHORT-LIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five of the country's major airlines raised their fares Thursday
and Friday, though the increase could be short-lived if three other
carriers do not match them.
</P>
<P>
   News of the fare increase sent some airline stocks soaring
Friday on a day when they normally might have fallen because of a
jump in the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines rose $3.50 to close at $64; the UAL Corp., the
parent of United Airlines, rose $2.0625 to close at $67.0625; and
the AMR Corp., which owns American Airlines, closed at $58 a share,
up $2.
</P>
<P>
   United began the price increase on Thursday evening, according
to Susan Donofrio, an airline analyst with BT Alex Brown in New
York. The carrier raised fares 1 percent for unrestricted tickets
designed for business travelers and 3 percent on advance-purchase
tickets favored by vacationers. United was then matched by Delta
and America West Airlines, followed by Continental Airlines and
American.
</P>
<P>
   For the increase to hold, Northwest Airlines, Trans World
Airlines and US Airways would also have to go along. Jon Austin, a
spokesman for Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest
airline and has undermined many attempted fare increases in the
last year, declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If it holds, the fare hike would be the second this year. In
early February, the airlines raised fares 2 percent for business
travelers and 4 percent for leisure tickets. Up until then, the
industry had not raised prices in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines have seen their revenues slide so far this
year after four straight years of record profits. But a fare
increase may be hard to maintain because many carriers are planning
to expand their fleets, raising fears of overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   Fares between the United States and Europe have already fallen
steeply because many carriers have redeployed their planes from
Asia to transatlantic routes.

INVESTIGATION OF MOODY'S IS ENDED BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department has ended an investigation without
finding anti-competitive practices at Moody's Investors Services
Inc., the credit rating agency that is a subsidiary of the Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The government's investigation of Moody's, part of a
wide-ranging investigation into charges of anti-competitive
practices in the bond-rating services industry, began early in
1996. It was conducted by the Justice Department's antitrust
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust investigation of the industry is still
ongoing,'' said Jennifer Rose, a Justice Department spokeswoman.
``But the Moody's part of that investigation is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Becton, a managing director and spokesman for Moody's,
said the company received a letter from Justice on Feb. 1 saying
that the investigation had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter is straightforward and to the point,'' Becton said.
``It simply said the investigation into the firm's bond-rating
practices has ended. It was a wide-ranging inquiry and we provided
them with hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, mostly in
1996. We are pleased that the Department of Justice has completed
this civil inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its inquiry, the Justice Department examined whether
Moody's used the threat of unsolicited ratings as leverage on
issuers to hire the agency to assess their credit-worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Most bond ratings are issued with the consent of the entity
selling the bonds. The company, state or city issuing the debt pays
a fee to the credit-rating company, which then publishes a rating,
often in the form of a letter grade, for the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rating agencies have been issuing unsolicited opinions on
the credit-worthiness of borrowers for decades. Indeed, it was not
until the late 1960s that agencies, beginning with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp., a unit of the McGraw-Hill Cos., and then Moody's,
began to charge issuers for their services.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began after a lawsuit was filed in November
1995 against Moody's by the Jefferson County School District, the
largest in Colorado. The suit contended that Moody's hurt the
marketability of the district's bonds by issuing a negative, and
unsolicited, report on a 1993 bond sale after the district refused
to hire Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   A motion by Moody's to dismiss the lawsuit was granted by a
Federal District judge in Colorado on April 8, 1997. That decision
is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Justice Department's investigation into Moody's
was reported Friday by The Wall Street Journal.

OIL PRODUCERS CUT PRODUCTION IN BID TO INCREASE PRICES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to capitalize on their modest success in
stabilizing world oil prices, a coalition of major oil producers
announced Friday that they had agreed to cut production by another
2 million barrels a day, a move that kept crude oil prices heading
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that if the cuts were implemented as
promised by April 1, and if nascent signs of an economic recovery
in Asia were realized, a steady recovery of crude oil prices could
be in the offing. That would eventually bring higher gasoline
prices, which are now at very low levels.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the supply cuts held, which is far from certain, the
increase at the pump would be modest at first _ about 5 cents a
gallon, analysts said. Considering that gasoline prices have been
averaging about 95 cents a gallon for regular unleaded compared
with $1.06 a gallon last March, it will cause little pain in the
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not kick off a wave of inflation,'' said Fred
Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. ``It will not kill
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on cuts was made at The Hague, Netherlands, by an
informal coalition that included Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran and
Venezuela, all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, as well as Mexico, which is not an OPEC member. Formed
last March, the coalition of producers, which have all lost
billions in revenues because of the oil glut, has already managed
substantial production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting a unified front, the countries have minimized the
traditional undercutting of OPEC's attempts to raise prices. That
helped to boost prices until last summer, when the Asian economic
crisis cut demand for oil and brought prices down. The inability of
OPEC to make cuts last November further depressed prices, leading
to a 12-year low of $10.35 a barrel in December.
</P>
<P>
   For the new cutback to go into effect, it must be ratified and
spelled out in detail at an OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, on
March 23, agreed upon by non-OPEC producers, and then acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cut represents about 2.6 percent of the daily world
demand of about 75 million barrels a day. News of the agreement
sent crude oil prices up 1.3 percent Friday, and 9 percent for the
week.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC failed to reach an agreement on production cuts at its most
recent meeting in November, and voluntary cutbacks in oil
production have been difficult to enforce in recent years. Indeed,
burgeoning supplies of oil, combined with a grave economic slowdown
in Asia that has spread to Russia and Latin America, contributed to
the historic decline in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on the clout of the broad coalition of OPEC and
non-OPEC producers, and on hopes that flagging demand in Asia may
be reviving, many analysts saw Friday's cutback plan as
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that it was well timed and could, by the end
of the year, lead to higher crude oil prices and eventually to
rising prices for an enormous range of industries, including
automobiles, plastics and makers of synthetic fibers. Because
inflation has been so low in recent months, however, the near-term
prospects for an increase in inflation caused by the oil price
increase were generally seen as modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is less out of balance than it was a year ago,''
said Ann-Louise Hittle, the director of international petroleum at
Cambridge Energy Associates, an energy consulting group in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Demand is showing slight recovery and low oil
prices have been whittling away at growth in production.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that if the cuts were put into effect they would have
``major impact'' by the end of the year when the current oversupply
of about 1.8 million barrels a day could be worked down and if
demand continued to be strong. She declined to project a specific
price.

 NEW YORK: specific price. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a wait and see attitude among some analysts and
industry experts on whether all of the production cuts would
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is in the details,'' said Alan Struth, the chief
economist for Phillips Petroleum, which is based in Bartelsville,
Okla. ``Who complies and who doesn't will be the critical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of major oil producers called early last year for
cuts of 3.2 million barrels a day, of which OPEC's portion was 2.6
million barrels. For a time, this helped crude oil prices recover.
But as of February, according to a survey by Bloomberg, OPEC had
achieved only about 79 percent of its promised reductions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the drop in demand, particularly in Asia, that was the
main reason last year's price recovery was short-lived and prices
fell again. Last year the price of crude oil averaged $14.35 for
West Texas Intermediate compared with $20.60 in 1997. The price for
the first two months this year averaged about $12.25 until a recent
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale gasoline futures rose to a five-month high Friday, as
traders sought to lock in prices, expecting that the prices at the
wholesale level and at the pump would increase moderately in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Although there could be attempts by refiners and station owners
to put through price increases quickly, it has traditionally taken
weeks for increases in futures prices to be passed through to the
pump.
</P>
<P>
   While at first crude oil surged on the news of the meeting, the
run-up abated as the sketchiness of the agreement became evident.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil for April delivery first rose by
as much as 80 cents, to $15.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, before settling back at $14.49 a barrel, up 18 cents for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   What some analysts found to be significant was that the
coalition of major producers has been able to come together again
to lead the effort to make further cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic agreement has survived,'' Ms. Hittle said. ``That is
quite remarkable compared to previous OPEC agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway, another non-OPEC member, is expected to take part in the
newly proposed reductions, the oil ministers said in a statement
issued at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said that they have resolved a dispute over
Iran's promised cutbacks, a particularly contentious issue for
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Youcef Yousfi, the oil minister for Algeria who is also the
president of OPEC, said that a more precise breakdown of the cuts
would be given at the organization's meeting on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the cuts were implemented on April 1, it would take
until May for the flow of oil to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the anticipation of a reduction in supply could
lead to a recovery of crude oil prices before that.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, a research group for the oil industry based in
New York City, said that it was the huge losses in revenue suffered
by the major oil producers that has spurred them on to seek further
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the OPEC countries, except for Iraq, had seen
revenues from oil exports drop to $100 billion last year compared
with $156 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays for them to cut back,'' he added, because the higher
prices will bring more revenue than the loss of revenue from
exporting less oil.
</P>
<P>
   While the lower oil prices have led to low gasoline and heating
oil prices, they have also caused major cutbacks in staff by major
oil companies and smaller producers who have shut wells and cut
back on exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of oil service workers in the Southwest have
lost their jobs. Even if oil prices recover, companies will be slow
to add workers until they are sure that the higher prices will be
long term.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtblau also said that if reports were true that Saudi Arabia
had agreed to cut back 600,000 barrels a day, it would mean a major
shift in position. In the past the Saudis have said they would not
cut back below 8 million barrels a day.

CLINTON, BACK IN HOPE, RECALLS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPE, Ark. _ President Clinton returned to his birthplace Friday
for the dedication of his childhood home, still believing in Hope,
and hoping that Hope still believes in him.
</P>
<P>
   In the nostalgic visit, Clinton recalled his humble beginnings
in this small town that shaped his vision as president, saying at
one point, ``In many ways, I know that all I am or ever will be
came from here.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in driving rain on a makeshift stage just outside
the house where he lived the first four years of his life, he
recalled his childhood friend, Vincent Foster, a former White House
aide who committed suicide in 1993 and was part of an independent
counsel's investigation of Clinton's Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Foster was with him when he broke his leg, ``in the
first of many major mistakes I was to make in my life, jumping rope
in my cowboy boots.''
</P>
<P>
   For the president, whose signature phrase at the 1992 Democratic
convention was ``I still believe in a place called Hope,'' Friday's
visit demonstrated the strength he still draws from the state.
Several hundred people turned out in a cold, driving rain to greet
him at the Hope airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said people here stuck with me through rain or
shine,'' he said. ``Now I know it's literally true.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansas is also a reminder of some troubling associations
from his past, long before his relationship with former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky became public, eventually leading to his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One of his Whitewater partners, Susan McDougal, is on trial in
Little Rock. A few weeks ago, nursing home operator Juanita
Broaddrick stepped forward to allege that Clinton sexually
assaulted her more than 20 years ago when he was state attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who frequently accompanies her husband
when he returns home, remained at the White House Friday, further
fueling speculation about strains in their marriage amid Lewinsky's
book tour and Broaddrick's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady Friday held the latest in series of meetings with
top New York Democrats about the prospects of a run in 2000 to
replace retiring Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She met with
Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York state assembly, and
Judith Hope, the state Democratic Party chair.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, would not comment
directly on the meetings, but said the first lady's deliberations
about a Senate campaign are ``going to take some time. There is no
sense of a timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry played down Mrs. Clinton's absence from her husband's side
in Hope. She said the first lady had ``never been scheduled'' to
attend the dedication because she had expected to just be returning
from a tiring trip to Central America. Because of the recurrence of
a back injury, Berry said, Mrs. Clinton at the last minute canceled
her plans to take that trip.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, the Clintons' schedules will take them in
separate paths. The first lady will resume a busy schedule next
week with several public events in Washington, and the following
week she will travel to Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco with daughter
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the president cut short his own scheduled three-day trip
to Arkansas and Texas, where he was to stay through Sunday. White
House aides said Clinton was tired after his trip to Central
America, and wanted to return to Washington to rest up before a
busy schedule next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dedicating his childhood home, Clinton attended a
fund-raiser for Representative Max Sandlin of Texas and Saturday
will travel to Little Rock to raise money for the Democratic
National Committee and attend a reception in honor of retired US
Senator Dale Bumpers, who spoke in defense of Clinton at the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hadn't seen his childhood house, at 117 South Hervey
St., since 1990. After living in this house, and two years at
another house in Hope, he moved with his family to Hot Springs,
Ark. Friday, he dedicated a garden at the home in honor of his
mother, Virginia Kelley, who died in 1994. Clinton's father died
three months before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   The house has been restored to its appearance in 1946, the year
Clinton was born, and a neighboring house was converted to a
visitor center. Renovations on the 2 1/2-story began in 1995 in an
effort to restore it to its likeness during Clinton's childhood.
The only original item in the house is a little golden book, titled
``The Kitten's Surprise,'' given to Clinton by a childhood friend,
Susan Cook, that sits on the top of a chest in what was Clinton's
second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Arkansas Legislature refused to provide $500,000
to make improvements to the boyhood home, which is now a museum.
Many of the lawmakers who opposed the funding said it had nothing
to do with Clinton, but with the source of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sort of a speed bump for us. It's not going to slow
us down,'' said Beckie Moore, executive director of the Clinton
Birthplace Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Jo Hays, a Hope resident and member of the Birthplace
Foundation Board, said that despite Clinton's problems, ``We're
proud of the president. We think that he has been a very good
president for us, economically speaking.''

LAW FIRMS CANCEL PROPOSED MERGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prominent New York law firms of White &AMP; Case and
Brown &AMP; Wood called off their proposed merger Friday after at least
four months of talks, saying the move was ``impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   Top partners at the two firms refused to give details of why
they had abandoned their plans for a merger that would have created
the nation's fourth-largest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The firms issued a brief statement that said that they were
ending their talks after concluding that ``issues such as the
significant differences in capital structure of the two firms make
the merger impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers at the two firms, who would speak only on the
condition they not be named, said they were surprised by the
announcement because the talks had seemed to be moving forward.
Both firms had been studying each other's list of clients,
financial statements and other matters crucial to joining their
practices, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   For partners at White &AMP; Case, which is already the nation's
seventh-largest law firm, a merger with the smaller Brown &AMP; Wood
would have strengthened its Wall Street practice. Brown &AMP; Wood's
major clients include Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. A merger would have given Brown &AMP; Wood a wide
global presence. White &AMP; Case has more than two dozen offices in
Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, one sticking point between the firms had been
their differences in profitability. According to The American
Lawyer magazine, the average profit earned by each partner at White
&AMP; Case in 1997, the most recent year available, was $625,000, while
it was $535,000 for partners at Brown &AMP; Wood.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, in what was widely viewed as an attempt to get
past that issue, Brown &AMP; Wood announced its 1998 revenue and other
information that most law firms try to keep private. The firm said
it had realized its highest revenue ever, which had pushed the
average profit for each partner up to about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   White &AMP; Case has 848 lawyers, according to a recent survey by
The National Law Journal, while Brown &AMP; Wood has 366 lawyers.

 &HT;    Green likes Cup challenge in Busch races
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From where he sits _ on the outside pole for today's
Yellow Freight 300 at Atlanta Motor Speedway _ Jeff Green doesn't
care how many Winston Cup drivers crowd Busch series races.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a sore point lately with some Busch drivers as they've
watched a number of their own fail to qualify for events while Cup
drivers make the field.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's final round of qualifying, nine Winston Cup
drivers were in the race (four among the first 10 starters) and 19
Busch teams packed up and went home. Among those failing to
qualify: six drivers ranking in the top 20 in points, including
Chuck Bown (10th) and Jeff Purvis (12th).
</P>
<P>
   Dave Blaney, whose average start in three races is 23rd, has the
pole after qualifying at 186.755 mph. Green was just 0.017 of a
second slower but he's not crazy about his No. 32 Chevrolet just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're as good as we need to be to win this
race,'' Green said. ``I think we've got a top-five car. It's not
good enough yet. We're out of practice (time) so we're going to
have to guess a little bit. But I've got some awful good guessers
in my corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is ninth in points, despite failing to qualify at
Rockingham. And that experience hasn't moved him to join in the
anti-Cup sentiment in the Busch garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to go home,'' he said. ``But you've got to have
your act together when you come in the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the Cup drivers have a right to be in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Cup guys, they put their pants on just like I do and I
can beat them every week if we have the right opportunity,'' Green
said. ``When we do beat those guys, it makes you know that you've
done your job that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do make us better, they make us work harder. There are
Busch guys that are just racing four or five races a year and they
sent some people home today. People don't look at that as those
people doing anything wrong. So you can't say the Cup guys are
doing anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's brother, Mark, starts sixth in the No. 50 Chevy. He'd
like to see to a Busch version of last week's Cup race at Las Vegas
when the Burton brothers, Jeff and Ward, battled the last four
laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and myself once ran first and second at Myrtle Beach
coming to the checkered flag,'' Jeff said. ``Not as close a race as
it was with the Burtons, that was pretty special. I thought it'd be
awesome to do that. Hopefully, it's coming.''

 &HT;    Bobby Labonte puts Pontiac on AMS pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A driver of a Pontiac hasn't won NASCAR's Winston Cup
points title since Rusty Wallace held off Dale Earnhardt in the
final race of 1989 for his only championship.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500 at Atlanta
Motor Speedway is only the fourth event of this year's 34-race
schedule, Pontiac appears to be making a major push toward gaining
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Pontiac charge is Bobby Labonte, who won his second
consecutive pole by covering the 1.54-mile oval of AMS in 28.437
seconds, an average speed of 194.957 mph. It was the second-fastest
qualifying mark at the track since it was reconfigured before the
`97 season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we thought we were headed (in the right) direction
all year long (in the Pontiac),'' Labonte said. ``Then they came
out with the new spoiler and air-dam rule and I think that helped
us. ... We're awfully excited. The Pontiacs aren't hurting for
anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac put four drivers among the top 10 qualifiers for
Sunday's race. Mike Skinner was second in a Chevrolet at 194.226
mph, but rookie Tony Stewart, who pairs with Labonte on Joe Gibbs'
team, was third-fastest at 194.192.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bobby running so well, it's easier for me to come here
and have a comfortable setup,'' Stewart said. ``I try not to bother
Bobby unless I have to, but it's great to be able to share
information with him. It makes both of us better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford drivers Dale Jarrett and Jeremy Mayfield round out the top
five qualifiers, but rookie Buckshot Jones and John Andretti also
made the top 10 in Pontiacs. Chevy also has four cars in the top
10, including two-time defending Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who will
start eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Pontiac drivers led only 7 percent of nearly 10,000
laps and collected only two victories on the circuit. This year,
Pontiac has led 17.3 percent of the first 860 laps, including 71
laps led by Ward Burton in last week's Las Vegas 400.
</P>
<P>
   In the three races since the reconfiguration at AMS, the winner
hasn't started in the top 10. Labonte won in November 1997 after
starting 21st, then followed that with another victory in March
after starting 14th. Gordon started 21st in November's
rain-shortened event, but won a 25-lap shootout over Jarrett.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Reared in the poverty of a bleak housing project,
Arthur Murray, 29, had kicked around for years with two boyhood
pals _ ``Now one's dead and one's in prison'' _ before finding his
way to the carpenter's union hall. Now an apprentice, he is headed
toward a $27-an-hour job.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Alex, 43, searching for a job after a recent divorce, knew
that supporting two children on the wages of a secretary or a
waitress would be daunting. Always handy around the house, she
landed a job in the building trades as a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Giron, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico as
a boy, once viewed plumbers, carpenters and bricklayers as ``just
big white guys.'' But now he wears the hard-hat and steel-toed
boots of a carpenter, and the union people tell him that his
ability to speak Spanish as well as English will be a help on the
construction site, not a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a shortage of trades workers to meet the voracious
demand for construction in the United States, desperate builders
and eager unions have begun aggressive campaigns to court new
workers, attracting women and members of racial minorities to the
traditional bastion of white men, a world where a coveted union
card was handed from father to son.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-area carpenters union is investing $15,000 a year in
each trainee in its apprenticeship program and last December opened
a $3.5 million training center in a poverty-scarred neighborhood on
the city's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   Besides broadening the labor pool, leaders in the construction
field are working to enhance the image of the trades worker, a
career path that has often lost out to the prestige of a college
education or the dazzle of the high-technology field. But many
school counselors are starting to urge some students to give a
second look to the trades, jobs that often pay $50,000 a year to
workers with a high school education, offer a sense of
accomplishment, and have family-friendly work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we have come to view these as hard, dirty
jobs,'' said Jim Turffs, a high school career counselor in Oregon,
Ill. ``There's a stigma that if you wear jeans and a T-shirt,
you're not as intelligent. But these are good jobs, paying good
money. And you know, there are some drawbacks to being stuck at a
desk for 10 hours a day, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the unemployment rate among skilled trades
workers has fallen below 6 percent, the lowest level on record. A
shortage of skilled workers ranks as the most serious problem
facing contractors, according to a survey by the National
Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the No. 1 problem all over the country,'' said Tom Woods,
a builder in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., who leads the
association's new task force on the labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   He said the worker deficit had driven up labor costs, especially
in overtime wages, and often forced customers to wait six months,
or even a year, to move into a new house, compared with the
traditional 60-day wait.
</P>
<P>
   As just about anyone knows who needs to build an addition,
renovate a kitchen, or even fix a dripping bathroom faucet, it is
sometimes nearly impossible to get through to a trades worker. They
are overwhelmed with work.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the builders group in December found that 87
percent of contractors reported shortages of carpenters, and that
the situation was worst in the Midwest and Northeast. The report
also found that 75 percent of contractors reported ``significantly
higher costs of labor'' in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Graham, a project manager for a New York City builder,
said his customers must wait at least 12 weeks for work to begin. A
few years ago, people sometimes waited only a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electricians are so busy they don't have time to bid jobs,''
said Graham, who works for 3-D Laboratory. ``And you can't find
anybody down at the union hall. They're all out working.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the builders surveyed expressed concerns
about the quality of available skilled trades workers. Some
builders said they had absorbed higher labor costs because work had
been done improperly and needed to be redone.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Klein, a builder in Tulsa, Okla., said his company, Kleinco,
had been forced to turn away business, because it lacked enough
skilled workers, and he worried that the problem could worsen, as
the average age of trades workers increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out at my carpenters, and they're mostly in their
40s,'' he said. ``This used to be a young man's game.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to attract more young people into the building
trades, in the view of industry and labor officials, stems partly
from the decline of vocational education in public schools. High
schools that once offered courses in automotive work or building
trades, for example, have increasingly come to measure themselves
in terms of the percentages of students they send to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat into their heads that unless you get a college
education, you're a failure,'' Woods said. ``We, as a society, have
failed young people by giving them that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools that retained the industrial arts, in some cases, used
the shop floor as a place to send misfits. ``If you had an unruly
kid,'' Woods said, ``there was this idea, `We'll just make a
bricklayer or a carpenter out of him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in appeal of working in the trades, all sides of the
construction field agree, stems in large part from the plebeian
image of manual labor in American society, where the work force
increasingly sits in front of a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   On television and in movies, industry and labor leaders say,
trades workers have often been lampooned, depicted as overweight
men in ill-fitting clothes, speaking in fractured grammar and
holding benighted social views.
</P>
<P>
   The reality on the construction site today is far more diverse.
Alesia Cherry, 28, a carpenter apprentice who was framing metal
studs at one of the union's training facilities on a recent
afternoon, teaches English at night at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was a carpenter,'' Ms. Cherry said, adding,
with a laugh, ``Of course, he probably wouldn't think a woman
should be doing this kind of work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Her love of books, she said, hardly meant that she could not
also find gratification in the construction of roof trusses. For
centuries, the artisans in the building crafts were among the most
highly regarded workers in Europe, she noted. She said she would
continue to teach after becoming a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Another apprentice in the carpenter's program, Steve Wilson, 27,
is a social worker with a degree from Illinois State University. He
worked with young men who were offenders, and simply grew weary of
the stress, and the long odds of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I start work at 6 a.m. and I'm done at 2:30 p.m., and I
can look at something and say, `I built that,''' Wilson said.
``Besides that, it pays better.''
</P>
<P>
   For some young people of working-class backgrounds, it is the
very success of the building trades that has propelled them in a
different direction. They are the children of carpenters, plumbers
or bricklayers who were able to give their families the comforts of
middle-class life, and the aspirations to go even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ball, a high school senior in Oregon, Ill., is the son and
grandson of tool-and-die tradesman, a young man who has great
respect for the craft that pays more than $40,000 a year. But he
will be enrolling in a private college this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a lawyer,'' said Ball, who is drawn to history,
government and politics. ``It was just always assumed that I would
go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders and unions are making greater efforts to speak to high
school students at career days, hoping to portray a life in the
trades in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said builders were emphasizing the appeal of the working
hours, noting that it is the carpenters and plumbers who have time
to coach Little League and soccer games in the early evening. In
addition, he said, young people need to know that technological
advances have made construction worker a bit less physically
taxing. Carpenters often use nail guns, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical labor is still involved, but not nearly like it used
to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Isaacson, the vice president of the district that
governs unions for 32,000 carpenters in the Chicago area,
meanwhile, stresses the benefits of trade union work. He noted that
carpenters now receive pensions of about $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In its apprenticeship program, the union even gives trainees a
$300 tool allowance. Apprentices start training at an indoor
facility for nine weeks, practicing before going out to jobs. As
trainees, they earn about $10 an hour. Their wages increase
gradually over five years to the journeyman level, now about $27 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   For young workers like Murray, who recalls the scarcity faced
growing up in the Robert Taylor Homes housing project, the
apprenticeship program amounts to a chance at the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to build a new house,'' said Murray, who is married and
has four children. ``It's my goal. And I'm going to reach it.''

 &HT;    Carter's size, quickness provide Falcons more flexibility at
safety
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons went into the offseason looking to get a
little faster and a little younger in the secondary. They
accomplished both Friday, when unrestricted free-agent safety Marty
Carter signed a five-year contract worth about $15million.
</P>
<P>
   Carter led the Bears in tackles three of the past four seasons
after playing four seasons for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Carter is four years younger than last season's strong
safety, William White, will be later this month. In the 6-foot-1,
214-pound Carter, the Falcons get more flexibility than they had in
White. Where White left the field in passing situations last
season, Carter will be an every-down player because of his speed.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who got a $2.6million signing bonus that leaves the
Falcons $1million or less under the salary cap, couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   A native of LaGrange, he lives in Marietta in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost didn't get any sleep last night because I thought I
would wake up and find out this was a dream,'' said Carter, who had
18 tackles in the Bears' 20-13 loss in Atlanta last Nov. 22. ``It
means a lot to have the chance to play in the ultimate game with
what is basically your home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother (who lives in LaGrange) would come to Chicago for
games in the winter, and it would be so cold she would end up
watching them on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter could move to a linebacker spot in passing situations now
that linebacker Cornelius Bennett is no longer with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played both safety spots; lined up at linebacker,'' he
said. ``Just let me make plays. I'll play wherever they want me
to.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons hired Giants assistant director of media relations
Aaron Salkin, who was in New York when coach Dan Reeves was there,
to replace director of media relations Charlie Taylor, who resigned
two weeks ago. ... Linebackers Jessie Tuggle and Ben Talley,
natives of Griffin, will be honored in their hometown with a parade
at 4 p.m. today. Tuggle also will be honored before a 1 p.m. Harlem
Globetrotters game at Alexander Memorial Coliseum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ There, on one stage at a conference, sat
some of the best economic minds in the nation _ Gary Becker, Nobel
laureate; Merton H. Miller, Nobel laureate; Douglass North, Nobel
laureate; Myron S. Scholes, Nobel laureate, and Michael R. Milken,
fallen financier.
</P>
<P>
   Having the dethroned junk bond king rub shoulders with Nobel
laureates was not all that incongruous. As a brochure from the
conference notes, The Wall Street Journal once described Milken as
``arguably the most important financial thinker of the century.''
Besides, it was Milken's party, and he could crow if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The Milken Institute Global Conference, which ended on Friday,
is part of the resurrection of Milken. Since leaving prison in
1993, he has enlisted his personal fortune and wide network of
contacts in an effort to become an influential force in medical
research, education and economics.
</P>
<P>
   His Association for the Cure of Cancer of the Prostate, formed
after the disease was diagnosed in Milken, has given away $65
million, much of it from Milken himself, becoming the leading
private sponsor of prostate cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   His Milken Family Foundation, run with his brother, Lowell,
makes awards of $25,000 each to about 150 teachers annually, part
of an effort to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   And Milken, 52, barred from securities trading for life, is
rebuilding a business empire in education. His Knowledge Universe
has quietly acquired companies in businesses ranging from day care
centers to computer training, with combined revenues of $1.2
billion last year. One unit, a corporate consulting firm called
Nextera Enterprises, has filed to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The economic conference was sponsored by the Milken Institute,
his small research center. In addition to the Nobel laureates,
speakers included Gov. Gray Davis of California, Mayor Richard H.
Riordan of Los Angeles and former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana.
Reggie Jackson, the former baseball star whom Milken enlisted to
spread cancer awareness among minorities, sat by Milken's side at
the opening dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was only a coincidence that the conference was at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel, site in the 1980s of several of Milken's
extravagant junk bond conferences, known as Predators' Balls. In a
coincidence of timing, however, the conference took place the week
when the largest and most celebrated deal Milken financed, the 1989
buyout that created RJR Nabisco, was undone by RJR's decision to
break itself apart.
</P>
<P>
   Those at the conference, at least, seemed to care little about
his past. Supporters said Milken was active in philanthropy long
before he went to jail and is spending too much time and money for
it to be a charade. Besides, they ask, what's wrong with trying to
improve one's image by doing good?
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, you don't hold it against someone for
the rest of their lives,'' said North, a professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. ``My view is he's doing generally
constructive things now, and they are worth supporting. He's using
his money more intelligently than a lot of rich people do.''
</P>
<P>
   Milken declined to be interviewed. But in a brief conversation
he discouraged any interpretation of his motives, saying of the
conference, ``It is what it is,'' and adding, ``It takes time for
people to not be emotional about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Milken served two years of a 10-year sentence for violating
securities laws, and after leaving prison in 1992 was diagnosed
with cancer and given 12 to 18 months to live. The cancer, though,
is now in remission, and Milken is vigorous. But his sense of
having limited time has made him as driven and obsessive as he was
in his days at Drexel Burnham. He has staff meetings at 6:30 a.m.
and calls aides late at night when ideas occur to him, which is all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the cancer has also made Milken stop to smell the roses,
literally. Besides conventional treatment, he has turned to
alternatives like meditation and aroma therapy, having flowers
planted around his house and smelling them to bolster his immune
system. He has gone to a low-fat, high-soy diet and even been
co-author of a cookbook, from which proceeds go to cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer foundation is given credit by scientists for
accelerating research and changing the way it is done. But
Knowledge Universe, while growing rapidly, still must prove it can
change education, as opposed to merely changing the ownership of
companies already in the business.
</P>
<P>
   The Milken Institute and its Global Conference are the least
significant of Milken's activities in terms of time and money. Even
some institute officials acknowledge that so far it has had little
impact on public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1991, the Milken Institute became a haven for young
PhDs to do scholarly but obscure research. In 1997, Donald H.
Straszheim, then chief economist at Merrill Lynch, was brought in
as president, expanding the staff and shifting toward work of
interest to businessmen and politicians rather than academics.
</P>
<P>
   This second annual Global Conference is part of that effort.
Peter Passell, formerly a business reporter for The New York Times,
is revamping the institute's magazine, with a new, sprightlier
version being sent free to 10,000 influentials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the institute's young researchers were dismissed or
quit, complaining that serious scholarly work was less valued than
was preparing slides for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has always been very unhappy with the institute, and it
has never accomplished what he wants,'' a former researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Another said: ``I think he wants basically nothing more than a
venue from which to address the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are still in flux, and the institute is still searching
for a firm footing. ``Changing a culture is not easy,'' Straszheim
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides appearing with the Nobel laureates, Milken delivered one
of his trademark speeches to the 1,000 people in the audience, an
hourlong ramble that meandered from the return on investment of the
Louisiana Purchase to the ethnic mix in Los Angeles, but along the
way he emphasized his perennial themes _ the need for capital
sources other than banks, the necessity for medical research and
the importance of education and human ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money has long ceased to be a major determinant in the
creation of value,'' he said. Though for Milken, who once made $550
million in a year, money helps in moving him back into the
limelight. But the value of his legacy, which he cares deeply
about, will be based on more than that.

Texas Tech women have something to prove
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ There has been one thing that has driven the Texas Tech
Lady Raiders to a 28-3 record and the Big 12 women's title. There
has been one thing that has driven senior Angie Braziel to earn Big
12 Player-of-the-Year honors. There has been one thing that has
driven coach Marsha Sharp to earn conference Coach-of-the-Year
honors.
</P>
<P>
   There has been one thing on the Lady Raiders' minds every time
they hit the weight room, take shot after shot duringpractice and
when they tip off at the start of games this season _ revenge.
</P>
<P>
   They were the top seed last year at home when they were stunned
by Notre Dame in an embarrassing 74-59 loss. Their loyal fans
watched in shock as the Lady Raiders failed to advance beyond the
second round for the second consecutive season. This was a team
used to winning, staring every day at the 1993 National Champion
banner earned by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw them (after the loss), I knew it was
something that affected them a great deal,'' Sharp said. ``From
that very moment, in the weight room, the things they did on their
own in the spring and summer, was more impressive than any group
I'd ever coached. They spent more time getting ready for this year
than any group we've ever had here. It carried over to our workouts
early and everything we did as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have gone over that game hundreds of time in their
minds, eagerly awaiting the day when they again could step onto the
court in another first-round NCAA Tournament game. The opportunity
comes tonight when the second-seeded Lady Raiders host No. 15 seed
Stephen F. Austin at 8 p.m. at the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum.
Tenth-seeded North Carolina State and No. 7 seed Mississippi State
play at 5:30 p.m. in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lady Raiders (28-3) are the easy favorite against
the Ladyjacks, who got an automatic bid by winning the Southland
Conference tournament, they won't be thinking about their possible
second-round matchup. That is what was to blame for last year's
upset, Braziel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking about our next game too much,'' the 6-foot-2
post said. ``We would have played Louisiana Tech, and we were
focusing on them rather than Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Making its 12th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, SFA is
anything but the typical 15th seed. The Ladyjacks, who dealt with
the suicide of former star player Katrina Price, bring an
uncharacteristically mediocre 17-11 record into this year's
Tournament. However, they have won 10 of their last 12 games and
have gained strength and unity through tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a group that has gone through adversity like
they have, you become stronger,'' said Sharp, whose team is making
its 10th consecutive tournament appearance. ``And they are an
unbelievable 15th seed. I was surprised that they were that low.
They are extremely scary to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As is Tech to SFA. After all, the Lady Raiders are perfect at
home this year and hold a nine-game winning streak. Braziel leads
them in scoring with a 20.6 average, and senior guard Rene Hanebutt
is averaging 15.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest concern about Tech is that they are such a
complete basketball team,'' SFA coach Royce Chadwick said.
``They've got the best post player (Braziel) in the country and one
of the best shooters (Hanebutt). (Forward Keitha) Dickerson is one
of the best defensive players. They don't have any weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders also will be better equipped to handle the
intensity. Last year, they were a No. 1 seed; this year, they're
No. 2. That top billing made for weighty pressure, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than overlooking (Notre Dame) last year, we probably were
a little overwhelmed,'' Sharp said. ``(It was) the first time we'd
ever been a No. 1 seed, first time the regional had ever been held
in Lubbock. I can tell you that I've never felt as much pressure in
my life to stay in a tournament as I did last year, trying to be
here at home for our fans in the regional level. It really crushed
us.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of pressure, the same kind they've put on
themselves every day since that crushing loss to end last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though they won 28 basketball games, this season
won't be successful for them unless they go erase that memory from
the NCAA Tournament,'' Sharp said. ``After we won (the Big 12
tournament) Saturday night, we sat in the dressing room for a
moment as a group and talked about it. And the commitment I could
see on their faces was special to me because I think they finally
got to a point where they felt like they could go vindicate
themselves a little bit. In their minds, the success of their
season rests on the ability to get this done.''

Davis' involuntary departure, Arkansas weigh heavy on Iowa
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ He says he isn't dwelling on the finality of it all. There
is another team to scout, another game plan to fine-tune, another
40 minutes to scheme and matchups to fret about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought much beyond that,'' Tom Davis said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes say something different. You see that in the faces of
his players, too, as an era of Iowa basketball ends and ends badly,
no matter how much the man at the center of one of the season's
stranger stories tries to put on a civil face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about it, and coach doesn't really want us to
think about it,'' Hawkeyes guard Kent McCausland said. ``But every
time we go out there, we give a little more, because we know there
will be a change after this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the strange reality since last April, when the
school announced Davis' contract would not be renewed. His 13th
season as Hawkeyes head coach would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can fathom why.
</P>
<P>
   Those years, after all, have produced 11 trips to the
postseason, nine of those to the NCAAs. They have resulted in a
268-139 record, part of a 542-289 mark in a 28-year head coaching
career that has included stops at Lafayette, Boston College and
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Davis' teams never lost a first-round NCAA game.
That modest but still remarkable trend continued with Thursday's
elimination of Alabama-Birmingham, setting up this afternoon's
second-round meeting with Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   If seeds hold, the No. 4 Razorbacks will put an end to the run.
And try as the Hawkeyes might to make the farewell party an upbeat
affair, the sadness in the eyes and the hesitation in the voices
tell a different story, one not short on irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' senior forward Jess Settles said, '' but the way
it's turned out, everybody in Iowa loves coach Davis now.''
</P>
<P>
   A 19-9 season has helped rekindle those affections. So has the
fact that Davis, a rumpled 60-year-old with an elfin smile, has
done his best to take the high road throughout.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to keep the parting as amicable as possible. He
continued to honor the commitment even when athletic director Bob
Bowlsby explained the move in an interview with a national
magazine, citing differences over scheduling, recruiting and the
character of some players as reasons for the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with the pulpit clearly his, Davis continues to keep
his own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been dealing with this all season,'' he said. ``When
it's over, maybe there will be a time to look back and reflect on
things a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not now.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before play began in this half of the West Regional,
Davis and Nolan Richardson ran into each other in a McNichols
Sports Arena hallway. The Arkansas coach had a broad smile and a
warm handshake for a man he called a fellow ``cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is 57. Even with a 1994 national championship in his
pocket, he wonders when his time will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches like Tom, myself, John Thompson, John Chaney _ to me,
those are the cowboys,'' Richardson said. ``Our days are numbered.
But are they numbered as bad as the ones coming behind them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm the age I am at. I'm glad I don't have to look
over my shoulder at some little young AD who's come to fire me.
Some of them are hired to fire you.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis wasn't exactly fired. He simply was told he no longer was
needed after 13 mostly successful years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of those years has become a hot topic of discussion
back home. Davis' supporters cite the NCAA bids and just two losing
seasons. They also point to the fact that ``Dr. Tom'' has run a
program that for the most part has steered clear of negative
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Critics view all this in a different light. They say the program
has been in a holding pattern since Davis' first season, when the
Hawkeyes won 30 games and came within a game of the Final Four.
They also note Iowa hasn't advanced beyond the NCAA second round
since 1988, and that Davis' teams never won a Big Ten championship.
</P>
<P>
   Davis takes pride in being a teacher and coach who can get the
most out of the available talent. This year's team earned another
NCAA bid despite losing its potentially best shooter, Kyle
Galloway, to a back injury and forward Sam Oakey to a broken wrist.
Each had been counted on to contribute to a club picked to finish
in the lower half of the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Even shorter on talent than expected, Iowa nevertheless
prospered. The Hawkeyes ended Kansas' 62-game home winning streak
with a 65-61 victory Dec. 8 in Lawrence. Despite losing eight of
its last 13, Iowa earned a No. 5 seed in this West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how much this means to him,'' junior guard Ryan
Luehrsmann said. ``We want to keep it going as long as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating a deeper, more athletic Arkansas team to earn a trip to
Phoenix may be a tall order. Either way, Davis will take them one
at a time at least one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing what I've done for 13 years in terms of trying to
develop the program, a clean program that is respected around the
country for playing by the rules with good guys _ stuff like
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, stuff like that isn't enough anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Tom Davis has another game to worry about, another 40
minutes to plot and ponder. The time to think of other things will
come soon enough.

 &HT;    Gore announces $25 million to fight citrus canker
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dropping by for lunch, dinner and a
reception, Vice President Al Gore collected $600,000 for his
presidential campaign Friday during a 12-hour stay in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took in $150,000 at the Four Seasons Resort where the lunch
crowd paid $1,000 each to dine with the leading candidate for the
Democratic nomination. Then he traveled to the Sheraton Bal Harbor
Hotel near Miami Beach, where he attended a reception with 200
contributors who gave him $250 each. He then moved on to dinner
there where 400 people paid $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   While $600,000 may seem like a lot of money, it's just a small
chunk of the $20 million that candidates are expected to need to
win their party nominations next year. Gore is the Democratic
front-runner, with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, his only
announced opponent, a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech in Palm Beach was a grab-bag of political goodies
for everyone. He said the country needs better schools, a robust
economy, better health care, protection of Social Security, equal
pay for equal work, more progress in civil rights, stronger
families, a health-care bill of rights and an unshakable commitment
to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughed after Gore said that on his way to Palm Beach
he read a 19th century description of the island that said it was a
patch of South Seas excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things don't change,'' Gore said. ``It also said you
could buy land here for $1 an acre. Some things do change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can expect to see a lot more of him in Florida,''
said Palm Beach County Commissioner Burt Aaronson, a staunch
supporter. ``We have to do everything we can to get him elected, or
Democrats could be in trouble for a long time.''

THE CLINTONS' MARRIAGE AND THE BELTWAY BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CLINTON-HOPE) 
(mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a court of law, the evidence would have been
considered laughably circumstantial. But in a city primed for
scandal and hooked on scuttlebutt, it inevitably took on the cast
of something significant, or at least something worth chattering
about.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: The Utah ski vacation two weeks ago. Bill and Hillary
Clinton ended it a day ahead of schedule, heading back to the White
House with such haste that the reporters who travel with the
president were left, atypically, in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: The trip to Central America this week. He went and
she didn't, although she was supposed to. The first lady's
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said Mrs. Clinton was nursing a back
injury that she had aggravated on the slopes. But the ailment had
not kept her from a hectic schedule of appearances in New York just
three days after her return from the snowy West.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit C: The dedication of a shrine to Clinton Friday in his
hometown, Hope, Ark. It was a big occasion for the big guy, but she
wasn't there. Scheduling conflicts, Ms. Berry said, and anyway the
back was ``still tender.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a strained muscle and a crammed dance card might well
have been the humdrum sum and summary of the situation. But it was
a measure of this moment in the Clintons' marriage, and in Mrs.
Clinton's flirtations with a future beyond the White House, that
questions about the state of their union wafted from dinner tables
inside the Beltway and set Ms. Berry's phone to jangling.
</P>
<P>
   In the suspicion-rich aftermath of Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky,
impeachment and the rest of it, a strange and ghoulish vigil has
undeniably taken hold here. It's a marital death watch, perhaps
arising less from any smoke signals that the Clintons are sending
out than from Washington insiders' presumptions about what they
would do if they were in Mrs. Clinton's pumps.
</P>
<P>
   And it demonstrates the way the tornado of attention surrounding
Mrs. Clinton's possible political ambitions is sweeping all aspects
of her life into its funnel cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first lady's advisers and friends dismissed this
week's speculation about new troubles in the Clintons' relationship
as so much overblown hooey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for this unfortunate mishap on the ski slope in Utah,
Mrs. Clinton would be _ we would all be _ in Central America with
the president,'' Ms. Berry said toward the end of the week, the
good cheer in her voice intact.
</P>
<P>
   As for a few news reports of heightened discord between the
couple, Ms. Berry said, ``I don't know what it's based on.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a convergence of circumstances has intensified
scrutiny of the Clintons' marriage. Beyond the scheduling oddities,
there are the books being peddled simultaneously, and with enormous
fanfare, as privileged peeks into the couple's private hearts.
</P>
<P>
   In ``All Too Human,'' the former White House aide George
Stephanopoulos recalls scenes of playful affection, like Mrs.
Clinton's hand-feeding her husband lemon wedges dipped in honey.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Monica's Story,'' the writer Andrew Morton, weaving threads
of information, opinion, fantasy and pure vitriol from Ms.
Lewinsky, posits a coldness and distance between the Clintons that
forces the president to look elsewhere for emotional and sexual
comfort and leads him to talk about the possibility of bachelorhood
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mrs. Clinton's professed contemplation of a Senate
candidacy in New York. Entering the race would mean more time away
from the White House, and the establishment of a beachhead in New
York before the president's lease at Pennsylvania Avenue is up.
</P>
<P>
   Is that an omen of a more lasting separation to come?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a media strategist who
knows the Clintons well.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ickes, one of Mrs. Clinton's current political advisers,
similarly scoffed at the various notions floating around this week,
including a tidbit that the Clintons had essentially separated
while remaining under one capacious roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it is totally goofy,'' Ickes said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps best capturing the quasi-absurd flavor of this latest
inning in the guessing game, another adviser, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, attributed the conjecture to nothing less
than a conspiracy of innuendo orchestrated by Rupert Murdoch's
media empire.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser noted that the three news outlets that first ran
accounts about the Clinton marriage this week were tied to Murdoch.
Those outlets were Fox News and The New York Post, both owned by
him, and The Drudge Report, an online newsletter whose publisher,
Matt Drudge, appears regularly on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Murdoch, chuckled at the
accusation of conspiracy and said he did not think that Murdoch
would have any interest in responding to it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, swells of anger have often roiled the Clintons'
marriage, and they have frequently gone their separate ways, a
modern couple with dual and sometimes dueling schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have always been like two ships passing in the night,''
said someone familiar with the Clintons' daily routines inside the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes to go to bed early,'' this person said. ``He stays
up late, making phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said the president would go stag to the Gridiron
dinner in a week, with the first lady and the couple's daughter,
Chelsea, taking advantage of Chelsea's spring break from Stanford
University to tour northern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton is expected to be back for the White House
radio and television correspondents' dinner. What's more, just
before she leaves for Africa, she and the president will both be
host at a St. Patrick's Day party at the White House, Ms. Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several friends said late this week that to their eyes, the
marriage had not taken any noticeable turns in the last month. But
no one claimed to know definitively what was going on, as no one
but the Clintons really could.

 &HT;    Fine cabinetry, hidden storage blend tour kitchens with rest of
house
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mahogany islands that look more like fine furniture
than kitchen bars.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet doors and drawers that conceal not just pots and pans
but refrigerators and freezers.
</P>
<P>
   Arched alcoves that double as corner pantries while making them
more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   So what's happened to the kitchen as we know it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see some really clean lines to the design of
kitchens, spaces that are less complicated in some ways but with
more attention being paid to the details and materials,'' said
designer Shirley McFarlane of Kitchensmith of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a kitchen that blends more than ever with adjacent
areas as it continues to evolve into a multipurpose room and, in
many cases, a status symbol. As eating out and taking out become as
common as drive-throughs and Tater Tots, cooking is only one of
several kitchen functions _ a gathering spot for entertaining
guests, an office for managing households, an unloading zone for
kids' books and toys.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of those trends can be seen March 20 during the second
annual Junior League of Atlanta Tour of Kitchens. The seven
featured kitchens, located in the Buckhead-Vinings area, will serve
up a smorgasbord of ideas for homeowners, whether they're building
or remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed at the people who came through last year who
were getting ready to start a renovation,'' said Suzy Smith,
chairman of the tour, which benefits teen pregnancy prevention
efforts. (The first event raised more than $25,000, for
scholarships aimed at developing teen leadership skills.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's kitchens include new construction and renovations,
designs for family lifestyles as well as for casual entertaining.
All but one are traditional, and most are high-end examples of
what's possible with deep pockets, though one by do-it-yourself
giant Home Depot's Expo Design Center is bound to inspire visitors
who might leave house tours feeling discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot who came last year were the do-it-yourselfers who left
with plenty of ideas, just not the $75,000 or $100,000 budgets to
do kitchens like these,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Several features are evident in this year's lineup:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Layouts that blend the kitchen with family room. Great rooms
are nothing new, but the flow between kitchen and den has led to
some major changes in the look of kitchens. Open kitchens mean
fewer walls, so efforts are being made to hide refrigerators and
other large appliances by integrating them with cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   A look behind what appear to be the doors of tall storage
cabinets in a kitchen on Nancy Creek Road reveals a freezer; a peek
in several of its drawers shows refrigerated compartments.
``Everything is pretty much tucked away,'' said McFarlane about her
integrated design for the corner kitchen, which is open to the
breakfast room, family room and rear staircase.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, designers are mixing surfaces and cabinet
heights to give the kitchen a more interesting look. In some tour
kitchens, granite-top islands stand beside ceramic-tile
countertops. White cabinets and stainless steel appliances are
integrated with natural wood islands. Wall cabinets hang at varying
heights and counters are higher not only to meet the needs of an
aging population but for the sheer convenience of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cabinets designed to resemble furniture. One of the most
dramatic changes has been the emphasis on cabinetry styling. As
with appliances, cabinets are designed so they don't stand out but
instead look as if they could be used in any room in the house.
</P>
<P>
   In Bruce Patterson's new Wieuca Road home, Rutt of Atlanta
created a streamlined kitchen that at first glance appears
contemporary for Atlantans' traditional tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing about this kitchen is the interior designer
(Bill Cook of Vermillion Designs) wanted the dramatic impact with
the yin and the yang of black and white,'' said Jere Bowden, owner
of Rutt. ``But the thing that softens the look is that the cabinets
are all wood instead of laminates, and the floors are small-plank
oak, which extend to other rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nancy Creek kitchen, the centerpiece is an
irregular-shaped granite-top island made of mahogany, with end
pieces inspired by carved stair pickets and containing display
shelves. Hidden behind the island's fine finish, intricate moldings
and brass hardware are state-of-the-art appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the mahogany gave us the opportunity to make the piece
look more like furniture and the overall environment warmer,''
McFarlane said. ``We're seeing more people going to more
furniture-quality products in their kitchens, not just pine, oak or
maple, but nicer finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walker and Mary Jane Candler remodeled their Arden Road
kitchen and family room, they sought to blend the rooms. Walker, an
architect, designed a kitchen floor in a basketwork pattern
containing oak and St. Joe brick pavers. The bricks complement
those in the existing breakfast room floor, and the wood picks up
the mahogany cabinets and heart pine ceiling beams from Savannah.
Columns flanking a large prep and eating island are faux finished
to resemble heart pine. An oak armoire serves as a handy depository
for book bags as the Candlers' three children enter the back door,
and in a nearby corner is a small workstation for storing recipes
and keeping track of schedules.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Architectural details not sacrificed. The heavy crown
moldings, architectural columns _ even arches _ common in many of
today's new homes aren't being ignored when it comes to kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Candler designed his kitchen to mimic a Palladian style pool
house in his back yard. ``I was trying to relate the two houses,''
he said, so he incorporated archways between the kitchen and
breakfast room.
</P>
<P>
   Archways, instead of doors, also are used to separate kitchens
from storage areas, such as corner pantries and wine rooms, so that
they're readily accessible to the cook.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the columns on the tour aren't just accents; they're
storage units chock full of food.
</P>
<P>
   In Patterson's kitchen, Rutt incorporated black columns flanking
the cooktop that slide out to reveal hidden spice racks. Another
pair, beside the sink, holds cleaning supplies. The secret units
help give the owner clean, open space for impromptu dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a place where I could entertain comfortably, where I
could cook and still be with my friends,'' said Patterson, a real
estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   Angular walls, which open the kitchen on one end to the entry
hall and on the other to the breakfast room, contain a wine storage
unit and a wet bar, convenient for large parties throughout the
house or intimate get-togethers in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden chose a warm white for the walls and cabinets that is not
sterile and sleek but clean and classic. The result is a timeless
combination that even the most traditional tastes will find
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference,'' she said, ``between being trendy and
having style.''

 &HT;    Children find they make a difference in their world, and ours,
by pitching in as volunteers
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazing things can happen when children become
volunteers. Just ask Judy Avison.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta (Ga.) woman and her 8-year-old daughter, Hannah,
decided to do something for children in foster care after watching
a television program last year that showed such youngsters using
plastic garbage bags to hold their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Avison and Hannah came up with the idea to collect suitcases to
replace the garbage bags and enlisted the help of Hannah's Brownie
troop to carry out the project.
</P>
<P>
   In less than four months, the Brownies collected 800 suitcases,
which they turned over to the Fulton County Department of Family
and Children Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls have learned that they can start something from
scratch and it can turn into something huge,'' says Avison.
``They've discovered that they can really make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Such projects are one way to enlarge the world of children and
help them grow spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are naturally empathetic and want to reach out,''
says Mimi Doe, author of ``10 Principles for Spiritual Parenting''
(HarperPerennial, 1998, $13). ``When kids ask what they might give
instead of what they might get, it's a beautiful way to bring to
light the principle that all life is connected. It can make magic
out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Doe, who lives in Concord, Mass., encourages her two daughters
to express their passions by giving to others. Her oldest child,
Whitney, 11, loves animals, and so collects sheets to take to local
animal shelters for bedding. And her other daughter, Elizabeth, 8,
loves to play the flute, and so regularly performs at a nearby
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried that my daughter would be upset when people
started to die,'' says Doe. ``But her concern is brightening up the
moment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield Hebrew Academy's Betty Minsk thinks volunteerism
supplies a way of connecting the school's students with the
spiritual values of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance of mitzvahs _ good deeds _ is basic to
Judaism,'' says Minsk, director of special education projects at
the Sandy Springs (Ga.) school. ``We teach that good deeds should
be performed all the time, at home and at school, as a way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   To put these ideals into action, Minsk, in partnership with
classroom teacher Sylvia Miller, organized a community day of
service last week for the 550 students at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The event was overwhelmingly successful,'' says Minsk. ``We
felt it made a tremendous impact on both the children and the
agencies, and the parents who came along were elated.''
</P>
<P>
   Doe understands the impact volunteerism has on youngsters and
youngsters have on volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are amazingly powerful,'' she says. ``Our children
can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of volunteer projects involving youngsters take place
each year across metro Atlanta. Everyone benefits. Here's a
sampling below, including ways children can become involved.
</P>
<P>
   American Red Cross
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHAT: High school Red Cross volunteers teach first aid and
disaster preparedness to Gwinnett County fourth- and fifth-graders.
The instruction takes place at Collins Hill High School in Suwanee
as part of the Red Cross Elementary Leadership Development
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  REACTION: ``It's very rewarding,'' says Paul Bruckman, 17, a
junior at Parkview High School in Lilburn, who has been
volunteering with the Red Cross since he was a sixth-grader. ``I
have so much fun with the kids, and I see the result,'' says the
Lawrenceville resident. ``A lot of times they will come up to me in
a store and say, `You taught me first aid.' It's great to think you
might have helped a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING INVOLVED: The Red Cross has volunteer opportunities
for children as young as 9. Many schools have Red Cross clubs that
take oncommunity service projects, and there are also leadership
development conferences and youth councils and boards that sponsor
service projects. For additional information, call Sharon Burton at
404-575-3111.Girl Scouts
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHAT: After learning that children in foster care usually
transport their belongings in plastic garbage bags, eight
second-graders from Brownie Girl Scout Troop 7313 in Alpharetta and
Roswell (Ga.) decided to do something about it. With help from
troop co-leader Judy Avison and the approval of the Fulton County
Department of Family and Children Services, the Brownies began a
campaign, Suitcases for Kids, to collect suitcases for kids in
foster care. To date, they have collected 800 slightly used
suitcases, duffel bags and backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  REACTION: ``It makes me feel good and it makes someone else
happy,'' says Megan Sweeney, 8, of Alpharetta. ``I thought it was a
very good project,'' says Hannah Avison, 8, of Alpharetta, who says
she wants to become president of the United States when she grows
up. ``Because of it, I got an interview on TV and talked in front
of our church and a whole bunch of other places.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TO HELP: To donate a suitcase or learn more about the project,
call Judy Avison at 770-664-9182.
</P>
<P>
   Hands On Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHAT: High school and middle school students serve as Saturday
morning tutors and mentors to children at East Lake Elementary
School in Atlanta, teaching them reading skills. Many tutors are
graduates of East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHY: Forty-five percent of Georgia students are not reading at
an acceptable level when they reach the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  REACTION: Nicole Riley, 13, an East Lake graduate, has been on
both the giving and receiving end of the Hands On Atlanta program.
Currently a seventh-grader at Glen Haven Elementary School in
Decatur, she now volunteers as an East Lake tutor. ``I help the
students with their reading and draw with them,'' says Riley. ``I
especially like helping the little children. I have learned from
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TO HELP: Hands On Atlanta offers numerous volunteer
opportunities for children, families and adults. For additional
information, call Youth Service Coordinator Ken Hansberry at
404-872-2252, Ext. 52.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Community Food Bank
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHAT: Every week special education students from Turner Middle
School in Atlanta help to sort food.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHY: To help feed the hungry and teach the students work
skills.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  REACTION: ``We pack food to give to people that don't have
food and let them know that we care about them,'' says Turner
Middle School student Crystal Foster, 15.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRAINING: The food bank shows its volunteers videos about
hunger that explain why the need for volunteer help is so great.
``The kids not only have fun, but learn how they are affecting
lives,'' says warehouse manager Kevin Dorsey. Dorsey frequently
brings in his own five kids, 6 to 14, to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TO HELP: Children 8 to 18 are welcome, but need to be
chaperoned by an adult. For additional information, call
404-892-FEED (3333), Ext. 230.Greenfield Hebrew Academy
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHAT: This Sandy Springs-based Jewish day school involved its
entire 550-member student body, from pre-kindergartners to
eighth-graders, in 28 service projects _ Community Concern Day _
throughout Atlanta last week. Projects ranged from cleanups and
tree plantings to activities with senior citizens and homeless
children.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHY: To honor the sacred Jewish injunction to perform mitzvahs
_ good deeds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  REACTION: ``It was really positive and really fun,'' says
eighth-grader Carla Bloomberg, 14, of Dunwoody (Ga.). She helped
wash windows, prepare food, clean toys, do laundry and sort books
for children at the Genesis Shelter, a facility for homeless
newborns and their families. ``They were just little things,''
Carla says. ``But they sure had an impact. You felt so good about
yourself afterwards, and the people at the shelter said we were a
big help.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TO LEARN MORE: For additional information about the program or
school, call Betty Minsk at 404-843-9900, Ext. 334.

 &HT;    Mississippi's casinos have paid off with prosperity _ for a
price
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ As big as an ocean liner and bathed in a ghostly
blue light, the pirate ship sits a few hundred feet offshore.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't move. It doesn't have to. This ship's quarry comes to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers come to Treasure Bay from all over, from all walks of
life: denim-clad locals and fur-wrapped visitors, twentysomethings
and octogenarians, blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians, all eager
to unload their doubloons within the hulking vessel.
</P>
<P>
   A few hunker over lush felt tables manned by sharply dressed
pirates' minions, whose hands blur in a hypnotic flurry of
card-fanning, dice dispensing and chip-scooping. Many more belly up
to endless rows of slot machines, which pulsate and ping with
electronic lights and bells and have seductive names such as
``Sizzling 7'' and ``Filthy Rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the fortunate ``win'' back a few coins. And then
proceed to fork over even more cash in the hope of getting
``lucky'' again.
</P>
<P>
   That human instinct is at the heart of this once-depressed Gulf
Coast city's multibillion dollar gaming industry, which has
accounted for more than 12,000 new jobs. Since gambling was
legalized here in 1992, nine mammoth casino-resort properties have
opened, and more are on the way. In six years, the number
ofvisitors has leapt from 1.5 million to 19 million per year. And
this crowded field is about to be joined by an even bigger player.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably already seen the commercial. Over pastoral
images of children swinging, seagulls gliding and shrimp boats
listing in a placid harbor, a plummy, faux-Scarlett O'Hara voice
(supplied by Elizabeth Taylor) drawls, ``And then, one day, it
happened. You looked up and there it was! Just like a storybook,
written large across the sky. . . . And after that, nothing was
ever the same. 'Course, we still like the smell of the magnolias.''
</P>
<P>
   What has ``happened'' is Beau Rivage, Biloxi's newest and
arguably grandest casino-resort, which opens Tuesday. The ad
epitomizes the balancing-act marketing plan behind this $650
million, 32-story behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Built by Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts Inc., Beau Rivage aims
to be a posh, five-star retreat with a Deep South flavor. It
outsizes the competition in nearly every way, with nearly 1,800
hotel rooms _ compared to 1,088 at the second-largest Imperial
Palace _ plus 12 restaurants, a 30-slip marina, a full-service spa
and a 1,550-seat theater that will offer ongoing performances by
the avant-garde circus troupe Cirque du Soleil. Yet, for all its
look-at-me largeness, Beau Rivage is less garish than neighboring
casino-resorts. The muted color scheme is heavy on pastel yellows.
Taylor's favorite trees, magnolias, even shade the lobby. And the
casino itself is a forest of floral prints and fringe.
</P>
<P>
   All the better to attract the target customer: affluent women
from out of state. Barry Shier, 43, chief executive officer of Beau
Rivage Resort, says states such as Georgia, Florida and Texas boast
``a level of affluence'' higher than Mississippi's.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic studies show that the typical visitor to the Gulf
Coast is female, over 45 and college-educated. It remains to be
seen whether Biloxi's working-class male visitors will take to Beau
Rivage and its nicotine-distressed murals, sushi bar and
aromatherapy chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the jackpot
</P>
<P>
   Deep within the bowels of Treasure Bay, Wonverlette Miller is on
a roll. The 29-year-old nurse's assistant from Hilton Head, S.C.,
has just scored a ``double jackpot'' on her slot machine, which is
spewing a slew of quarters into her waiting hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no skill to it,'' she tells an amazed onlooker. ``You
just sit down and play.''
</P>
<P>
   He does, feeding an adjoining machine with a roll of quarters.
Within four minutes, he's down to one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you do?'' asks Miller, aghast. ``You must have done
something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners and losers. It has become Biloxi's story.
</P>
<P>
   Such dizzying growth in so short a time has made some in the
city of 53,000 giddy with newfound prosperity. Others feel that
their simple way of life has been lost to the pirates forever.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1980s and early '90s were dire times in Biloxi. The
city, with its 26 miles of man-made beaches and picturesque
antebellum homes, had been for decades a popular getaway spot for
New Orleans' upper crust. But when Louisiana's oil industry hit the
skids in the late 1970s, money grew scarce and the vacationers
stayed away. The hotels started to fall into disrepair. Other
travelers bypassed Biloxi for beach towns in Alabama and the
Florida Panhandle. The city began to have trouble paying its bills.
``We couldn't even afford to buy tires for the police cars,'' says
Vincent Kreel, Biloxi's public affairs manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, several states in the Midwest and South hit
the jackpot with limited legalized gambling. In 1990, the
Mississippi Legislature cleared the way for the counties along the
Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast to offer dockside gambling.
The idea was to keep things small, with a historic riverboat feel,
so as not to insult the conservative Christian sensibilities of
many residents. Early on, one gaming official took pains to point
out in the Mississippi Business Journal that the combined square
footage of the dozens of casino boats then docked in Mississippi
was only as large as two Las Vegas casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought the industry would last maybe three or four
years,'' Shier says. But when gamblers began descending on the area
in droves, the casinos permanently dropped anchor. The riverboats
were replaced by immobile gaming barges and seamlessly fused with
land-based hotel and restaurant facilities. And gaming revenue
became an inextricable part of Biloxi's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rents, robberies
</P>
<P>
   Ask any number of Biloxi's merchants and they'll invariably say
the casinos have been good for business. Then, almost immediately,
they'll start talking about the downside.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody mentions the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to be, you could shoot a cannon down Beach Boulevard and
not hit anybody,'' says one restaurant owner, referring to Biloxi's
oceanfront thoroughfare. Others believe that crime in the area is
on the rise, pointing to a recent upturn in bank robberies.
Escalating rents and the loss of qualified employees to the casinos
are also concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of these problems is relative. Take the traffic.
True, Beach Boulevard and U.S. 110, which connects the coastal
highway to U.S. 10 inland, can get moderately conjested. But it
isn't exactly Atlanta's Spaghetti Junction during afternoon rush
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to combat traffic congestion by building a
3.5-mile loop around downtown and another connector in West Biloxi,
says David Nichols, Biloxi's chief administrative officer. As for
crime, he acknowledges that bank robberies are on the rise, but the
overall crime rate has fallen, he says, thanks to a burgeoning
police force funded by gaming tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has a solution for skyrocketing rents, which are
pricing some mom-and-pop operations out of high-profile beachfront
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz and Bobbie Winnett pay $3,000 a month rent for their small
beachfront boutique, Bobbie's Bikinis, up from around $800 a month
in the early '90s. Their business has improved slightly every year,
thanks to an influx of young women employed by the casinos as
cocktail waitresses. But if the rent continues to rise, the
Winnetts may have to move inland.
</P>
<P>
   Small pawnshops, which can be seen as barnacles on the boat that
is gambling, are thriving. Mark Millette, owner of Beach Pawn &AMP;
Gun, set up shop six years ago and has seen his business grow 10 to
15 percent annually. Thanks to his largely local customer base,
Millette is well-stocked with hocked jewelry, guns and stereos. ``I
just saw all the people coming to the area,'' he says. ``And I
thought, `Hey, whether you have a pawnshop or a Ruby Tuesday's,
things are going to be good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He's not just talking. There's a new, double-decker Ruby
Tuesday's just down the block. The wait for a table on Saturday
nights: an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   `A laissez-faire view'
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carter has the kind of energetic, up-with-people
personality common to young Southern ministers. He says
``wonderful'' a lot when preaching to the Leggett Memorial United
Methodist Church. ``Isn't it a wonderful day?'' he says to his
congregation of a year. ``It's wonderful to have y'all here.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the first Sunday in Lent, he's sermonizing passionately
about the need to ``examine ourselves'' in order to guard against
``unhealthy appetites.'' He never mentions gambling directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes talk about it, but I never rail against it,''
Carter, 37, says later. He understands that many who attend
services at the small beachfront church have, in his words, ``a
laissez-faire view'' of the local gaming industry. Some have even
found jobs in the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   His own feelings are unequivocal. ``I'm personally opposed to
it,'' Carter says. ``There's no question that it's rejuvenated the
coast, but I guess I see the underside of it.'' He ministers to the
homeless at a shelter in downtown Biloxi and says he sees plenty of
``personal destruction and despair'' caused by addictive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Mississippi's religious community are even more vocal
in their opposition to the casinos. Last year, legislative aide
Elizabeth Stoner, with the support of religious groups, tried to
force a statewide vote on gambling. A judge rejected the initiative
because it did not address what effect a ``no'' vote would have on
the state's economy. Gaming taxes now account for 10 percent of
Mississippi's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   And, to Carter, that's the rub. ``Many of my fellow pastors
oppose gambling, but now that it's here, they don't want to see it
taken away,'' he says. ``Our economy is tied to it. And that's a
big concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A bonanza in quarters
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Boomtown Casino, which looks from the outside like a
slice of Walt Disney World's Main Street, George Bowling dispenses
advice on how to win at the slots. ``It doesn't matter which
machine you play,'' he says. ``They're all the same. The only thing
that matters is that you stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old retired infantryman from Columbus, Ga., knows
what he's talking about. He's popped down to the casino for a few
minutes while his wife dresses for dinner, and he's already $100
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Another gambler, a reporter hopeful of understanding the lure,
if not getting on a roll of his own, wasn't faring as well. One
roll of quarters was gobbled up by a slot machine called Treasure
Wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He tried again.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the machine's spinning reels stopped on a bar. So
did the second. Then the final reel landed on a super-fancy
Treasure Wheel bar. The machine began to flash and ping. Quarters
spilled out at a breathtaking rate.
</P>
<P>
   He cashed out, admiring his winnings _ $14 _ and walked out of
the casino.
</P>
<P>
   As pirate spoils go, it wasn't much. But it felt like a million
bucks.

 &HT;    Walk in woods leads to other time and place
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ As winter strains to hold back spring, the
woods offer the most satisfying solitary walks.
</P>
<P>
   Every season is a fine one for appreciating and learning from
nature's gardening; spring, with its rich burst of wild plants _
trillium, lady's slipper, rattlesnake plantain, azalea and all the
rest _ dazzles, delights. And autumn sets souls on fire with colors
so hot and brilliant, radiating from dogwoods, maples, sourwood,
sassafras, red oak.
</P>
<P>
   But now, when neither spectacular bloom nor awesome leaf color
grabs a walker's attention, the woods' essence takes center stage,
simple, profoundly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   I have enjoyed countless woods walks with friends, lovers,
darlings. Assorted family members. Strangers. I even found pleasure
in trekking the woods with GI buds in Germany when I was a boy
soldier bivouacking.
</P>
<P>
   Walking alone brings me unique value, however.
</P>
<P>
   Like gardening, walking through woods transports me to simpler
times, unfraught. But because they predate any garden I've built,
the woods around the cabin feel more timeless than my planted
spaces. When I lose myself in the woods, I imagine a good life in a
natural, untouched place a thousand years ago _ or a thousand years
hence.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the only way to be truly alone is to walk alone.
Married, with children, they sleep with someone, wake up with
someone, take care of someone or go to work with someone _ then
start the cycle again. I believe many commuters shun company
because that is their only alone-opportunity. Even then, though,
they turn on car radios.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, I feel the desire from time to time to test my
tolerance for true aloneness. The timing was perfect the other day,
as I had done as much fall and winter planting as I intended. And I
was holding off on pruning for a little while. Not preoccupied, I
could occupy myself totally with the walk.
</P>
<P>
   The cloudless, blue-sky day was brisk, lit by sharp-edged
sunshine. The deeper I walked into the crunchy, crackly woods, amid
the white pines, hemlocks, Virginia pines _ all the workmanlike
trees that in spring become mere background for the showy azalea
and laurel _ the more striking the light became. It streaked
through the pine needles, bouncing here and there.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, the light hit mosses; in another, ground cedar. At
one point, I saw several bright spots about 10 yards away. So
bright, it had to be remarkably early blooms of some low-growing
perennial. A closer look showed it to be some kind of devil-weed,
perfectly lit. Throughout, pine branches with knots on the ends lay
like so many clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A good wind swooshed through branches as it swayed trees,
knocking them against one another. From time to time, I heard a
loud crack as another limb knocked too hard. The woods, populated
with tall skinny trees straining to reach the light, are punctuated
with others broken in half during blow-downs. Birds flitted through
all.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how long I was in there, but when I came out of the
woods, back into the angular day, I brought a few mosses for the
garden, a mental note on where to gather ferns, a question about
whether to transplant some ground cedar for ground cover. And, most
important, I brought back some time well spent.

ECUADORAN PRESIDENT IMPOSES SWEEPING AUSTERITY MEASURES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ After a two-day strike that paralyzed
commerce in Ecuador and sparked clashes between security forces and
demonstrators, Ecuadorans awoke Friday to find gasoline prices more
than doubled, many of their bank accounts frozen and the country's
politics still in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   President Jamal Mahuad announced a sweeping austerity package
late Thursday, after the general strike, which was called by labor
unions, opposition parties and student and indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   At least 235 people were arrested in skirmishes between
demonstrators and 15,000 soldiers and police officers who were
mobilized after the government declared a 60-day state of emergency
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's 39 commercial banks, the targets last week of huge
withdrawals by depositors who feared the banks were on the verge of
collapse, remained shuttered Friday for the fifth consecutive
business day.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad promised they will reopen Monday, but imposed severe
restrictions, limiting withdrawals to 50 percent of most checking
and savings accounts and freezing the remaining funds for up to a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confronted with this crisis, I could have done what many have
done: nothing,'' Mahuad said in a televised address to the 12
million Ecuadorans. ``But you elected me to do the right thing, not
to choose the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other austerity measures he plans is an increase in
the value-added tax to 15 percent, from 10 percent, a measure that
has drawn strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was called in an attempt to force Mahuad, a former
mayor of Quito, the capital, to rescind earlier austerity moves
that froze salaries of public workers and ended subsidies on
gasoline and other fuels.
</P>
<P>
   But as the left warned of further protests, conservatives took a
different but equally disenchanted view. Mahuad's chief aide, Jaime
Duran, had promised ``a move toward a radically different economic
model,'' but business leaders said the government's measures were
both misdirected and fell well short of what was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has wasted our time,'' Joaquin Zevallos, the
president of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, said Friday.
``You do not build a country with more price and tax increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, 49, a Harvard-educated lawyer, took office last August,
inheriting what he acknowledges is Ecuador's worst economic crisis
since the Depression:
</P>
<P>
   _ El Nino has inflicted over $2 billion in damages on the
country.
</P>
<P>
   _ The price of oil, the principal export, is sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ecuador's 1998 inflation rate, 43 percent, was the highest in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Since January the value of the sucre, the national currency, has
fallen in dollar terms by more than 40 percent, with most of the
decline occurring last week.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of finance, Ana Lucia Armijos, said Friday that the
worst may yet be to come, at least as regards inflation. ``These
are measures aimed at prices, and there is going to be a spike in
prices before the inflation rate starts to slow down,'' she said in
a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   There had been much speculation before the president's speech
that he might follow the path taken by Argentina and decree either
parity between the sucre and the dollar or outright dollarization.
</P>
<P>
   He did not take either step, but said ``it is possible'' he may
do so later, though only if he succeeds in implementing his reform
package swiftly. &QL;

LEWIS, HOLYFIELD AIM TO UNIFY HEAVYWEIGHT TITLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once Don King's sideshow shenanigans are stripped from
Saturday's heavyweight title unification fight, the key issues
aren't too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis is considered the harder puncher, and finally gets
an opportunity to carve his niche in boxing history. But even with
a 34-1 record, he hasn't been tested against a proven warrior like
Evander Holyfield. Does Lewis have the heart?
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is quicker, but talented big men like Lewis have given
him trouble. He will try to muscle inside to negate Lewis' 7-inch
reach advantage. But at 36, does Holyfield have the strength to
survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finally time for me to make my mark,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   To which Holyfield said: ``Lennox Lewis is just a bump in the
road I have to get past. He doesn't stand a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is a slight favorite in the 12-rounder at sold-out
Madison Square Garden in New York. The fight can be seen locally on
cable TV pay-per-view and is scheduled to begin about 10:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation
recognize Holyfield (36-3) as heavyweight champion. Lewis, a
33-year-old from England, holds the World Boxing Council belt.
Holyfield is making $20 million for the fight, compared with $10
million for Lewis. The victor will be the first undisputed
heavyweight champion since Riddick Bowe in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Lewis have never fought, but their careers have
been intertwined to an extent. Bowe defeated Holyfield in 12 rounds
to unite the title, but his WBC crown was taken away because he
refused to fight Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Bowe defeated Holyfield twice in three bouts. That could be
relevant, because Bowe stood 6-foot-5 and weighed 235 to 246 pounds
in those fights.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, also 6-5, weighed in at 246 pounds. The 6-2 1/2 Holyfield
weighed 215 pounds, identical to his weight when he knocked out
Mike Tyson in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad thing,'' Holyfield said of the size mismatch.
``I fight tall and short, and it's been a proven fact that I have
won in both cases. I don't compare (Lewis) to Bowe. Bowe happened
to be the most talented big guy I ever fought.''
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel Steward, a boxing legend who once trained Holyfield
and trains Lewis, said Lewis' size will pose problems for
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was involved with Evander and had any decision-making
authority, he would not be fighting Lennox Lewis,'' Steward said.
``Traditionally, Evander has a problem with taller guys. Whenever
he has to punch up, his rhythm is off. And Lennox is not just tall,
he's strong. There's a difference between being tall and being
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Holyfield has secured his place in boxing lore with
triumphs against Larry Holmes, George Foreman and Tyson. If he
beats Lewis, he will join Muhammad Ali as the only three-time
undisputed heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis probably has more motivation. He sought a major fight for
years without success, and a chance like this might not come again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Lennox Lewis' whole career,'' Steward said. ``After
this, there is no one else.''
</P>
<P>
   King is promoting the fight, and his hyperbolic stamp is
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a gracious opponent, Holyfield has been predicting a
third-round knockout, although power punching is not his game. Why
three rounds? Because God told him.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born Lewis has publicly called Holyfield a
hypocrite, because Holyfield speaks often about religion but has
fathered five illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   If this smacks of professional wrestling, that isn't unusual for
a King product.
</P>
<P>
   Doing his part, King said the satellite transmission of the
fight will temporarily end hostilities in Bosnia. He also said he
has undergone a religious conversion after Holyfield's victories
against Tyson, during which he stood in Tyson's corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've touched the garment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other championship bouts Saturday, highly touted Fernando
Vargas (15-0) of Oxnard, Calif., defends his IBF junior
middleweight title against Howard Clarke (26-10-2) from England.
WBA welterweight champ James Page (23-3) puts his title on the
title on the line against Sam Garr (25-2) of Stone Mountain, Ga. nn

THUNDER IN THIRD: HOLYFIELD READY TO POUND LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield, the man with the shaved head and
the shortened ears, is going to hit Lennox Lewis so hard tonight at
Madison Square Garden, the big man's dreadlocks are going to
straighten out on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Thunder is coming, Holyfield says, in the third round. I'm not
sure Lewis, even as big as he is, lasts that long.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield may be 36, he may be on his last legs and he may even
be the hypocrite Lewis says he is, but he's a proven warrior, and
that's something Lewis is definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   When the two best heavyweights on the planet meet tonight in a
title unification bout that has captured the imagination of boxing
fans like no fight since the first Holyfield-Mike Tyson battle, it
will be about carving out a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   On the line for Holyfield: A chance to stamp himself as one of
the premier heavyweights of all time. A loss at this stage of his
career would label him good, but not great, pending a rematch if he
wants it.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, it's a chance to prove that he's real and not just a
myth of boxing politics and public relations smoke. If he goes
down, don't hold your breath on a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden, attempting to recapture its romantic past
as a mecca for boxing, has been sold out for weeks and prime seats,
originally sold at $1,500, are being scalped for $10,000 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   This, for a fight Holyfield says won't go more than three.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it's a furious three, as many fight experts are
predicting it could be, no one will complain.
</P>
<P>
   There is a glint in Holyfield's eyes that does not bode well for
Lewis, despite a massive difference in size. The 6-foot-5 Lewis
weighed in at a strong-looking 246 Thursday to Holyfield's chiseled
215 rock-hard pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let that fool you. Boxing's historical canvas is littered
with the bodies of hulks who brought size, a big punch and a
veritable cornucopia of glass jaws. Can you say Gerry Cooney?
Buster Douglas? Jess Willard?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also carries the burden of a long line of Brits who have
come to the Colonies to box the ears of the upstart Colonials, only
to leave humbled and bloodied. Henry Cooper, Frank Bruno, Brian
London ... why should we believe that Lewis, who likens his style
to ``a chess game in the ring'' is any different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he's not coming in here with his chess board,''
said Lewis trainer Emanuel Steward, who admits even he's not sure
``which Lennox will show up.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis tries to ``castle'' Holyfield tonight, I predict a
checkmate, on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis is an enigma,'' Lewis said, as if he was talking
about his next door neighbor. ``They don't know much about Lennox
Lewis yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And why would we? At 33, he is the WBC heavyweight champ more by
accident than design. He plucked the title out of the dumpster,
where it was tossed by Riddick Bowe, who wanted nothing to do with
Lewis, and won it again when Oliver McCall had a crying fit.
</P>
<P>
   The same man who clubbed Andrew Golota into submission in the
first round, but panicked, turned his back and cowered in the first
against Shannon Briggs. He carries the reputation of being too soft
where Holyfield is strongest _ in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the best fighter Lewis has beaten, Steward could
not come up with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to get what he wants _ respect _ Lewis must destroy
Holyfield. Better men have tried and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, once thought to be no more than a blownup cruiser
weight, has earned his respect the hard way. He has battered eight
former champions, including Larry Holmes, Bowe and George Foreman,
and twice took on the devil himself _ Mike Tyson _ and won for all
that is right and good in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe he's not exactly Sir Galahad, after all. More of a
philandering Lancelot, to hear Lewis tell it. Lewis has called
Holyfield a ``hypocrite'' because the WBA and IBF champ talks often
of his Christian beliefs despite having fathered five illegitimate
children, including a pair born last year to women not named Mrs.
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has been made about what I said, calling him a
hypocrite, but it's time to think about the fight,'' Lewis told
reporters this week. ``He knows what I feel and he's expressed what
he feels. Now I'm going to get the opportunity to go out and try to
prove all the people wrong.''
</P>

BLANKS'S WORKOUT IS HOT, HIS STORY UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Blanks is hot.
</P>
<P>
   His Tae-Bo workout video has grossed $75 million since last
August. Time magazine devoted a full page to him this week,
trumpeting his story as that of a man who has risen from poverty in
Erie, Pa., to the fast lane in Hollywood as the personal trainer to
the stars. No less than Oprah Winfrey, Paula Abdul, and Wayne
Gretzky have become part of the spin.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Blanks, from zero to hero, a wonderful story. A self-made
man, living the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   But when Patricia Pierce of Hingham, Mass. hears the name of
Billy Blanks, she starts to sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is promoting a lie,'' says Pierce, a freelance writer and
art consultant who ``discovered'' Blanks more than 15 years ago and
became his trainer and manager. Pierce maintains that Blanks left
the Boston area more than 10 years ago, owing her an explanation
and several others money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought Billy here in 1981,'' says Pierce. ``I saw him in a
(karate) tournament in Minneapolis, thought he was a great talent,
and became his manager. For four years I paid for his dojo (workout
studio), apartment, car, health insurance, fixed his teeth, paid
his debts and all his expenses to train and go to major
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never took a dime from him and I paid all of his bills. It
was an American Dream for him; it became a nightmare for everyone
else. And his claim that he is self-made is a lie, as are many
other things in his public relations campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanks claims he is a seven-time world karate champion. ``He won
it twice,'' says Pierce, ``and never until I became his trainer. He
says on his web site infomercial that he won the Golden Gloves
light heavyweight championship (in Massachusetts) in 1984 and was
the Tri-State champion of champions. That's a lie. He tried boxing
and in his only fight, he got knocked out. He had a glass jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Romalo, who has run the Golden Gloves in Eastern
Massachusetts since 1969, said he has never heard of Blanks. ``I've
been here for 30 years. I looked back through all of our records
listing every champion. Blanks is not there. As far as we are
concerned, he never won the title and certainly was not a champion
of champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Vose, owner of the Vose Art Gallery on Newbury Street in
Boston, also has unkind things to say about Blanks. ``He owes me
money,'' says Vose, who trained with Blanks when he had a studio in
Quincy, just over the line from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loaned him $60,000, and I had to sue him to get the money
back. I had to settle for $30,000, so as far as I am concerned, he
owes me $30,000 plus interest for the last 10 years. Now that he is
making all of that money, it would be nice if he paid me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce says she is not looking for money, but she feels the
public is owed the truth. ``This is why I am speaking out,'' she
says. ``I just want him to tell the truth. He says he's 43; he's
45. He says he's been working on this technique (Tae-Bo, a fitness
program combining aerobics and karate movements) for 35 years. That
would have made him 8 years old at the time. This all started as
Kaerobics, which I was working on in 1983 and 1984. It was a
combination of karate and aerobics. He (Blanks) says Tae-Bo is
truth; then he should start stop telling lies. He stole the
Kaerobics concept from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to do all of this b.s. Why doesn't he simply
tell the truth? He never won the Golden Gloves. He was not the
seven-time world karate champion. He did have a lot of help from me
and other people back here who befriended him. He is not a
self-made man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disheartened to know that Billy feels it is necessary to
deceive the public. The Time story implies he is a holy man or
preacher. Holy men do not mislead people to attain money, power,
and fame. It is time for him to tell the truth. Anything less is
dishonorable and discredits the black belt he wears.''

   If the lawsuit involving Patriots Drew Bledsoe and Max Lane and
their stage-diving incident goes the distance, coach Pete Carroll
might have to change his plans for practice this spring. Bledsoe
and Lane have been sued by Tameeka Messier, who was injured two
years ago at the Paradise nightclub in Boston. Messier claims she
was injured when Lane and Bledsoe landed on her while stage-diving
at a concert. The trial is scheduled to start in three weeks. The
judge has asked both sides to try to reach a settlement. But it
looks as though the case will go to a jury trial. Nearly 60
depositions have been taken to date, and if all those people are
called as witnesses, the trial could last more than a month.
Messier claims that first Lane, then Bledsoe landed on her. The
players deny it. Bledsoe claims he dived 5 or 6 feet to the right
of Lane. Lane has no insurance. The depositions make it clear that
Messier's attorneys also are going after Bledsoe, who would be
worth more than Lane.

   There could be more bad news for Red Sox team physician Arthur
Pappas. Former Sox pitcher Butch Henry lashed out at Pappas this
week, saying he misdiagnosed Henry's knee injury last season. Now
comes word from two people close to Tim Naehring that the former
Sox infielder is considering a lawsuit against Pappas and the team.
Naehring injured his throwing elbow two years ago and never was
able to play again. Naehring now has a front office job with the
Cincinnati Reds. Word has it that although Naehring likes Pappas,
he was told by other doctors that the surgery performed by Pappas
was flawed and that Naehring could have continued to play if the
operation had been done better.

   The Sox coaching staff was more than impressed with Ramon
Martinez's first workout. According to a team source, Martinez
threw the ball 86 to 87 miles per hour, which is outstanding this
soon after rotator cuff surgery. If he continues to throw with no
setbacks, the Sox expect him to be able to reach 93 miles per hour
_ and be ready for game action _ in three months . . . One of the
most prolific scorers in college hockey history will be in action
Saturday when Harvard hosts Cornell (2 p.m.) in the women's ECAC
quarterfinals. A.J. Mlezcko became the first woman to collect 100
points in a season, finishing with 102, including 31 goals. Tony
Hrkas, who played for North Dakota, has the men's record with 116
points. But it took Hrkas 46 games, including playoffs, to reach
that number. Mlezcko has her total in just 29 games . . . The Red
Sox expect to have 1.75 million tickets sold before Opening Day,
which would be a record.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a year after a Marine Corps jet hit an
alpine gondola cableway that was not on the crew's map, the
Pentagon has not updated its maps. While the Defense Department
says it can operate safely with the old maps, a lawyer for victims'
families said that changes in the maps would complicate the
government's legal defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The omission of the Mt. Cermis cableway on the map was a major
point for defense lawyers in the court martial of the pilot, Capt.
Richard J. Ashby, who won an acquittal a week ago, arguing that the
lack of a warning meant the case was an accident waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Any move by the Pentagon to update the maps by including the
cableway and dozens of other obstructions would help the families
of the 20 victims in bringing claims against the Defense
Department, according to an American lawyer for the families of
five Belgian victims.
</P>
<P>
   Two legal experts on international legal claims, while saying
they could not predict whether such a case will be successful,
agreed that changing the map now could help convince a judge or
jury that the original map contributed to the accident, but they
pointed out that failing to change it to bolster a legal position,
could also anger a judge or jury.
</P>
<P>
   Suits against the U.S. government can be brought only for
actions in this country, and any change in the map could be taken
as an admission that the originals, drafted here, were flawed, said
the lawyer for the families, C. Torrence Armstrong of McLean, Va.
Armstrong made a claim to the Department of Defense seeking damages
for the deaths of the Belgian victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate that there was a desire not to correct
anything for fear it might look bad,'' said Armstrong in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Pentagon, Col. Richard M. Bridges, said
the map ``fully complied and complies with military service
requirements for this product.'' It is meant to be used with a
second publication that now specifies planes must maintain a
2,000-foot minimum altitude above ground level, far higher than
man-made obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction was in place before the accident, but the Marine
crew, rotating through Italy on temporary Bosnia duty, was not
aware of it. In addition, Italian air traffic controllers now brief
pilots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges and other defense officials stressed that a tower must
rise 200 feet to be included on the map, and the towers at
Cavalese, where the deaths occurred, were far lower. The cables
were higher, however, because the ground drops away beneath them as
it crosses a valley.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham D. Sofaer, a former federal prosecutor, U.S. district
judge and legal adviser to the State Department, and an Air Force
veteran, said a court might find the map to be ``a source of
negligence.'' By not changing it, he said, ``what they're trying to
do is avoid providing evidence of having made a mistake to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges said that Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, appointed this week to
conduct a review of changes made since the accident, could make a
recommendation about the map.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the chief Pentagon spokesman, referred obliquely
to Armstrong's claim on March 4, the day of the acquittal, when he
was asked at a briefing whether the maps had been fixed. ``There is
a separate, as I understand it, a separate litigation involving the
mapping agency, the National Imaging and Mapping Agency,'' he said,
adding that he was not aware any change had been made to the map
and could not discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's claim was rejected by the Pentagon on March 2, two
days before Ashby's acquittal. Defense Department lawyers told him
to file in Italian courts, and that any award would be paid under
the Status of Forces Agreement, which was ratified in 1951 to
govern NATO forces. Armstrong, who along with lawyers for other
families has complained that the process would take eight years,
has six months to appeal the denial to a U.S. District Court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say they want to avoid a precedent that would
destroy the status of forces agreement, which is used for scores of
less spectacular damage claims every year. Asked if the desire to
preserve the agreement figured in the decision not to change the
map, Bridges replied only that the agreement ``is the exclusive
remedy for claims taking place in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Beck, the civilian lawyer for the navigator on the
flight, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, whose court-martial is scheduled
for next week at Camp Lejeune, said the omission on the map was
central to the accident. ``Had they known it was there, they
wouldn't have even flown down the valley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Italian Ministry of Defense, in Rome, officials said they
had sent another 10 copies of their maps to their American
counterparts after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   One official, who asked not to be identified by name, said that
Italian law called for foreign pilots to be using Italian maps. But
Defense Department policy is to use American maps, and the crews
permanently based in Aviano continue to fly across Italy using the
American maps that lack markings for the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how a correction to the map now would play in a federal
trial is not clear, but a law professor said that such a change
could be used to prove that an action taken in the United States
contributed to the accident. Andreas F. Lowenfeld, a professor of
law at New York University who specializes in international law and
in aviation, said that a measure taken after an event that could
have made the event less likely cannot be admitted as evidence to
prove negligence.
</P>
<P>
   But the existence of such measures, like a correction to a map,
can be introduced as evidence when offered to prove ``ownership,
control or feasibility of precautionary measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear whether this would affect the litigation,'' he
said. ``Even if it does, you don't invite future accidents by
trying to cover your rear end on a prior one; that's a terrible
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's plane, an EA-6B Prowler on a training mission, hit two
cables at a point where they were about 360 feet off the ground.
The cable line has since been rebuilt, with $20 million
appropriated by Congress, and follows the terrain much more
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Maj. Daniel J. Daugherty, cross-examining
Ashby, asked why the crew had not noticed a church at which they
were were supposed to execute a turn, and asked why he thought the
map-makers showed the church, if not for navigation purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they mark them, sir,'' Ashby responded. ``I'd
rather have them mark the cableway than the church.''
</P>
<P>
   A Marine colonel who held eight days of hearings last year on
whether there was enough evidence for a court-martial reported in
June that on the map used in the flight ``aerial obstructions
appear rare on Italian soil yet, in Austria, just north of the
Italian border, obstructions are marked with great frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   The colonel, Ronald L. Rodgers, concluded that the map makers in
a Pentagon agency outside Washington had gone to a less detailed
Italian map to copy down instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force had a copy of the more detailed Italian map in an
office at the Aviano base, but did not use it, Rodgers reported.
</P>
<P>
   At the Italian embassy in Washington Friday, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe
Bernardis, a military attache , said that the map alone had not
caused the accident; that, he said, would have been prevented if
the crew had been aware of the Italian restriction of 2,000 feet,
or even if they had stuck to what they believed their restriction
was, 1,000 feet. But asked if putting the Mt. Cermis cableway and
other low-level obstacles on the maps would aid safety, he said
``it helps.''

 &HT;    Texas border cities lobby for relief from truck traffic
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ In this booming border city, free trade has a
sound. It's the hiss of air brakes and the deep rumble of diesel
engines and the clank of trailers hitched to tractors, readying
another load to take across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the sounds of money. Trucking has become Laredo's
bread and butter, its largest industry, its biggest employer and
the main reason Laredo is the busiest port on the U.S.-Mexico
border. The trucks are also its biggest headache, tearing up roads,
lining up for miles on Interstate 35, and clogging the narrow
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Mayor Betty Flores calls her city, where up to 6,000
trucks each day cross the bridge from Mexico, a ``chokepoint
instead of a checkpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Laredo and other cities along the Texas-Mexico border are
lobbying the Legislature for relief as their roads become
gridlocked. Their own booming populations are going
bumper-to-bumper with commercial traffic that has surged since the
North American Free Trade Agreement took effect five years ago.
Their argument is simple: We're bearing the brunt of the trade
boom, so we need extra money to keep the traffic and the goods
flowing.
</P>
<P>
   But to get what they want, border counties will have to persuade
lawmakers to either divert transportation money from other parts of
Texas or dip into a budget surplus that state leaders have all but
promised to use for education and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Their challenge is to convince cities like Austin, Dallas, and
Houston _ which have their own traffic to deal with _ that it's in
their interest to help the border. Border leaders, who have united
and hired lobbyists to work for the entire region, hope to convince
lawmakers from other parts of the state that spending money on the
border will benefit them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your border,'' Flores said. ``It's in my city, but
it's your border and you have to help me take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It promises to be a tough sell in a state that ranks 45th in per
capita highway spending. The Texas Department of Transportation
estimates it has about 40 percent of the money it needs for road
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The border's request for nearly a billion dollars in new highway
money has drawn skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If money is diverted down to the border, there are other areas
of Texas that are going to suffer, I would think,'' said Al
Luedecke, director of planning and programming for the
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, others say the problem is more complicated than
simply building more roads. The quality of Mexican highways, the
hours that trade-related businesses keep, and the increased
vigilance of federal agents hunting for drugs and illegal
immigrants all contribute to the border bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, the trucks leave their mark everywhere. In the smell
of exhaust that hangs over downtown. In the grooves their tires
wear into the blacktop. In the stretch of concrete on I-35 at the
international bridge where lanes had to be closed last summer when
idling trucks literally sank into the sun-softened asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're constantly trying to keep (the roads) in shape. It's a
never-ending battle,'' said Jorge Pineda, assistant general manager
of Celadon Trucking Services, a company that logs more than 100
border crossings every day.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo is home to 400 trucking companies and 55 million square
feet of warehouse space _ enough to cover all of downtown Austin.
The city is constantly repairing streets, and the police department
deploys officers to warn motorists away from the line of trucks
that stretches for miles on I-35 as truckers wait to clear Mexican
customs in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who has been mayor for a year, said the congestion is
killing downtown business. People are dying too. Every so often, a
motorist comes over a rise and smashes into the back end of a truck
stopped on I-35.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same on the Mexican side, with trucks stacking up by 10
a.m. waiting to clear U.S. inspections before rumbling down one of
Laredo's designated truck routes, mostly two-lane blacktops where
traffic stacks up at stoplights and railroad crossings. A third
bridge opened upriver to relieve the problem handles mostly
commercial traffic, but many truckers don't like the longer drive
to the bridge or the alarmingly narrow road on the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, said City Manager Florencio Pena III, ``caught us
off guard completely. We just didn't expect this much traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Other border cities have similar complaints. In the Rio Grande
Valley, big trucks rumble down farm-to-market roads from some
bridges to reach U.S. 83, the area's clogged main artery. Upriver
in Roma, a town in Starr County, a spacious new port facility is
underused because trucks have to cut through an alley to reach the
main highway, Reba said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could handle a lot more traffic, but the road is not
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Pass is building a new international bridge and wants the
narrow highway to San Antonio widened. El Paso, the second-busiest
port on the Texas border, wants a loop around the city. ``When 20
percent of NAFTA traffic comes through your community, believe me,
that creates a problem,'' said Sen. Eliot Shapleigh.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the congestion is the requirement that loads
going over the river use a drayage company, or short-hauler. Such
companies are necessary because the United States and Mexico don't
allow trucks from the other country to drive beyond the border
zone. That means three trucks are needed to get one load delivered
_ one on each side of the border, and one to cross the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A provision of NAFTA that would allow truckers from both
countries to drive freely within the United States and Mexico was
scrapped indefinitely in 1995 over concerns about the safety of
Mexican trucks.
</P>
<P>
   There's been talk of keeping customs open 24 hours to ease
congestion. But Maria Reba, director of South Texas operations for
U.S. Customs, said the results were disappointing a few years back
when they tried opening at 7 a.m. instead of 8. The customs
brokers, warehouses, importers, and freight forwarders who help
move each truck, she said, were unwilling to change their hours to
match customs.
</P>
<P>
   Border leaders like Alan Johnson, a member of the Texas Turnpike
Commission from Harlingen, say the border has not historically
received its fair share of highway dollars. ``That's basically
because we've never had any political clout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luedecke, the state Transportation Department official, said new
construction projects are given priority based on a complicated
formula including the cost, existing traffic, and other factors.
Border areas in years past didn't have the traffic volume to put
their projects ahead of more populous areas, but that has changed
since NAFTA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His agency says it is doing everything it can to address the
border's problems. The department had $440 million worth of
projects completed or under construction on the border at the end
of August, up from $300 million at the same time in 1994. The
department's total construction budget is $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has pitched in as well, setting aside $140 million a
year for five years to pay for highway improvements in border zones
and ``NAFTA corridors'' around the country. The state
Transportation Department has submitted 32 projects _ about half of
them on the border _ to compete for the money. Many border road
projects are in the pipeline, transportation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, for example, a fourth international bridge, scheduled
to open upriver from Laredo early next year, will have direct
access to Interstate 35, and all commercial traffic will be
diverted from downtown to the two outlying bridges, Luedecke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will change the whole character of Laredo, I think,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Infrastructure Coalition's wish list includes almost
$1 billion more for road and highway projects. Earlier this month,
the Senate Committee on Border Affairs, pared that number to $623
million, with the bulk for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's proposal would also earmark $9 million to create
one-stop border inspection stations that would house the various
state and federal agencies that are responsible for checking
everything from truck brakes to insurance documents to pesticide
residue on Mexican vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Rene Oliveira (D-Brownsville) has proposed a
third option: up to $1 billion in highway bonds for the border. The
bonds would require statewide voter approval. Texas Comptroller
Carole Keeton Rylander has proposed issuing $700 million in bonds
to help speed construction on the border and other parts of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Pete
Gallego (D-Alpine), said he and other border lawmakers have
convinced many of their colleagues there is a problem at the
border, ``but now we have to convince people to give up a little of
their share of the money to help someone else. That's a little
harder.''

KNIGHT WROTE THE BOOK THAT IS JARVIS' MANUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind.)  (mk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The first basketball book St. John's coach Mike
Jarvis bought was Bobby Knight's ``Let's Play Defense.'' At $1.50,
Jarvis says, it was the best basketball investment he has made,
still informing his strategy more than 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The first basketball clinic Jarvis paid to attend was one
conducted by Knight in 1967. Over the years, Knight, the bombastic
heartland hero, has been kind to Jarvis, the urbane philosopher,
calling him once to congratulate him on a victory and praising him
Friday for the job he has done at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   But the two coaches have not faced each other in a game. Their
teams will finally square off Saturday, when Jarvis' third-seeded
Red Storm plays Knight's sixth-seeded Indiana Hoosiers here in the
second round of the NCAA tournament's south regional.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis and the Red Storm will face an Indiana team coming off
its best performance of the season, a 108-88 first-round drubbing
of George Washington that was a clinic in using a big lineup to
dominate the inside game and pound a smaller, quicker team into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   Starting three big men _ and Luke Recker, a 6-foot-6-inch
forward, at guard _on Thursday night, Indiana shot 65.5 percent
from the field and attempted only three 3-pointers. Not that St.
John's seemed terribly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they'll play big against us so we can run on them,''
the Red Storm's Ron Artest said. ``I don't think their
ball-handling was that great either.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana did have 20 turnovers, but Artest's insouciance was
indicative of the Red Storm players' broader lack of awe for a
program as storied as their own. St. John's is in fifth place on
the NCAA career victory list; the Hoosiers are 10th. But St. John's
players are too young to remember Isiah Thomas wearing red, and not
one of them has seen the movie ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Knight and his players spoke of the toughness and love of
the game that New York's playgrounds foster in St. John's players,
the Red Storm's perception of Indiana centers on an image of
country boys, old-fashioned play and ``Bobby Knight and a lot of
hollering,'' according to Bootsy Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis' impression of the Hoosiers is a little more analytical.
He watched Indiana's beating of his former team, the Colonials, and
then viewed six or seven tapes of earlier Indiana losses. What he
saw against George Washington was a nearly flawless game:
fundamentally sound, with such pinpoint passes that there was
little need to do anything but go inside for layups.
</P>
<P>
   The 108 points were the most by an Indiana team in tournament
history. The redshirt freshman forward Kirk Haston, who cracked a
bone in his left hand against Iowa on Feb. 27, scored 27 points on
9-of-11 shooting from the field and 9-of-10 shooting from the line.
Recker scored 20 on 7-of-11 shooting from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Knight did manage to find something wrong with the game: George
Washington scored 57 second-half points. ``We cannot play that kind
of defense and expect to win against St. John's,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   If Indiana can approach that level of play again Saturday, a big
question in an erratic 23-8 season, St. John's (26-8) would face
multiple problems. Tyrone Grant said Friday that he still had pain
in his infected right hand and that he had less control of his shot
than usual, meaning that St. John's only true inside presence is
hampered.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's also prefers an uptempo pace to the slower halfcourt
game it is likely to get from Indiana, and if the officials call a
lot of fouls in what is expected to be a physical game, St. John's
has less quality depth than Indiana. The players' response to
questions about those potential roadblocks was essentially a big
shrug. They said that almost all of their opponents had greater
size and better depth, and St. John's had somehow won 26 games and
reached the top 10. Jarvis, though, was more cautious and more
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they played, I haven't seen too many teams play better
this year,'' Jarvis said. ``The things they do best have nothing to
do with size. They have to do with fundamentals. You're playing
against a system. They screen as well as anybody playing the game.
They do the little things that most coaches strive a lifetime to
get their kids to do. Like box out, pass, cut, screen.''

 `Underserved' Insurance Data Released  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Residents of low-income, minority neighborhoods were less than half
as likely as other Californians to have homeowner and auto
insurance in 1995, a new statewide report shows.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was released yesterday, follows three years of
skirmishes between civil rights advocates and the state Department
of Insurance, which fought efforts to make the data public.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocates, a San Francisco civil rights group, sued the
Department of Insurance in 1996 after learning the agency had told
the insurance industry it didn't need to submit ``redlining'' data
as required by the law.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the suit, Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
took three years to collect the data in part because some insurance
companies were reluctant to surrender the information and had to be
threatened with legal action to get them to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The study focuses on ``underserved communities'' comprising 151
ZIP codes, including two in San Francisco (94102 and 94124), six in
Oakland (94601, 94603, 94606, 94607, 94609 and 94621) and three in
San Jose (95110, 95116 and 95122). Only statewide data was
furnished in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report was confined to 1995. The insurance commissioner is
expected to release reports for the next three years by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underserved'' is defined in the report as communities that are
at least two-thirds minority, have low household incomes and
above-average percentages of uninsured motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's &UR;  &LR; findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Six percent of auto liability policies are written in the
target ZIP codes even though 13 percent of vehicles are there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six percent of homeowners policies are written in underserved
communities, even though 16 percent of the state's population lives
there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homeowners in target communities were three times as likely to
have fire-only policies than full homeowners policies that include
protections against theft and injury lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four percent of insurance agents are located in these
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approximately 5 percent of mail solicitations went to
underserved communities.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates and legislators said the long-awaited
numbers confirmed their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are appalling,'' said state Senator Jackie Speier,
D-Fremont and chairwoman of the Senate Insurance Committee. ``There
has been a concerted effort to hold back these numbers for years
and no wonder. They show systematic redlining in this state that
has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the major insurers scoring below average, when it came to
auto policies, were State Farm, Safeco and National General.
Although 13 percent of registered vehicles are owned by people
living in the target communities, each company wrote just 4 percent
of its policies there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive market,'' said State Farm spokesman
Bill Sirola. ``We still wrote more policies than anyone else and
we're aggressively marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a very tough business. We'd like to grow more in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Insurance said they'll be looking
into the numbers to learn why they look so bad in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our next step will be to sit down with insurance companies and
ask them some tough questions,'' said Deputy Insurance Commissioner
Rex Frazier. ``What we have in this report is a red flag about
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers criticized the report, saying it was dated.
``The study isn't realistic or relevant to today's marketplace,''
said Stephanie Saari of the Western Insurance Information Service,
a trade group. ``It compares apples and oranges _ the 1995
marketplace and the 1999 marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's marketplace is extremely competitive,'' she added.
``It's cutthroat. Companies are competing for high-risk drivers
today.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates, though, said the situation today is
probably much the same as it was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Speier should call for an immediate hearing, and the
Legislature should refuse to appropriate funds to the Department of
Insurance unless they stamp out redlining as they're required to do
under the law,'' said Bob Gnaizda, director of the Greenlining
Institute in San Francisco, an anti-redlining organization.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on both sides said the study raises a lot of questions.
For example, it's unclear whether the apparent redlining suggested
in the report is due to the unavailability of insurance or the fact
that low-income residents can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Some legislators have long held the belief that policies are
priced high to discourage business in those areas. In a hearing on
February 25, Speier introduced evidence showing a middle-aged male
driver with a perfect driving record _ one of her staffers _ was
quoted a price of $532 for Fireman's Fund auto insurance if he
lived in San Mateo but a premium of $1,826 if he moved to
low-income South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can redline by making policies so expensive no one can
afford them,'' said Speier.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's release is bound to stimulate debate over how
California insurance companies conduct their business. ``The
important thing was to get something out there,'' said Mark Savage,
the attorney for Public Advocates, which brought the suit resulting
in the release of data.

   What Was That Take On the RJR Cycle? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another turn in the history of RJR Nabisco changes participants
into revisionists, rehearsing what might have been. J. Tylee
Wilson, the former R.J. Reynolds chief executive who merged the
tobacco company with Nabisco in 1985, still thinks that building a
broad-based consumer products company makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson, now 68 and retired, is not about to second-guess the
intention of RJR Nabisco Holdings, it announced last week, to split
up the businesses and sell foreign tobacco operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't the faintest idea how it would work out for
shareholders, but they had to do something and this looks like a
reasonable solution,'' he said, citing the company's debts.
</P>
<P>
   He found some satisfaction from Japan Tobacco's willingness to
pay $8 billion for the international tobacco operations, saying,
``I set that business up in 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   RJR itself has come full circle, back to the way it was in the
1960s, Wilson said. But if tobacco companies have always been
besieged by competitors and regulators, today's climate is the
worst ever, he said, concluding, ``I certainly would never go into
the business today.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Atkins, a lawyer who advised the RJR Nabisco board on
buyout offers, said that RJR might have split up sooner if Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts had not bought it. In the 1990s, other companies
have sold off operations to focus on core businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demerger of RJR Nabisco is a late arrival in a fairly
well-established trend,'' he said. ``It might well have occurred
earlier but for the constraint of dealing with its liabilities,
including tobacco litigation and debt.'' &QL;

   A Journalist's Juicy Reward &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's the rare journalist who figures so large in a company's
business that his compensation becomes public as part of routine
financial disclosures. Add to the short list James J. Cramer _
hedge fund manager, columnist and part owner of TheStreet.Com, the
popular online financial news service.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prospectus issued last month, when the company
announced plans for going public, Cramer will get a salary of
$250,000 this year, with 10 percent annual increases through the
end of the agreement in 2002. But if the stock does well, his
salary will be the least of his rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer is TheStreet.Com's biggest stockholder; as of last month,
he owned about 2.7 million shares. (A $15 million investment in
February made The New York Times Co. the service's third-biggest
owner.) His new employment agreement gives Cramer an option to buy
an additional 333,333 shares at $3 a share. Given the roughly $11 a
share that the Times Co. paid for its position, that option would
be worth about $2.67 million. He can buy 25 percent of those shares
each year, starting in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What does TheStreet.Com get for its money? Cramer writes a
half-dozen or more columns for the service daily. Despite the poor
performance last year of his hedge fund, Cramer-Berkowitz &AMP; Co.,
Cramer's regular appearances on CNBC and his columns for other
publications help make him a one-man marketing department.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Cramer's journalist colleagues have nonetheless been
complaining about the founder's compensation _ but grousing is
common to newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   With TheStreet.com in a quiet period before its public offering,
Cramer said his lawyers had told him not to comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Teitelbaum &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warburg's Big Wager &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A collective gasp was heard on Wall Street last week. Who,
traders and bankers asked, could really be worth $70 million? To
Warburg Dillon Read, the investment banking business of UBS AG of
Switzerland, which was struggling to bolster its presence in the
United States, the answer was Benjamin Lorello, a Salomon Smith
Barney health care banker.
</P>
<P>
   Lorello left for Warburg after being offered more than $50
million in salary and bonuses over three years and about $25
million in deferred stock benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That huge price tag may say less about Lorello than the desire
of his new employer to crack the global health care industry. The
Europeans have largely failed in recent attempts to expand in
America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Deutsche Bank retreated from Wall Street, only a few
years after paying hefty hiring incentives. ``If it's $50 million
in salary, regardless of performance, it's a high-risk strategy,''
said Steven Eisman, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts question Warburg's timing, noting that
the health care business in general could use a resuscitator:
nursing homes and hospitals are comatose.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lorello nor his new employer would comment.

 FEDERAL INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON FORMER BANKERS TRUST EXECUTIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities investigating corruption at
Bankers Trust Corp. are focusing on the activities of B.J. Kingdon,
who formerly ran one of the bank's largest businesses and sat on
its 12-member operating committee, according to lawyers and Bankers
Trust employees involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon is a resident of Oceanport, N.J., and ran Bankers
Trust's custody, corporate trust and pension services businesses
before resigning in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Arkin, an attorney representing Kingdon, said his client
had not been charged with any wrongdoing and intended to contest
any criminal charges if they were filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon reported directly to the president of Bankers Trust,
Eugene B. Shanks, during years in which Bankers Trust illegally
padded its results with funds left unclaimed by customers. Shanks
did not return phone calls seeking comment, nor did Charles
Sanford, who was the bank's chief executive during Kingdon's
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan also has questioned
Timothy Yates, Bankers Trust's former chief financial officer, as
part of its investigation, although an attorney representing Yates
said he was not a target of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although no Bankers Trust employees were named in the court
papers filed against the bank on Thursday, other former Bankers
Trust employees who are being questioned as part of the federal
investigation include Paula C. Gabriele, former head of the bank's
retirement services business; Kenneth Goglia, a former managing
director for financial controls who worked for Kingdon, and Let W.
Lee, a former managing director in the bank's global securities
business.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gabriele's attorney said that she was not a target of the
investigation. Lee's attorney declined to comment. Goglia's
attorney did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest bank in the country, pleaded
guilty Thursday to federal criminal charges that senior officers
and employees had illegally diverted $19.1 million in unclaimed
checks and other credits owed to customers to the bank's own books
to improve its financial performance between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust agreed to pay a $60 million fine to the federal
government and a separate fine of $3.5 million to New York state
authorities for the illegal scheme. Unclaimed bank funds fall under
so-called ``escheat laws'' that vary from state to state but
typically require that such funds be turned over to the state.
Instead, Bankers Trust used the funds to pad its performance during
a period when the bank was mired in a scandal stemming from
questionable sales tactics involving complex financial products
known as derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp. recently agreed to pay $187.5 million to
settle charges that it mishandled hundreds of millions of dollars
of bond payments between 1978 and 1995. The bank was accused by
state and local authorities in California of pocketing unclaimed
bondholder payments that should have been returned to be used for
school construction and other public works.
</P>
<P>
   While federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the
comptroller of the currency, said the theft of unclaimed funds was
highly unusual and was generally not something consumers and other
bank clients needed to worry about, the fact that Bankers Trust has
pleaded guilty to such acts is no small matter. Bankers Trust is
completing the terms of its acquisition by Germany's Deutsche Bank
AG, but if the bank were still independent its viability would now
be in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be extraordinarily serious stuff if they were still
independent,'' said Lawrence Cohn, an analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
``Financial institutions face extraordinary risks when they plead
guilty to a felony. Lots of customers won't do business with
convicted felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Deutsche Bank said the guilty plea would not stymie the
merger, it is yet another embarrassment for Bankers Trust, which
was sold after a string of heavy trading losses last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Bankers Trust was considered one of Wall
Street's most aggressive, innovative and loosely controlled trading
houses before it was undone by hard-driving mandates imposed by its
former chief executive, Sanford, and by a certain willingness to
break the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York, said on Thursday that the illegal diversion of unclaimed
funds began after Bankers Trust's senior management ``placed severe
pressure'' on managers to generate revenue and meet expense
targets. Bankers Trust, hammered by allegations of improper sales
tactics in its derivatives unit, saw its earnings plunge to $215
million in 1995 from $615 million the year earlier and, according
to court documents, began applying pressure ``on all areas of its
business'' to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   An independent counsel appointed to investigate the bank's
derivatives activities issued a report in 1996 that criticized
senior management for lax controls over that business between 1991
and 1994. Among those criticized in the report were Sanford, Shanks
and Yates. These executives had all resigned or retired from the
bank by 1997, when Frank N. Newman, a former senior U.S. Treasury
official, became the new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon joined Bankers Trust in 1982, became a managing director
in 1986 and then went on to run a major division of the company now
known as global institutional services. Kingdon resigned in early
1997 after an investigation of his division had been started by
Bankers Trust. A bank spokesman said 13 other employees resigned
from the bank when the division's misappropriation of unclaimed
funds was discovered. The bank notified regulators and the U.S.
attorney's office of the problem in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed as part of the U.S. attorney's case
against Bankers Trust, a group of employees working in Kingdon's
division, under the direction of an unnamed senior manager and
controller, in 1994 began falsifying records and diverting millions
of dollars of unclaimed funds into a ``slush fund.'' The slush fund
was then tapped at the end of financial reporting period's to
increase Bankers Trust's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia was a senior controller working for Kingdon at the time,
according to a 1995 directory of Bankers Trust employees, although
it could not be determined if he is the individual referred to in
court papers. Likewise, Lee ran a securities unit named in court
papers, although it could not be determined if he is an unnamed
individual cited in court papers. The U.S. attorney's office
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another one of those cases where the government
stretches the facts to make them fit into a criminal case,'' Arkin
said Friday. ``If you wanted to talk about whether funds should be
escheated or not, that's one thing. But whether these people had
criminal intent is another.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview on Thursday evening, Kingdon had said he
had no knowledge of the federal investigation and no indication
that he was under investigation before declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Arkin contradicted his client's statements, saying that he
was retained by Kingdon two years ago and that Kingdon was aware of
the investigation at that time.
</P>
<P>
   So why the discrepancy?
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure of events,'' offered Arkin.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHAT'S WITH HOLYFIELD'S PREDICTION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the bell rings, Evander Holyfield, shorter by 3
inches and outweighed by 31 pounds, is expected to try to move
inside in order to smother Lennox Lewis' longer reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get inside,'' Lewis has been saying, ``and he's
got to be allowed to do something there. I don't think he's going
to get inside, or be allowed to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk about Holyfield's fighting inside, the more
compelling issue is _ what's inside his head? What's behind his
blurting out that he would emerge as the undisputed world
heavyweight champion Saturday night at Madison Square Garden by
knocking out Lewis in the third round?
</P>
<P>
   Such a brassy prediction has never been Holyfield's style.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not predicting; this is what's going to be true,'' he
said. ``I knew I was going to knock him out in the third round.
What would the people like _ a surprise or foretell it? This time
I'm not going to surprise, I'm going to let you know ahead of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering the almost gentle humility displayed by the WBA
and IBF champion in the past, it's not as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that Holyfield is now so completely confident
of his ability, he can boldly call the round. He even acknowledged
that confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more confident than I've ever been,'' he said of his
unprecedented prediction. ``I've been in this game 28 years. I know
what I'm capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Holyfield overconfident? Although he is still fighting
for his rightful ranking in heavyweight history, he is talking
about how ``I'm one of them already, whether anybody knows it or
not.'' As if he deserves to be put up there on the same pedestal
with, say, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, Jack Dempsey
and Jack Johnson. But a loss to Lewis would put that pedestal out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for Holyfield's prediction is that, after a
sluggish but successful 12 rounds against Vaughn Bean in his
previous title defense, he was trying to bolster his own confidence
while also branding the third round into the WBC champion's brain.
And he already has Lewis not only thinking about the third round,
but also denying that he'll be knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will definitely still be there in the third round,'' the
Englishman said.
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield is either overconfident or needs more confidence,
he would appear to be vulnerable, especially against Lewis, who is
so much taller, heavier and, possibly, stronger. Holyfield has a
history of not being able to stop larger opponents, such as Riddick
Bowe (to whom he lost twice) and George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the 36-year-old Holyfield can fulfill his prediction or
the 33-year-old Lewis can land a big punch, this scheduled 12-round
unification bout should develop into the survival of the toughest.
And over his 36-3 record with 29 knockouts, Holyfield has been one
of the toughest. Mike Tyson would testify to that.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' toughness is subject for debate. Despite his 34-1 record
with 27 knockouts, he has never had the look of a gladiator. But
his trainer, Emanuel Steward, remembered Lewis hanging tough in
earning a 10-round decision over Ray Mercer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox was bleeding from around the eyes, the nose and the
mouth,'' Steward recalled. ``Against Andrew Golota, a street-tough
guy, he stopped him in one. Against Razor Ruddock, he just
overpowered him. Any time he's been in a tough fight, he's never
faltered. He's tougher than people give him credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward expected Saturday night's early rounds to be wild, maybe
even a heavyweight version of the eight marvelous middleweight
minutes before Marvelous Marvin Hagler flattened Thomas Hearns in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday night's pay-per-view showdown on TVKO for the
undisputed heavyweight title were to last only eight marvelous
minutes, it would end in the third round, too. That doesn't
necessarily mean that Holyfield's prediction will be fulfilled.
There's no reason Lewis couldn't generate a third-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander's chin is definitely questionable,'' Lewis said. ``He
hasn't been hit by a heavyweight as big as myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this brawl develops into a survival of the toughest, the
pick here has to be Evander Holyfield, the proven toughest.
</P>

IOWA'S TWISTED PLOTS PROVIDE MOTIVATION
</HEADLINE>
 DAVIS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Welcome to ``As the Bracket Unfolds,'' featuring the
soap opera stars of the 1999 NCAA men's basketball tournament, the
Iowa Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes (19-9) are seeded only fifth in the West Region
heading into Saturday's second-round matchup against fourth-seeded
Arkansas (23-10). But they clearly lead the 64-team field in
poignant story lines. In no particular order, the Hawkeyes feature:
</P>
<P>
   A lame-duck coach, Tom Davis, who seeks to prove that school
officials erred in April by announcing that his contract would not
be renewed and that 1998-99 would mark Davis' 13th and final season
at a school where he has compiled a record of 268-139 with nine
NCAA Tournament appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-year senior Jess Settles, the starting power forward and
spiritual leader who returned in November after a two-year hiatus
because of a back injury. NCAA officials granted him an unexpected
extra season of eligibility as a medical hardship case.
</P>
<P>
   Three unexpected losses from the roster in the past calendar
year.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the Hawkeyes are attempting to reach the
Sweet 16 for the first time since 1988, Davis' second season at
Iowa. Their motivation, Settles said, is at an all-time high
because of Davis' lame-duck status and the unexpected personnel
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough year on our program,'' said Settles, who
openly wept when introduced before a Feb. 23 game against
Northwestern that marked his final game at Carver-Hawkeye Arena.
``I'm glad how these guys have fought for coach Davis. ... There
are so many factors why we want to keep it going, but coach Davis
is the biggest one. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many story lines about why we want to win, it
makes your job pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the angles, Davis' last dance is the most visible. Davis,
60, was hounded by detractors after a disappointing 1996-97 season
ended with a first-round loss to Georgia in the National Invitation
Tournament. But he emerged as a sympathetic figure after athletic
director Bob Bowlsby announced this would be Davis' final season.
</P>
<P>
   During Davis' final home game, chants of ``Fire Bowlsby'' echoed
through the student section. Knowing the next game could be his
last, Davis said, has made this NCAA Tournament run more emotional
than the eight that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the end is near, but you don't know how or when,''
Davis said. ``The emotion ... is deep. But I try to I take it day
to day, minute to minute.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling when the bandwagon will run out of steam. It
could happen against Arkansas. It might keep rolling until the
Final Four. When it does, Davis will become a former Iowa coach, a
prospect he declines to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been begging the question all year on that,'' Davis said.
``There's time to think about the future later. I try not to think
of it now.'' nn

 &HT;    Blue Devils not rattled; Vols survive
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida A&AMP;M's 15 minutes of fame actually lasted less
than four minutes in Friday's NCAA Tournament opener against
top-ranked Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the only team in the tournament with a losing
record, the Rattlers only trailed the favored Blue Devils 17-13
early in the first half. But Duke promptly answered with a 23-0
spurt that overwhelmed the Rattlers and sent them reeling to a
99-58 loss in the East Regional at the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Florida A&AMP;M (12-19), which opened the season with 10 consecutive
losses, won the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament and
earning a first-round match against Duke (33-1), the ACC power
favored to win the national title. But the school's first-ever
tournament appearance ended with a thud as it trailed 59-20 at
halftime en route to its second-worst loss of the season.Duke
advances to Sunday's second-round game against the winner of the
College of Charleston/Tulsa first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wally Szczerbiak scored 43 of his team's 59 points as Miami of
Ohio edged Washington in the Midwest Regional in New Orleans.
Szczerbiak scored 11 more points than the entire Wisconsin team as
the Badgers were eliminated by Southwest Missouri State 43-32.
Wisconsin's total was the lowest in the tournament since the
inception of the shot clock in 1986 and the lowest in a first- or
second-round game in tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   _ After winning the national title two years ago and advancing
to the regional semifinals last season, Arizona had another
first-round collapse in a 61-60 loss to Oklahoma. It was the fourth
time this decade the Wildcats lost in the opening-round to a team
seeded 12th or lower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite shooting only 33 percent from the field, Tennessee won
its first tournament game in 16 years and gave the SEC its fourth
straight tournament victory with a 62-52 win over Delaware.

<P>
   ORAN, Algeria _ A weak winter sun was rising over the Bay of
Algiers as passengers in the capital began boarding Train 1001 for
Oran, 285 miles to the west along a route through a region in the
Atlas Mountains made dangerous by years of attacks by Islamic
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Just before departure, security men checking baggage for bombs
cleared a path for 30 paramilitary policemen marching past with an
armory of rifles and machine guns. As the men took up positions in
the train's 11 cars, their commander took two foreigners aside for
what amounted to a battlefront briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't leave your seats without one of my troop,'' he said,
``and don't enter the first three carriages _ they are empty in
case we hit a bomb. Our government has allowed you to travel
because the dangers are much reduced. But it is not for nothing
that Algerians call this the Train of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, life in Algeria has been disfigured by massacres
of entire villages, bombings in restaurants and cafes and killings
of artists, theater directors, journalists, scholars and others
judged to have offended Islamic mores. No road has been safe from
roadblocks set up by the rebels, who have stopped cars, then shot
the occupants or cut their throats.
</P>
<P>
   But few experiences have been as unnerving as riding Train 1001.
On its seven-hour run from Algiers to Oran, the country's
second-largest city, it has been attacked at least 25 times,
usually with land mines. Dozens of passengers have been killed, and
scores more wounded. In the mid-1990s the government's inability to
halt the attacks became a symbol of widening chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with government troops prevailing in the conflict,
Train 1001 has become a new kind of symbol, of an Algeria working
its way back from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   After years of running half-empty, the train is full again and
runs safely for months at a time. Reflecting their new confidence,
the military authorities who are Algeria's real rulers have begun
allowing visiting journalists to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before the Islamic insurgency began in 1992, the
train was a tourist draw. It linked two Mediterranean cities,
Algiers and Oran, that are redolent in their whitewashed palaces
and villas of the French colonial past. And it served as a panorama
of Algerian history, running through towns that were Carthaginian,
Roman, Spanish and Turkish in the 2,500 years before France became
the ruling power in 1832.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the threat much reduced, few passengers today seem
disposed to ponder the mosaic of Algeria's past. As the train
headed into the Mitidja region, where the route rises into the
Atlas range and runs through areas where Islamic rebels remain
active, most of the travelers fell silent, leaving the conductor,
Dahman Fenni, to catch the mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Muslims believe in destiny,'' he said. ``So whether we die
in our beds or on this train, it's all the same in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenni, 45, a former amateur boxer, chuckled as if he did not
quite believe his own words. ``Well,'' he said, ``I suppose it's
fair to admit that those of us who make this journey for a living
may be testing God's patience just a little.''
</P>
<P>
   In a landscape of deep valleys and rushing rivers, among orange
and lemon groves and vineyards planted by the French, evidence of
past attacks lay strewn beside the track. Among the twisted
wreckage of rail cars blasted by bombs, the rebels have left
graffiti celebrating their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is led by infidels,'' said one. ``The GIA was
here!'' said another, using the French acronym for the Armed
Islamic Group, the most violent of the rebel groups. Another said
simply, ``In the name of Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly in a country where the government has had a
history of intolerance toward its critics, few of the passengers
seemed eager to talk to strangers about the conflict, especially
when the questions invited opinions about the ruling generals.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential election called for April 15 will give Algeria's
16 million voters a chance to choose between a candidate backed by
the generals and a range of opposition candidates, but few people
are ready to say openly whom they intend to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you crazy?'' said Nasser Benfatma, 27. Do you want me to
go to jail?''
</P>
<P>
   An architecture graduate who despaired of getting a professional
position in the severely depressed economy, Benfatma took up what
Algerians call trabendo, small-time trading in the marketplaces of
Algiers and Oran. On this trip, he carried a suitcase full of suede
jackets bought on a trip to Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young Algerians _ 70 percent of the 28 million people
are under 30 _ he said his first choice would be to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, what interests me is America,'' he said. ``Can you get
me a visa? If not, let's talk about Disneyland, or Coca-Cola, or
blue jeans. That will cheer me up.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a wariness about open political discussion, there
was little reserve in condemning the rebels. Fenni, the conductor,
said the rebels had exhausted their support among Algerians with
their violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am all for democracy,'' he said. ``All good men are. But
these Islamists, what are they offering us? They attack people in
their homes, they burn down schools, they blow up trains, they cut
people's throats. That's not democracy, and it certainly isn't
Islam.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the passengers, many were drawn from Algeria's poor, the
class that provided the strongest support for the Islamic Salvation
Front, a hard-line Islamic group, when it scored a landslide in the
first round of voting in the national election of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After the generals canceled the election, the armed wing of the
Islamic Salvation Front began the war. In 1997 the group negotiated
a cease-fire with the government, but a splinter group, the Armed
Islamic Group, has continued its attack, though at a diminished
level.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelkader Nedjoum, a 68-year-old traveler, said market-oriented
economic reforms by the government in the last decade had stripped
him of his job as a laborer on a collective farm. Like many of
Algeria's have-nots, he takes no side in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I know of those people?'' he said, referring to the
generals and the rebels. ``I am an illiterate man. All I know is, I
support anybody who gives me a daily ration of bread.''

FORMER BOSTON MAYOR WILL HEAD CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION OF
CATHOLICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Va.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raymond Flynn, former mayor of Boston and later ambassador to
the Vatican, said Friday that he would become head of a national
Roman Catholic political organization that was founded as a branch
of the conservative Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, a 59-year-old Democrat, described his appointment, to the
national presidency of the nonpartisan Catholic Alliance, as part
of a change that began when the group became independent of the
Christian Coalition two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want a leadership that is more in tune, more
focused on Catholic social teaching,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said that under his leadership, which takes effect next
Wednesday, the organization would encourage political participation
and provide a voice for Catholics, especially ``blue-collar,
working-class'' Catholics. ``Our focus will be on solidarity with
the poor, the needy and the immigrants,'' he said, adding that the
organization would also continue to oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Alliance's mission statement outlines ``four
pillars,'' or principles, the first of which calls for legally
protecting human life, ``from conception to natural death.''
</P>
<P>
   The other principles call for upholding the primary importance
of the family (and opposing legal recognition of same-sex
marriage); for recognizing that ``authentic freedom is bounded by
truth and personal responsibility,'' and for ``solidarity'' with
the poor (and opposition to ``the substitution of dehumanizing
government bureaucracy for real charity'').
</P>
<P>
   The organization, whose annual budget is about $1.2 million,
maintains a national office in Oakton, Va., near Washington, and a
smaller office on Capitol Hill. Flynn said it had about 125,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition created the Catholic Alliance in October
1995 with a mass-mailing appeal for members that coincided with
Pope John Paul II's pastoral visit to New York. At the time, Ralph
Reed, who was then the coalition's executive director, said that
anyone joining the new organization automatically would become a
member of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the publicity surrounding its start, the Catholic
Alliance has been a low-profile group, both before and after it
became independent in 1997. That year Keith Fournier became its
president, after having been head of the American Center for Law
and Justice, a conservative religious-liberty law firm founded by
Pat Robertson, who created the Christian Coalition. Fournier
recently stepped down as the Catholic Alliance's president.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lynch, a New York lawyer who became the organization's
chairman about a month ago, said that it recently had added new
board members and that its goal would be ``to inform and encourage
Catholics to participate in local, state and national affairs.''
Lynch said it would not endorse political candidates but would
create an Internet site where candidates' positions could be
compared with Catholic teaching on social issues.

No first-round fodder, Detroit tries to take next step
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ Enough already. For the Titans of Detroit and the
Midwestern Collegiate Conference, it's time to dissolve whatever
notion remains that their basketball team is a mid-level group from
a mid-level league.
</P>
<P>
   One win, even one like the 12th-seeded Titans' 56-53 stunner of
elitist UCLA, the No. 5 seed, in the South Regional's first round,
won't entirely wipe off the perception. Another win, like an upset
of No. 4-seeded Ohio State in the second round today at the RCA
Dome would certainly help, but the Titans and coach Perry Watson
are secure with their image.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Jermaine Jackson and Bacari Alexander are two Detroit
recruits whom Watson, well-versed from his days in that city's high
school coaching ranks, has injected into this fast-rising program.
But the canny Watson realizes there is a danger with back-to-back
NCAA tournament appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses might tend to take it for granted, that it's an
every-year thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (25-5) can't yet be considered NCAA regulars. They
have played in five Tournaments, but last year was their first in
19 seasons. The UCLA win was their third in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Watson if he accepts his team's role as one of this
Tournament's Cinderella teams and he parries the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm Cinderella?'' he says before noticing a friend in the
back of the room. ``Hey, Fran! They're making me Cinderella!''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Fraschilla coached last season at St. John's, eliminated by
the Titans in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deal in false hype,'' Watson continues. ``I deal in
city kids. I ask my guys to be the best player you can be and the
best team you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson dealt with city kids for 13 years at Detroit's
Southwestern High School. Three of his former players at
Southwestern _ Jalen Rose, who was in the stands cheering on the
Titans against UCLA, Voshon Lenard and Howard Eisley _ currently
play in the NBA. Watson recruits also helped fuel Michigan's NCAA
run with the Fab Five when he assisted Steve Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   While Michigan State and Michigan have appeared on recent Titans
schedules, Detroit is playing Ohio State for the first time since
1962 and the third time ever. But the Titans relish the chance to
take on a Big Ten power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to play anyone anywhere,'' Watson said. ``We
have tremendous respect for anyone that plays the game, but we
don't fear anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the MCC Player of the Year, played for a Detroit
suburban school and was recruited by Michigan State after he had
committed to Watson. He stuck with the Titans. Alexander had played
for Southwestern, Watson's former school. Yet Alexander seems to
understand the perception Detroit battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Detroit like the elephant and the mouse,'' he
said. ``Everybody sees the Michigans or the Michigan States like
the elephant. When the mouse comes at you, you tend to get startled
and run away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fans who have followed us for 20, 30, 40 years,''
Alexander said of the reception generated by the UCLA win. ``This
is a special time for them as well as us. This will be something I
will hopefully be able to tell my children _ that I was a part of a
team that beat UCLA in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Alexander doesn't think there isn't much more ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a beautiful sport,'' he reasons. ``You can mix
all kinds of concepts and socio-economic backgrounds and get it
done in a team concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might get `B' players,'' he said, ``but we get `A' wins.''

 &HT;    It's ugly, but Tennessee defeats Hens
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The late Jim Valvano once said that the NCAA
Basketball Tournament is about one thing and one thing only:
Survive and advance. And that's about all Tennessee did to
distinguish itself Friday when the Volunteers defeated Delware
62-52 in the first round of the East Regional at the Charlotte
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tennessee's Brandon Wharton (5 for 18 from the field),
summed up the afternoon best when asked about a moment in the
second half when the lights on the court got temporarily brighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they were trying to show us the way to the basket,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (21-8), the No. 4 seed, beat the 13th-seeded America
East champion (25-6) despite shooting 32.8 percent (20 of 61) from
the floor with 19 turnovers, and committing plenty of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the SEC's Eastern Division champion is one of 32 teams
still alive and will meet Southwest Missouri State on Sunday for a
trip to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jerry Green's team won its first NCAA Tournament game
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still here and we know we can play a lot better,'' said
Green, who has the Volunteers in the tournament for the second
consecutive year. ``And I think our guys feel good about that. Now
we'll just get ready to play the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaware wasn't exactly ripping down the nets, either. In the
first half, the two teams combined to shoot 26.3 percent from the
floor (15 of 57) with 20 turnovers. The Volunteers needed a 11-0
run in the final three minutes to lead 25-22 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime we just said `we can't shoot any worse so let's
keep playing defense,''' said Wharton, who finished with 16 points.
``If we just kept playing defense, we knew we'd have a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Tennessee's superior size and athletic
ability began to take their toll. With the score tied at 25, the
Volunteers went on a 11-2 run to take a 36-27 lead with 15:24 left.
The Blue Hens climbed to within 36-35 with 11:20 remaining, but
Tennesee scored seven straight to take a 43-35 lead with 9:08 left.
The Vols were in control after that.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, which was eliminated by Purdue in the first round last
year, shot 29.8 percent (18 of 57). The Blue Hens hit only two of
15 shots (13.3 percent) from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had our chances,'' Delaware coach Mike Brey said.
``But Tennessee did what they had to do to win the game.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Muhammad Ali in his boxing prime, financial wagers on the
Year 2000 problem can float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
Just ask futures traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   They began betting last fall that the final days of 1999 would
bring worldwide panic about potential Year 2000 computer glitches.
They speculated that nervous people and businesses would hoard
cash, putting a severe strain on banks and driving up borrowing
costs for anyone needing credit.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the traders had driven December 1999
futures prices to levels that, in effect, projected a devastating
jump of about 13 percentage points in dollar interest rates at the
end of this year. They did it with trades known as ``butterflies''
that usually look a bit like the insects when their components are
charted.
</P>
<P>
   By December, the charts for the ``millennium butterfly'' _ the
purchase of a September 1999 contract, the sale of two December
1999s and the purchase of a March 2000 _ had wings at the sharpest
angles in memory.
</P>
<P>
   The trading was greeted as an overdue guest by Year 2000
alarmists, who had been longing for evidence to support their
predictions that Y2K, as the computer problem has been nicknamed,
would make huge waves in the markets. It also grabbed much
attention in banking circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all looking for road signs as to what will happen,'' a
Year 2000 project manager at a major New York bank confided at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The road sign has since been flattened, though, along with those
who were certain it pointed somewhere. By last month, December
futures prices had tumbled back into their traditional relationship
with the September and March contracts. Participants were left
wondering what to make of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a bubble rather than anything substantive,''
said Galen Burghardt, a senior vice president at Carr Futures, a
brokerage firm based in Chicago. ``If you really got a sense people
couldn't bank at year-end, all hell would break loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The aborted flight of the futures butterfly has reinforced the
prevailing sentiment that it does not pay _ so far, at least _ to
bet that Year 2000 problems will produce any sharp moves in stocks,
bonds and other mainstream markets. Some managers say it is a
mistake to think that bets on Y2K will ever be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, the stock market only moves on surprises, since
today's prices reflect expectations,'' said Kenneth L. Fisher of
Fisher Investments in Woodside, Calif., which manages $2.9 billion
for institutions and private clients. ``Y2K is no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Fisher a gold medal in the Understatement Olympics. It
would be a feat these days to find an investor who has never heard
that the decades-old practice of using two digits in computer
dates, like ``99'' for 1999, could trip up computers, programs and
electronically controlled machines reading year 2000 dates. The
``00'' might be read as 1900 or not recognized as a valid date;
some malfunctions lead to shutdowns and others to faulty
calculations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, many investment advisers and managers are not quite as
confident as Fisher that the market has anticipated Y2K: Everyone
may know that Y2K is coming, but there is great uncertainty over
how extensive disruptions will be, where they will strike and when
their impacts will be felt by individual companies and nations.
Prices may plunge where disruptions hit or skyrocket where they do
not.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Jan. 1, some analysts say, the prospect of
volatility could force trillions of dollars in investment
portfolios to be rearranged as managers try to reduce their risks.
If that happens, those who move before the crowd will, as always,
pay less to achieve their goals. So even skeptics must be poised to
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a puzzle to me,'' said Jonathan Muehl, a pension fund
adviser at Buck Consultants in Pittsburgh, who sees no sign yet of
Y2K hedging activity in options prices. (An option is the right to
buy or sell a commodity, a stock or an entire basket of stocks for
a specific price at a specific date in the future; a future is an
obligation to complete such a deal.)
</P>
<P>
   Muehl says options that would protect investors from sharp
stock-portfolio declines in the trading days before 2000 currently
sell at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and in over-the-counter
trading at prices that imply almost no increase in the risk that
stocks will gyrate later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that the market isn't concerned, but part of me
wonders whether the market has really focused on the issue yet,''
Muehl said.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing wisdom _ reflected in a report this month from a
United States Senate special committee tracking Y2K as well as
recent analyses by leading Wall Street brokerage firms _ is that
overseas markets are especially vulnerable to Y2K problems. Most
countries started dealing with Y2K later than the United States,
and many developing nations are hard pressed for resources.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, an
international organization of more than 230 banks, insurance
companies and other financial institutions, dropped plans to
publicly rate the readiness of 35 key countries after regulators
fretted privately that such a move could ignite a disruptive flight
of capital. But lagging nations _ and the businesses within them _
may have received only a temporary reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably too early for Y2K factors to dominate an
investment decision,'' said George A. Murnaghan, executive vice
president and marketing manager at Rowe Price-Fleming International
in Baltimore, which manages $30 billion for mutual funds and
institutions with international portfolios. ``As the year goes on,
it will become more important.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there has already been plenty of action involving
the stocks of companies like Viasoft Inc. and Data Dimensions that
have been beneficiaries of the billions being spent to repair Y2K
defects.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1996, such stocks soared _ and often later crashed _
as investors placed bets on how big the repair effort would be and
which companies would profit most. Now all those players are
treating Y2K as history as they race to convince Wall Street that
they have viable strategies to prosper when the Year 2000 work
dries up.
</P>
<P>
   But such investments were never bets on either the actual impact
of Y2K or on how individuals and business will act in the final run
up to it. Other than the butterfly, which involved contracts so
large that only large institutional investors and professional
traders at the Merc waded in, the only hot Year 2000 investment
action to date has been in market niches like gold and silver
coins, where small investors are chasing limited supplies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The coins are being snapped up not only as investments but also
because many alarmists see them as valuable assets for barter if
the Year 2000 banking collapse they foresee comes to pass. Demand
was so strong for 1998 Silver Eagles that the United States Mint
ran out in early December; the 1999 version is already in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortages are just driving demand higher,'' said David
Harper, editor of Numismatic News, a weekly newspaper for coin
collectors, based in Iola, Wis. He said many dealer quotes for the
coins have been running at more than triple the once-common $1.25
premium to spot silver prices.
</P>
<P>
   He recently wrote an editorial that warned of the potential for
a crash in the coin markets if, as most experts predict, Y2K
disruptions turn out to be minor in the United States. Prices may
also dive if the Mint sharply increases its output this year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coin markets are being stoked by feverish talk on the
Internet of inevitable catastrophe come the millennium. More
respected voices _ like Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities, who gained a following on Wall Street for
correctly forecasting the market boom of the 90's _ couch their
warnings in terms of probabilities. Yardeni currently says there is
a 70 percent chance that Y2K breakdowns will usher in a global
recession and that the most likely impact on the stock market is a
30 percent to 40 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bother to look up Yardeni's full analysis,
however, might sit tight. He expects a major rebound in 2001 and
sees the Dow Jones industrial average, currently at 9,876.35,
reaching 15,000 by 2005. Of course, if he and other forecasters who
are relatively gloomy about Y2K are correct, there are huge profits
to be made by selling now and buying just after prices tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is currently priced for perfection, and that just
won't happen,'' said Dennis G. Grabow, chief executive of the
Millennium Investment Corp., a Chicago-based investment adviser to
pension funds with $20 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Grabow advocates dumping investments in emerging markets, urban
real estate and the chemical industry, among others, in favor of
government bonds. He expects a ``flight to quality'' to drive up
demand for such bonds, creating profits for those who hold them.
Investors, he said, can easily move their money back into stocks
once markets have absorbed a Y2K hit.
</P>
<P>
   The market is not accurately anticipating Y2K, Grabow argued,
because analysts are talking to their usual sources, like corporate
financial officers, instead of those lower down the ranks who are
managing repair work and testing.
</P>
<P>
   But Grabow's view has been, at best, premature. He had predicted
that anticipation of Y2K would send stocks down 25 percent last
year; in fact, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 26.7
percent. Small investors who saw Tony Keyes on Oprah Winfrey's
television program last year and snapped up his book, ``The Year
2000 Computer Crisis: An Investor's Survival Guide'' (Y2K Investor,
1997), may also have turned defensive too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've left a lot of money on the table,'' conceded Keyes, a
former computer systems analyst turned Washington talk-radio host.
</P>
<P>
   He outlines many investment choices in his book but chose a
defensive posture emphasizing government bonds for himself. Though
he largely missed the latest leg of the bull market in stocks, he
added, the upside is that he has been sleeping well.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences underscore the exquisite timing skills that Y2K
financial bets require _ exactly the kind of market timing that
many Wall Street professionals and financial advisers tell
investors to avoid. Not only are there varying theories of when
disruptions might strike _ it could take months, for example, for
overseas problems to hurt many American businesses _ but it is also
difficult to predict when investors might start reacting.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, the California money manager, is fond of calling stock
markets ``The Great Humiliator.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could easily envision a ``relatively normal
correction'' this year in a market that has reached record prices.
Such a correction, he said, could become exaggerated if ``Y2K
people come screaming out of the woodwork.'' Investors trying to
time the market, he added, could be lured into foolish selling.
</P>
<P>
   Others warn that even in the event of a New Year's debacle, the
reactions in financial markets might not all be so obvious as a
race into government bonds. Y2K problems might not send markets
tumbling in Asia, for example; so much money has already been
pulled out of troubled stock markets there that major investors
might simply delay reinvestment instead of selling more.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about this twist: Big companies with no Year 2000
problems might face selling pressure if mutual funds see selling
those stocks as the least costly way to build up cash to buy stocks
they regard as unfairly beaten down. That picture seems plausible
to the chief strategist of one of the country's biggest pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're long-term investors, but we're also opportunistic,'' he
explained, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while institutions may have a variety of deft
strategies for jumping on opportunities, history suggests that many
will end up outwitting themselves if Year 2000 trouble develops. In
every recent downturn, the big institutions have done the bulk of
the misguided panic selling and small investors a large proportion
of the timely buying.
</P>
<P>
   One could easily imagine Y2K producing a similar result. Many of
the most skittish small investors are already out of the market and
into coins or other defensive investments. If trouble hits, they
will not be around for the panic selling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those left may well be mostly long-term investors
perfectly willing to snap up any bargains the institutions create
in their race to the exits.

 &HT;    Meet Delray's Don King
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some call him a convicted murderer, a swindler, the
King of Babble-On. But Don King is still here, still tireless and
tactless and shameless, 25 years after orchestrating Zaire's Rumble
in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, eight months
after acquittal on insurance fraud charges that meant to send him
back to prison for 45 years, even as the U.S. Congress weighs a
bill targeting his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government went after John Gotti and got him, went after
Al Capone and got him,'' says Randy Gordon, the former New York
State Athletic Commissioner. ``They did an extensive investigation
on King, two trials worth, and came up with nothing. He has come
up, if not clean, then not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   So here he is on the Madison Square Garden theater stage, the
conductor in black tuxedo and diamond pendants, promoting tonight's
``unmitigated, unadulterated, undisputed heavyweight championship
of the world'' between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   King spent 45 rambling minutes Wednesday calling himself
agrarian and statesman for ``putting the seeds in the ground'' for
Kings' Crowning Glory _ a fight that will unify three titles and,
says King, cause a cease fire in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not shoot each other on March 13. They will watch
Holyfield and Lewis on March 13.''
</P>
<P>
   As will many, for $49.95 a pop, in his adopted home state.
</P>
<P>
   Floridian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Florida,'' says King, 67. ``It is paradise, it is the
Garden of Eden. I think it is something that we say in the
vernacular of the ghetto, SKD ... something kinda different. I am
domiciled there, and I will continue to be domiciled there.''
</P>
<P>
   King's main offices are in Deerfield Beach, his crown logo
visible from I-95. ``He is not an absentee owner,'' says Howie
Evans, King's public relations director. ``He's usually the first
one in the building, the last one to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   A marker outside is dedicated to Henrietta, his wife of 43
years, for decorating the former warehouse, but the first grinning
face seen is Don's on a portrait behind the main desk. The
predominant artistic pieces are animal sculptures, allegorical to
the owner's career: majestic birds proudly spreading their wings,
cowboys and Indians hanging onto bucking horses.
</P>
<P>
   Kingvision Pay Per View is in this $2.1 million complex, and
there's International Operations, and Accounting, and a video
production room with tapes strewn across desks. A large white room
serves as an infomercial studio, an employees' workout room has a
Jacuzzi and lockers, and an unfinished ring sits in the warehouse's
corner. ``We may have small shows,'' Evans says.
</P>
<P>
   One guesses the shows upstairs are more combative, when King's
profile reflects in framed certificates and hanging photos of the
owner with Tip O'Neill and Jimmy Carter and Bob Dole and Bill
Clinton. One conference room is behind brown doors fronting the
executive suites, the offices of King and in-house lawyers, handy
considering his involvement in more than 100 lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   King moved his headquarters from Manhattan to Fort Lauderdale's
Oakland Park Road from 1993-1997. The Deerfield building is closer
to his home in Foxe Chase off Germantown Road in Delray Beach,
purchased early this decade and a place where he entertains the
chairmen of boxing's sanctioning bodies over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   King's primary dwelling is a sprawling 400-acre estate in
Windsor, Ohio, with its indoor pool shaped like a boxing glove. But
his daughter Debbie lives in Boca Raton, his stepson Carl resides
in Boynton Beach. King has frequented the businesses of Delray
Beach's Linton Road for seven years: the Circuit City, the
Albertson's, the TCBY (now Brendy's), the Blockbuster Video. ``He
was a real nice guy,'' says Marco Conde, 16, who worked at TCBY and
now is at Circuit City. ``With a big wad of money, a rubberband
around it. He always let me keep the change.''
</P>
<P>
   He has noshed on bagels in Poppie's deli, with people like Boca
Raton police officer and community activist Wayne Barton, who says
King ``did more talking than eating; soon as he sits down, you are
in a classroom lecture.'' Barton attended King's 67th birthday
party at Renzo's Italian restaurant. ``He calls me to make chicken
soup,'' says owner Renzo Sciortino, whom King calls ``Fratello''
for brother. King comes in for trippa (cow stomach) with potatoes
and peas, and linguini al dente, and zuppa di clams. ``He mingles
with everybody, he talks to everybody if he has to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Community activists revere King, which is why there's a Don King
Plaza in Newark, N.J., and a Don King community center in South
Central Los Angeles, and an honorary doctorate for him at Shaw
University in Raleigh, N.C., where there soon may be a Don King
Wellness Center. He has been honored by the NAACP, the Rainbow/PUSH
coalition, the Council for Negro Women, the Southern Leadership
Conference, and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to have him in the community,'' Deerfield fire
chief Gary Lother says, especially after King spent $326,000 to
replace a fire engine that was rear-ended on I-95. In 1997, King
added this area to his holiday Turkey Tour, his staff working with
the Delray Community Action Center, and holding a press conference
at Tom's Place restaurant. Evans says King has spent close to $1
million on various South Florida projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a part of the community, with its problems, its
joys and its sorrows, and everything it involves,'' King says.
``And to do that, you have to be involved. You must be as John
Dunne was many years ago, when he said no man is an island ... when
the death bell tolls, does it not toll for me, for whom the bell
tolls. If any man dies it diminishes me, because I am involved with
mankind. I'm involved with Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did public relations that some people do with all the
things he's doing, you'd see a whole different picture,'' says Shaw
University alum and Stuart attorney Willie Gary, with whom King is
working on a scholarship foundation in Stuart. ``He doesn't look
for the limelight when he's giving, he just does it. He gives and
gives and gives and gives.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 27, he will give the area a third fight card in four
months, this one at Miccosukee Indian Gaming. He already has made
an impact through another gift, a $100,000 donation to former
Florida State Athletic Commissioner Mike Scionti's non-profit
foundation for needy boxers. Gov. Jeb Bush removed Sciont on
Wednesday. An investigation found him guilty of, among other
things, giving King back his promotional license while he was under
indictment, which is against Florida law, and endorsing a change in
state law to allow exclusive promotional contracts, which helped
King in his court battle with boxer Julio Cesar Chavez. King denies
his gift was coercion.
</P>
<P>
   He has always denied, especially after Jack Newfield's 1995
book, Only in America: The Life and Crimes of Don King, detailed
with considerable documentation how he intimidated his way to
prominence: getting what he wants through payoffs, death threats,
mob ties, the race card, and deceptive and restrictive contract
practices, and leaving broke, bewildered fighters in his wake.
Evans _ a former Amsterdam (N.Y.) News reporter _ calls Newfield's
book a ``vendetta,'' though King has not accepted the author's
challenge to sue. The boxing industry's consensus is that most of
the book is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, Don lost his way,'' says Mike Marley, King's former
spokesman and a boxing journalist. ``At one time, he was a man on a
mission, a businessman who might have had a little bit of a noble
motive. The only blacks in boxing were in the ring, and he came in
the hard way. He excelled. His record speaks for itself.
Unfortunately so do a lot of his abuses of people. He used to say,
`It's for the needy not the greedy.' Over the years, he may have
reversed that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Marley has seen ``slivers of decency,'' noting King gave Ali
sidekick Drew ``Bundini'' Brown a ``fitting burial,'' and helped
brain-damaged fighter Gerald McClellan financially, though some in
McClellan's family said King didn't fulfill his obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept all criticism,'' King said. ``I'm to blame for the
Johnstown Flood. I'm to blame for the second World War. I'm to
blame for the Lindbergh killing. I'm to blame for everything that
ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The book spawned a movie by HBO Pictures, which shows the
numbers runner beating Sam Garrett to death in 1966 over $600
(King's murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter and he served
less than four years). King calls the film a $9 million commercial.
On the Holyfield-Lewis fight he's again working with HBO, nine
years after bolting for Showtime with Tyson. ``Being on a promotion
with Don is like dating your ex-wife, carefully, and you hope
there's a second date,'' says HBO's Seth Abraham, who lauds King's
work on what is the fastest heavyweight sellout at MSG.
</P>
<P>
   King forgave HBO. He can even forgive lawsuits _ attorney Jim
Beasley recalls being told at a party, ``You're one SOB of a
lawyer, and I like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has seen King's nasty and playful sides _ Gordon said
King once told heavyweight Greg Page, ``Don't you ever try to
think, I do the thinking. If you ever try to do the thinking again,
I will ruin you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was working as a USA Network broadcaster when King came
into a Las Vegas casino screaming, ``You're killing me, Randy
Gordon! You're killing me!'' Gordon protested he hadn't spoken
about King. ``That's what I mean,'' King bellowed. ``You're talking
about Bob Arum, you're talking about everyone in the world but
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite is happening in Washington D.C., where
Senators John McCain (R-Az) and Richard Bryan (D-Nev) introduced
the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, soon to be argued in the House.
The bill forces ratings organizations to establish consistent
criteria, limits option contracts with promoters to one year,
prohibits conflicts of interest between promoters and managers, and
forces promoters to disclose complete copies of their contracts to
state commissions.
</P>
<P>
   It strives to save boxing from itself, falling just short of
appointing a federal commission, and many in the fight business _
from trainers Angelo Dundee, Kevin Rooney, Gil Clancy and Emanuel
Steward to former King executives like Scott Woodworth and Sterling
McPherson _ are crying out for salvation. ``Promoters serve a role
in the industry,'' says McCain spokesman Paul Seeney. ``What we are
trying to cut back on are the monopolistic, or egregious, or
anti-competitive business practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-room deals and double contracts _ one signed, the other
blank. The inconsistency of rankings from one alphabet organization
to another _ ratings often influenced by promoters. A promoter's
domination of an entire division for years, by forcing a challenger
to give him future promotional options, should he beat the
champion. The insertion of puppet managers who serve the promoter,
rather than rightly serving their client, the fighter.
</P>
<P>
   King's practices. The practices so constricting they force even
the fighters who sue him, from Larry Holmes to Felix Trinidad, to
return to him. McCain won't say that the bill is aimed at King,
even if many in the Senate Commerce hearing did. King has called it
an anti-King bill. ``As Don tells the federal government, I don't
make the rules, I just play by the rules,'' Woodworth says. ``That
doesn't mean the rules are good.''
</P>
<P>
   King shied from the government this time. ``We invited every
major figure, and we never got a response from King,'' Seeney says.
Allan Grossman, Florida's assistant attorney general, says King was
accommodating when he met with him in Deerfield Beach on behalf of
the National Association of Attorneys General's Boxing Task Force _
which created a Boxers' Bill of Rights and may make recommendations
for amendments to the Ali Act. King couldn't attend the Task
Force's three-day hearing, however, and a spokesman for New York
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer says Spitzer is ``looking forward''
to receiving King's written testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, his appearance in Canastota, N.Y., was testimony to his
impact when he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of
Fame. ``It is difficult for a fan to walk down boxing's memory lane
with so many world championship fights without seeing the DKP on
programs, posters, fight tickets,'' says Ed Brophy, the Hall's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in Manhattan for this championship, quoting Kipling,
and Shakespeare, and Paul Revere, and FDR, sliding from phone to
phone on the press table to talk to radio show hosts for nearly two
hours. Sweating, rumpled, asking for water, then grabbing another
phone to tell the world how ``we couldn't paint a seat in if we
were an artist,'' greeting Mexico with ``muy grande, fantastico.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why critics _ even McPherson and Woodworth who have sued
him on behalf of fighters and whom he now calls Judases _ respect
him as a promoter. His ability to block out any noise but his own,
something McPherson tries to do now to make his teacher ``proud''
of him. ``Don paid me a very handsome salary, and what we did for
him was give up our lives,'' Woodworth says.
</P>
<P>
   King's life has become Ali's tactic in that Rumble 25 years ago,
the rope-a-dope. His critics have punched, and punched, and perhaps
someday they'll punch themselves out. For this King, what a
crowning glory that would be.

OIL PRICE SURGE DOES NOT MEAN INFLATION SURGE, ECONOMISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also OIL-TALKS) 
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The oil price surge this year, which got another boost Friday
with a new agreement on cutting production, is beginning to sting
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline pump prices began to creep up this month. Colder
weather in the Northeast could add to the heating oil pinch. Higher
prices for airplane fuel may make tickets more expensive quickly.
The indirect ripple effects in products, like plastics, that use
oil, will take longer to bite, but will come.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the oil price increase, economists are not
predicting a new surge in inflation across the board. Rather, they
are merely saying that the decline in inflation, which limited last
year's increase in the Consumer Price Index to 1.6 percent, will be
over if the oil price rises stick.
</P>
<P>
   This means, economists said Friday, that the rate of inflation
overall, which includes energy and food prices, is likely to move
up toward the rate for what economists call core inflation. That
rate, which excludes energy and food, is considered by some to be a
better measure of the long-term rate of price increases. Last year,
the CPI's core rate rose 2.3 percent. But, the economists agree,
there is no upward spiral on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should notice but not worry,'' said Gail Fosler,
the chief economist at the Conference Board. ``There is really
nothing in the global environment or the United States environment
that suggests that this is going to spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen whether consumers will get unnerved
when they see reports that prices are moving up rather than holding
steady or declining. Investors might also get disturbed and push
the price of bonds down and interest rates higher. But there was no
sign of this kind of concern in the bond market Friday, as interest
rates on Treasury securities fell and the government's
inflation-indexed bonds were virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The changing outlook for inflation was reflected pointedly in
two separate news events Friday. First, the Labor Department
reported that prices paid to producers fell four-tenths of 1
percent in February. Without energy and food, producer prices were
unchanged. Throughout the report there were signs that the prices
of many goods were still falling.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers meeting at The Hague, Netherlands, also announced
that they had the outline of an agreement to cut oil production by
2 million barrels a day. That report pushed up the price of oil for
delivery in April to $14.49 a barrel, its highest since October.
The anticipation of some kind of new reduction in production has
been pushing up the price of oil steadily since mid-February when
it was $11.37 a barrel, just above a 13-year low.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons that economists are not predicting
another general price spiral. One is that the global economic
growth is still sluggish at best. Even if Asia, which triggered a
worldwide financial crisis in 1997 with a series of currency
devaluations, is recovering, Latin America is in decline and Europe
seems to be standing still or slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank is forecasting about 1.5 percent growth
globally this year. Even if stronger than expected U.S. growth
pulls that up to 2 percent, that will be significantly below the
pace of recent years, said James Glassman, Chase's senior U.S.
economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main driver for all this good inflation news is that we
are not growing at our potential globally,'' he said. The way to
change his mind about the outlook for inflation, he said, was to
have oil prices rising because global demand was picking up.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that other commodity prices, from cotton to
copper, are at or near their recent lows. The Commodity Research
Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities, which fell Friday, is just
five points above its 24-year low, hit at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until there is significant upward pressure on all commodities,
we are not going to have any worrisome price impact,'' said Ms.
Fosler of the Conference Board.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, while oil prices have shot up 20 percent this year,
they have risen from very low levels and are just back to where
they were last summer or fall, when they were already low. The same
is true for gasoline prices, which were at their lowest level,
after adjustment for inflation, since at least the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the question of whether the production cuts will
hold or have a significant impact. Oil producers are notorious for
cheating, even after agreeing to pump less oil. After the last
major effort to cut production began in March 1998, the price of
oil dropped 36 percent to its low of $10.72 a barrel in December.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is not a new inflation spiral in sight, the
overall inflation rate will rise if the oil price increase holds.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch,
estimates that the price of oil could move up to $17 a barrel soon.
And he said it could possibly move near $20 a barrel by the end of
the year if there was a sustained reduction in production that made
a meaningful dent in the current overload of oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Latta, principal U.S. economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
in Lexington, Mass., ran an end-of-the-year oil price of $18 a
barrel through her computer model and found the following: The DRI
forecast of a 1.8 percent rise in the CPI, year-over-year, in 1999
inches up to 2.1 percent. And if the oil price held there, the CPI
would increase 2.8 percent in 2000 and 2.6 percent in 2001, before
slipping back to 2.4 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   This is above the 1.6 percent increase for 1998. But the number
is less startling when compared with the 2.3 percent increase in
the CPI in 1997 and the 3 percent rise in 1996. In addition, the
forecasts are close to the increase in the core CPI, without the
volatile elements of food and energy, which rose 2.3 percent in
1998, 2.4 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   All this leads Ms. Latta to agree with the other economists on
the recent rise in oil prices: ``It is not going to have much of an
impact on inflation.''

ICAHN NAMES HIS OWN BOARD IN FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF RJR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving forward with his bid to gain control of RJR Nabisco, Carl
C. Icahn Friday named a nine-member board of directors that
includes Icahn himself and several officials of companies he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn announced Thursday that he would challenge RJR's
management over which part of the company to spin off.
</P>
<P>
   RJR's chairman and chief executive, Steven F. Goldstone,
announced plans on Tuesday to sell the company's international
tobacco division and set up its domestic tobacco operations as a
separate, publicly traded entity. That would take RJR out of the
cigarette business, and leave it with an 80.6 percent stake in
Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Icahn wants the company to spin off the food business and
leave the domestic tobacco division inside the holding company. He
has argued that doing so would increase shareholder value more than
Goldstone's plan, although Goldstone says a food spinoff cannot be
done.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for RJR said the company had no comment on the
proposed board, which includes two people Icahn persuaded to serve
on an alternate board when he sought to take over the company in
1996. Shareholders will vote on which board should run the company
at its annual meeting in Winston-Salem, N.C., on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   The notes accompanying Icahn's filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission say that the board will run ``on a platform
that advocates the prompt spinoff of Nabisco to stockholders.''
Icahn said Thursday that he hoped to keep the proxy fight focused
on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Icahn, the proposed board includes four executives or
directors of companies he owns. They are Russell D. Glass, the
president of Icahn Associates; Martin Hirsch, a vice president of
American Real Estate Partners LP, a partnership controlled by
Icahn; Robert J. Mitchell, the vice president of Icahn &AMP; Co., and
Jack G. Wasserman, a lawyer who is a director of several Icahn
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman was named to the alternate board filed by Icahn in
1996, as was Seymour C. Fliegel, an educational consultant and
senior fellow at the Center for Educational Innovation in
Manhattan, who is also on the list this time.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposed directors are Jerome M. Becker, 63, a lawyer;
Harold First, 62, a self-employed financial consultant, and Felix
Pardo, 61, chairman of Dyckerhoff Inc., Glen Falls, N.Y.

 &HT;    Gators get crash course on Weber State
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Don't blame the Florida Gators for not knowing much
about Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe them, either, when they say they weren't expecting
to play third-seeded North Carolina in tonight's second-round West
Regional game of the NCAA Tournament in KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   That went awry, of course, when 14th-seeded Weber State knocked
off the big-name Tar Heels late Thursday night to send North
Carolina, which was making its 25th consecutive NCAA appearance, to
its first first-round loss since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say the Wildcats got the Gators' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches are big on watching film,'' Florida freshman guard
Teddy Dupay said. ``We'll probably be looking at film right up to
the time we go out to play.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Gators will be x's-and-o's prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become very, very educated on Weber State overnight,''
Florida coach Billy Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoops eductated, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the Gators
</P>
<P>
   (GT)please begin ital(GT) really
</P>
<P>
   (GT)please end ital(GT) know Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, probably, do you.
</P>
<P>
   A quiz is therefore in order. Answers are provided below.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Where is Weber State located?
</P>
<P>
   A) Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   B) Ogden, Utah
</P>
<P>
   C) Cheney, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   D) Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What is the correct pronunciation of the name of the school?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Which former NBA coach, who won a title with the Washington
Bullets and is fourth on the league's all-time victory list (six
ahead of the Heat's Pat Riley at the moment), coached at Weber
State for six years beginning with the 1962-63 season?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What's so big about the Big Sky Conference in which Weber
State plays?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: When was the last time Weber State played in the NCAA
Tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: How did the university get its name?
</P>
<P>
   (GT)center bullet(GT)
</P>
<P>
   1. Weber State is located in Ogden, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   2. The name of the school is spoken with a long first E, which
makes the pronunciation sould like Weeeber State.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dick Motta.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Big Sky houses teams from seven states stretching from
the U.S.-Canada border to the U.S.-Mexico border and from the
Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Wildcats beat Michigan State in the 1995 first round
before losing to Georgetwon in their next game.
</P>
<P>
   6. Legend has it that the area around Ogden, Utah, was a
fur-trapping territory in the 1820s and a man named John Weber
explored the river and valley now bearing his _ you ready? _
mispronounced name. As the name of the river was passed on over
subsequent years, it was frequently called the Weaver River by
trappers who had never seen the name in print. The subsquent result
was a translation to Weber, rhymes with Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   (GT)center bullet(GT)
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida locker room Saturday afternoon, most of the
Gators insisted they knew how to pronounce the name of their
upcoming opponent even before having it drilled into their heads
during those aforementioned film sessions. And all of them knew
Utah was Weber State's home, though they were mostly off on the
Ogden part of the location.
</P>
<P>
   Not, on the other hand and side of the country, that a lot of
the Weber State players knew Gainesville was Florida's specific
home.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is that a team such as Weber State becomes
something of a password for NCAA Tournament anonymity, and grows in
fan appeal after pulling off an upset of, say, a North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is always asking me where Weber State is,'' said
Wildcats junior guard Eddie Gill, who, by the way, didn't know,
either, when he was a Colorado prep star. ``Maybe they won't ask so
much now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill _ he's The Thrill _ played 40 minutes agaist North
Carolina, and scored 16 points in support of Harold Arceneaux _
he's The Show _ who rocked the Tar Heels for 36 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats also feature center Andy ``Big Bus'' Jensen, so
named because he catches a 5 a.m. ride to campus on such
transportation most days.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kind of storylines that develop when a Weber State
takes an unlikely step through the tournament bracket. There is a
momentum gathered in the process that won't, for example, manifest
itself for a 13th-seeded Oklahoma in the wake of its Friday victory
over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Oklahoma is too easily identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a Detroit or a Southwest Missouri State or a Creighton
or a Gonzaga. Or a Weber State, which gave KeyArena, in Jensen's
words, the feel ``of playing a home game'' while the Wildcats were
beating North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's Florida's turn to be big, bad wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why coaches in Donovan's position are so effusive with
their praise for a Cinderella opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really good, regardless of whether they've gotten
enough exposure'' he said. ``I think our guys respect them for what
they've done. You don't just show up, walk out there and beat North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the Gators do know that much about Weber State.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)  
 (af)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uncertainty about the Year 2000 computer problem has popped up
in the pits at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where 90-day
Eurodollar futures are traded by banks and other institutions
trying to protect themselves from swings in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the further away the period covered by a 90-day
Eurodollar futures contract, the higher the projected interest
rate, just as a loan due further in the future will usually carry a
higher rate because of the added risk.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, today, a June futures contract _ which embodies
the market's guess at what interest rates will be from mid-June to
mid-September _ would be priced to reflect a lower rate than a
September contract, which projects rates from mid-September through
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   One common exception to the price patterns occurs because banks
often need extra cash near year-end, especially over the New Year's
holiday, when the Federal Reserve is closed. Speculating that the
supply of money will be tight enough to force up interest rates
temporarily, traders take a ``butterfly'' position across the
September, December and March contracts.
</P>
<P>
   When turned into a chart, this phenomenon usually shows what
looks like gently angled ``wings'' from the September and March
contracts to the December ``body'' between them. That implies a
modest interest-rate increase the last day of the year. A typical
trading pattern was seen last Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   However, late last year, Year 2000 fever drove implied interest
rates way up for December 1999 futures, giving the butterfly
sharply angled wings. At its peak on Dec. 28, the contract price
indicated that traders expected a rate jump that was far larger
than normal at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By late February, the patterns were closer to normal. Since
then, the trend has edged toward slightly more nervousness. But
volume has dropped sharply, indicating that many traders have
decided that the butterfly spread this year is too unpredictable to
trade.
</P>
<P>
   How is the year-end butterfly turned into a calculation of
projected interest rates? The difference between the projected
December interest rate and the rate of the contracts on either side
of it, September and March, is seen by banks as a starting point
for estimating by how much market interest rates in the London
currency market, where the Eurodollars are traded, will exceed the
Federal Reserve overnight bank lending rate over the New Year's
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the three-day New Year's weekend beginning Dec. 31,
1999, is one-thirtieth of the 90-day contract period, bankers
simply multiply the difference by 30 to come up with a number that
roughly approximates how much the market expects interest rates to
jump at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders still expect rates to climb, but not nearly to the
extent that they did in December. &QL;

MOCK INVASION TAKES A DETOUR ABOVE SEA LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Giving in to the concerns for the safety of
whales and other marine life, the Marine Corps has called off a
mock assault by hovercraft on Monterey Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Six days of war games, scheduled to begin on Saturday in
Northern California, hit a snag when the California Coastal
Commission objected on Thursday to the shore landing by the
hovercraft in the bay, much of which is a marine sanctuary, about
90 miles south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey component of the games _ part of a $4.5 million
training exercise called ``Urban Warrior'' _ will go on as planned
at two military sites, the Naval Postgraduate School and the
Defense Language Institute, both in Monterey. But the 700 troops
and ``actors'' will now skip the beach and will be taken from ships
by helicopter to the staging sites. There, they will play out
scenarios meant to test warfare equipment and techniques used to
fight enemies in urban, seaside environments in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Delaplaine, a San Francisco analyst for the commission,
said the coastal watchdog group was particularly concerned about
the effect of the hovercraft, amphibious craft that ride at high
speed on a cushion of air, on migrating gray whales, now making
their annual trip north. The endangered southern sea otter and a
coastal bird, the snowy plover, were also thought be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   From 15,000 to 20,000 gray whales make the trip from Baja
California to Alaska every spring, Delaplaine said, and March 10 to
March 15 is the busiest week, with 20 whales an hour cruising by.
And while the male whales tend to take a straight northerly course
across the broad mouth of Monterey Bay, female whales and their
weeks-old offspring venture closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother and calf pairs tend to hug the coast where there
are canyons and food,'' Delaplaine said. ``They would see the
hovercraft and hear them and they would freak, with the potential
for the mothers and calves to become separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jenny Holbert, a Marine Corps spokeswoman for the Urban
Warrior program, said she was disappointed that the Coastal
Commission objected to the water approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hovercraft were a means to get the Marines to land,''
Holbert said, ``and the fact that we are changing our mode of
transportation does not affect the exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Once ashore in Monterey, 400 uniformed Marines and 300 trained
actors will simulate incidents involving the release of chemical
and biological weapons, as well as practice humanitarian,
peacekeeping and disaster relief missions. Following the mock
skirmishes, the teams will instruct local police, fire and
emergency personnel on incidents involving those weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey sites were chosen for the exercises after the
National Park Service last year denied the Marine Corps permission
to use the Presidio, a former Army post in San Francisco, with
shoreline both on San Francisco Bay and along the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Operations were quickly reorganized using Monterey, and a
recently closed naval air station and former naval hospital in
nearby Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hovercraft, Harrier jets and Cobra helicopters will
land at the closed Alameda Naval Air Station. As many as 1,200
Marines will then conduct four days of daytime exercises at the
abandoned hospital complex, with Marines simulating exercises to
deal with terrorists and other enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the San Francisco Bay area plan to protest the
mock invasion, saying that the hardware and troops will cause
environmental damage, with the hovercraft stirring up toxic
sediments in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   An Oakland city councilwoman, Nancy Nadel, said Friday that she
objected to the exercises themselves, and to the fact that the City
Council did not get to vote on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that this is really nothing but a blatant
recruitment exercise for the military,'' she said, adding that the
Marine Corps could have used one of its coastal bases and a
constructed ``set'' to practice warfare techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a public relations event that has nothing to do with
humanitarian exercises as has been claimed,'' she said. Ms. Nadel
said she also objected to the planned exhibits of military hardware
in Oakland and Alameda on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a needless glorification of the toys of war at a time
when we are working hard to minimize violence in our city,'' Ms.
Nadel said.
</P>
<P>
   Protests are planned to coincide with the hovercraft landings on
Monday morning and Monday afternoon at the office of Oakland's new
mayor, Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Jones, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Warfighting
Laboratory in Quantico, Va. _ where Urban Warrior was conceived and
planned _ described the games as real-world tests of warfare models
that the Marines expect to employ in future military encounters
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president sends the Marines in,'' Jones said, ``we'll
be feeding people, keeping the peace, and _ when necessary, like it
or not _ we'll be fighting people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous Urban Warrior exercises have been conducted in Chicago,
New York City, Charleston, S.C., and Jacksonville, Fla.

CAMBODIA REJECTS TRIBUNAL FOR KHMER ROUGE KILLINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of wavering, Cambodia Friday officially
rejected U.N. recommendations to convene a tribunal to try
surviving senior Khmer Rouge leaders, seeming to kill any chance of
an international court.
</P>
<P>
   Hor Nam Hong, Cambodia's foreign minister, flew to New York and
informed U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that Cambodia would hold
a trial of Khmer Rouge leaders in its own courts. He said he would
ask for international assistance to insure that the proceedings
would be ``fair and transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that what we are doing now is in conformity with
the convention on prevention and punishment of genocide,'' Hong
said in a later interview, pointing to the convention's article
that allows for a ``competent tribunal'' to be convened in the
country where the crimes occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have asked for international jurists to help us to ensure
it meets international standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The minister also announced that his government has rejected the
recommendation that a truth commission be convened to try lesser
figures in the Khmer Rouge movement.
</P>
<P>
   The official rejection was announced days before the secretary
general was scheduled to make public the recommendation of a panel
of experts that the United Nations convene a tribunal to try a
dozen or more senior Khmer Rouge leaders outside of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of coordinated steps, the Cambodian government first
captured Ta Mok, the last fugitive senior Khmer Rouge figure,
announced that he would be tried in a military court in Phnom Penh,
and then dispatched the foreign minister to the United Nations to
head off the building movement for an tribunal before the release
of the U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
   With this strong rejection by Prime Minister Hun Sen's
government, the Security Council is unlikely to approve a separate
international tribunal, according to diplomats. China already has
said it will oppose a tribunal if the Cambodians oppose it. France
has given Cambodians assurances it will assist in a Cambodian
military trial to ensure that it meets international standards,
according to diplomats close to the Cambodian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian trial would cover the period from 1975 to 1979
when the Khmer Rouge governed Cambodia, taking the lives of 2
million Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his government's stance with the secretary
general, Hor Nam Hong said the Cambodian courts would not restrict
themselves to the trial of Ta Mok alone. The court has the
authority to ``to try the whole Khmer Rouge organization and other
Khmer Rouge leaders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do not believe Ta Mok will accept full
responsibility for the genocide and that he will reveal other names
of people to be tried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting, the secretary general's spokesman said
Annan still had concerns about Cambodia's judicial system and its
ability to meet the minimal standards of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a show trial that brings neither truth nor
justice,'' said Stephen Heder, a professor and Cambodian scholar at
the School of Oriental and African Studies. ``At the end of the day
all the questions will be unanswered and all the suspicions left in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian foreign minister disagreed and said the Cambodian
courts planned to use the evidence amassed with the support of the
United States by the Cambodian Documentation Center in its quest
for a ``transparent and fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind his country's determination to hold the Khmer Rouge trial
in Cambodian courts, Hor Nam Hong said, is the lingering anger over
the international community's refusal to punish the Khmer Rouge
when they were overthrown by the Vietnamese in 1979 and throughout
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the peace negotiations that led to the 1991 Paris
Peace Accords,'' said Hor Nam Hong, who was a principal negotiator
for the Hun Sen government. ``The international community forced us
to accept the Khmer Rouge as equal partners and forbid the use of
the word `genocide' in any peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Khmer Rouge refused to comply with the 1992 U.N.
peacekeeping effort created by the 1991 accords, and it was only
with the capture of Ta Mok last week that the government put an end
to what remained of the Khmer Rouge movement. Pol Pot, the top
Khmer Rouge leader, died last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nuon Chea, his second-in-command, surrendered in December with a
fellow Khmer Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan, to the Cambodian
government. All told, at least 10,000 Khmer Rouge soldiers and
officials have defected to the government since the Paris accords
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to these defections, Hor Nam Hong said he told the
secretary general that the Cambodian government ``has achieved what
the United Nations peacekeeping plan and the Paris Peace Accords
failed to achieve'' and should be respected for accomplishing this
``national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general then reminded the Cambodian foreign
minister that Hun Sen requested help in 1997 to establish an
international tribunal and suggested that ``it would be good for
the image of Cambodia to cooperate with that recommendation,''
according to Hor Nam Hong.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreign minister said he demurred and underlined his
government's concern that a trial of all the senior Khmer Rouge
leaders by an international tribunal would upset the newly won
``reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. panel of experts recommended an international tribunal
precisely because the situation in Cambodia still was volatile and
the courts too inadequate to handle such a complex case. In his
1997 letter requesting the aid of the United Nations in setting up
a tribunal, Hun Sen said his country did not have the ``resources
or the expertise'' to conduct a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Hor Nam Hong said Friday that with the help of international
jurists, Cambodia could try the Khmer Rouge in the country where
``we were all their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pushed for an international
tribunal for the Khmer Rouge and supplied critical financial
support for the gathering of evidence against them. David Scheffer,
the U.S. ambassador for War Crimes, met with Hor Nam Hong Friday
afternoon but failed to persuade the Cambodian to approve of an
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we were grateful for the United States help,'' Hor
Nam Hong said, ``but we had to respond to the interests of the
Cambodian people and there is nothing else we can do.''

HERMAN WEISMAN, LEADER IN ZIONIST GROUPS, DIES AT 95  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ala.)   By ERIC PACE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herman L. Weisman, a lawyer who was prominent in American
Zionist organizations, died on Sunday at the Hospice of Palm Beach
County, Fla. He was 95 and lived in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman was president of the Zionist Organization of America
from 1970 to 1974, at a time when it had 110,000 members. His
earlier posts included chairman of the American Zionist Fund in the
mid-1950s, chairman of the Zionist Organization of America's
national executive committee from 1965 to 1969, and chairman of
that organization's national administrative board in 1969 and 1970.
He was also active in other Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and '30s, he held New York state prosecutorial
positions, and from 1938 to 1940, he was legal assistant to John
Harlan Amen, the special assistant state attorney general, in
Amen's investigation of law enforcement in Brooklyn. Weisman was
active in the prosecution of Alexander R. Baldwin, staff assistant
to District Attorney William F.X. Geoghan of Brooklyn. Baldwin was
acquitted of a bribery charge in 1939, but his license to practice
law was later revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman was born in Russia but was brought to New York as an
infant in 1906. He received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in
1924 from City College, where he was a captain of the debating
team, and his law degree in 1927 from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   During the time he had a private law practice in New York, he
counted Eleanor Roosevelt among his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman is survived by his wife, Jeannette Cobey Weisman of West
Palm Beach, Fla.; three sons, Edward, of North Palm Beach, Fla.,
Robert, of Lantana, Fla., and Matthew, of Weston, Mass.; a sister,
Nettie Kramer of Birmingham, Ala.; eight grandchildren; and four
great-grandchildren.

FBI PROBED LATE SPEAKER O'NEILL FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an effort that spanned 20 months and a dozen
states and used electronically wired informants, the FBI conducted
an exhaustive political-corruption probe of the late House Speaker
Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. from 1979 to 1981 and concluded he had done
no wrong, newly released records show.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the previously unreported FBI investigation were
released by the bureau to the Globe Friday under the US Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption probe was conducted under the tightest secrecy at
a time when the House speaker was playing a major role in national
affairs as an ally of President Jimmy Carter and, later, a foe of
President Ronald Reagan. Records were kept in a ``Special File
Room'' at FBI headquarters under the code names ``Phoenix Bird''
and ``Quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, and James A.
Baker III, Reagan's chief of staff, all said in interviews over the
last year that they did not recall knowing of the FBI
investigation, harboring any doubts about O'Neill's honesty, or
talking to the speaker about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher O'Neill, son of the the late speaker, said his
father was aware of the FBI probe while it was being conducted, and
it was ``a quite uncomfortable experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was quite relieved when it was over, though he did
not have any doubts he would be vindicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Rowan, a former aide to the speaker whose affairs were
also scrutinized by the FBI during the probe, said he had not known
of the bureau's extensive effort but was pleased with its ultimate
conclusion. ``It's always nice when you haven't done anything,''
Rowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents, prompted by the testimony of a ``reliable
confidential source,'' pursued allegations that O'Neill had used
his political clout to win some $3 million in federal loans and
loan guarantees for projects in which he and his associates had
financial interests. For a time, the FBI suspected that O'Neill had
received $65,000 in kickbacks for his help.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation reached its peak in February 1981, when the
FBI conducted some 25 interviews in a burst of activity, only to
conclude that ``all interviews conducted met with negative results
regarding allegations concerning Congressman O'Neill and the misuse
of his office,'' according to the FBI records.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to take the case to a grand jury were called off, and on
March 30, 1981, the Justice Department attorney supervising the
probe concluded that ``there seems no present basis for continuing
the FBI special (investigation) on Speaker O'Neill predicated on
presently known facts.'' The bureau closed its investigation on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the investigation were four government loans or
loan guarantees worth almost $3 million that were given to a
Jamaica Plain psychiatric hospital, a Middleton restaurant, and an
Attleboro nursing home in which O'Neill or Rowan had an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the federal loan guarantees _ made in 1972 to the
Glenside Hospital in Jamaica Plain and in 1971 to the Bristol
Nursing Home in Attleboro _ were the subject of news reports by The
New York Times, the Boston Herald, WBZ-TV, and the Globe in 1977
and 1978. The US Small Business Administration launched its own
probe of the nursing home loan in 1978. But it was not until the
confidential source got the FBI's attention in August 1979 that the
bureau began to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Source . . . advises . . . O'Neill has received payoffs for
his assistance in obtaining these loans,'' the FBI investigators
wrote. In an August 1979 memo, the FBI's Washington field office
requested permission from FBI headquarters to outfit its source
with a transmitter and recording device and to record conversations
with O'Neill and associates.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI informant recorded three hours of conversations with
individuals whose names have been redacted in the files released by
the bureau. From those conversations, the bureau suspected that one
or more of O'Neill's associates was involved in some unspecified
``illegal acts'' on behalf of the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In ``highly sensitive'' reports to the FBI director's office,
the field agents theorized that O'Neill and his fellow investors in
the Jamaica Plain hospital had misled federal officials about the
ultimate use and beneficiaries of the funds when they applied for a
$1.1 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Housing and
Urban Development and a $1.6 million lease guarantee from the Small
Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agents kept the director's office informed, there
was no indication that any White House officials were consulted on
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The agents suspected that O'Neill then used his influence to get
the federal guarantees, boosting the value of the hospital's assets
at a time when he and his fellow investors were ready to sell the
property. The sale went through, and O'Neill acknowledged on his
congressional financial disclosure forms that he made $108,000 on
the deal. The FBI, however, initially valued O'Neill's interest at
$43,000 and suspected that the other $65,000 was a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of two years, the FBI concluded that the Glenside
probe had ``ended with negative results.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol Nursing Home in Attleboro and the Country Squire Inn
in Middleton each received Small Business Administration loans or
loan guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   SBA investigators had concluded that the application for the
nursing home had contained ``false statements as to the
ownership,'' and complained to the FBI that O'Neill's lawyers had
challenged and forced changes in their final report. But they also
told the FBI they ``had no information that O'Neill limited or
applied pressure to inhibit the results of the investigation.'' An
IRS agent audited the nursing home's returns and examined O'Neill's
income tax return to verify that he had reported income from the
nursing home, and no wrongdoing was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill did not have an interest in the Country Squire Inn, but
Rowan did. The FBI investigation of O'Neill spun off a separate,
Boston-based arson probe in 1981 after the restaurant burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Like most raw FBI files, the ``Phoenix Bird'' records included
unsubstantiated charges _ in this case rumors of organized crime
connections that sent FBI investigators to work in Louisiana,
Florida, and Nevada _ and moments of low comedy, as in the report
of one woman the agents sought to interview, who told the FBI she
was taking a bath and didn't want to talk to them, anyway.

TREASURY LOSSES WON'T TOP $20 MILLION, MASS. TELLS FINANCIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's office estimates
that losses from the state treasury scandal will likely not exceed
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator gave the forecast quietly to jittery Wall
Street investment bankers Tuesday while they were considering
buying $250 million in state bonds. Several firms involved in the
otherwise routine sale wanted to know just how bad the scheme
involving the treasury's Unpaid Check Fund might get before closing
on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators allege that nearly $9 million has been stolen from
the fund, which holds unclaimed state payments. Four men, including
two treasury workers, have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has said he expects his investigation to turn up more
losses. The estimated $20 million figure is based on the
investigation so far, according to Brian Heffron, a spokesman for
the attorney general. The actual amount stolen from the treasury
could be much higher, but prosecutors believe some money could be
recovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has already recovered $6.5 million allegedly stolen
from the account. Another $2.4 million is missing and may be gone
for good, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office was asked: `Do we believe that the loss to the
state will exceed $20 million?' And we have said, based on what we
know at this point. . .it would be remote,'' Heffron said. ``But
again, it's based on what we've been able to review so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, which is
responsible for reconciling the state's books, grew nervous late
last week that poor accounting and the alleged thefts could affect
the accuracy of their figures, which investors consult when buying
state debt.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banking firms involved in the sale also voiced
concern to Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, who sought an answer from
Reilly's office. She got one Tuesday, and the deal closed that
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a discrepancy of up to $20 million (in the state
coffers) that's considered to be a material omission of fact on the
official statement,'' O'Brien said. ``So we've actually had to work
with the attorney general's office to reassure them that there will
not be more than $20 million missing because that will have an
impact on how we sell our bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The word back from Reilly in a March 9 letter was short,
although bound up in legal language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the actual knowledge acquired by the office of the
Attorney General in its review to date of matters related to the
operation of the office of the treasurer, we believe the likelihood
of loss by the Commonwealth in excess of $20 million is remote,''
the letter, addressed to Deloitte &AMP; Touche, said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Unpaid Check Fund, John F. Trischitta, was
arrested last month for his part in the alleged theft of $6.5
million from the fund along with outsider, Martin Robbins, who is
accused of forging documents to siphon the money into an escrow
account at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   A bank employee notified the attorney general when Robbins later
tried to withdraw those funds, an act that launched the
investigation. That $6.5 million has since been returned to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta's boss, deputy treasurer Robert E. Foley and another
outsider, Thomas Ciliberto, were arrested shortly after, charged
with bilking $2.4 million from the same account.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they don't know if those funds will ever be
returned.

ANALYSTS FORESEE BIDDING WAR OVER IOWA SEED CORN COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Switzerland)   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the world's largest producer of
seed corn, and DuPont Co. announced Friday that they were
discussing a possible combination, raising the prospect of a
bidding war in the agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the discussions was seen by some analysts as
an indication that Pioneer is eager for a deal _ either with DuPont
or with another company. Neither Pioneer nor DuPont would say
anything more than that they were talking.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the disclosure of the talks could prompt rival
bids for Pioneer from several of the world's largest producers of
agricultural products _ notably the Swiss giant Novartis _ if there
was not another bid already on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement about DuPont and Pioneer came out of left
field,'' said Robert F. Goldberg, an executive vice president of
the research firm New Vernon Associates. ``What could be happening
is that there is another company making overtures at Pioneer, and
DuPont wants to bail out its shareholders as a white knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pioneer, which had reached a 52-week low on March 3,
soared 40 percent, or $9.8125, Friday to close at $34.3125.
DuPont's stock dropped 37.5 cents to close at $57.75.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday that several components of the disclosure
were puzzling. Several pondered why Pioneer and DuPont appeared to
be in such a rush to make a deal, and why the two companies would
want to increase their already close association.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., owns 20 percent of Pioneer,
which is based in Des Moines, Iowa. The two companies are also
partners in a joint crop biotechnology venture, Optimum Quality
Grains. They reached an agreement in 1997 that DuPont would not
increase its position in Pioneer for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year agreement can, of course, be altered. But then there
is the matter of how a deal may be done. DuPont has stated that it
does not want to dilute its stock or hurt earnings in making any
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   If DuPont acquires Pioneer, a company roughly one-twelfth its
size, the company will have to overcome several obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, DuPont announced that it would establish a tracking
stock to allow investors to bet on the performance of one part of
the company. DuPont had intended to use the tracking stock to make
acquisitions, primarily in pharmaceuticals and in agribusinesses.
</P>
<P>
   Its interest in pharmaceuticals and agribusiness has also led
DuPont to discuss a possible merger with Monsanto, a large
biotechnology and seed company and the parent of the drug maker
G.D. Searle, executives who have been briefed on the negotiations
have said.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont had known about the negotiations with Pioneer when it
announced its plans for a tracking stock, analysts said. Yet the
stock will not be established until later this year, well after any
deal with Pioneer should be solidified.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, DuPont may have little choice but to pay cash for
Pioneer. Since DuPont owns a 20 percent stake in Pioneer, it will
face a huge tax bill should it pursue a cash deal.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont may face other hurdles. The founder of Pioneer, Henry
Agard Wallace, left the family fortune to his two children, Jean
Wallace Douglas and Robert B. Wallace. The two siblings own some 14
percent of Pioneer's stock, a stake that was valued at $1.15
billion after Friday's close. Analysts believed the Wallaces were
unlikely to accept a cash proposal for fear of the heavy tax bill
that would go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages for Mrs. Douglas and Wallace were not
returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Pioneer came to DuPont with these discussions,'' said
John McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential Securities.
``That's the only way to explain the rush of it. It will be
interesting now which companies are going to be able to take a
bid.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont disclosed the talks on the same day it announced steps to
bolster earnings. It will reduce capital spending 13 percent this
year, to $2 billion, and it plans to overhaul its polyester unit.

EX-TREASURY AIDE HAD LINK TO BANKRUPT ACCOUNTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Robert E. Foley, the former deputy treasurer accused of
embezzling $2.4 million from the state, had a close business
relationship with a Wayland accountant who declared bankruptcy
after being ordered to return $350,000 he allegedly stole from a
Newton Centre widow.
</P>
<P>
   Foley and the accountant, Louis J. Pellegrine Jr., operated an
accounting business called Foley &AMP; Pellegrine out of Foley's Natick
offices _ where Foley ran several other business ventures _ for
about four years beginning in the spring of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was sued by BayBank in 1991 after Pellegrine refused to
repay a $65,000 loan that Foley had guaranteed. Foley was also
named as a defendant in the widow's suit against Pellegrine.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1990, the widow, Louise A. Andrews, sued Pellegrine,
alleging he had stolen money she gave him to invest after her
husband Thomas died in January 1986. Court records show Foley was
dismissed as a codefendant in Andrews's suit by stating that ``at
the time of service of the Summons upon him,'' he had none of
Pellegrine's assets under his control.
</P>
<P>
   According to Middlesex Superior Court files, Pellegrine, who had
done the couple's tax returns since 1976, promised the widow that
he could make her 15 percent a year if she gave him $350,000 and
agreed not to touch it for three years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, Andrews wanted to withdraw $1,500 a month for living
expenses. Pellegrine allegedly refused to pay or return the money,
saying, ``I don't have the money. You can sue me if you want, but I
will just go bankrupt,'' according to court filings by Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews implored him to return the money. ``I believed you and
trusted you completely, Louie,'' the widow wrote him in February
1990. ``I have to have my money now to live on and to pay my bills.
I can't stand this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Pellegrine's employees, Harlan Dunn, said in an affidavit
in the case he saw ``numerous accounting irregularities'' at
Pellegrine's business. Dunn said Pellegrine told him he invested
the widow's money ``in an extremely high-risk Israeli real estate
venture.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1990, Superior Court Judge Thomas E. Connolly
ordered Pellegrine to repay the widow $362,000 plus $186,767 in
interest. Pellegrine filed for bankruptcy about a month later.
</P>
<P>
   However, Andrews's attorney, Peter B. McGlynn, successfully
petitioned to block Pellegrine from having his debt to Andrews
dissolved as part of the bankruptcy. Last July, after Pellegrine
had returned only a few thousand dollars, Andrews re-sued
Pellegrine in Middlesex Superior Court to get back more than
$700,000, including interest.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrine two years ago sold his Wayland house at far below its
assessed value to Richard D. Smith Jr., who was the leasing agent
and part owner of the building on Route 30 where Foley had his
office. Pellegrine, who court records show has a $600,000 Florida
home in his wife Margaret's name, is renting back the Cottage Road
home from Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews has an attachment on the Wayland house, and Friday,
Andrews's attorney, Robert S. Sinsheimer, went to court in an
attempt to void the sale to Smith as a way to get at least some of
her money back. The judge is reviewing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrine and Foley could not be reached for comment. Foley's
lawyer, Gary Meyers, who represented Foley in both lawsuits
involving his ties to Pellegrine, said he recalled no details about
their business relationship. Pellegrine's attorney, Lawrence J.
Casey, did not return a call.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pellegrine told the Globe he had run into financial
difficulties and could not repay Andrews because his investment in
the Ashland Market Basket Plaza that Foley developed in 1989-1991
had ``gone bad.'' The size and nature of Pellegrine's purported
investment in the mall could not be determined Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Through her attorney, Andrews said Pellegrine had told her one
reason he could not pay her back was because Foley owed him
$200,000 that Foley had taken out of their accounting business.
</P>
<P>
   Records at Worcester Superior Court show Foley personally
guaranteed two loans totaling $65,000 that BayBank made Pellegrine
in 1989. After Pellegrine defaulted on the payments, BayBank, now
BankBoston, sued both men in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1992, BayBank won a $58,339 judgment against Foley.
Court papers indicate Foley paid off some or all of the judgment
against him by selling an Ashland condominium that had been
attached by the bank.

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

A VIRGINIA TOWN'S BOOM IS NOT ALL IT HOPED FOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Va. _ For rural Pulaski County, it was like a dream come
true: Volvo, the automobile maker, decided last year to expand its
truck-making plant here, a plan that would double the size of the
work force to 2,500 and add an estimated 1,200 jobs in related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of economic boon that county leaders had been
striving for through an aggressive program of state and local tax
incentives to attract new businesses. Not that Pulaski County was
desperate for such growth.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the southwestern corner of Virginia, the county
stands out as a pocket of economic diversity. Rolling hills of
farmland and forests surround busy factories that have made
textiles, furniture and munitions for almost a century. But the
more vigorous the growth, the better, county officials have long
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, some of them, along with other county residents,
are wondering whether an old saw _ be careful what you wish for _
might apply to them. While a plant expansion is something other
rural counties love to contemplate, people in Pulaski County are
grappling with the flip side of a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's expansion is certain to increase the county's
population, 34,000, planners say, leading some officials to
question the possible ill-effects on businesses, schools and the
overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, there is extremely good news here, with many
more options locally so people don't have to leave the region to
get good paying jobs,'' said David A. Cox, the county's
superintendent of public schools. ``But there are going to be some
growing pains we have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Virginia ranked as one of the leading states in new
jobs, with 90,000, and one of the lowest in unemployment, with a
rate of 2.7 percent. State officials say so many technology
companies have recently opened or expanded that they have openings
in 25,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski County lies in a region that joined the economic parade
only recently, largely through the state grants and tax incentives.
Volvo expanded in Pulaski after the state offered a tax package
worth $56 million over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners of other businesses worry that the Volvo
expansion could hurt them by luring away their best workers. Jobs
at the Volvo plant can pay more than $40,000 a year, a handsome
income in a county where the Census Bureau puts the median value of
a house at $51,400, well below the national median, $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   The business owners are typically able to pay much less than
Volvo and offer fewer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll take people from us,'' said David B.
Spangler, president and chief executive of Jefferson Mills, a
textile plant that employs 320 people in the town of Pulaski.
``They already have, and they'll take my younger and better people.
Anybody they take will start earning twice as much as we pay after
we've trained them.''
</P>
<P>
   Spangler said he was not sure where he might find replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Tim D. Thompson, vice president of a company that makes church
pews, says that when he needs new workers, he walks around downtown
Pulaski and hires men off the street.
</P>
<P>
   But county officials expect some new workers to move into
Pulaski County, a prospect certain to accelerate a rise in housing
costs that began about a year ago, around the time the Volvo
expansion was announced. Volvo has already hired about 500 workers
and the rest are to be phased in over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne McGlothlin, the owner of a Century 21 real estate agency,
said a chronic shortage of housing listings in the county, combined
with the rising demand, had already pushed up the sale price of
houses by 47 percent in the last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is more likely to hurt hourly workers than
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already a housing shortage,'' said Gerald E. Bolen, a
salesman in the Century 21 office. ``We're seeing more new
construction, but for hourly people, it takes two incomes to move
into a house in the $175,000 range.''
</P>
<P>
   Spangler predicted that the lack of affordable housing could
become a major impediment for companies like his trying to recruit
new workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to build houses here that cost less than $60,000 and
that's even pushing it for a worker making $20,000,'' he said.
``What they ought to be thinking about, maybe, is trailer parks.
Nothing wrong with trailer parks.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is watching the influx more closely than Cox, the schools
superintendent. This year, 5,075 children in the county attend
eight elementary schools, two middle schools and the high school.
The overall student-to-teacher ratio is a comfortable 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the county passed a $44.5 million plan to
renovate every school over the next 10 years. But Cox said that as
few as 400 children added to the system would cause overcrowding
that could lead to a decline in test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks are talking about this and what it means,'' he
said of the county's job creation. ``We just don't know yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders are also grappling with how to spruce up the town
of Pulaski, the largest in the county, with about 10,000 residents.
For now, Pulaski has little to offer in way of shopping,
restaurants and recreation; and Dublin, with a population of about
2,000, even less.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day in Pulaski, more stores along Main Street, the
retail center, are closed than open, and empty sidewalks suggest
that none is especially thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca English, the owner of MimiAnne's Gourmet Coffee Shop, is
president of the Pulaski Downtown Merchants' Association, which has
taken on a number of projects to pump new life into the town,
including an effort to turn an abandoned roller-skating rink into a
fine arts center and an old movie theater into a performing arts
center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. English said progress was slow because local residents had
long grown accustomed to seeking culture, entertainment and
shopping a short drive away in the larger towns of Radford,
Blacksburg and Christiansburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the cusp of something really exciting if we can get
all the pieces together,'' she said. ``If what is scheduled to
happen happens, this town can be transformed.''

FBI PROBED LATE SPEAKER O'NEILL FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an effort that spanned 20 months and a dozen
states and used electronically wired informants, the FBI conducted
an exhaustive political-corruption probe of the late House Speaker
Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. from 1979 to 1981 and concluded he had done
no wrong, newly released records show.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the previously unreported FBI investigation were
released by the bureau to the Globe Friday under the US Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption probe was conducted under the tightest secrecy at
a time when the House speaker was playing a major role in national
affairs as an ally of President Jimmy Carter and, later, a foe of
President Ronald Reagan. Records were kept in a ``Special File
Room'' at FBI headquarters under the code names ``Phoenix Bird''
and ``Quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, and James A.
Baker III, Reagan's chief of staff, all said in interviews over the
last year that they did not recall knowing of the FBI
investigation, harboring any doubts about O'Neill's honesty, or
talking to the speaker about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher O'Neill, son of the the late speaker, said his
father was aware of the FBI probe while it was being conducted, and
it was ``a quite uncomfortable experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was quite relieved when it was over, though he did
not have any doubts he would be vindicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Rowan, a former aide to the speaker whose affairs were
also scrutinized by the FBI during the probe, said he had not known
of the bureau's extensive effort but was pleased with its ultimate
conclusion. ``It's always nice when you haven't done anything,''
Rowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents, prompted by the testimony of a ``reliable
confidential source,'' pursued allegations that O'Neill had used
his political clout to win some $3 million in federal loans and
loan guarantees for projects in which he and his associates had
financial interests. For a time, the FBI suspected that O'Neill had
received $65,000 in kickbacks for his help.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation reached its peak in February 1981, when the
FBI conducted some 25 interviews in a burst of activity, only to
conclude that ``all interviews conducted met with negative results
regarding allegations concerning Congressman O'Neill and the misuse
of his office,'' according to the FBI records.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to take the case to a grand jury were called off, and on
March 30, 1981, the Justice Department attorney supervising the
probe concluded that ``there seems no present basis for continuing
the FBI special (investigation) on Speaker O'Neill predicated on
presently known facts.'' The bureau closed its investigation on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the investigation were four government loans or
loan guarantees worth almost $3 million that were given to a
Jamaica Plain psychiatric hospital, a Middleton restaurant, and an
Attleboro nursing home in which O'Neill or Rowan had an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the federal loan guarantees _ made in 1972 to the
Glenside Hospital in Jamaica Plain and in 1971 to the Bristol
Nursing Home in Attleboro _ were the subject of news reports by The
New York Times, the Boston Herald, WBZ-TV, and the Globe in 1977
and 1978. The US Small Business Administration launched its own
probe of the nursing home loan in 1978. But it was not until the
confidential source got the FBI's attention in August 1979 that the
bureau began to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Source . . . advises . . . O'Neill has received payoffs for
his assistance in obtaining these loans,'' the FBI investigators
wrote. In an August 1979 memo, the FBI's Washington field office
requested permission from FBI headquarters to outfit its source
with a transmitter and recording device and to record conversations
with O'Neill and associates.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI informant recorded three hours of conversations with
individuals whose names have been redacted in the files released by
the bureau. From those conversations, the bureau suspected that one
or more of O'Neill's associates was involved in some unspecified
``illegal acts'' on behalf of the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In ``highly sensitive'' reports to the FBI director's office,
the field agents theorized that O'Neill and his fellow investors in
the Jamaica Plain hospital had misled federal officials about the
ultimate use and beneficiaries of the funds when they applied for a
$1.1 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Housing and
Urban Development and a $1.6 million lease guarantee from the Small
Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agents kept the director's office informed, there
was no indication that any White House officials were consulted on
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The agents suspected that O'Neill then used his influence to get
the federal guarantees, boosting the value of the hospital's assets
at a time when he and his fellow investors were ready to sell the
property. The sale went through, and O'Neill acknowledged on his
congressional financial disclosure forms that he made $108,000 on
the deal. The FBI, however, initially valued O'Neill's interest at
$43,000 and suspected that the other $65,000 was a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of two years, the FBI concluded that the Glenside
probe had ``ended with negative results.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol Nursing Home in Attleboro and the Country Squire Inn
in Middleton each received Small Business Administration loans or
loan guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   SBA investigators had concluded that the application for the
nursing home had contained ``false statements as to the
ownership,'' and complained to the FBI that O'Neill's lawyers had
challenged and forced changes in their final report. But they also
told the FBI they ``had no information that O'Neill limited or
applied pressure to inhibit the results of the investigation.'' An
IRS agent audited the nursing home's returns and examined O'Neill's
income tax return to verify that he had reported income from the
nursing home, and no wrongdoing was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill did not have an interest in the Country Squire Inn, but
Rowan did. The FBI investigation of O'Neill spun off a separate,
Boston-based arson probe in 1981 after the restaurant burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Like most raw FBI files, the ``Phoenix Bird'' records included
unsubstantiated charges _ in this case rumors of organized crime
connections that sent FBI investigators to work in Louisiana,
Florida, and Nevada _ and moments of low comedy, as in the report
of one woman the agents sought to interview, who told the FBI she
was taking a bath and didn't want to talk to them, anyway.

A PROFESSOR IN NANJING TAKES UP JEWISH STUDIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: China , Israel, Utah, Ill., Mass.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a time when advances in communication and an
increase in political freedom have eroded international boundaries,
scholars have an ever-greater opportunity for closer attention to
religions and places that might once have seemed vastly distant.
</P>
<P>
   So, should it be surprising that a Center for Judaic Studies has
sprung up in a university in central China? Or that Brigham Young
University, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, has begun publishing a series of bilingual (English and
Arabic) editions of classic Islamic philosophical texts?
</P>
<P>
   The center in China is the work of Xu Xin, a professor at
Nanjing University, in the city of that name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I tasted it, I really fell in love with Jewish history,''
Xu said in an interview in New York this week, where he had spent a
few days visiting Yeshiva University, and before he was to go
lecture at Park East Synagogue about the history of Jews in China
in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   How Xu discovered Jewish history makes an interesting story in
itself, especially considering that nearly all of China's Jews
emigrated before the 1949 Communist revolution, about the time he
was born.
</P>
<P>
   Xu began teaching English-language literature in Nanjing in the
late 1970s, focusing on the work of post-World War II writers.
``Post-war writers were not known in China, so it was our job to
introduce them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His curriculum included Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, Isaac
Bashevis Singer. That they were Jewish tickled Xu's intellectual
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to do research to get the background to their
stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His interest picked up a decade ago, when he spent two years
teaching at Chicago State University. An American family took him
to synagogue services and to a bar mitzvah, Xu said. He read widely
on Jewish subjects and, before returning to China, visited Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, with help from grants, Xu has edited a one-volume
Chinese edition of an encyclopedia of Judaism, arranged an exhibit
on the Holocaust in Nanjing and returned to Israel to study Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   As a visiting scholar at Harvard University's Center of Jewish
Studies in 1996, Xu was interviewed by the Harvard University
Gazette, which said his academic writing ``includes an essay
comparing the figure of the schlemiel in Jewish literature with the
Chinese figure of the wise fool.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Xu lectured in Israel and was the subject of a profile
in The Jerusalem Post's magazine, which said his interest in
Israeli writers had led him to translate some short stories from
Hebrew into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Xu's visit to Yeshiva came through a program in international
relations with which Rabbi Arthur Schneier, Park East Synagogue's
spiritual leader, is associated. The rabbi has visited China
several times, going last year to Shanghai, which sheltered
thousands of European Jews in World War II, to donate a Torah
scroll to its historic synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Schneier said that he had met an academic expert in Judaism in
Shanghai but believed that Xu had created something unique in
Nanjing. ``There's no other university in all of China that has a
Jewish studies department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Xu said he had found considerable interest among his students in
learning Jewish history. He seemed to want to get the word out in
the West about how Jews had fared in China. ``I believe the Jewish
experience in China gives a good reputation to the Chinese, because
we never persecuted them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Brigham Young project, the books the university is
publishing in its Islamic Translation Series, are meant to help
foster a greater understanding of the Muslim world, said Daniel C.
Peterson, an associate professor of Islamic studies who is also
director of the university's Center for the Preservation of Ancient
Religious Texts.
</P>
<P>
   That the work is being sponsored by a Mormon institution,
Peterson said, is ``a little bit of a striking conjunction, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   The first book in the series to be published is ``The
Incoherence of the Philosophers,'' an important work by the
11th-century Persian theologian and mystic Abu Hamid al-Ghazali.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, Peterson said, the book discusses the question of
whether human reason can supplant divine revelation. He has used
the work in philosophical discussions among his own students. ``The
issues he's talking about are still live issues,'' Peterson said.

Lewis knows his time is now
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ The bold prediction, a deviation from the normal manner
in which Evander Holyfield approaches an upcoming fight, had
floored Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis responded the way a proper English gentleman should.
Without bravado, Lewis simply called Holyfield's third-round
knockout prediction ``preposterous'' and then questioned Friday
whether the three-time heavyweight champion had gone 'round the
bend.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much at stake for Lewis to go berserk and perhaps
lose focus on the eve of their heavyweight title unification bout
at a sold-out Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, is trying
to become the first resident of Great Britain to hold the unified
title since Ruby Rob Fitzsimmons in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Quite important, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   It is critical, too, that he could upset the plans of Holyfield
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But this fight, more than any of the previous 35 Lewis has waged
(losing only once), is most important because it could validate his
place among the great heavyweight champions past and present.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my time,'' Lewis said. ``There's a reason for
everything and the reasons that I wasn't able to put my stamp on
things before, whether it was politics or whatever, now it has
finally come time to make my mark and create history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a defining fight for Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   But as his trainer, Emanuel Steward, has said, ``If Lennox loses
this fight, he'll just be another guy from England with
dreadlocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield (36-3, 25 knockouts), the World Boxing
Association/International Boxing Federation champion, will earn $20
million for facing Lewis (34-1, 27 KOs), who will receive $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   While Holyfield-Lewis is the main event, two other world title
bouts are on the pay-per-view card, which gets under way at 7:30
p.m. CST. The main event is expected to start at approximately 10
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Newly crowned IBF junior-middleweight champion Fernando Vargas
(15-0, 15 KOs) of Oxnard, Calif., defends against Howard Clarke
(26-10-2, 8 KOs) of West Ham, England, in the top bout on the
undercard.
</P>
<P>
   And James Page (23-3, 18 KOs) of Pittsburg, Calif., puts his WBA
welterweight championship on the line against Sam Garr (25-2, 23
KOs) of Stone Mountain, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a title unification bout in the heavyweight
division since 1987 when Mike Tyson beat Tony Tucker, then the
crown jewel of the now-defunct Houston Boxing Association, to add
the IBF title to the WBA and WBC championships he already owned.
</P>
<P>
   And there hasn't been a fight in Madison Square Garden to
generate the interest and excitement of Holyfield-Lewis since
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier fought the first time 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot riding on the fight for Lewis, but there is
tremendous pressure on Holyfield, too.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Holyfield also wants to solidify his place in history
beyond joining Ali as the only three-time world heavyweight
titlists.
</P>
<P>
   There have been hints that should he win, Holyfield wouldn't
wait around for another fight with Mike Tyson, potentially the
biggest money-maker available to him. Nor would he be satisfied to
bide his time taking on a succession of pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, rumor has it that if he fulfills his dream of once more
owning the undisputed championship, Holyfield would fight two or
three more times and then retire to his spacious home outside
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That is of little consequence to Lewis. Although he often has
fought in the United States over the last seven years, there always
has been questions about his courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amusing in one sense, and I find it offensive in
another sense,'' he said. ``How dare anybody question my heart. I
have never shown anybody I don't have heart. You have to have heart
in the first place to step into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield does not have the monopoly on heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Holyfield, said Lewis, would erase the stigma forever.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's prediction, Lewis has said, is an indication of the
``soft'' fight expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting enough respect. That just pushes me to win,''
Lewis said. ``I'm ready. I don't like waiting around. I want to get
in the ring. I will go into the ring with one belt, but I'm coming
out with three.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)  
 (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Three years ago, when consumers complained
about the smell of its bleach, the Clorox Co. cut the chlorine odor
by adding floral scents _ and helped increase its share of the
American bleach market to a remarkable 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a competitor introduced a cleaning spray
intended for daily use in the shower, Clorox unabashedly copied it
_ but used a clear bottle with pastel labeling, a contrast to the
rival's industrial-looking container. More appealing packaging, the
company figured, would prompt consumers to leave the bottle near
the shower instead of under the sink, increasing the likelihood
that they would use it each day. The product, Tilex Fresh Shower,
quickly became a big seller. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian fiddling with pedestrian products, many a
metal-bending or electron-zapping executive might sniff. But not a
smart investor. Clorox's stock has shot up 372 percent the last
five years _ 45 percent the last year alone. That has far outpaced
the market, outgunned industry giants like Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Colgate-Palmolive and proved to stock snobs that there is gold in
the most everyday goods.
</P>
<P>
   And this year? Well, it's time for Clorox to prove itself all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring the First Brands Corp. of Danbury, Conn. _ maker of
familiar products like Glad bags, Scoop Away cat box filler and STP
motor oil additive _ Clorox has bought a company that increases its
size by almost 50 percent but that resembles the vapid Clorox that
G. Craig Sullivan took over seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Clorox, which competitors had mostly dismissed as
knowing how to sell bleach but not much else, was stuck with a
complacent management and a tired product line. Its profits were
falling, and its stockholders were skittish.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who studied accounting, began his career selling cake
mix in Brooklyn for P&AMP;G and was hardly a golden boy. His own mother
once suggested he might not make it in sales and urged him to
consider a new line of work. Investors reacted to his appointment
by knocking the stock down 5 percent in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   They soon had a change of heart. First, Sullivan cut managers he
judged to be out of step with the new marching orders. ``When
you've got 25 or 30 years of white-rat training, sometimes it's
hard to change, so we just decided for them that maybe they ought
to do something else,'' he said. Half the management team left.
</P>
<P>
   Then he dumped money-losing operations like bottled water and
restaurant equipment, bought grime-fighting brands like Lestoil
cleaner and S.O.S scrubbing pads that were more in line with
Clorox's core business. And he stepped up marketing for existing
brands like Pine-Sol and Formula 409 cleansers.
</P>
<P>
   The results have made the one-time Wall Street wallflower the
life of the party: from the time that Sullivan took over through
the end of last year, Clorox's revenues increased by 76 percent to
$2.7 billion, while profits shot up 200 percent, to $298 million.
The company's market capitalization in that time rose from $2.5
billion to $10 billion. Clorox shares closed at $125.50 on Friday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But with the purchase of First Brands for $2 billion _ a deal
that closed in January _ some investors are wondering whether
Clorox has overextended itself. The deal, the largest in Clorox's
86-year history, increases its revenue to a projected $3.95
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Clorox of old, First Brands had struggled with a
number of stalled or fading products. Slowing retail sales resulted
in disappointing earnings for the company last year. So some
analysts and investors who have been enthusiastic about Clorox
wonder whether the growth of the 1990s can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difficulty will be how life is different under the
auspices of Clorox,'' said Andrew Shore, an analyst who follows the
company for Paine Webber. ``First Brands may have an initial good
boost from cutting costs and new advertising and new products, but
I think Clorox has to make First Brands a much better
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Sullivan said, noting that a key element of
Clorox's growth strategy has been to dust off brands that had lost
their luster under previous owners. That, he said, is what made
products like S.O.S and Armor All car-care products such good fits.
``With all due respect,'' Sullivan said, ``those companies, and I
think they would admit it themselves, were not consumer
brand-focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan says he has the formula to keep things going, and it's
pretty simple: Execute. Freshen old brands, extend product lines,
improve advertising, squeeze costs. He intends to maximize the
First Brands investment, for example, by steadily adding new
features to Glad bags and wraps, much as diaper makers do to their
products, and extending the brand name to entirely different
products that will likely hit store shelves next year. (He's
holding off on discussing the details.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the former First Brands managers, he said bluntly: ``They
don't understand the consumer, they don't understand that their
target may not be the right target and their advertising mix may
not be correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan has been there before, tinkering with even
well-respected brands to unleash their potential.
</P>
<P>
   When the company bought the Armor All Products Corp. two years
ago, it saw unrealized promise in a product called Flash Black, a
clear liquid in a black bottle that is used to shine tires.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the gloss potential that Flash Black was supposed
to deliver, Clorox repackaged it in a clear bottle and changed the
name to Extreme Tire Shine. It was minor tweaking, but it
``essentially doubled the business,'' said Derrick Gordon, a group
marketing manager in Clorox's auto products division.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing team lso scuttled what it viewed as a mismanaged
ad campaign created for Armor All by the previous owner. ``How do I
say it? They didn't understand really who their customer was,''
Sullivan said of Armor All's managers.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Rose, Clorox's chief financial officer, pointed to Armor
All's choice as its spokesman of the retired football star Terry
Bradshaw as a major marketing misstep.``He was a quarterback for
the Pittsburgh Steelers back in the 1970s, so you know he doesn't
have all of his hair anymore,'' Ms. Rose said. And since the target
customer base for Armor All is males aged 16 to 25, ``Terry
Bradshaw doesn't speak to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clorox's ad agencies, DDB Needham San Francisco, came up
with fresher ads. Spots for a car wax that the company is
introducing under the Armor All name clearly have youthful
testosterone in mind. They use hip music and a sporty car to depict
what looks like a party at a car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tag line ``stay a little longer,'' the commercials
feature a model with a come-hither pout who borrows the sports
car's rear-view mirror to apply red lipstick. Since it is obvious
that she has no intention of scrubbing the tires, the impression
seems to be that Armor All will not only produce a lasting shine,
it just might help you find a girl.

TREASURY LOSSES WON'T TOP $20 MILLION, MASS. TELLS FINANCIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's office estimates
that losses from the state treasury scandal will likely not exceed
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator gave the forecast quietly to jittery Wall
Street investment bankers Tuesday while they were considering
buying $250 million in state bonds. Several firms involved in the
otherwise routine sale wanted to know just how bad the scheme
involving the treasury's Unpaid Check Fund might get before closing
on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators allege that nearly $9 million has been stolen from
the fund, which holds unclaimed state payments. Four men, including
two treasury workers, have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has said he expects his investigation to turn up more
losses. The estimated $20 million figure is based on the
investigation so far, according to Brian Heffron, a spokesman for
the attorney general. The actual amount stolen from the treasury
could be much higher, but prosecutors believe some money could be
recovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has already recovered $6.5 million allegedly stolen
from the account. Another $2.4 million is missing and may be gone
for good, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office was asked: `Do we believe that the loss to the
state will exceed $20 million?' And we have said, based on what we
know at this point. . .it would be remote,'' Heffron said. ``But
again, it's based on what we've been able to review so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, which is
responsible for reconciling the state's books, grew nervous late
last week that poor accounting and the alleged thefts could affect
the accuracy of their figures, which investors consult when buying
state debt.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banking firms involved in the sale also voiced
concern to Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, who sought an answer from
Reilly's office. She got one Tuesday, and the deal closed that
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a discrepancy of up to $20 million (in the state
coffers) that's considered to be a material omission of fact on the
official statement,'' O'Brien said. ``So we've actually had to work
with the attorney general's office to reassure them that there will
not be more than $20 million missing because that will have an
impact on how we sell our bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The word back from Reilly in a March 9 letter was short,
although bound up in legal language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the actual knowledge acquired by the office of the
Attorney General in its review to date of matters related to the
operation of the office of the treasurer, we believe the likelihood
of loss by the Commonwealth in excess of $20 million is remote,''
the letter, addressed to Deloitte &AMP; Touche, said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Unpaid Check Fund, John F. Trischitta, was
arrested last month for his part in the alleged theft of $6.5
million from the fund along with outsider, Martin Robbins, who is
accused of forging documents to siphon the money into an escrow
account at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   A bank employee notified the attorney general when Robbins later
tried to withdraw those funds, an act that launched the
investigation. That $6.5 million has since been returned to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta's boss, deputy treasurer Robert E. Foley and another
outsider, Thomas Ciliberto, were arrested shortly after, charged
with bilking $2.4 million from the same account.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they don't know if those funds will ever be
returned.

Astros' Bako fighting hard but losing the battle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ One mark of a good team is the scarcity of
position battles during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Astros don't have many. But one they do
have has been a knock-down, drag-out.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner there's Mitch Meluskey, who has the inside track
to the second catcher's spot on the roster, along with Tony
Eusebio. Across the ring stands Paul Bako, whose only hope is to
match Meluskey blow for blow _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as being like a heavyweight championship fight,''
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``You don't usually
beat the current champ unless you knock him out. Bako has to
clearly distance himself from Mitch to win that job at the start of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is too close to call.

   Meluskey, who doubled and scored twice in Friday's loss to the
Marlins, is hitting .571 with two RBIs in five games. Bako struck
his biggest blow with a grand slam Friday and is hitting .455 with
six RBIs in five games.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the Astros traded veteran catcher Brad Ausmus
was to create playing time for Meluskey. So it stands to reason the
25-year-old switch-hitter would be given every chance to prove the
Astros made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey's up-side potential offers the promise of more offense
than Ausmus. But Meluskey's spring performance will be evaluated
mostly on his work behind the plate, not beside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch just needs to reinforce our confidence that he can
handle the defensive part of the job,'' Hunsicker said. ``Unless he
does something during the spring to convince us he's not ready, he
has the advantage to start the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bako starts the season in the minors, Hunsicker has said
he wouldn't hesitate to recall him if Meluskey got off to a slow
start. Nevertheless, it appears Bako will open the season as an
insurance policy at Class AAA New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it sounds like,'' Bako said. ``But that's not how
I'm looking at it. I'm approaching things as if the job is as much
mine as it is anyone else's. All I can do is keep going out there
and busting my butt. I'm sure they can make a pretty fair
evaluation of me, and I think I can help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the minors would be nothing new. Although he didn't
make the club out of spring training, Bako ultimately became the
Tigers' every-day catcher and hit .272 in his first season in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence he gained from starting 83 of 139 games in
Detroit after his recall seems to have carried over into the spring
and is serving as momentum in Bako's quest to upset Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything to lose the job,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   And he may not be able to do enough to win it.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Bako's best chance of making the opening-day
roster is if Hunsicker goes against his general philosophy and
keeps three catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the third catcher can play another position, you
generally shortchange yourself by carrying three catchers,''
Hunsicker said. ``The third one would have to be a better offensive
candidate then some of the other candidates you'd be considering
(for the final spot on the bench).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible _ because of Mitch's offense _ that you could
make a case for that. I wouldn't rule it out, but with the
commitment we have to the people already in place, there's just no
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three catchers has much experience at another
position.
</P>
<P>
   And unless he makes a trade for an extra outfielder, Hunsicker
is committed to giving the final spot on the bench to one of the
outfield hopefuls already in camp. Glen Barker has the inside
track; Ryan Thompson and Alex Diaz also are candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bako, he'll have to keep working for that knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just keep plugging away,'' he said. ``In baseball, you
never know what can happen.''

 OAKLAND, Calif.: a girl.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clorox has been known to take creative liberties in other
commercials. Recognizing that its Hidden Valley salad-dressing line
had confused consumers with too many new products, another of its
agencies, Young &AMP; Rubicam San Francisco, dreamed up a slogan that
ran the risk of flouting Americans' infatuation with change at
breakneck speed: ``Not new and improved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we found is that consumers don't want to
think about food products coming from a big processor,'' explained
David Matz, a Clorox general manager. ``They want to think about it
coming from my grandmother's formula.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be, but no matter how wholesome and folksy an image it
wants to project, Clorox is clearly driven by technology and
research. It spends about 2 percent of revenues, in line with its
peers' budgets, to create products meant to better clean sinks or
shine glass. At its 28-acre product-development nerve center in
nearby Pleasanton, workers go to odd lengths in the name of
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent test of the effectiveness of a pet product, for
instance, they lent their noses for, of all things, sniff tests of
used cat litter. ``The basic premise is, if you don't like it, how
can you expect the consumer to buy it?'' said Vincent E. Alvarez,
director of technology. ``Why is your nose any different than their
nose?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much of the research is far more high tech: computer
design and testing of plastic products, an automated system for
soiling cloth to test stain removers and computerized testing of
the effects of humidity on packaging. Such work has helped to cut
costs and enabled Clorox slash its average product-development time
to six months, from two years.
</P>
<P>
   The R&AMP;D army is a key contributor to the company's battle to
control the supermarket cleaning aisle, but some products seem to
provide insurmountable challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox's insecticide sales, for example, have slipped lately,
with sales falling by percentages in the low single digits last
year; shipments of its Combat and Black Flag brand were off 3
percent in the latest quarter. Executives say Clorox never wanted
to be a major factor in the bug business, but was forced to take
the Combat line when it bought Pine-Sol; even Sullivan acknowledged
that the company was ``trying to figure that business out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the product development folks have gone to great lengths
to develop new ways to trap and kill household pests. At the
sprawling research campus, the company built a veritable insect
zoo, to study the behavior of roaches, mosquitoes and ants. There
is even a ``roach rearing room'' where workers watch the bugs
breed.
</P>
<P>
   And, as luck would have it, the campus was unwittingly built on
an ant colony, which provided all sorts of opportunities for
watching those insects travel and eat.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clorox is determined to fight on in the insecticide
aisle, the company tends not to suffer losses on product lines for
long. For example, in 1994 it introduced Hidden Valley salad
dressings aimed at children, with flavors like pizza and nacho
sauce. Unfortunately, while parents seemed to like them, youngsters
turned up their noses. And so Clorox discontinued the line after a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a golden touch, and not everything goes
well,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the
Dreyfus Corp., which owns 380,000 shares of Clorox, ``but they seem
willing to cut things off as well when they are not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, maintaining the rapid gains of the last few years will
be a challenge. About 80 percent of Clorox's revenues and profits
come from the United States; in contrast, about 80 percent of
Colgate-Palmolive's business is overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox is seeking to increase its relatively tiny international
presence, but with the economic outlook uncertain in much of the
world, that effort carries its own risks.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at 38 times forward earnings, Clorox stock is trading
at a multiple more typical of technology stocks like Intel and
Microsoft than of a maker of toilet cleansers. Indeed, some
investors, while still bullish on Clorox's management and strategy,
have begun to dump the stock because the price has become so rich.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yacktman, vice president of Yacktman Asset Management in
Chicago, which has owned Clorox shares since 1994, said his firm
bought the stock at a price 7 times earnings before income,
depreciation and amortization. With that measure now at 20, he
added, ``the big upside from that is not going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still a Clorox fan, but has sold some of his shares.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many analysts remain optimistic about the stock's
future growth potential. ``This company finds new niches and finds
that consumer whose need is not being met,'' said Carole Warner of
Prudential Securities. ``They own the cleaning aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, said Shore of Paine Webber, ``this is a
company that had tremendous self-doubt in the 1980s, and I think
Craig Sullivan made them believe they could be better than they
ever thought they were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the equivalent of what a good coach is to a team,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   While Clorox investors have certainly enjoyed hefty returns,
Sullivan's compensation package is relatively modest, said Graef S.
Crystal, an executive compensation critic. Although Sullivan's
$800,000 annual salary and $1.1 million bonus last year was
``within the normal range'' for his peer group, Crystal said, the
pay package was actually 49 percent below the market because it did
not include stock options and restricted shares.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Clorox was a sleepy, one-product company. It was
founded in 1913 by five Oakland entrepreneurs who started a bleach
factory with $500 and did not add another product for 56 years. The
company became a division of P&AMP;G in 1957 and was divested in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox's roots help explain the culture that Sullivan faced in
1992, when he was elevated from group vice president over the
outgoing chief executive's heir apparent. The company controlled
about half of the bleach business, and its rivals simply followed
at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   But now _ having bulked up in the 90s into a formidable and
diversified consumer-products concern _ it must find a way to hang
onto its new-found entrepreneurial spirit and remain nimble enough
to fend off industry giants as well as upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Sullivan must prove himself all over again.
That, it seems, is fine with him, since few people thought he could
pull it off the first time. And while always careful to spread the
credit, he has enough executive ego to suggest that his last seven
shareholder letters are useful reading _ a reminder that this is a
company that now delivers on its promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``But again,'' he added, ``this isn't about me.''

MUSIC GENIUS YEHUDI MENUHIN DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Violinist Yehudi Menuhin, one of the noblest musicians of the
century and one of its great humanists as well, died yesterday FRI
MAR 12  &LR; in Berlin. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   He was embraced as a son of San Francisco but as a citizen of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Death came ``totally unexpectedly,'' said a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He died at the Martin Luther Hospital in Berlin, where he had
been taken earlier in the week suffering from what turned out to be
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin was to have conducted the Warsaw Symphony Orchestra in
Berlin on Tuesday but took ill. His London office said the cause of
death was heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's enormous international acclaim had its beginning when
he was a child prodigy in San Francisco. He became beloved as a
man, though in some eyes an eccentric one.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on April 22, 1916, he said he always considered
San Francisco ``home.'' His family moved here when he was 2 years
old. His first violin lessons were in San Francisco _ he began
studies with Sigmund Anker before the age of 4 _ and the assurance
of his professional debut here at the age of 7 seems astonishing to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Paris, Berlin and London soon followed, and there came
a time when there probably was not a Western cq &LR; classical music
lover anywhere in the world who did not know his name.
</P>
<P>
   He added classical Indian music to his repertory as well. And a
little jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could not hear him in person treasured his recordings.
He was the most widely recorded artist of his day _ and the highest
paid _ and his recording of the Elgar Violin Concerto made in 1932
has been available ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When he could no longer play the violin to his satisfaction, he
switched to conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin practiced yoga as well as the violin. He was
health-conscious and an early advocate of organic farming and
alternative medicine. He liked conducting for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   His Ukrainian-Jewish parents, immigrants from Palestine, settled
in the Western Addition district of San Francisco, then a
predominately Jewish section.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, he created controversy when he was the first
Jewish artist to play with the Berlin Philharmonic, under conductor
Wilhelm Furtwaengler, after World War II. He refused to condemn an
entire people for the atrocities of the war.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, he gave hundreds of concerts for American and
Allied troops. After the war, though it was many years afterward,
he played a concert in the fire-bombed city of Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin became an advocate of peace and human rights. He
supported dissidents in China and the Soviet Union. He was the
recipient of the 1960 Nehru Peace Prize for International
Understanding.
</P>
<P>
   He was associated with UNESCO, the cultural-scientific arm of
the United Nations, but felt  &LR; freely to &LR; criticized the U.N. when he
felt it was not living up to its obligations. The United Nations,
he once said drily, continues to have ``great potential.''
</P>
<P>
   He was devoted to education, supporting schools for the urban
underprivileged as well as the musically gifted.
</P>
<P>
   He sincerely believed music could change people's lives _ ``if
they're willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a belief he shared with Beethoven. Another trait he
shared with that fellow musical genius was deafness. &QL;

EDITORIAL: PEACE EQUATIONS IN KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, March 13:
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations on Kosovo resume in France on Monday, Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian leader, may find himself isolated in his
opposition to peace. The House of Representatives voted on Thursday
to support sending U.S. peacekeeping troops to enforce a settlement
in Kosovo, removing any doubt about American participation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the commanders of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas wisely
agreed to accept the peace plan proposed by Washington, its
European allies and Russia. The ethnic Albanians are expected to
sign the deal this weekend. If they do, Milosevic's refusal to
allow international peacekeepers into Kosovo will be the only
remaining obstacle. It is crucial that the countries supervising
the peace talks remain united, and that NATO sustain its resolve to
use force, if necessary, to get Milosevic to sign a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians initially were expected to embrace the
agreement, which may prevent the death of thousands of civilians.
But they left France with the promise only that they would sign
after two weeks of conferring in Kosovo. They now are apparently
prepared to do so, thus allowing NATO to unite on the threat of
force against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. diplomat, has returned empty-handed
from yet another visit to Belgrade, this time trying to persuade
Milosevic to allow 28,000 NATO peacekeeping troops into Kosovo,
4,000 of them American. Few expected Holbrooke to succeed, as
Milosevic senses that NATO countries are unenthusiastic about using
airstrikes. He expects he can divide the West and win concessions _
among them the assurance that he cannot be prosecuted by the war
crimes tribunal. The nations supervising the talks should not let
him dictate the terms of settlement for a conflict he began by
persecuting Kosovo's people.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration feared that the congressional debate
on Kosovo could undermine the peace talks. But Congress had every
right to debate this important issue, and the speeches for the most
part proved thoughtful and serious. The vote was close, but
admirably bipartisan, as 44 Republicans supported the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The House seemed swayed by the need to stop the killings,
prevent the bloodshed from spreading throughout the Balkans and
strengthen NATO as it stands up to Milosevic. Those arguments
should remind the Western nations running the talks of the many
good reasons to remain united in pursuit of peace.

EDITORIAL: THE DRUG WAR BACKFIRES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, March 13:
</P>
<P>
   Almost 70 years after the failure of Prohibition, the
much-trumpeted ``war on drugs,'' begun more than a decade ago, has
hugely misfired. ``We have a failed social policy and it has to be
re-evaluated,'' says Barry R. McCaffrey, the four-star general in
charge of national drug control policy.
</P>
<P>
   The boomerang effect of the failed policy was richly detailed in
recent articles by Timothy Egan of The New York Times. School
systems deteriorate while tax dollars build new prisons. Municipal
police forces have grown so militarized that drug warrants are
served in armored personnel carriers. Young mothers are imprisoned
for years for simple drug possession. Young black males in
California are now five times as likely to go to prison as to a
state university.
</P>
<P>
   The drug war was created in reaction to a wave of urban violence
triggered by crack cocaine that ignited fears that crack addiction
might spread widely. Surveys now show, however, that the use of
crack, by about 600,000 people annually, has not changed in 10
years. Nor has the general level of illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for controlling illicit drugs lies in treatment.
Unfortunately, as new prisons have gone up, treatment programs
within them have declined. In their obsession to control drug use
by making war on it, federal and state legislators have turned the
world's greatest democracy into its largest prison system, where
young adults are warehoused and the opportunity to treat them is
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   As McCaffrey says, ``we can't incarcerate our way out of this
problem.'' But we can, he argues, focus punishment on drug dealers,
not drug users, while beginning to treat the hundreds of thousands
of people in prison with drug problems.

Hurdling walls old hat to Maryland's Francis
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ This time, when the first-round music stopped
and there was no reason for the Cinderellas from tiny Valparaiso to
waltz on at the Big Dance, coach Homer Drew still left the floor
with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a quick and decisive 82-60 loss to Maryland that had
none of the drama or joy of last year's stunning victory over
Mississippi in which son Bryce, the Rockets rookie, beat the buzzer
with the shot that would win an ESPY Award, there was reason for a
basketball coach to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to Steve Francis and shook his hand,'' Drew said.
``I just wanted to tell him that it won't be long before they're
calling him Sir Francis at the next level in the NBA. I don't think
there are any walls he can't climb.''
</P>
<P>
   There never have been walls that could hold Francis back.
</P>
<P>
   Not the solid walls of a cramped elementary school gym in Takoma
Park, Md., that were barely a foot beyond the baseline of the court
where a young kid tagged along with his older brothers and was
often sent headfirst into the cinder blocks after a driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Not the just-as-hard walls of family tragedy, injury,
bureaucracy and his own academic indifference that kept blocking
Francis' path to the spotlight of the game. Maryland is his sixth
campus in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of times over the years when it looked as
if Francis would never make it out of those dark shadows. Yet here
he is, finally in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Francis played just one season of high school basketball as a
5-3, third-string sophomore. He transferred to another school the
following year, sat out to become eligible as a senior, then
promptly broke his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hardest blow was still to come when his mother died of
cancer in 1995 at age 39. Francis left school, withdrew inside
himself, retreated from life and from friends. But he never gave up
on the game and his hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom taught me to be a man and not to run away from my
problems,'' he said. ``For a while, I thought maybe it wasn't meant
for me to go to college and play ball. But I just continued along
the way on my journey.''
</P>
<P>
   A long and unusual one. The little guard sprouted up a foot in
two years, but the only ball he was playing was at a gym in the
basement of a firehouse. He would play against the firefighters,
who were often called away in the middle of a game when an alarm
would ring.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of those playground figures whose reputation
spreads by word of mouth. People who had never even laid eyes on
him would talk about the amazing things he'd done on a basketball
court. Like the time he notched a quadruple double in a junior
college game. Or the time he scored 42 points in a half of a game.
Or the time he used his 43-inch vertical leap in a pickup game to
gather in an alley-oop pass and slam home a dunk over the head of
6-10 NBA star Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Before he pulled on a Maryland uniform for the first time last
fall, he had been named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference first
team by several writers. Traveling from a military academy in
Connecticut to junior colleges at San Jacinto and Allegany (Md.),
Francis had become an urban legend.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Terps lost 6-10 senior center Obinna Ekezie with a
torn Achilles' tendon on Feb. 9, Francis wouldn't let them stop,
and they entered the Tournament ranked No. 5 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The hype has been so great, you half expect a trail of sparks to
follow him up and down the court. Yet his game is more fine silk
than glittery sequins. He led Maryland to the win over Valpo with
just 15 points and seven assists while getting all of his teammates
involved in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the next game will be mine to shoot,'' Francis said. ``I
do whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Always has. Once in a rec league playoff game at Takoma Park,
Francis got the winning basket when he defended an inbounds pass,
asked a gullible opponent to ``check'' the ball and then converted
the gift turnover. In a summer league game, he fed a pass for the
winning hoop to a teammate whom he had set up in a hiding place
behind one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he can take over a game by running, jumping, leaping,
dunking, filling up the hoop. But he doesn't feel the need to do it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the package with Steve,'' said Terps coach
Gary Williams. ``He keeps us very unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Terrapins head into today's second round against upset
winner Creighton trying to get past the Sweet 16 for the first time
in a generation and maybe even to the Final Four for the first time
ever. Without Ekezie, it's a big obstacle for Steve Francis.
</P>
<P>
   But after all he's been through, what's one more wall?

   SOME MAJOR OIL PRODUCERS AGREE TO CUT PRODUCTION
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of major oil producers, hoping to capitalize on
their modest success in stabilizing world oil prices, announced
they had agreed to reduce production by another 2 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that if the cuts were carried out as
promised by April 1, and if nascent signs of an economic recovery
in Asia were realized, a steady recovery of crude oil prices could
be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   DOW FALLS AFTER NEARING 10,000
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average paused in its climb toward
10,000 as technology stocks suffered. The Dow came within 42 points
of 10,000 before giving up ground and closing at 9,876.35, down
21.09. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.09 points,
to 1,294.59. The Nasdaq composite index fell 30.72, to 2,381.53.

   ICAHN PROPOSES RJR NABISCO BOARD
</P>
<P>
   Carl Icahn, moving forward with his bid to gain control of RJR
Nabisco, named a nine-member board of directors that includes
several officials of companies he owns.

<P>
   JAPAN PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR NISSAN
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government sent the clearest signal to date that
Japan would not allow automaker Nissan Motor to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE AIRLINES ARE INCREASING FARES
</P>
<P>
   Five of the country's major airlines raised their fares late
this week, though the price increase could be short-lived if three
other carriers do not match them. News of the attempted fare rise
sent some airline stocks soaring on a day when they normally would
have fallen because of a jump in the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   STRIKE ROILS ECUADOR'S ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices more than doubled in Ecuador, and some bank accounts
were frozen after a two-day strike that paralyzed commerce.
</P>
<P>
   RESIGNATION HELPS GERMAN MARKET
</P>
<P>
   The German stock market soared one day after the abrupt
resignation of Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   CATERPILLAR SAYS ITS PROFITS WILL LAG
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, the maker of construction and earthmoving
equipment, warned that its first-quarter profits would be far below
expectations. It cited a sales slowdown in Latin America and stiff
competition in North America. The news caused the company's stock
to tumble 12.2 percent. Caterpillar has been suffering through a
gradual decline in sales and profits over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY CONTRACTS IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy was still shrinking in the fourth quarter
of last year, the government reported, despite a surge in public
spending that was meant to help start a recovery. The decline, at
an annual rate of 3.2 percent, was a surprisingly sharp drop that
extended the economic contraction to a record five consecutive
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   NEW PLAN FOR RUSSIAN DEBT
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston, the largest holder of Russia's
defaulted Treasury bills, rejected the current terms of debt talks
accepted by some major banks and issued its own plan, according to
a document sent to investors.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE GROUP FAULTS SUBSIDIES
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization ruled that subsidies in Brazil and
Canada unfairly helped aerospace companies such as Empresa
Brasileira de Aeronautica and Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   REORGANIZATION OF MICROSOFT SET
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it would soon announce a reorganization, creating
four groups based on customer service instead of the current three
based on technology.

BIDU SAYAO, STAR SOPRANO OF THE '30S AND '40S, DIES AT 94  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Brazil, France, Italy, Calif., Maine, N.Y.)   By GLADYS BOURDAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidu Sayao, a Brazilian soprano whose gossamer voice and
vivacious personality made her one of the most popular stars of the
Metropolitan Opera from the late 1930s through the  &UR; ' &LR; 40s, died
Friday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Maine. She was
94 and lived in Lincolnville, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Miss Sayao, restricted by her small voice to the
lyric and coloratura repertory, often expressed regret that she
could not sing such heavier roles as Tosca and Butterfly. But her
interpretations of Manon, Violetta in ``La Traviata,'' Mimi in ``La
Boheme'' and Susanna in ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' among other roles,
received consistent praise, with critics stressing her
expressiveness, sensibility, girlishness and excellence of
phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   Balduina de Oliveira Sayao was born on May 11, 1902, into a
wealthy family in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although her childhood
dramatizations in front of a mirror convinced her that she had a
future as an actress, the family conviction that it was a metier
for loose women dashed that hope. Piano lessons, too, were a
decided failure, but when she was 13 a music-loving uncle helped
arrange lessons with a celebrated former soprano, Elena Theodorini.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of study and appearances at the court of
Romania, her teacher's native country, Miss Sayao studied recital
repertory in France with the tenor Jean de Reszke. An eventual
audition in Rome led to an engagement as Rosina in ``Il Barbiere di
Siviglia,'' and by her late 20s she had sung at many opera houses
in Europe and South America.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of her first performance in the United States, a
Town Hall recital on Dec. 30, 1935, Noel Strauss of The New York
Times wrote that Miss Sayao's voice ``if light, was one of
pronounced sweetness; silky and caressing when used at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Arturo Toscanini, who was preparing an
all-Debussy program for the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra _
precursor of the New York Philharmonic _ engaged the young soprano
whose years in France had perfected her pronunciation, and gave her
one week to learn ``La Demoiselle Elue.'' A short time later the
Metropolitan Opera, which had recently lost Lucrezia Bori, a
stalwart of French repertory, to retirement, invited Miss Sayao to
sing the title role in ``Manon'' in February 1937.
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote of the debut, ``Miss
Sayao triumphed as a Manon should, by manners, youth and charm, and
secondly by the way in which the voice became the vehicle of
dramatic expression.'' The Met was her base, the San Francisco
Opera her alternate headquarters and South America the only foreign
territory to hear her in live performance.
</P>
<P>
   A month after her first Met ``Manon,'' Miss Sayao sang the lead
role in ``La Traviata.'' Two weeks later, she sang her first
``Boheme'' in the house, and Howard Taubman wrote in The Times that
she sang with ``freshness and simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the soprano sang more than 200 performances of 12
different roles at the Metropolitan. She made several opera and
song recordings and gave many recitals. In December 1943 she and
Lawrence Tibbett, the baritone, were soloists with the New York
Philharmonic under the direction of Artur Rodzinski for the
inaugural concert at the City Center of Music and Drama. The U.S.
government decorated her for her many performances in Army camps
and hospitals during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sayao resigned from the Metropolitan Opera in April 1952, a
month before her 50th birthday. ``I am proud, and I did not want to
wait until I was asked to leave,'' she said in an interview in
1987. In 1957 after a performance of ``La Demoiselle Elue,'' which
seemed to bring her career full circle, she abruptly retired,
canceling many engagements for subsequent seasons. She told an
interviewer years later that it was hard to stop but that being
able to smoke again was a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano's first marriage, to the Italian impresario Walter
Mocchi, who headed the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for
a time, ended in divorce. She and Giuseppe Danise, the baritone,
were married in 1947, and he gave up his career to manage hers.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death in 1963, she divided her time between
the Salisbury Hotel in New York City and her home in Lincolnville.
She was often seen at vocal events in New York City, a tiny woman
in high heels, her reddish hair pulled back in the chignon familiar
to several decades of opera fans.
</P>
<P>
   On a Metropolitan Opera broadcast in December 1989, the soprano
plaintively gave a personal summation of her career: ``I had
something appealing, I don't know what. The sincerity of my
singing. I give my heart. I give my soul. I give myself.''

MIAMI OF OHIO'S WALLY WORLD ECLIPSES WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Considering the distance the Washington Huskies
traveled for this, someone should have at least informed them of
the change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies might have thought they were in the Superdome for a
first-round NCAA Tournament game in the Midwest Region yesterday.
Actually, they were rounded up to serve as featured foils in the
Wally Szczerbiak Show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with seconds remaining _ and despite a 43-point bombardment
from the Miami of Ohio forward _ there was still a chance. There
was a loose ball and a last, desperate shot, which was ... blocked
by Szczerbiak.
</P>
<P>
   The play preserved a 59-58 victory for the RedHawks (23-7) and
produced a deadpan response from Miami coach Charlie Coles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I thought it was a very exciting basketball game,'' he
said, ``despite the score.''
</P>
<P>
   It also produced a memorable duel between two players of proud
lineage _ Szczerbiak, whose father, Walt, played professionally in
the ABA and Europe, and Washington's Donald Watts, son of former
Seattle SuperSonics guard Don ``Slick'' Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Watts performed admirably, scoring 28 points and keeping
Washington (17-12) in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It paled in comparison, however. Szczerbiak finished the day
with 43 points, 12 rebounds, two assists, three blocks and a steal.
He hit five 3-point shots and played all but 49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies put three different defenders on him and used three
defenses, but nothing worked for long on Szczerbiak, who said the
dislocated knee he suffered two weeks ago is feeling fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he always plays like this,'' said RedHawks guard Damon
Frierson, who had 12 points and two steals. ``Toward the end of a
close game like this, you just feed him the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   At one crucial juncture, Szczerbiak came up with a rebound, a
steal, an assist and a 3-pointer in a span of 15 seconds. But when
he missed a short jump shot with 25 seconds left, the Huskies had a
chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Washington brought the ball upcourt, but as Watts was moving in
for a shot in the key with 10 seconds left, Miami's Anthony Taylor
knocked the ball out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing scramble, Washington's Greg Clark (brother of
Detroit first baseman Tony Clark), came up with the ball. But as he
rose to shoot, Szczerbiak rose with him.
</P>
<P>
   For his final act of the day, he blocked the shot, recovered the
ball, and clung to it while the last two seconds ran off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had set a screen and I was getting ready to help on
Watts, when we knocked the ball loose,'' Szczerbiak said. ``I just
went up with Clark, and got a piece of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't stop that guy alone _ we all did. Maybe the
scoring total doesn't look like it, but this was a team effort. A
big part of this win was the job we did on Todd MacCulloch, and
that was mostly John Estrick and Mike Ensminger _ they stood in
there and banged heads with a 280-pounder.''
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks' defensive plan had been to stop MacCulloch, the
Huskies' 7-foot center who came in averaging 19 points. He scored
11 yesterday, but only two came in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Coles, ``now we have to play Utah. We got two
guys who took 45 shots today and scored 55 of our points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means I have a day and a half to teach the other three
guys how to shoot.'' \Ntagtop:Whit Canning, (817) 390-7760

Rockets' Barkley nears elite company
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Rockets guard Michael Dickerson lowers himself into a shooter's
crouch, hands open wide with his arms extended like Oliver Twist
pleading for just one more.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson is performing a basketball pantomime, waiting for a
pass from the low post as if Charles Barkley across the locker room
was waiting for just the right time to bounce the ball across the
carpet to Dickerson at an imaginary 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets the ball inside, I'm always like this,''
Dickerson said, readying himself like a gunslinger. ``When other
guys get it, I'm (hands on hips and standing straight) `OK, OK.' I
know when he (Barkley) gets the ball inside, when I'm open, he will
pass it. When I cut, he will pass it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls me his little parakeet because he's feeding me. I'll
be his parakeet if he keeps passing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson has been the benefactor of Barkley's low-post largesse
for a month. But that's enough to put him in a very large club.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley gets his first assist tonight against the Cleveland
Cavaliers, he will become the third player in NBA history with
20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists. The others:
Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great compliment to be on that list,'' Barkley said.
``Those passes are hard when you're double-teamed. It looks easy,
but it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As an offensive philosophy, it sounds so simple, so basic. If a
player is double-teamed inside, putting two defenders on one scorer
should leave someone open.
</P>
<P>
   Pass to the open man and he'll have an open shot.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA teams, particularly the Cavaliers, have a way of making
that much more difficult. The Cavaliers are especially skilled at
double-teaming from different directions. They move quickly to
switch to the player left open or to the lane a low-post passer
will try to use.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Bullard said of Barkley, ``He's got great vision of
the court. He sees where the double team is coming from. Some guys
just pass out of the double team but it doesn't get a shot. Charles
has a knack of passing it directly to the guy who can get the shot.
Whenever I'm out there, I try to position myself so I'm that guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of times you're not as ready as you should be
With Charles, I'm always ready when he's got the ball. He's keeping
me around in this league. Being a shooter, having a guy like
Charles that can command the double team and score at will so they
have to double team him, really makes my job a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's averages have dipped since his return from knee
surgery to 16.9 points, 13 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged four assists per game before he was hurt, matching
his career average.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his best passes do not result in assists because often
it's the pass after Barkley's that leads to the best open shot. A
better measure might be how often the Rockets' offense has worked
when it begins with Barkley in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rockets' first five games, before Barkley was sidelined,
the Rockets scored or drew a foul on 52 of the 98 plays begun with
Barkley posting up. That play's 53 percent success rate was far
ahead of any other play.
</P>
<P>
   It has worked 63 of 135 times (47 percent) since Barkley's
return, and and 55 of 94 times (59 percent) in the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounding is my greatest passion in life,'' Barkley said.
``Passing is something you have to do if they're going to double
you all the time. You've got to make the defense pay. There's
nothing better than getting your teammates easy baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   His passing success clearly begins with attitude, something
perhaps best seen in last week's win in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had seven assists before he took a shot,'' Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said of Barkley. ``That says it all right
there. I had seven assists in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees the floor. He understands where they're coming from.
He understands if there's two guys on him, we have another guy
going to the basket. That leaves three defenders (inside). We've
got three guys on the perimeter and they've got only two to defend
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high percentage play and a high scoring play because we
get 3-pointers of out of it. I've always said he's one of the best
ever passing the ball out of a double team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   The last could be as valuable as the passes themselves, because
Barkley can pull rank when it comes to allocating shots. But
choosing to emphasize team success sends a message as directly as
any bounce pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what a great player he is,'' Dickerson said. ``But
that just shows he's not worried about his scoring, he's worried
about the team. He could have always said, `He's a rookie. He
doesn't need the ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I'm open, he passes me the ball. That says what kind of
guy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley would argue that there is nothing noble about passing to
the open man. Doing well enough to join a club with only
Chamberlain and Abdul Jabbar merely proves something he said he has
known all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt great about my passing,'' Barkley said. ``It
gives me a lot of satisfaction being a great passer. I started my
second year in Philadelphia, when they started doubling me all the
time. I've just exceeded everyone's expectations.''
</P>

NEW YORK STATE SETS REGULATIONS ON HIV REPORTING AND PARTNER
NOTIFICATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of delay, New York state has moved one
step closer to implementing a new HIV reporting and partner
notification program by issuing long-awaited regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Those regulations appear to close loopholes in the new law,
disappointing some advocates for people with HIV who had hoped it
would limit those who would be identified in the state registry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law approved by the state Legislature last June,
doctors and laboratories would be required to report the names and
addresses of HIV-positive people, but it was unclear whether the
new program would include those with previously diagnosed HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which are to be officially released on
March 17, say that HIV reporting will result from a positive HIV
antibody test, and will also apply to patients who tested positive
before the law was implemented but were seeking routine HIV care.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations from the state Health Department
require that the reports of HIV cases by doctors, clinics and
laboratories include the name and address of the infected person,
their demographic information and the names of any potential sexual
or needle-sharing partners known to the doctor or provided by the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, which will undergo a 45-day public comment
period, will also require doctors and government health counselors
to administer a questionnaire to seek information about potential
domestic violence. The regulations also forbid the use of data
gleaned from HIV reporting and partner notification in criminal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the regulations allow hospitals, doctors and
clinics to provide HIV information, if it exists, from their
medical records to someone who has experienced a significant
exposure on the job in those health settings. But the rules do not
allow for someone to be tested for HIV without the person's
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new program, the government, health workers or doctors
will be responsible for seeing that partners of infected people
have been warned of their potential exposure to the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But state health officials anticipate that the majority of the
partner notification cases will be carried out by the government
workers. The notifications are to be done in person, with the
identity of the infected person who exposed them never to be
disclosed. The state projects that it will make 22,000 HIV partner
notifications annually.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the program say it is a huge, costly undertaking
with much of the burden falling on local health departments that
are already underfinanced and understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when resources seem to be increasingly constrained,
there is a question about how all of this is going to be done and
the quality of work,'' said Jeffrey L. Reynolds, the policy
director for the Long Island Association for AIDS Care.
</P>
<P>
   But even as many advocates for infected people agree that the
time has come to monitor HIV cases in New York state to better
track the epidemic, they say they are troubled by how the program
will be carried out. Some advocates fear that the regulations will
have the counterproductive effect of deterring HIV-infected people
from entering medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulations create significant barriers for people trying
to seek HIV care,'' said Michael Kink, the legislative counsel for
Housing Works, a social service agency for people with HIV. ``It's
a 10-foot-tall concrete barrier to getting care.''

HOLYFIELD PLANNING TO MAKE LEWIS BELIEVE IN HIM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield has spent a good portion of his
career making believers of those who doubt his ability. They said
he would never successfully move up from cruiserweight to
heavyweight. Now, people argue whether he belongs among the top 10
heavyweights of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson's people predicted they would carry Holyfield out in
a coffin after their first bout. Instead, Tyson was the one who had
to be revived after a stunning 11th-round loss by technical
knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis is the latest candidate for conversion. And this
time, Holyfield is the one making the prediction, saying he will
knock Lewis out in the third round Saturday night. It has added to
the intrigue of this fight.
</P>
<P>
   A celebrity-studded sellout crowd of 19,000, more than 5,000
from Britain, Lewis' birthplace, will pack Madison Square Garden
for the fight and perhaps a million or more worldwide will tune
into pay-per-view to see if Holyfield, a slight favorite over
Lewis, can make good on his promise and become the first undisputed
heavyweight champion since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield (36-3), who is the IBF and WBA champion, is so
confident that he will deliver that third-round knockout that he
has not allowed himself to think of anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't have a Plan B,'' he said. ``Plan A has to work, because
I've torn down the bridge. There's nothing else. There ain't no
`What if?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1), a 1988 Olympic boxing gold medalist for Canada and
the WBC champion, probably cannot stop thinking ``What if?'' A
victory for Lewis would bring the kind of credibility in the
division that he has only dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   He has never faced an opponent with the credentials of
Holyfield, who has fought eight former world champions, and he has
never been involved in a bout of this magnitude. There are
questions about his heart, his courage, his stamina and his
psychological makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I get to prove myself as the best fighter on the
planet,'' Lewis said. ``To show there's a reason why all those
fighters have been ducking me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said there were questions about Holyfield, who is 36 and
has been involved in several epic ring wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is definitely beatable,'' said Lewis, who is 33. ``His chin
is questionable. He hasn't been hit by a big heavyweight like
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is giving up 31 pounds to Lewis, but he has never
shrunk with fear in the face of a larger man. He won a 12-round
decision against George Foreman, even though Foreman outweighed him
by 49 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Knockout punches aside, the outcome of the fight will hinge on
which fighter is better able to impose his will on the other and
which fighter has more determination if it goes to the later
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has a tendency to sag in the middle rounds, but he is
very determined. Expect Holyfield to try to work inside of Lewis'
long reach, tying him up and trying to catch Lewis with uppercuts.
Holyfield is also a master counterpuncher.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield expects Lewis to try to work his jab and set him up
for the knockout by the right hand. Holyfield said he was not
worried about what Lewis would try to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not concerned about Lennox and what he does well,''
Holyfield said. ``Anything he does, I'm going to use against him.
If he moves well, I'll use that against him. If he doesn't move
well, I'll use that against him.''

ARIZONA TUMBLES TO OKLAHOMA BY A TOE AND A TIP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Had Michael Wright, Arizona's outstanding freshman
forward, been wearing something smaller than a size 14 shoe, the
Wildcats might well have advanced in the first round of the Midwest
Regional of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the fourth-seeded Wildcats were upset Friday, 61-60, by
13th-seeded Oklahoma, the last at-large team chosen in the 64-team
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (22-7), the 1997 national champion, had its hands full
with the Sooners (21-10). With 48 seconds left in the game, Arizona
had a 60-59 lead and, following an Oklahoma timeout, Wright tried
to throw the ball inbounds. He was about to get the ball to Richard
Jefferson, who turned his back and headed up court. A surprised
Wright had to quickly shift gears and tossed it to another
teammate. That was when misfortune struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``My momentum carried me a little too far,'' said Wright. The
referee's whistle blew and Wright was charged with stepping on the
line as he threw the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the line, oh, only about this far,'' said Wright,
measuring about an inch with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Forget it, Michael,''' said Jason Terry,
Arizona's all-America guard. ``I said, `We gotta stop 'em on
offense.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Oklahoma had the ball. With around 16 seconds left, Eric
Martin missed a 3-pointer. Eduardo Najera rebounded the ball and
tried to put it back in. The ball seemed to linger on the rim when
the hand of Ryan Humphrey reached up to tap it in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely goaltending,'' said Terry, ``but it wasn't
called, so I guess it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright was his team's leading scorer with 16 points (on 6 of 13
from the field), its leading rebounder, with 12, had the Wildcats'
only two blocked shots and even managed a steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have been in the ball game without a great game
out of Michael Wright,'' said Lute Olson, the Arizona coach. ``He
did a great job, but he made a freshman mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the whole team made a freshman mistake, since there was
obvious confusion on the key play. After all, the Wildcats had just
come out of a timeout. A.J. Bramlett, the team's center, normally
throws the ball in, according to Olson, and the players didn't seem
to be cutting for the ball with purpose. ``But there was some kind
of miscommunication,'' Olson said. ``I'm not sure what exactly
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The upset was another blow for the Wildcats as they suffered
their fourth fourth first-round loss of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Humphrey gave Oklahoma the lead, there were still 10
seconds left in the game. Terry hurried the ball down court. He
shot and missed a fall-away 10-footer with 3 seconds left, Bramlett
missed a tip-in and Richardson put up an 8-foot air ball from the
lane as the buzzer sounded, causing the red-clad Oklahoma Sooners
to go wild.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first NCAA tournament victory for Sooner coach Kelvin
Sampson. ``To say this win was satisfying is an understatement,''
he said. He credited his players with not losing their composure
when they fell behind by nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma will meet the University of North Carolina at Charlotte
in the next round of games here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   UNCC 81, RHODE ISLAND 70
</P>
<P>
   With Rhode Island behind by 60-56 with 4 minutes 31 seconds
remaining in regulation, Lamar Odom, the dynamic 6-10 sophomore,
made a free throw, a turnaround jump shot and tossed in another
free throw to tie the score at 60-60.
</P>
<P>
   The foul that sent him to the free-throw line was the fifth
committed by Galen Young, the 6-7 forward who had done a good job
defending Odom. Young was a force in other areas, as he was his
team's leading scorer, with 17 points, while grabbing 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tip Vinson then sank a 3-pointer to give the 12th-seeded Rams a
63-60 lead. It was frenetic at this point. Kelvin Price, the
muscular center for the fifth-seeded 49ers, put back a rebound to
make the score 63-62.
</P>
<P>
   After a Rhode Island miss, guard Jobey Thomas hit a 3-pointer to
give UNCC a 65-63 lead. With 13 seconds remaining in regulation,
Antonio Reynolds-Dean grabbed a rebound and laid in a shot to send
the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was all UNCC. Marlon Thomas scored the first 5
points and Rhode Island was all but finished. Odom finished with a
team-high 16 points. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: DON'T LET ADMINISTRATORS OFF THE HOOK WHEN THINGS GO
WRONG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn . )   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coaches and players had finished their games Thursday and
hurried back to their hotels to watch recaps of the day's upsets of
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. Detroit
upset UCLA; Weber State upset North Carolina; Gonzaga upset
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But for at least one coach, this was upsetting for a different
reason than the impact on the office pool. Five hours before
Minnesota's first-round game, Mark Yudof, the president of the
University of Minnesota, announced that two starters and two
reserves were suspended from the team. The action was taken pending
the outcome of an inquiry into allegations that from 1993 to 1998,
a former office manager in the university's academic counseling
unit did course work for at least 20 players in the basketball
program, including four on the current team.
</P>
<P>
   The four players sat at the end of the Gophers' bench during
Thursday's game, wearing matching black and white warm-ups instead
of Minnesota's maroon and gold. The only time they got on the court
was during timeouts, when they peeked in from the edge of the team
huddles. Television cameras moved in on the four, and commentators
discussed the unfolding allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the clip was shown, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis
became increasingly annoyed. ``I was taught that you're innocent
until proven guilty,'' Jarvis said, ``so I have a problem when
these images are being shown as if you're looking at criminals.
They're not criminals. They're kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The former tutor, Jan Gangelhoff, said her role had evolved from
tutor to actually doing the players' assignments. Most disturbing
was Gangelhoff's admission that she did the work without being
asked. ``The kids didn't ask me, either,'' she told WCCO-TV. ``That
was a decision I made on my own. Basically because of time
constraints, it was just easier for me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an abdication of responsibility that makes her a
perpetrator as well. But NCAA regulations deal only with the
student-athletes, not with an administrator who took matters into
her own hands. We haven't seen Gangelhoff's photo with a scarlet
letter emblazoned across her forehead; we have just seen numerous
shots of four banned players bunched together at the end of
Minnesota's bench.
</P>
<P>
   The overt message is that there continues to be a problem in
this semipro industry. The subliminal message is that these faces
represent what is wrong with college athletes, that these faces
represent what is wrong with sports. But the players are only part
of the problem. The administrators share a large part of the blame.
Punish them. The coach, Clem Haskins, if he is found to have been
involved, should be harshly disciplined. Gangelhoff should be
punished, too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, once again, the NCAA scapegoats the defenseless. The
players are hung out to dry. University presidents puff out their
chests and use high-profile sports teams to promote themselves. But
when something goes wrong, they put the players in stocks to be
pelted with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is beginning to pay for the arrogant attitude that too
often treats players, and coaches, as afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last month a judge ruled that Charles Williams, a former
basketball player at the University of Cincinnati, may pursue a
defamation suit against the university. Williams, who played for
the Bearcats in 1996 and 1997, accused it of breach of contract, as
well, after an investigation of his eligibility grew into a
two-year inquiry into the men's basketball team. The NCAA found
that Williams had received under-the-table gifts while he was being
recruited and that Cincinnati's basketball staff improperly had
arranged for him to attend and receive passing grades in summer
school classes. Williams was suspended from the basketball team in
1997, and he later dropped out of college.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last April a federal judge awarded $80 million in damages to
three classes of plaintiffs who had held ``restricted earnings''
coaching positions earlier this decade and sued the NCAA for
illegally setting salary caps.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Monday a judge ruled that it is racially biased to use
minimum test scores to bar student-athletes from scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   So, the tournament is off and running: Weber State, Detroit and
Gonzaga won games they were supposed to lose. Minnesota lost a game
it was supposed to win.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering image of four ostracized Minnesota players,
dressed in black and white, is a poignant snapshot of March
Madness. What a rotten way to go. &QL;

 BOSTON: FBI allies.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trial testimony and related interviews have verged repeatedly on
the cinematic. There was a moment, as recounted by Connolly in an
interview, when Bulger was recruited to inform on his enemies and
said: ``They want to play checkers; we'll play chess.''
</P>
<P>
   There were homey, boozy dinners shared chummily by FBI agents
and criminal informers, as described in testimony by both sides.
And there has been jaw-dropping courtroom drama as criminal after
criminal has been revealed to be an informer too, like some zany
comedy in which one actor after another pulls off a lifelike rubber
mask.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the remark that lies at the crux of Flemmi's
argument that the government owes him immunity.
</P>
<P>
   At one of those cozy dinners, Flemmi has testified, an FBI
supervisor, John Morris, told him and Bulger, ``You can do whatever
you want, just don't clip anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor says he does not recall making the remark. But it
encapsulates the sense that emerges from the case of the FBI's
willingness to resort to questionable means to achieve its end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone in their right mind really believe Jimmy Bulger
and Steve Flemmi survived the most powerful law-enforcement agency
on earth unless we fully intended them to survive us?'' asked
Connolly, who believes that the government owes both Flemmi and
Bulger immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another pivotal comment, Morris has said that he once asked
Connolly what the two men wanted in exchange for their information,
and Connolly replied, ``a head start.'' In other words, warning in
time to run if an indictment against them was about to come down.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, until the FBI guard changed and the two men's
usefulness declined, they seem to have gotten, and gotten away
with, much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   So the awkward question arises of who, exactly, was running
whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always weighing how bad are the bad guys versus how
good is the information they're providing,'' said Robert M. Bloom,
a professor of law and specialist in federal procedure at Boston
College Law School who has been following the Boston case. ``That's
the dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   But the picture here gets even worse for the FBI. Morris, who
has immunity, has admitted to acts of outright corruption: taking
several thousand dollars and cases of the wine he was so fond of
that the criminals nicknamed him ``Vino.''
</P>
<P>
   So, then, another question arises: Is all this really about a
couple of rogue agents who got too friendly with a couple of
criminals?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Kenneth Fishman, Flemmi's lawyer. If it were just that,
he argued, the Justice Department would not be talking about
changing its whole system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an aberration,'' Fishman said. ``It's an inherent
part of law enforcement that the courts have found to be
acceptable. You can make these deals with the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishman is arguing that the government must live up to its deal
with an informer like Flemmi _ a deal that he describes as
effective immunity for the racketeering crimes of which he stands
accused.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Callaghan, former assistant special agent in charge of
the Boston FBI office, said that dealing with criminals was
naturally a significant part of the bureau's job. ``You don't go to
the local church pastor for information,'' he said. ``We use
criminals. Do we think at certain times they do certain things they
don't tell us about? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But agents are already obligated to follow up leads on
unauthorized crimes by criminal informers, he said. He decried
Morris' corruption, but said of Connolly, ``You hate to see people
who are out there trying to get the job done whose reputations are
destroyed simply because they handled those people.''
</P>
<P>
   To Flemmi's arguments that he is owed immunity, the government
is arguing back strenuously, through its team of federal
prosecutors, that no such deal was ever made and that Flemmi was a
criminal who happened to find it advantageous to inform on his
enemies but received no legal promise of protection from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   A government brief filed recently accuses Flemmi of ``trying to
rationalize a life of heinous crime and duplicitous treachery into
the actions of some super federal undercover agent imbued with the
license to commit crime purportedly in the service of his
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Boston, Donald K. Stern, emphasized the
importance of informers for fighting everything from hate groups to
drug dealers. ``We're not suggesting everything here worked the way
it should have,'' he said, ``but we'll strongly defend the ability
of law enforcement to develop and nurture informants _ within
carefully constructed guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Connolly says Flemmi and Bulger ``were no angels,'' he
disagrees with the government's position on whether it owes them
immunity. He says his superiors did in fact make a deal with the
two informers, at least concerning gambling and loan &UR; - &LR; sharking.
And a deal is a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, however, that ``It was always understood they could
not commit violent acts.'' Brought up on the same South Boston
territory as Bulger, it was Connolly who helped Bulger turn
informer, and he does not regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business decision, pure and simple,'' said Connolly,
who retired a highly commended agent. ``We were going to use a gang
of two to get rid of a gang of 42.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you were a victim of Flemmi and Bulger, a victim of
criminals given virtual carte blanche by the government?
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the matter is, what if you're one of the Mafia's
victims?'' Connolly countered. ``The 42 people we put away were
probably responsible for 200 murders over 30 years, maybe more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the name of the game,'' he said. ``It all depends on what
your investigative priorities are. A decision was made by the
Department of Justice and FBI to go after the Mafia, and that's
what I did. My only crime is doing my job and doing it too well.''

UTAH USES SIZE TO BURY ARKANSAS ST.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Making its first NCAA Tournament appearance,
Arkansas State had a ride in the fast lane that lasted about 25
minutes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   After which, second-seeded Utah (28-4) methodically set the
inevitable in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we kinda fell apart,'' said Indians coach
Dickey Nutt, after his team's 80-58 loss. ``Eventually, their size
just wore us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians (18-12) did not go quietly, stunning the Utes and
the Superdome crowd with a 13-4 run to open the game, but were done
in by an erratic game and Utah's inside strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a scrappy team, and I was impressed with them,'' Utah
coach Rick Majerus said. ``If they can keep their program going the
way it is now, they'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utes won their 23rd consecutive game with a 40-24 advantage
in rebounding and 40 points from forwards Hanno Mottola (22) and
Alex Jenson (18). And when they made a change to counteract the
efforts of Arkansas State's 5-foot-5 point guard, Chico Fletcher,
the Indians were done.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians lost the early lead when it went cold for eight
minutes while Utah went on a 19-2 run. In the second half, the
Indians were two points away (41-39) when they went cold again _
going six minutes without a point. By the time they scored again,
the Utes were out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the key was when we switched and put Tony Harvey on
Fletcher in place of Andre Miller,'' Majerus said. ``Tony ...
doesn't have the offensive responsibilities that Andre does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Andre gets weighted down with having to move
everyone around on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher finished with 21 points, but only six came in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a matter of time,'' Jensen said. ``We were a
lot bigger than they were all across the front line.'' Kansas 95,
Evansville 74 The Jayhawks' victory was enlivened by the crowd
reaction at every appearance of Kansas forward Lester Earl, who was
the center of a scandal two years ago that landed Louisiana State
on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciative fans demonstrated they have not forgotten, booing
Earl's every move while waving money and car keys at him.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going, the sixth-seeded Jayhawks (23-9) had a far
bigger worry _ Evansville guard Marcus Wilson, who scored 18 points
in the first eight minutes, pacing the Purple Aces (23-10) to a
26-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas coach Roy Williams then made a change, putting Marlon
London on Wilson, who scored only two more points in the half, as
the Jayhawks took charge. Wilson finished with 34, but this was
Kansas' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take away the first eight minutes, and we were awfully good,''
said Williams, after watching his team shoot 63 percent, forge a
45-15 rebounding advantage and cruise through the second half.

MIAMI OF OHIO LEADER SCORES 43 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.Y., Utah, Ark.)  (mk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Chagrined by his losing performance in the
Mid-American Conference tournament final, Miami of Ohio's Wally
Szczerbiak came into the Midwest Regional looking to get the sour
taste out of his mouth. He did so by keeping the basketball in his
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   The senior forward from Long Island, N.Y., scored a career-high
43 points in the Red Hawks' 59-58 victory over Washington Friday in
the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-seeded Miami now faces No. 2 Utah on Sunday in a
second-round game. The Utes (28-4) steamrolled past Arkansas State,
80-53, for their 23rd consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, who played with a dislocated kneecap during the
conference final, may now be fighting arm soreness. He launched 33
of Miami's 55 shots, making 18 of them. He had 12 rebounds to lead
both teams. He played all but 33 seconds in the game. He hit the
game-winning shot. And he blocked what could have been the Huskies'
game-winner in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps as surprising as Szczerbiak's dominance was how
little special attention the seventh-seeded Huskies gave him
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the MAC, guys are always hedging on screens, chasing me up
and down the floor and bodying me up,'' he said. ``I was more open
than I've ever been today.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Bob Bender agreed that his team did a miserable
job of getting around the screens Szczerbiak's teammates kept
setting for him. ``And once he got his confidence, he was that much
tougher to stop,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Donald Watts said the Huskies had seen a number of guys
with Szczerbiak's offensive ability, but he lamented that they
could not keep him from finding a comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you let a player of that caliber get into his comfort
zone, he'll burn you,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Szczerbiak, a 6-foot-8-inch, 243-pound senior
forward, noted that he had a number of shots rattle in and out or
he might have exceeded the 54 points he once scored at Cold Spring
Harbor High School in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak missed 13 of 17 shots in a painful 6-point loss to
Kent in the conference final, hampered by the kneecap. But on
Friday the points came early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the games I can keep up with how many points I have,''
he said. ``Today, I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which ended its season at 17-12, stayed with a
box-and-one defense through much of the game, with Greg Clark
mostly assigned to Szczerbiak. Szczerbiak said he realized early on
that the Huskies' 7-foot center, Todd MacCulloch, would not be much
of a shot-blocking presence.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Szczerbiak had 21 points as 10th-seeded Miami, now
23-7, built a 29-26 lead. He scored the Red Hawks' winning basket
with 1 minute 10 seconds left, then made the crucial defensive stop
as time was running out. He blocked Clark's jump shot with three
seconds left, retrieved the ball, then threw the ball high in the
air after the game clock reached zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony Taylor did a great job of switching off and forcing
Watts to give the ball up to my man,'' Szczerbiak said. ``I knew
time was running down and I closed out. I didn't want to foul. I
stuck my hand up, got a piece of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of it, the Red Hawks live to play another day. But
they may not last much longer.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH 80, ARKANSAS STATE 53
</P>
<P>
   The opener essentially pitted a polished team against an
unpolished one. Utah, runner-up to Kentucky last year, fielded a
starting lineup of 22-year-olds except for the 20-year-old guard
Jeremy Killion. Arkansas State (18-12) may well have had an edge in
athleticism, but began to show chinks after taking a 15-7 lead 6:45
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out intense and we didn't match them,'' Utah forward
Alex Jensen said. ``When we matched their intensity in the second
half, we were able to pull away.''
</P>
<P>
   A 40-24 rebounding edge didn't hurt, either.

SERENA WILLIAMS POWERS INTO EVERT CUP   FINAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ With big sister on the singles sidelines,
little sister continued to bask in the limelight Friday as
17-year-old Serena Williams, apparently on a take-no-prisoners
mission to follow Venus into the top five, bullied her way into the
final of the Evert Cup with a 7-5, 6-0 victory over 12th-seeded
Sandrine Testud of France.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's final at Indian Wells, Calif., Williams, who
captured her first tour title two weeks ago in Paris, will face
Steffi Graf, the owner of 106 titles.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Williams promises not to be intimidated by Graf,
the 29-year-old icon. ``She's a good athlete,'' Williams said.
``She's fast. I'm fast. I'm a great athlete. It's going to be
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Things continued to be exciting for the underdogs at the men's
Newsweek Champions Cup event, where seven of the top eight seeded
players have vanished. Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian who captured
the 1997 French Open and fancies himself as more than a clay-court
contender, secured a semifinal berth against Carlos Moya of Spain
by ousting eighth-seeded Richard Krajicek, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The 550th-ranked Chris Woodruff, a qualifier from Knoxville,
Tenn., beat the seventh-seeded Tim Henman, who double-faulted at
match point. Woodruff reached his first semifinal since 1997 with a
6-1, 1-6, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Moya, the highest-seeded player remaining on
the men's side, advanced with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over 12th-seeded
Karol Kucera. Moya, the 1998 French Open champion, can claim the
No. 1 ranking from Pete Sampras by beating Kuerten, against whom he
is 0 for 4 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, a two-time Evert Cup champion at this dual desert event,
flexed her credentials in January at Sydney, Australia, in her only
prior meeting with the younger Williams sister. But lately,
everything Serena Williams touches has been trouble for her
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 66-minute onslaught of power tennis against an
increasingly submissive Testud extended the teen-ager's undefeated
streak to a career-best 10 matches. Williams began the tournament
with a straight-set dismissal of second-seeded Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think I'm playing with a lot of confidence; who
wouldn't?'' said Williams, who is ranked 21st.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of her previous confrontation with Testud, a 9-7
third-set loss in the third round of the Australian Open, Williams,
furious about her failure to convert two match points, flung her
racquet at the net before flouncing off the court. But Friday she
was poker-faced concentration from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've finally realized it's not time to play around anymore,''
Williams said. ``Five years from now, there's going to be another
player who's going to be just great; it's not going to be my turn.
So now is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After scrambling out of a 3-1 first-set deficit and breaking
Testud for 7-5, Williams wasted no time asserting herself in the
second set. Each mistake from Testud, who dropped eight straight
games from 5-5 in the first set, was punished with alacrity.
Williams reached double match point with a down-the-line backhand
pass delivered with a roar, and did a hop at the baseline after
Testud blundered a forehand beyond bounds. &QR;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months ago, when Howard Milstein and Daniel Snyder agreed to
buy the Washington Redskins for a stunning $800 million, it looked
as if nothing could stand in the way of their dream of owning a
National Football League team.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Milstein family's real estate and banking fortune
is estimated at $5 billion, so Milstein clearly believes he can
afford paying more than three times the sales price of the last
operational NFL franchise to change hands: $250 million for the
Minnesota Vikings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for all of us the most exciting thing we have ever
done and most likely ever will do,'' Milstein said upon signing the
deal to buy the team from the estate of Jack Kent Cooke, the former
owner, who died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Milstein, whose brother, Edward, is also a partner in the
deal, has faced unexpectedly stiff resistance. The league first
looked for a way to consider a $680 million bid made by John Kent
Cooke, the former owner's son. But the Cooke estate's binding
agreement with the Milsteins forced it to drop that idea.
</P>
<P>
   The deal remains in doubt as the NFL's finance committee
prepares to meet Saturday at the Arizona Biltmore in Scottsdale,
Ariz. The committee will determine whether Milstein has met the
league's demands that the team itself not be used as collateral for
a $400 million unsecured line of credit from the French bank
Societe Generale, which has lent to several other NFL team owners.
The league is also asking Howard and Edward Milstein each to be
individually responsible for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale has agreed to take certain Milstein family
assets if the loan goes bad, without putting Howard Milstein or the
Washington team at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent us a letter saying they will comply, but without any
specific timetable or substantive support documents,'' said Joe
Browne, the NFL's senior vice president for communications and
government relations.
</P>
<P>
   The league's full 31-team ownership is scheduled to vote on the
deal on Tuesday. If it is rejected _ approval is needed by 24 or
more owners _ Milstein and his partners will lose not only their
contract for the team but also a $30 million nonrefundable deposit
held by the Cooke estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rich man's poker,'' said Rick Burton, director of the
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, part of the business school at the
University of Oregon. ``It must have been very important to them to
pay this much, maybe overbidding by $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Overbidding or not, the cost of playing NFL poker is climbing.
Spurred by network television deals that will total $18.3 billion
through 2005, team values are soaring. In 1993 the expansion teams
in Jacksonville, Fla., and Charlotte, N.C., paid fees of $140
million each to join the league. Two years later, Malcolm Glazer
acquired the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for $192 million. Last year, Red
McCombs snapped up the Minnesota Vikings for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for the TV deals, teams would still sell for $200
million,'' said Robert McNair, who is seeking an expansion team in
Houston. Two groups from Los Angeles are also competing for that
team, which would be the league's 32nd franchise and could go for
at least $600 million, experts say. The NFL is expected to decide
next week whether to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The latest television package _ the networks paid each team in
the league $54.8 million last year and will pay them almost twice
that amount, $90 million, in 2005 _ changed everything. Last
September, for example, the NFL reaped $530 million for selling the
rights to re-establish the Browns in Cleveland. The price
capitalized on the team's new worth in view of the television
package as well as on the revenue to be derived from a new stadium.
The new Browns will start play this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But even that $530 million bonanza, which will be shared among
the current team owners, fell far short of the value perceived in
the Redskins. The Milstein-Snyder partnership, and the rivals they
outbid, recognized that the team was worth a lot more because of
its lucrative stadium arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, in suburban Maryland, opened in 1997
and is a model of modern sports finance. The 80,116-seat stadium
was built by the late Cooke for $180 million (the state paid $70
million for infrastructure work). It boasts the league's most
expensive tickets ($52.92 on average), most luxury suites (280,
which sell for $59,950 to $159,950) and most club seats (15,044 at
$995 to $1,995).
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the last year the Redskins played at the district-owned
RFK Stadium in Washington, it earned $213,455 on revenue of $79.3
million. By 1998, the team's second season at the new stadium, the
preseason estimate for combined team and stadium revenue was $141.2
million, with net income of $21.6 million. All this for a team that
finished the season next to last in its division.
</P>
<P>
   And although players' salaries are rising, the revenue potential
at Cooke stadium has not been fully exploited. Revenue from
advertising, for example, is relatively low. Not all the club seats
have been sold. Moreover, the stadium's name has not been sold to a
corporation, which could generate at least $5 million a year. And
dozens more luxury suites could be built if there was demand.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein's pursuit of the Redskins is not his first NFL
go-round. Last year he joined the auction for the re-established
Browns. He withstood the league's security and financial
investigations and proposed financing his deal with the same line
of credit that is at the center of the Redskins purchase. He signed
a prospective buyer's contract and put up a $45 million letter of
credit. But his $450 million bid finished third to the $530 million
price that was paid by Alfred Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 14 months, Milstein and his brother have owned 45
percent of the New York Islanders, a stake they must sell to join
the NFL. The hockey foray turned sour quickly when talks to build a
new arena collapsed. The team even temporarily abandoned the
Coliseum, where it plays, in a dispute over safety.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein absented himself from involvement in the Islanders to
focus on his Browns bid, then on the Redskins. But the league's
approval process has bewildered the Milstein camp, people involved
in the negotiations say, forcing the Milsteins to wonder if
questions of personality and business style _ not finances _ are
really behind the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein and his partners would not comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, if we voted for personality, we'd have a four-team
league,'' said Art Modell, who moved the Cleveland team to
Baltimore in 1996 and renamed it the Ravens, leaving behind the
Browns name and colors.
</P>
<P>
   The Milsteins have squabbled with the league over how easily
their real estate assets could be extricated from family
partnerships if the team's finances collapsed. They have also
fought over the amount of cash or equity they are putting into the
purchase, and whether financing secured by debt-free real estate is
essentially equity.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which lets owners borrow up to $100 million against
their teams, would prefer that any prospective new owners bankroll
their purchases of high-priced franchises with loans against stock
holdings, as did Lerner, who is chairman of MBNA Inc., the credit
card issuer, and McCombs, a co-founder of Clear Channel
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most highly leveraged purchase in the history of
team sports in this country,'' Browne, the NFL official, said of
the Milstein deal, ``and we want to make sure that Societe Generale
isn't our partner if something happens financially to the
Milsteins.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and chairman of
the finance committee, said: ``I don't think there's any doubt of
Milstein's significant net worth, but you have the question of
liquidity. And I don't think anyone questions Howard's ability to
do an excellent job. But this is a complex transaction, and we want
security between the team and the lender.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell said that rejecting Milstein might expose the league to a
lawsuit of ``monumental proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the deal is rejected, the Cooke estate, which would
put the proceeds of the sale in an educational foundation, might
have a claim against the league because of its binding agreement
with the Milstein group. In January, the estate rejected the
league's request to consider John Kent Cooke's bid even if though
it was not the top one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trustees want to receive the sale proceeds as soon as
possible,'' said Stuart Haney, one of the trustees for the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If Milstein loses, the estate would at least have to start a new
sale process, which could take months. Still, league officials say
they are not worried about the prospect of costly litigation. ``You
can't conduct business being concerned about lawsuits,'' Browne
said about the Cooke estate's possibly challenging a rejection in
court. ``The NFL has to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   The contentiousness and pace of the process have led various
Washington politicians to press the NFL commissioner, Paul
Tagliabue, to expedite the approval process. Bob Dole, the former
senator and presidential candidate, serving as head of a local
business group, wrote a letter to Tagliabue. So did Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., also chimed
in by calling Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   One point of contention has concerned the NFL's hiring of a
company run by Terry Lenzner, a private detective, to check
Milstein's background. Lenzner once served as a Watergate
prosecutor and was hired by the Clinton White House last year to
investigate potential witnesses in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation. By contrast, the NFL used in-house staff to
investigate the seven bidders, including Milstein, who vied for the
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   But when the staff looked at the Redskins proposal, Browne said,
it recommended that ``further review would be required if the
Milstein group were the eventual winner.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the dispute will end. ``If they want Milstein
out, they'll need a powerfully good reason to pre-empt him,'' said
Modell, the Baltimore Ravens owner. ``But if this is an attempt to
discourage him from going forward, they chose the wrong guy.''

NEW MEXICO CENTER HAS UCONN'S ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ After the Connecticut basketball players practiced at
McNichols Arena Friday, the two most talked about people were Jim
Calhoun and Kenny Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun is the coach who could not work for a second straight
day because of an intestinal virus, but who plans to be on the
sideline for Saturday's game versus New Mexico. Thomas is New
Mexico's mobile center who could be in UConn's face more than
Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas offered a dazzling display of muscles and moves before
fouling out with 20 points in New Mexico's 61-59 triumph over
Missouri on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Huskies watched part of the thrilling first-round
game that preceded their 91-66 conquest of Texas-San Antonio and
conceded that the 6-foot-8-inch, 260-pound Thomas surprised them
with his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better than I thought he was,'' forward Kevin Freeman
said. ``He's got the shake and bake. He's got the nice jump shot.
It's going to be a tough matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Voskuhl, who is 6-11 and 245, widened his eyes when he was
asked about Thomas and, suddenly sounding like he was 5-11 and 145,
said, ``He's big.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Thomas big enough and bad enough to lead the ninth-seeded
Lobos (25-8) over the top-seeded Huskies (29-2)? Probably not, but
Thomas' versatility certainly got UConn's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Arkansas (23-10) will oppose fifth-seeded Iowa
(19-9) in the second game of the West Regional, with the two
winners advancing to Phoenix for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas was told that some Huskies had admired his play, he
coyly said: ``They're being humble. Come on, it's UConn. We just
want to be able to hang with them. If we lose by 10, I'll be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters doubted Thomas, but he said: ``I mean it. If we lose
by 30 or 40, I don't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaying UConn will take more than just Thomas, who averages 18.5
points and 9.9 rebounds. The Lobos could be susceptible to UConn's
pressure defense because John Robinson 2nd, a freshman point guard,
can be erratic.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's defense does not frighten opponents and Thomas, who
has fouled out in four of his seven career NCAA tournament games,
must stay on the court or the Lobos are doomed. Still, Thomas,
contradicted his other comments when he said he was ``not worried
at all'' about the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, it seemed risky that Voskuhl, who has a stress
fracture in his right foot, played 24 minutes on Thursday,
including nine minutes in the second half. Voskuhl said he needed
the court time, but the Huskies would have been forlorn if he had
injured himself in a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to play,'' Dave Leitao, the associate head coach who
replaced Calhoun, said. ``I thought he needed to get a little bit
of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's virus prevented him from coaching Thursday's game, and
the 56-year-old coach attended Friday's practice but was unable to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I 100 percent plan to be here at 12 o'clock tomorrow to face a
good New Mexico team,'' Calhoun said. &QL;

CINCINNATI CRUISES INTO SECOND ROUND MATCHUP WITH TEMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins finds his team as
intriguing as everyone else does.
</P>
<P>
   ``From minute to minute I don't know what to expect from these
guys,'' Huggins said Friday after the third-seeded Bearcats
defeated George Mason, 72-48, at the Fleet Center in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cincinnati will play sixth-seeded Temple, which also
grappled its way to the second round of the East Regional Friday
with a 61-54 victory over 11th-seeded Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins understands that there is a certain fascination with his
team, because Cincinnati (27-5) is the only team to have beaten
Duke this season. To that end, it is conceivable that even Duke,
seemingly invulnerable, is watching Cincinnati from the other side
of the East bracket with a wary eye.
</P>
<P>
   But if Duke knows which Cincinnati is going to show up _ the one
that beat Duke back in November or the one that lost three straight
games last month _ Huggins would like to know, too.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as Cincinnati made its eighth consecutive NCAA
tournament appearance, 14th-seeded George Mason shot so poorly that
it should have called itself the George Masons. Huggins did not
learn too much new about his team, not when the opposition made
just 16.1 percent of its shots in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that the Temple game on Sunday may enlighten
Huggins about his team. Good shots will not come easily in a match
of these defensive-minded teams, but victory would be especially
significant for Cincinnati, which has not survived the first
weekend of play in the NCAA tournament in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could come out Sunday and make virtually everything we
shoot, or miss everything,'' Huggins said with his usual humorless
delivery. ``We don't shoot it straight sometimes, but I think we're
one of the best defensive teams in the nation. That keeps us in a
lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Cincinnati does not get to at least a third tournament
game this year, it will become known as a great 1990s college
basketball program with a string of disappointing tournament
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati won 27 games last season and 26 the season before. As
a second-seeded team in 1998 and as a third-seeded team in 1997,
Cincinnati never got out of the second round. The trend is obvious
to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get through the first weekend to show that we are
a respected program,'' the junior forward Ryan Fletcher said.
``We've had two good regular seasons and we have to show it's not a
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Success this month would prove that Cincinnati's 77-75 victory
over Duke on Nov. 28 in the final of the Great Alaska Shootout was
also not a fluke. Cincinnati made 57 percent of its field-goal
attempts in that game and forced Duke into 17 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were relentless that day,'' Melvin Levett said. ``That's
what we have to remember. If we can just get that attitude back.''
</P>
<P>
   TEMPLE 61, KENT 54
</P>
<P>
   Temple coach John Chaney, whose team has been in the same NCAA
bracket with Cincinnati for five straight seasons, recognizes
Cincinnati's most enduring on-the-court characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob gets his team to play tough, bordering on arrogance,''
Chaney said, referring to coach Bob Huggins almost admiringly.
</P>
<P>
   Temple was nearly as tough, as Kent made just 34.5 percent of
its shots. Temple's backcourt of Pepe Sanchez and Rasheed
Brokenborough divided 30 points. Sanchez, who missed 10 of 11 shots
in his last game, sank 5 of 8 shots today, including three
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (Fla.) 75, LAFAYETTE 54
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Johnny Hemsley sank eight straight 3-point shots and
nine overall to lead second-seeded Miami to a rout of 15th-seeded
Lafayette in the evening session. Lafayette, the Patriot League
champion, held an early lead before Hemsley made the first of five
3-pointers, staking Miami to a five-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley began the second half with another 3-pointer, the first
of 12 consecutive Miami points. He sank two more before missing,
then added another 3-pointer before leaving the game with three
minutes remaining.

ARIZONA'S MISTAKES COSTLY  
 UA BLOWS LEAD TO OKLAHOMA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ They didn't stick around long enough to enjoy a good
bratwurst.
</P>
<P>
   But then, there is a lot of that going around among Pac-10 teams
in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had talked a good game, about how it could draw strength
from its seniors, All-America point guard Jason Terry and
all-conference center A.J. Bramlett.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were certain that their successes in close games
all season would serve them well in the tournament, where the vast
majority of games become nail-biters.
</P>
<P>
   But holding a four-point lead and going to the line for two free
throws that could have clinched it with 1:02 minutes left Friday in
its Midwest Region opener against Oklahoma, Arizona conducted a
clinic on how to self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Wildcats were eliminated by the 13th-seeded
Sooners, 61-60.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inexperience finally caught up with us,'' UA Coach Lute
Olson said. ``That and a bad shooting game are a recipe for
disaster. I hate to see it end this way for our seniors, but we had
our chances and didn't close them out.''
</P>
<P>
   In that fateful final minute, Bramlett missed both free throws.
Then Sooners forward Eduardo Najera (17 points, 13 rebounds, three
steals, two blocked shots) swished a three-point basket over the
upraised arms of the 6-foot-10 Bramlett. That cut Arizona's lead to
60-59 with 48.2 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UA freshman forward Michael Wright instinctively picked up the
ball to inbound it. Normally, that's Bramlett's job. Wright sets
the screen to free Terry to catch the inbound pass.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who otherwise played a dominating game around the basket
(16 points, 12 rebounds, two blocked shots), thought he could
quickly get it in to Richard Jefferson before the Sooners set up
their full-court defense. Just as Wright began to pass, Jefferson,
who wasn't expecting it, turned to run downcourt. Wright tried to
catch himself before throwing the ball away, but his momentum
caused him to step across the end line, a violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners took the lead with 10 seconds remaining when forward
Ryan Humphrey rebounded a missed three-point try by Eric Martin and
put it back.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had one last chance. With the ball in the hands of
Terry, who brought a pile of national Player of the Year awards
with him to the tournament, they seemingly couldn't have been in
better position, even though it was not a vintage Terry
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Terry had the ball at the top of the key as the clock ticked to
five seconds. He drove on Alex Spaulding and put up a shot from 10
feet on the right wing. It missed.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson batted the ball and finally controlled it. His shot in
the lane over Humphrey came up short as the horn sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get a piece of the ball, he got a piece of my arm,''
Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no call, and the Wildcats, just like fellow Pac-10
teams UCLA and Washington, took a first-round leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disbelief,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Sooners Coach Kelvin Sampson not only had dropped five straight
games in the tournament, he was 0-15 against the Wildcats during
his years as coach at Pac-10 member Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say this was a satisfying win does not do it justice,''
Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ended the season with a 22-7 record. Terry, the Pac-10
leader in scoring, assists and steals, had carried the Wildcats,
but in this one, he made just 4 of 17 shots in scoring 15 points.
Bramlett, the Pac-10 runner-up in rebounding and double-doubles,
finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds, but missed the critical
free throws and failed to get to the rebound that Humphrey grabbed
to make the game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners aren't afraid to use 25 seconds off the shot clock
before firing away. After holding the ball, missing a three,
getting an offensive rebound (16 of their 38 rebounds were
offensive), holding the ball again, then scoring in threes while
the Wildcats (33 percent shooting) were misfiring, it didn't take
Oklahoma long to create a tempo to their liking against the Pac-10
scoring leader.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the Wildcats should have milked their advantage
harder in the low post with Wright and Bramlett, they concurred.
Arizona had an early nine-point lead until Bramlett picked up his
second foul and sat down with 8:34 left in the half. It took
Oklahoma only four minutes to tie the game with Bramlett out of
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were killing them in there,'' Bramlett said. ``We had a
stretch where we took a lot of long shots. We probably needed to be
more in tune with where our strengths and weaknesses were.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, who spent the week trying to convince the freshmen that
there was no reason to be tight, denied that he was tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I was hoisting up air balls,'' Terry said. ``I
took shots I normally take. A lot of times they rattled in and out
when I had a good look.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (21-10) moves on to the second round here Sunday
against North Carolina-Charlotte, a No. 5 seed that needed an
overtime Friday to dispatch 12th-seeded Rhode Island, 81-70. &QL;

<P>
   Stefan Albrecht Riesenfeld, an international law expert who
taught at the University of California and helped frame the
Constitution for West Germany after World War II, died on Feb. 17
at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, Calif. He was 90 and lived in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Riesenfeld, a native of Germany, officially retired and was
granted emeritus status in 1976 but continued to teach at Boalt
Hall, the law school at Berkeley, until last December.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking German, French and Italian and with two European law
degrees to his credit, he learned English only while studying at
Boalt Hall in the 1930s. He nonetheless graduated on time and near
the top of his class in 1937 and went on to receive a doctorate in
law at Harvard University three years later.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty at Berkeley in 1952 as a professor of law
after teaching at Harvard and the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last surviving founders of comparative international
law in the United States, he was an authority on property law,
creditors' recourse and bankruptcy, administrative law and legal
history in a career of more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote or edited 32 books dating to the 1940s, including most
recently ``Creditors' Remedies and Debtors' Protection: Cases and
Materials'' (4th ed., 1986; with a 1990 supplement),
``Parliamentary Participation in the Making and Operation of
Treaties: A Comparative Study'' (1994), and, with Robert B.
Krueger, ``The Developing Order of the Oceans'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   A native of Breslau _ now Wroclaw, Poland _ Stefan Riesenfeld
received law degrees from the University of Breslau in 1932 and the
University of Milan in 1934. Having a Jewish grandparent, he grew
leery at the Hitler's rise and moved to Italy before the Nazis took
power in Germany in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935 Boalt Hall was looking for an expert on the European
criminal codes and invited him to join the staff as a research
assistant. At Harvard, he studied under Felix Frankfurter, who
later became a Supreme Court justice, and while at Minnesota
obtained a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Riesenfeld is survived by his wife of 55 years, Phyllis
Thorgrimson Riesenfeld; two sons, Peter W., of Saunderstown, R.I.,
and Stefan C., of London, and two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. citizen since 1940, Riesenfeld turned down an Army
assignment to broadcast propaganda to the Germans in World War II
and instead served in the Navy in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, as a civilian legal adviser to the military
government in West Germany, he helped lay the foundation for the
basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany, whose Constitution
serves a reunited Germany.
</P>
<P>
   While in his 70s, he served two terms as counselor on
international law for the State Department and often represented
the United States before the International Court of Justice. He
helped revamp Hawaii's workers' compensation system in the 1970s
and helped develop human rights litigation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Riesenfeld was a visiting professor at
universities in Germany, Australia and New Zealand. Named the
Emanuel Heller professor at Boalt Hall in 1954, he attracted
students to his classes in droves to the end with his broad
knowledge, served up in humorous, if at times harsh, style.
</P>
<P>
   He lectured without a prepared text and expected to be listened
to and did not hesitate to aim his famously biting comments at
students who came to class ill prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his heart trouble, on the day before he died, Riesenfeld
finished grading blue books for a course on bankruptcy law he had
conducted the previous semester.

ROBERT POSTEL, COUNCILMAN WHO RAN FOR NEW YORK MAYOR, DIES AT 59  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Pa., Mo., Fla.)   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert I. Postel, a maverick Democratic New York City
councilman in the early 1970s who conducted a brief, unsuccessful
campaign for mayor, died on March 6 at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center. He was 59 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Postel died after a 15-month struggle with cancer of the
esophagus, said his wife, Joan L.S. Postel.
</P>
<P>
   During his stint as a councilman at large in Manhattan starting
in 1970, Postel gained a reputation as a political gadfly. He often
embarrassed the Republican administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay
with self-publicized investigations into allegations of corruption
and patronage in government institutions, including the Housing and
Development Administration, the Spofford Juvenile Center and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   His repeated assertions in 1971 that the Municipal Loan Program,
intended to help rehabilitate slum housing, had produced
multimillion-dollar fraud led to an investigation by the Manhattan
district attorney. Numerous officials and contractors were indicted
on charges stemming from allegations that they created fictitious
mortgages, offered kickbacks and paid for work not done. Only a few
of those charged were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics often accused Postel of making allegations that could
not be substantiated with the available evidence, leading to
well-publicized spats with officials from both parties. In the
Municipal Loan Program investigation, for example, Postel accused
the Lindsay administration of trying to hush him with the offer of
a city job. But a deputy mayor shot back that Postel was ``not
rational enough'' to be given a job in city government.
</P>
<P>
   On his official biography issued by the City Council, he listed
his interests as ``scuba-diving and, occasionally,
parachute-jumping.'' The morning after his wedding in October 1969,
he and his wife left their honeymoon hotel and handed out pamphlets
for his race for city councilman. In late 1972, Postel announced
that he would run for mayor and would refuse all donations from
real estate, banking or other major interests in the city. He
dropped out of the race in 1973 and ran instead for comptroller,
ending his career in politics when he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 9, 1939, in New York City, Postel graduated from
Dartmouth College in 1960 and from Harvard Law School in 1967.
After he left politics, he founded the First Wall Street Co., which
specialized in converting rental buildings to cooperative
apartments and other real estate development in New York, Florida
and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Darren, of
Philadelphia.

ADS ATTACK PATAKI'S PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS TO HOSPITALS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Attacking Gov. George Pataki directly for the
first time in four years, hospitals and health care workers began a
broadcast campaign Friday asserting that the governor's proposed
budget cuts would have dire consequences for health care, including
hospital closings.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began with a 60-second radio advertisement in the New
York metropolitan region and in Albany, and its sponsors say that
in trying to raise a public outcry to defeat the cuts, they are
prepared to expand the campaign to other parts of the state and to
television, and to spend millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in which he did not press for significant
changes in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor,
Pataki called this year for $800 million in cuts, despite a state
budget surplus expected to top $2 billion. Most of those cuts would
come in lower payments to hospitals and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy has never been better, the state has a huge
surplus, and so many hospitals are in financial trouble, why now
does the governor want to begin pummeling a major industry?'' asked
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, a trade group of 175 hospitals and nursing homes in
the New York metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, Pataki's press secretary, said: ``New York
spends more than $28 billion on health care, more than any other
state in the nation. The governor's budget maintains New York's
national leadership in health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest group of health care workers, and one of its
most politically powerful unions, 1199, the National Health and
Human Service Employees Union, remained neutral in Pataki's
re-election campaign last year. At the height of that campaign, the
president of the 120,000-member union, Dennis Rivera, stood by the
governor's side and praised him warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a coalition led by Rivera and Raske hopes to reprise its
effort of 1995, Pataki's first year in office, when it leveled an
advertising attack on the governor, his popularity plummeted and he
backed away from some of the deep cuts in Medicaid he was
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be much harder to damage the governor this time.
Four years ago, he was an unknown quantity, easily tarred as an
unfeeling archconservative. Today, he is much better known, highly
popular, widely seen as a moderate and fresh from a resounding
re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Its sponsors say that the initial purchase of air time is
$125,000 for the first week, comparable to the spending in a
political campaign. The coalition says it is also sending mailings
to 250,000 homes.

INVENTORS OF PAPER CLIPS AND TALL TALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capping a week that illuminated whole new
dimensions to the talents and accomplishments of this city's most
powerful politicians, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
revealed Friday that he was the inventor of the modern paper clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my service in the United States Congress,'' Lott, a
Mississippi Republican, said in a written statement, ``I took the
initiative in creating the paper clip. Paper clips bind us together
as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he for real? Not exactly, although he was doing an awfully
good imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's deadpan announcement, printed on his official letterhead,
was the latest and cleverest effort by Republicans to rib Vice
President Al Gore for a statement on Tuesday on CNN in which he
said he ``took the initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was referring to a legislative career in which he promoted
technological advancements, but his Republican colleagues obviously
thought his precise phrasing grabbed a tad too much credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president created the Internet,'' Rep. Dick Armey,
the House majority leader, said in a statement after Gore's
remarks, ``then I created the Interstate highway system.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's claim was a bit more ingenious, because it poked fun not
only at Gore but also at himself. Lott is famous for his
fastidiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news release said: ``Lott, known for his passion for
order, said that paper clips are a crucial element to a
well-organized office. Lott also noted that paper clips help
contribute to a growing economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The release quoted the senator as saying: ``Paper clips are the
engine of the U.S. economy. The Dow will soon break 10,000, due in
part to strong growth in the paper clip industry.''
</P>
<P>
   And it included six sketches chronicling the evolution of Lott's
sketches for the paper clip, culminating in the creation of the
current design on April 1, 1973. Note the month and day.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Miami, where the vice president
was visiting a federal ``empowerment zone,'' a spokesman for Gore
said that Lott's claim was apt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that Senator Lott and the Republicans are
taking credit for an invention that has been around for
centuries,'' the spokesman, Christopher S. Lehane, said, at least
partly in jest. ``After all, their policies are intended to take us
back to the Dark Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, the Gore camp was reaching a bit too far. The
paper clip, sired by a Norwegian man named Johan Vaaler, goes back
only about 100 years.

BOXING MAKES A COMEBACK AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM GERSHENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``One thing about the Sweet Science upon which all
initiates are in agreement is that it used to be better,'' wrote
A.J. Liebling in The New Yorker in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   So when heavyweight championship boxing returns to Madison
Square Garden Saturday night for the first time since 1992, it is a
safe bet that many will complain that the bout between Lennox Lewis
and Evander Holyfield can never live up to previous legendary bouts
at the Garden's various locations: Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier or
Jack Dempsey vs. Luis Firpo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is little doubt that the fight has captured the
imagination of many in the city and signals that boxing may be
returning to its historic base. Nearly 21,000 tickets have been
sold for Saturday night's event _ a full house _ the first boxing
sellout at the Garden since Roberto Duran fought Davey Moore in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices range from $100 to $1,500, but the fight is
available on pay-per-view for $50, and it is being talked about in
the barbershops and bars, the taxis and sandwich shops of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fights like this that make New York City the capital of
the world,'' said Mohammed Choudry, a taxi driver from Brooklyn who
has a miniature boxing glove hanging from his rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be hard to match the celebrity power of Frank
Sinatra, who sat ringside at the Ali-Frazier contest in 1971 and
took pictures for Life magazine. For Friday night's fight, the
Garden expects to counter with the presence of three New York
Knicks, two Rolling Stones, Jack Nicholson and Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the star-studded arena with all the silver
sparkles,'' Frazier said in a telephone interview from his gym in
Philadelphia this week.
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers see Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, as a slight
favorite, but some city residents remain skeptical. They wonder
whether Holyfield, the 36-year-old, 215-pound paladin who twice
defeated Mike Tyson, has the strength and stamina to defeat Lewis,
the WBC champion, who is three years younger and 30 pounds heavier,
but still relatively untested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wager on either guy,'' said Dee Tu, the sushi chef
at the Hi-Life Bar and Grill on Amsterdam Avenue and 83rd Street.
``The fight's too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the past, the Garden stands alone as the site of
big-time boxing in New York. Many boxers prefer fighting in New
York, rather than in a ring assembled in a casino parking lot in
Las Vegas or Atlantic City. Local fans are considered
knowledgeable, and the blood and sweat spilled by former champions
in both the new and old Gardens lend the arena an undeniable
mystique.
</P>
<P>
   After sparring on Wednesday, Holyfield said that fighting Lewis
in the Garden would enhance his own legacy. ``You're happy to get
the opportunity to fight there,'' he said. ``That's how you become
a part of what they call history.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Garden history has been glorious. There have been nights
that diminished the sport. In February 1993, Ray Mercer was accused
of offering Jesse Ferguson $100,000 to lose _ in the middle of
their fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer was later cleared of the charge, but the taint on the
sport remained. With the scent of corruption lingering and the
competition from casinos intensifying, the Garden closed its boxing
department later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Even after it reopened in 1995, not every event went smoothly. A
July 1996 fight between Andrew Golota and Riddick Bowe dissolved
into a brawl that engulfed the arena, injured 23 people and led to
13 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis vowed that he would not let the Garden's history distract
him. ``I'll be thinking about that 20-by-20-foot ring, and that's
all,'' he said after a recent workout.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lewis' manager, Emanuel Steward, says he expects the New
York crowd to energize the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Garden makes people go crazy,'' the manager said. ``It's
the biggest crowd, the loudest fans, and all that electricity makes
everyone go cuckoo.''
