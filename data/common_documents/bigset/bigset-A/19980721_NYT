THE CHASE FOR THE BROWNS: BIG NAMES, BIG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Warfield grew up in Warren, Ohio, played for Woody Hayes at
Ohio State, was the Cleveland Browns' No. 1 draft choice in 1964,
caught 271 passes for them and spent the 1980s with the team as an
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to own them _ or at least a small part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in northeast Ohio wanted to be a part of that
tradition, to touch that great power,'' he said during an interview
Monday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, a National Football League strategic planning
committee pondered how to select a Browns owner and how much to
charge the lucky bloke. A decision is expected in September, after
qualified candidates submit bids.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield, still slim at age 55, was in town to talk to Lamar
Hunt, the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, who is a member of the
NFL planning committee, and to pitch his group's credentials to
various news media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a challenge and an opportunity to restore the legacy
of the team after a three-year hiatus, to bring it back as big as
possible,'' he said, likening the allure of the Browns to the
emotional tie between the Yankees and their fans. For Warfield,
entering Cleveland Stadium for a Browns game struck him with as
much awe as visitors feel at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pinstripes in New York, orange and brown in Cleveland,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield would be the Browns' general manager if his group _ the
New York real estate developer Howard Milstein, whose family would
own 75 percent; Calvin Hill, the former Brown and Cowboy, and six
Cleveland business executives _ beats several other bidders to pay
at least $350 million for the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The revived Browns will start play in 1999, which will mark the
fourth season since Art Modell wrenched Cleveland's sporting heart
by moving the old Browns to Baltimore, where they play as the
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield's group paints itself as being particularly cohesive.
Hill and Milstein met at Riverdale Country Day School in the 1960s;
Hill and Warfield have known each other for more than 20 years. And
Warfield is quick to note that the bid was not a case of the very
wealthy Milstein needing two famous football names to make him less
of a carpetbagger to Cleveland and to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing started with Calvin,'' he said. ``We got
Howard Milstein. He didn't get Hill and Warfield.'' By the time
Milstein said yes, he was already an owner of another team, the
National Hockey League's Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Famous Investor scenario worked in reverse in the bid
financed by Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision Systems,
which owns Madison Square Garden. He brought in his brother, Larry,
a Cleveland-area lawyer, and they got Bill Cosby and Don Shula, the
former Miami Dolphins coach, to buy 5 percent stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prove our capabilities and stand on our own
laurels,'' Warfield said. ``I can't be concerned with the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dolan said: ``We don't care about the competition, whoever
they are.'' In this fluid situation, the formers Browns star Jim
Brown Monday backed Bart Wolstein, a Cleveland real estate
developer, in his quest to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, when all this wealth clashes in pursuit of a very
public asset, a scrum can ensue. The Warfield-Hill-Milstein group's
decision to add six prominent local businessmen as investors irked
some other moneyed folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milstein's got deep pockets, but what does he know about the
Cleveland Browns?'' Thomas Murdough, president of Step2 Corp., a
Cleveland-area bidder for the Browns, told Business Week. ``I have
lived here for 30 years. I've been a fan. I am emotionally
committed to the Browns, and I have the money, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Once talk fades about which bidder has the most famous or local
investors, which group can best uphold the Browns' legacy, or which
ownership has the best community relations plan, money will surely
shout the loudest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the Minnesota Vikings were worth $205 million to Red McCombs,
their new owner, the Browns will be worth far more because of a new
stadium with a sweet lease, a devout fan base and a stake in the
rich new television contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But how much? The NFL has not released all the financial
information needed by the bidders to determine how much makes sense
and how much is nutso. Should it be $300 million? $400 million?
$500 million?
</P>
<P>
   The entire process is still murky, but the haze may clear after
next week's meeting of owners in Dallas. Browns bidders are not
invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible we've gotten all the data we're going to get,
but I don't know,'' Larry Dolan said. ``They haven't been cute, but
I don't think they know what the process should be.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Five hundred million is not a price anyone wants to
pay. We've seen nothing to justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfield said his group had not set a ceiling price and would
not until the league handed over more data. ``We've heard
everything from $300 million to an impossible figure I won't even
talk about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody a wee bit anxious? ``I don't think I'll get antsy
until we get to September and there's no clear determination,''
Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're in July now and it's a little late,'' Warfield
said. ``Almost a year from today, we'll play our first preseason
game.''

WEB-SAVVY WORD MAGAZINE WINS AN UNLIKELY SAVIOUR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Minn., Texas)   (js) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it was born three years ago, the literary Web
magazine Word was widely praised as an example of how good Internet
content could be, a kind of hip, lo-fi New Yorker magazine for a
new generation.
</P>
<P>
   It attracted well-known authors like Mary Gaitskill, who wrote
about her first sunburn, and David Foster Wallace, who excerpted a
chapter of his novel ``Infinite Jest.'' The magazine won awards,
and its hard-working, low-profile editor, Marisa Bowe, even ended
up with her picture in Esquire, one of its ``women we love.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem? Like other worthy endeavors in the still
unmapped world of Internet commerce, Word made no money. Its
corporate parent, Icon CMT, which once dreamed of fast profits in
Web magazines, closed it last March without so much as a courtesy
call. (``They walked in at 5 and said, `Be out of here by 7,' ''
Ms. Bowe recalled.)
</P>
<P>
   But now, after months of dire ``content is dead'' predictions
from Web watchers, Word is being reborn.
</P>
<P>
   Its unlikely savior is a Houston company that was founded as an
oil business in the 1950s by a young George Bush but that now
focuses on processing protein extracted from fish. This summer the
company suddenly announced that it would become a major player on
the World Wide Web, though it had no experience in the Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Zapata, controlled by the Glazer family of
Rochester, then changed the name of its Internet division to the
more cybercool Zap. Like a lonely heart looking for a date, it
began advertising in newspapers across the country to buy Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   It is a turn of events that Ms. Bowe says can sound like a
parody of the Internet business, something Word itself might have
published. The staff members now call a Louisiana fish meal
company, one of Zapata's holdings, when they have questions about
their health plan. (``They're really sweet,'' Ms. Bowe says of her
new personnel department.)
</P>
<P>
   And the editors count among their new corporate colleagues the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a team also owned by the Glazers. ``It's all
kind of nerve-racking,'' Ms. Bowe said one morning last week before
meeting with her staff, ``but that's the Internet business
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when she first heard about Zapata she ``pictured
some egomaniac Texan with a big hat going, `Hey, I want to get into
the content business.' '' But whatever worries remain, her new
backers have assured her not to worry about one thing: Word can
continue to pursue its defiantly nontraditional vision without
interference.
</P>
<P>
   It will still have no celebrity profiles and no reviews. It will
continue to publish funny, raw, sometimes disturbing and mostly
first-person articles about subjects ranging from sex to getting
stabbed. In other words, it will continue to have a slim chance of
raking in a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Avram Glazer, Zapata's chief executive, seems not to mind. ``We
didn't buy them because we wanted People magazine,'' he said,
adding that, besides, he finds Ms. Bowe ``witty and easy to work
with.''

 NEW YORK: work with.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The magazine is a creation that Ms. Bowe, 39, has been
cultivating, almost unwittingly, for a long time. Growing up in
Minneapolis, where her father worked for Control Data Corp., she
would roam around a crude precursor to the Web developed by the
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, she used the early technology mostly to flirt on
line with male programmers. ``So my first primal experiences with
computers were all sexy, fun, social,'' she said. Then came the
second part of her education, in which she developed what she calls
a populist's passion for the unadorned and unrehearsed in American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   There was the job as a trainee lumberjack, then as a cocktail
waitress and a taxi driver, all in Minneapolis (``my
mini-Jack-Londonette trip'').
</P>
<P>
   She got involved in the city's punk scene, which meant mostly
that she ``chased the boys in the bands and got dressed up in cool
clothes.'' She can now think of it as ``developing my visual
esthetic through the medium of sartorial expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to New York 13 years ago, she finally graduated from
college, Columbia University, with a degree in modern European
history. She became involved in a ``Marxist guerrilla video
collective'' that produced angry public access television programs
and then she managed an on-line interactive bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   All of that left her with a distinct yearning to create a Web
publication for ``people turned off by the incessant glare of
publicity and promotion and gloss and perfect people using perfect
things.''
</P>
<P>
   But one that was more funny than preachy. (A good sense of the
tone can be gained by reading an editor's letter that Ms. Bowe
posted at Word's Web site _ www.word.com _ which will become active
again in September. Betraying a broad smirk, she asks loyal readers
to remember that the magazine is ``erudite, aggressively
avant-garde, trenchant and metastasizing ergonomically,'' which is
not always easy because it also tends to be hermeneutical and
``ur-echt-gestalt-schadenfreude-y,'' which loosely translated means
taking pleasure in pointing out American society's defects).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowe said that the magazine world is filled with niche
publications aimed at small groups of readers, like, for example,
baking enthusiasts. ``Word is for people with a certain kind of a
sensibility,'' she said. ``There are probably more of them out
there than bakers.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, smiling nervously, ``But maybe not.''

PAPER GETTING TAX BREAK TO STAY IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in two years, The New York Post
has received large tax breaks and other subsidies from city and
state officials after threatening to move some of its operations
out of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have granted the newspaper $24.4 million in incentives
to build a new printing plant on 17 acres at a rail yard in the
South Bronx. The deal, which included a $12.9 million cash grant
from the state that was approved Monday, has been criticized by
community groups, environmentalists and some politicians who
doubted that the company actually intended to leave New York.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Levine, deputy mayor for economic development, said the
deal would enable The Post to build a $200 million plant and
transfer 400 valuable manufacturing jobs to the South Bronx from
the company's printing plant on South Street, near the Brooklyn
Bridge. City and state officials had feared that The Post would
follow The Daily News to Jersey City, N.J., where that newspaper
built a printing plant that opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say The Daily News has had occasional problems
transporting newspapers through the tunnels into Manhattan during
the morning rush, a problem that would discourage other newspapers
from moving operations to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another case of the city and the state throwing away
hard-earned tax dollars on a company that would not have left the
city anyway,'' said Franz Leichter, a state senator from the Bronx.
``Certainly, The Daily News shows the folly of moving these kind of
jobs to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $12.9 million cash grant from Empire State
Development Corp., the deal brings The Post $4 million in sales tax
breaks and $7.5 million in low-cost electricity from the New York
State Power Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity to keep and grow manufacturing
jobs in the city,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Post is not the only newspaper to obtain subsidies. In 1992,
The New York Times got a benefit package worth more than $29
million for a new $315 million printing plant at College Point,
Queens. The following year, The Daily News got more than $15
million in tax breaks from New Jersey to move its printing
operations from Brooklyn to Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   The Post and its parent company, News America, have now gone to
the bargaining table with New York officials twice in recent years.
In 1996, the city granted News America a $20.7 million package for
the company's new headquarters at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, at
47th Street, after it had threatened to move some employees outside
New York. News America transferred 400 editorial employees at The
Post to the midtown building from South Street.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development
Corp., said Monday that News America had refused to include The
Post printing plant in the original deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the latest agreement with The Post cost a modest
$9,600 per job to keep the Post printing plant in New York City,
far less than the subsidy given The New York Times. ``We're getting
jobs in the South Bronx for a good price,'' Millard said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Millard's calculations did not include both the value of the
electricity from the State Power Authority and the $12.9 million in
cash benefits granted by the state. All told, the deal to keep 400
manufacturing jobs cost taxpayers about $61,000 per full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   The Post project would benefit further from millions of dollars
in tax benefits and training grants that are available because the
site of the new plant in the Bronx is within the city's Empowerment
Zone.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is to be located in what is known as the Harlem River
Yards, in the Port Morris section of the Bronx, and also includes
an adjacent eight-acre parcel that contains the Walnut Avenue bus
depot.
</P>
<P>
   The bus depot had been scheduled to close in two years, but the
Post deal forced the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to
relocate 220 buses to five depots in the Bronx and upper Manhattan
and to spend an additional $1.6 million to speed the completion of
a bus depot along the West Side Highway in Manhattan that will open
when the depot in the Walnut Avenue station closes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Reuter, president of New York City Transit, has
acknowledged that it would cost more to run Bronx buses from a
depot in Manhattan.

KONERKO SAYS LASORDA DIDN'T LIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On June 27, with trade rumors raging, Los Angeles
Dodgers interim general manager Tom Lasorda pulled rookie Paul
Konerko aside and assured him that he would not be part of a trade
to Cincinnati for closer Jeff Shaw. Exactly seven days later, on
July 4, Konerko was sent to the Reds with pitcher Dennis Reyes for
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was lying to me,'' Konerko said of Lasorda on
Monday, while making his first visit to Dodger Stadium with the
Reds. ``I think when he told me, that (retaining Konerko) is
exactly what their plans were, and a week later it changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko laughed. ``It made me relax for the next week. It makes
for a funny story.''
</P>
<P>
   He also chuckles when he recalls the immediate aftermath of the
first meeting with Lasorda. Konerko says he conveyed his no-trade
news to Dodgers reserve catcher Tom Prince. Prince's response:
``That's the kiss of death.''

NYC POLICY BANNING RALLIES AT CITY HALL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, JUDGE
RULES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By XXXXXXXXXXX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Monday that a
city policy banning large groups from holding news conferences or
rallies on the steps of City Hall was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that the mayor used the policy selectively to
allow groups like the Young Republicans to gather there, while
blocking an AIDS advocacy group that had been critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city had argued that the policy, which limits
the number of people attending such events on the steps to 25, was
necessary to protect the security of City Hall and the safety of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. But the AIDS advocacy group, Housing Works,
argued in a lawsuit that the city had routinely made exceptions to
the rule for certain groups.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Harold Baer Jr. sided with the AIDS organization.
</P>
<P>
   Citing large gatherings on the City Hall steps, like the rally
in May, attended by about 300 people, to honor Yankee pitcher David
Wells' perfect game, Baer said that he was troubled by the lack of
guidelines regarding exceptions. And he suggested that the policy
could be used to punish the mayor's political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City, in practice, appears to have unbridled discretion to
grant exceptions to the policy,'' Baer wrote. ``Arguably then, the
City could grant exceptions to those groups whose speech it agrees
with and deny exceptions to those groups whose speech it disagrees
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Baer did not explicitly declare that the Giuliani
administration had enforced the policy only against its critics, he
wrote that ``the evidence demonstrated that the policy is not
administered evenhandedly.'' Without written guidelines on
exceptions, he added, ``this type of discretion, I find, runs afoul
of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the Police Department to allow Housing Works
to hold a news conference on Tuesday morning at 10, involving up to
50 people. The group had recently requested to hold a rally with as
many as 50 people, and had been turned down, prompting the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning to show up,'' said Charles King, one of the
group's two executive directors. ``We plan to be there loud and
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that they would not appeal the ruling, in
which Baer also called for New York City's ``thoughtful and astute
Corporation Counsel to fashion a policy which meets Constitutional
muster.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a ``policy should spell out in narrow, definite and
objective terms'' any exceptions to 25-person limit, the judge
added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the corporation counsel, Michael Hess, and the
Police Department spokesman, Marilyn Mode, said that both agencies
would work together ``to develop a clear written policy that
encompasses Judge Baer's guidelines.''

KONERKO WON'T MISS L.A. PRESSURE COOKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The blessing is no longer shrouded in disguise for
Paul Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was crestfallen when he learned on the Fourth of
July that he'd been traded by the Los Angeles Dodgers with pitcher
Dennis Reyes to Cincinnati for closer Jeff Shaw _ 168 hours after
interim general manager Tom Lasorda had assured him he would not be
part of any deal with Cincinnati for closer Jeff Shaw _ Konerko now
embraces this new opportunity enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   The most important consideration: On a young, recontructing Reds
team, he's getting to play. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to the boyishness of just coming to the
park every day and playing,'' Konerko said Monday at Dodger Stadium
before his first encounter with his former team. ``Every time I
came to the park in L.A., I was wondering, `Am I going to get
traded? Am I going to get sent down? What am I doing today?' I
don't know. I guess I didn't handle that well. It's tough. It's a
pressure cooker over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Reds, Konerko hasn't hit his weight (.182
entering Monday night's game), and he arrived in L.A. with a
hitless streak of 11 at-bats. If he had stayed with the Dodgers,
given the panic that has marked the Fox Group's stewardship of the
franchise this year, Konerko probably would have been optioned to
Albuquerque twice, San Antonio once, traded, reacquired, and
converted to pitcher by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a position where we can afford to run him out
there,'' said Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon, whose low-budget team
is eight games under .500 and features five regulars under the age
of 27. ``We don't put any pressure on him. We try to encourage him.
What I tell him is not to try to do too much. `We didn't bring you
over here to carry us. Just have fun.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Konerko, 22, might also find that enjoyment of this
game is much more likely away from the crush of expectation that
accompanied his Dodgers career.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a rich history of building up their
minor-league sluggers to dizzying heights, a condition that has
resulted in a long string of major-league disappointments. Greg
Brock. Mike Marshall. Billy Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko, during an anxious first month as an everyday player
this year, was shaping up to be the next clunker off the
promotional assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it compounds the pressure and creates a problem, but I
don't think it's unique to this organization,'' said Dodgers first
baseman Eric Karros, who feels he _ and Mike Piazza _ benefited
from not busting down the fences in Triple-A Albuquerque, where the
elevation is 5,000 feet and the Pacific Coast League pitching is
largely ragged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these guys come up and don't succeed right out of the
chute,'' Karros added, ``it increases the pressure. When you first
get up here, it's tough enough to play at this level, let alone to
play here in L.A. And then to have the weight of all these
expectations _ that's another burden you don't need on your
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The others were certainly bent by the load.
</P>
<P>
   When Brock hit 44 home runs and drove in 138 runs at Albuquerque
in 1982, Ben Wade, who headed the Dodgers' scouting department at
the time, declared him the organization's best power-hitting
prospect since Duke Snider. Brock went on to average a quiet 18
home runs and 55 RBI, while batting .233, in four-plus seasons with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall won the Pacific Coast League triple crown (.373
average, 34 homers, 137 RBI) in '81, one year before Brock's
exploits. Marshall averaged 19 homers and 68 RBI in seven full
seasons in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley was USA Today's minor-league player of the year in '94 on
the strength of his .345 average, 37 homers and 105 RBI in
Triple-A. Before the Dodgers gave up on him this year, he struck
out 38 percent of the time up here and never cracked double digits
in home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko? Albuquerque pitching coach Claude Osteen surveyed this
young man's bat speed and power to all fields and invoked the name
of Mike Schmidt for purposes of comparison. Phew.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko was consensus minor-league player of the year in '97
after putting up numbers in Albuquerque _ .323 average, 37 home
runs, 127 RBI _ that were worthy of ... well, those other guys.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking spring training with the big club this year, he
batted .209 in 58 games before the trade, but he insists it wasn't
owed to any external factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel anybody put the pressure on me,'' Konerko said.
``Nobody said, `You have to hit home runs.' I probably put the
pressure on myself. I probably tried to do too much. When things
started going bad, the only way I could get back in good graces was
to do something huge (like a home run attempt) instead of just
getting a hit here, a hit there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I tried to put a whole season inside 75 at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko now operates at a more measured pace.
</P>
<P>
   Being traded to the Reds, Karros said of his ex-teammate, was
``the best thing for him. And I told him that.... In Cincinnati,
the guy's going to play every day. There's no expectation. There's
no `you've got to fill somebody's shoes.' There's no `they're
trying to win this year.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most important of all, no ghosts of disappointing
sluggers past.

DISNEY HALL ON TARGET WITH FUND-RAISING GOAL

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After years of feuds, false starts and promises,
the Walt Disney Concert Hall has passed a major milestone with the
announcement it has raised $196 million for the facility's
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, who took charge of the fund-raising operation 2 1/2
years ago, said Monday some $20 million in contributions from
various sources meant the Disney Hall board had met the 95 percent
goal set by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to allow
the project to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now within arm's length of completing Disney Hall fund
raising,'' said Broad, who chairs the Disney Hall oversight board.
</P>
<P>
   Broad also announced that the board has reached agreement with
architect Frank O. Gehry, who designed the hall to be the new home
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, to complete the construction
working plans and to oversee administration on the site across the
street from the Music Center in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Both steps are considered important in that they provide the
funding from private sources to complete the building and ends the
controversy with Gehry over his role in the project. Gehry had been
upset when it was suggested another firm do the working drawings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the controversies were all blown up,'' Broad said.
``In the end, however, we were able to get it resolved. The nice
thing now is that everyone seems happy with where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the project is to have the fund raising audited
and have the plans submitted to the Board of Supervisors by the end
of October.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he hopes to see construction begin in April on the
2,350-seat hall, with the work expected to be completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The latest contributors allowing the Concert Hall to meet its
goal include the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, the Thomas and
Dorothy Leavey Foundation, Flora L. Thornton, the Skirball
Foundation, Majestic Realty Co., PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
Jefferies Group, the partners of Arthur Andersen, Merrill Lynch,
Ambassador and Mrs. Glen Holden, Unova Inc., Kathrine and Frank
Baxter, and Tennenbaum &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said the Disney Hall group also has raised $20 million
toward a permanent endowment for the Disney Hall and to make
improvements at the Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   The project was expanded to include the Roy O. and Edna F.
Disney California Institute of the Arts Theater and the offices of
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Both have received commitments from
the CalArts and the Philharmonic to raise the funds needed to
complete construction.
</P>
<P>
   The concert hall was first proposed in 1988 with a $50 million
gift from Walt Disney's widow, Lillian.
</P>
<P>
   However, the project languished for years because of the
county's ongoing financial problems and escalating estimates of the
cost of construction.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Broad and Mayor Richard Riordan revived the
project in 1995, each pledging $5 million toward it, that county
officials agreed to allow the private fund-raising plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney family pledged an additional $25 million to keep the
concert hall project alive. &QL;

A WINNING COMEBACK FOR IVANKOV OF BELARUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Ivan Ivankov of Belarus is the reigning world
all-around champion, but he has much to prove to himself. The true
measure of success in gymnastics remains the Olympics. On that
count, the 23-year-old Minsk resident has registered a zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics is the Olympics and nothing will change that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivankov had just won the European championships in 1996 when he
went to Atlanta with gold-medal hopes and a sore Achilles' tendon.
At the urging of the Belarus team, he visited a doctor in the
Olympic Village. As he walked away from the examination table, the
tendon snapped in two. He faced an arduous rehabilitation and a
four-year wait for another chance at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ivankov is now two years into his comeback, and on Monday night
the Goodwill Games presented another challenge for him to measure
his progress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ivankov did not astound the cozy gathering of 2,278 at the
Nassau Coliseum on Monday night, but he avoided costly mistakes in
winning the all-around and a $10,000 check. His score of 57.500 was
pushed by evening highs of 9.750 on the rings, 9.775 on the
parallel bars and 9.575 on the horizontal bar. ``Sometimes you
don't have to be spectacular,'' he said. ``Sometimes you just need
to finish your routines.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Bondarenko of Russia, who was second to Ivankov at the
world championships, took the silver (56.70) and Blaine Wilson of
the United States (56.575) finished third. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a flawless dismount from the high bar, his final event,
Ivankov thrust his fists into the air. He knew he had passed
another comeback test. ``Not bad,'' he said. ``It can't be
perfect.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many concede that Ivankov is the most talented male gymnast in
the world. But living up to that billing has been a strain. `'It's
a lot easier to be a champion than to prove you're a champion,''
said Nellie Kim, the vice president of the Belarus Gymnastics
Association. ``He can handle it. The key is to not make a mistake
in preparation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where the difference can often be measured in
hundredths of points, Ivankov can be commanding. He won the world
championship last year in Lausanne, Switzerland, despite falling
off the pommel horse _ a half-point deduction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ahead is just one major meet, the 1999 world championships,
between now and the Sydney Olympics, and Ivankov is confident his
improvement will continue. `'It's my next step up,'' he said. &QL;

OLIVER HOPES SPEED WILL GIVE HIM EDGE WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys training camp has already
left Jimmy Oliver with the need to replenish fluids intravenously
after one practice.
</P>
<P>
   And the former TCU receiver is mired in a horse race for playing
time on a team with 10 wideouts in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oliver, who was a track All-American for the Horned Frogs,
is trying to use his 4.15-second speed in the 40-yard dash _ which
makes him maybe the fastest on the team _ to stay ahead in the race
to be the No. 1 kickoff returner.
</P>
<P>
   But Oliver knows being in the running this summer easily beats
sitting on the sidelines. A second-round draft pick for San Diego
in 1995, the 5-foot-10, 186-pound speedster has yet to play a down
of football in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had the talent,'' Oliver said. ``All I did was
continue to train. I worked out like crazy. That motivated me. I
started realizing I will face obstacles. A man is judged by how you
face obstacles and overcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's had his share to overcome. Oliver sustained a
season-ending separated shoulder during the 1995 preseason, his
rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he sprained his left knee during the final preseason
game and sat out the entire year. Last year, he entered camp with
ligament problems in his right knee, had arthroscopic surgery and
was waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting out was hard,'' Oliver said. ``I'd look at people I
played against and with and know I could be out there. Then you
have to listen to questions from your friends, who constantly asked
why you weren't out there. After a while, they started seeing the
pain I was going through and the questions stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has been a pain to Cowboys defensive backs on the
practice field at Midwestern State, repeatedly burning the Cowboys'
secondary to catch deep balls in an effort to prove that he can
fill the team's void for a deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Oliver has been impressive. He
said the only question the team had was whether Oliver was
injury-prone after a spate of mishaps the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Oliver's added weight and strength, however, Gailey
said he believes Oliver's problems might be behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing about Jimmy is that he had a great
off-season,'' Gailey said. ``He is a lot stronger. That allowed him
to overcome the wear and tear of getting beat on in this game of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who said he spent last season working out and has gained
roughly 10 pounds since his days at TCU, almost signed with NFL
Europe last spring. He backed out and decided to wait on an NFL
team.
</P>
<P>
   The wait was worth it when Gailey added former TCU coach Tommy
Robinson to the coaching staff. Robinson, who has kept in touch
with Oliver throughout his three-season ordeal, said he was looking
to help the Cowboys and a former pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good relationship and maintained good contact after
he left TCU,'' Robinson said. ``When coach Gailey brought me in, I
told him there was a guy out there with good speed that we should
bring in for a tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he also had the advantage of knowing Oliver did
not have a history of injuries and felt that his problems the past
three years were more the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't an injury-prone kid,'' Robinson said. ``It was a
situation where I knew him and knew what he was about. He had some
mishaps in San Diego, but I felt if we could get him in here, he
could turn into a player. I don't know what will happen. But I know
what he is capable of doing and that he has the ability to help the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has been everything Robinson thought he would be. He ran
the 40-yard dash in a time of 4.28 seconds during his tryout
workout and beat that with a sizzling 4.15 a few weeks before
training camp. He will be the team's No. 1 kickoff returner in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Considering what he went through the past three years, Oliver
said things could haven't worked out better. The Dallas Adamson
graduate grew up watching the Cowboys and idolizing Drew Pearson
and Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother \RWanda\S is loving it,'' he said. ``She has been
calling me every night. We can't wait until the season starts. It's
going to be exciting to have my mother come to a game at Texas
Stadium. ''

COWBOYS PLAN TO KEEP GODFREY AT OUTSIDE LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ One day after linebacker Broderick Thomas
was lost of the season with a knee injury, Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said the great experiment of moving strong-side linebacker
Randall Godfrey to the middle is basically over.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said yesterday the team will continue to give Godfrey
snaps at middle linebacker but said the starting linebackers most
likely will not change.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had hoped Thomas' presence would allow Godfrey to
compete with Fred Strickland for the starting spot at middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Thomas on the roster, the team plans to sign
free-agent linebacker K.D. Williams, Cowboys vice president Stephen
Jones said, adding that the team hoped to bring Williams to camp
last night and have him signed for practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who played at Henderson State in Arkansas, played in
Canada in 1995 and 1996 and spent the past season with the
Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL-Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the Cowboys don't plan to sign a more experienced
veteran to fill Thomas' role at linebacker or pass-rushing end,
Jones said. COWBOYS AND BEANIE BABIES
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys plan to give away Beanie Babies before the
regular-season opener against the Arizona Cardinals on Sept. 6 at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Stadium personnel will distribute authentic TY Beanie
Babies, along with a Cowboys collector's card, to the first 10,000
children 14 and under. The Cowboys will give out ``Chocolate
Moose'' Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a promotion that is being enthusiastically received
throughout the country,'' Cowboys spokesman Joel Finglass said.
``We wanted to be the first team in the NFL to become involved with
a Beanie Babies giveaway.
</P>

MERCURY RUNS OVER MON ARCHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The coaches ordering the listless Mercury to open the
second half in a zone defense was like a slap to the face that
ended up stinging the Sacramento Monarchs on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of an insult,'' guard Bridget Pettis said, worse
than the bleep-bleep-bleep speech she said Coach Cheryl Miller
unloaded because of a 33-31 deficit. ``I think everybody was upset
because we kind of take pride in our man-to-man defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (12-4) only needed a few possessions in the zone to
confuse the Monarchs (4-13) and more importantly ignite an offense
that also was missing in Saturday's loss to New York. The Mercury
hung 57 points, a team record for a half, on Sacramento in the
final 20 minutes to win, 88-67, and give the waiting Houston Comets
reason to come prepared at 7 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA Western Conference-leading Comets (16-1), who held the
Monarchs to 13 first-half points in a 75-44 win Saturday, have been
here since, plotting how to avenge their only defeat, 69-66, also
at America West Arena on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more special playing Phoenix because they're one of the
premier teams in the league, not so much having anything to do with
the first game,'' said Comets Coach Van Chancellor, who was among a
crowd of 13,257 Monday. ``We're in a major battle with this team.
They run so many offenses that they're hard to prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, of course, is a handful for everyone with its Big Three
of Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson, who combine
for 52.5 points per game. But the Mercury is not exactly quaking at
the challenge of snapping the Comets' league-record 11-game win
streak, even in the second of back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared of Houston at all,'' point guard Michele Timms
said. ``I think we're the one team that matches up reasonably well
against Houston. I think the last time we beat them wasn't a fluke,
and I think we can do it again. I'll be actually disappointed if we
don't win this one at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, still without consecutive losses, completes a
six-game homestand tonight. Nine of its final 13 regular-season
games are on the road, including two in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Timms (9) and Umeki Webb (7) tied their career assists high,
dishing off 11 of those in the second half when the Mercury used
the momentum from scoring the final six points of the first half to
stretch the run to 20-2.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, forging through its season without All-WNBA first
team guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield (knee surgery), got back within
six, 59-53, but no closer and fell to 0-6 all-time against the
Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs were hit with 24 fouls to nine for Phoenix, which
had an improbable 27-2 edge in free throws attempted and 20-2
advantage in scoring from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer for that,'' Sacramento Coach Heidi
VanDerveer said. ``Maybe you want to ask three other people (the
referees) I know. I don't think there's any justification for the
disparity.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half saw only four free throws total, all by Phoenix,
and part of the lopsided second-half differential was Sacramento
trying to keep up with its suddenly awakened hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't getting the job done with the man (defense),''
Mercury assistant coach Kathy Anderson said. ``If anything we
thought giving them something different would hopefully wake them
up and focus them a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zone served its purpose well. They played with a lot of
heart and enthusiasm in the second half and got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup center Marlies Askamp had 11 of her 13 points in the
second half, several on long-range connections from Timms. Pettis
(18), Jennifer Gillom (16) and Michelle Griffiths (14) also reached
double figures, the kind of scoring balance the Mercury must
replicate against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting to win and to go out and play some really
good defense against them,'' Pettis said. ``They're going to come
out here angry, just like last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets dropped their first game here in 1997, 69-64, but won
on the second trip, 77-69. The defending league champions hold a
3-2 all-time edge over the Mercury. &QL;

CARDS HEALTHY IN TIME FOR CAMP  
 KEY PLAYERS RE COVER FROM LAST SEASON'S INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ - As the Cardinals prepare to open training camp
Thursday, they find themselves armed not only with renewed
enthusiasm, but with incredibly good health.
</P>
<P>
   There were relatively few off-season surgeries and
rehabilitations, and all of those players are expected to be ready
for the first workout in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Aaron Graham, who in his third season is expected
to take the center spot from Mike Devlin, the starter most of the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is coming off a surgery to repair a torn tendon in his
left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have been on the sideline last year,'' said
Graham, who not only played through the injury but won the starting
job late in the season. ``It feels great now, but it was like
playing on one foot. I was disappointed that I did not play at the
level I wanted to. The coaches and fans will see a different player
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Also coming back is defensive tackle Jerry Drake, who suffered a
neck injury in training camp that required a fusion and cost him
the season. When the Cardinals left for Flagstaff last season,
Coach Vince Tobin was talking up Drake as one of the club's five
best defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's return would bolster an already deep front that is
shaping up as the strength of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swann, who starts in front of Drake at left tackle, had
off-season surgery to repair a finger injury that put him on the
injured reserve list the last week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Others who've overcome injuries include defensive end Brad Ottis
(screw inserted into fractured foot), free agent safety Van Malone
(hip and abdomen) and outside linebacker Tony McCombs (stress
fracture, foot).
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-round draft pick Terry Hardy has a torn rotator cuff. His
injury still could require surgery. It will not be known until
Hardy takes his physical Wednesday what his status will be for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has completed five months of rehabilitation on his toe
and is ``looking forward to playing on two feet again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I definitely favored my right foot because there
was no pain on it when I'd go to plant,'' Graham said. ``In some
ways, this feels like my second season all over again, although I
got some valuable experience starting the games I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham started seven games as a rookie when Devlin was injured
and started four last season, including the final three, when Coach
Vince Tobin began looking at younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting last year, but I'd decline comment about it
because I didn't want it publicized,'' Graham said. ``It's like if
I knew that the defensive lineman across from me had a sore knee or
ankle. I wouldn't go after it to blow it out, but I'd know he has a
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Graham's toe repaired, but he is in better condition
at 295 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked on speed and quickness because that's more
important at the position I play,'' he said. ``The dominating
centers in this league are not necessarily 300-pounders. This is
where I feel my quickest and most explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake, listed as Swann's backup, was coming into his own when he
was injured. He led the World League in quarterback sacks (eight)
in 1996. In 14 appearances with the Cardinals in 1995 and 1996,
Drake played mostly on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ottis was the utility man last season, serving as first backup
at both ends and left tackle. A healthy Drake would take some of
the load off Ottis, who will work with the first team at left end
until Andre Wadsworth comes to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals medical personnel are at a loss to explain the club's
good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes in cycles, but it does seem like this is a pretty good
cycle right now,'' assistant trainer Jim ``Machine'' Shearer said.
``We haven't done anything differently in how the players prepare.
Bottom line: If you're in the wrong place at the right time, you're
going to get injured. And if not, you're not.'' &QL;

NCAA CLEARS RECRUIT TO JOIN ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. _ After a year-long holding pattern, Justin Taplin
has reached the end zone of academic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA clearinghouse on Monday certified the wide receiver as
eligible to compete at Arizona State, a university source
confirmed. He will report with other first-year Sun Devils on Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the OK,'' said Clair Lane, his attorney. ``He's
eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin, ``The Arizona Republic's'' Class 4A Player of the Year
in 1996, signed a letter of intent to play at ASU for the 1997
season but lacked one of the core classes required under the NCAA's
Proposition 48. He tried to return to Tempe High School right away,
but the district rejected his attempt, citing a district policy
that prohibits students who have graduated from re-enrolling.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the district uncovered a loophole that allowed
Taplin to return to school.
</P>
<P>
   He recently completed two night courses and his transcripts were
forwarded to the NCAA for approval.
</P>
<P>
   He has been enrolled at ASU since February but has not been
allowed to complete in athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tempe Union High School District staff, when everything
got sorted out, really went to the wall for one of their high
school students,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin joins a group of receivers that may be the deepest in the
Pac-10, led by senior Lenzie Jackson, who had 53 catches for 733
yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   Others returning include Ricky Boyer, Kenny Mitchell, Creig
Spann, Brian Forth and Tariq McDonald, who made a strong case for
more playing time with an impressive spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devil Stadium won't be new to Taplin. He helped Tempe High
win the state title there in 1996, capping a 16-touchdown,
1,298-yard season. He holds 19 Tempe High records and also played
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's veterans report Aug. 11 and travel to Camp Tontozona on
Aug. 12.

WOODSON SIGN ING MAY COST CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Cardinals have a much better idea how much it
is going to cost to sign their top two draft picks, and they won't
come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The price for first-round pick Andre Wadsworth went up on Monday
when the Oakland Raiders signed Michigan cornerback Charles Woodson
to a six-year, $14.5 million deal that includes an $8 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, the Heisman Trophy winner, was picked fourth overall in
April's draft, one spot behind Wadsworth, the Florida State
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials initially had hoped not to have to pay
Wadsworth a larger signing bonus than the club-record $7.5 million
given to Eric Swann last February, when he re-signed for $25
million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Also unsigned is second-round pick Corey Chavous, taken one spot
ahead of Florida wide receiver Jacquez Green, who signed a
four-year, $2.637 million deal with Tampa Bay on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals spent $1.930 million of their $4.386 million
rookie pool on the eight rookies who previously signed. So, they
have about $2.456 million left to sign Wadsworth and Chavous, a
defensive back from Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous was reportedly on his way to Arizona on Monday and is
expected to sign by Wednesday, one day before training camp begins
in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are expected to sign Chavous to a three-year deal
worth between $660,000 and $680,000 a year. With his signing bonus
prorated, his rookie salary cap figure would likely be in the
$575,000 range, which would leave about $1.8 million for Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's bonus would also be prorated, and if he were to ask
for $8 million, it would likely accompany a six-year deal in order
to fit into the rookie cap.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's bonus is $1.7 million more than the St. Louis Rams
paid offensive tackle Orlando Pace, the first player chosen in last
year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had hoped to pay Wadsworth a bonus of between $6.5
million and $7 million. But with Woodson's deal, those chances
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's deal does not include any voidable years, but is
filled with incentives, including several ``escalators,'' that are
based on a point system. With escalators, players are paid for
certain achievements, all of which are added to future salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials have said they don't want to give contracts
that includes voidables, ``buy-back'' years or ``escalators.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth is unlikely to sign until after quarterbacks Peyton
Manning, chosen by Indianapolis first overall, and Ryan Leaf,
picked by San Diego second, agree to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's deal means the Manning and Leaf could get bonuses in
the $11 million range. &QL; 
Deal near
</P>
<P>
   Ronald McKinnon, the team's unsigned veteran middle linebacker,
is expected to sign a one-year deal by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials have talked with McKinnon about a multiyear
contract, but they aren't close to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon has been offered a one-year deal for substantially more
than the tender offer of $238,000.
</P>
<P>
   The only other unsigned veteran is free safety Kwamie Lassiter,
who has agreed to terms but hasn't signed a one-year deal worth
$397,000. Lassiter also is expected to sign by Wednesday.

JOSEPH MAHER, VERSATILE CHARACTER ACTOR, IS DEAD AT 64 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Maher, a veteran character actor of extraordinary range
who was best known for his roles in the mordant comedies of Joe
Orton, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor, said Joan Scott, his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than four decades, Maher built a career as one of the
most versatile and skilled character actors on Broadway, and he
appeared in such well-known films as ``Heaven Can Wait'' with
Warren Beatty and ``Sister Act'' with Whoopi Goldberg. He defined
the working actor, appearing in everything from episodes of
``Seinfeld'' and ``Thirtysomething'' to plays in London and
American touring productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had incredible wit and style, and he could be subversive
and affirmative at the same time,'' said the producer Scott Rudin.
``He could send up and embrace it at the same time. He was the kind
of actor that doesn't exist so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher was born in Westport, County Galway, Ireland, on Dec. 29,
1933. The son of a schoolteacher, he said he did not see a movie
until he was 10 or a play until he was a teen-ager. He emigrated in
1956 to Canada, where he began working for an oil company.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon became interested in theater. He studied at the
Royal Conservatory in Toronto, played his first professional
performance in a Toronto production of ``The Taming of the Shrew''
and then toured Canada for three years with the Canadian Players.
</P>
<P>
   He then moved to New York. Among his early credits were roles in
``The Hostage,'' with Julie Harris, ``Eh?,'' with Dustin Hoffman,
and ``The Local Stigmatic,'' with Al Pacino. He also appeared in
``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.'' Early film performances included
a role in ``Finnegan's Wake.''
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated for Tony Awards for performances in
``Spokesong,'' ``Night and Day'' and ``Loot.''
</P>
<P>
   With his big frame, booming voice, silver hair, sky-blue eyes
and ruddy complexion, Maher was a familiar figure for generations
of theatergoers, appearing in David Mamet's ``American Buffalo''
and James Roose-Evans' adaptation of ``84 Charing Cross Road.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was best known, working for the most part with the
director John Tillinger, for his roles in works by the British
playwright Joe Orton, who died in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Maher appeared in all three of the full-length Orton plays _
``What the Butler Saw,'' ``Loot'' and ``Entertaining Sloane'' _
often playing bumbling, befuddled authority figures without much
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Maher later branched out into television and film roles. Among
his best-known film performances were as Beatty's butler in
``Heaven Can Wait'' and as the bishop in ``Sister Act.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four sisters, Maureen Hogan of County Galway,
Ireland; Bridie Ingham of Bristol, England; Eileen McCarthy of
London, and Noreen Armstrong of Bedfordshire, England; and one
brother, Thomas Maher of London.

WHITE CLEANS UP MORE AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You can probably count on both hands the number
of times that Diamondbacks outfielder Devon White has hit cleanup
during his 12 years in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   That number is certain to increase over the next few weeks as
veteran third baseman Matt Williams allows his injured left foot to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   White, who has been the leadoff man 48 times this season, was in
the No. 4 spot on Sunday night against Colorado at Bank One
Ballpark in Phoenix, hitting a run-scoring double in four trips to
the plate. He was at No. 4 again Monday night in the first of a
two-game series against the San Francisco Giants at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tied for the team lead in RBIs (with Travis Lee at 54
entering Monday night's game), and he's a switch-hitter, so by the
process of elimination, he's the best fit there,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Devo and some of the other veterans before the
season about little things they like and dislike, and he said it
didn't matter where he hit because he's hit all up and down the
lineup before.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of White's job is to protect Lee, the star rookie first
baseman, who has been hitting in the No. 3 spot of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hit Travis at Number 4 with Devo at Number 3 and
David Dellucci at Number 5, but then we would be a little
susceptible to left-handed pitching,'' Showalter said. ``We like
having Travis batting in the first inning, and even if we go out in
the first, we've got Devo leading off the second.'' &QL; 
Phone tag &QL; 
Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. continues to make
and receive calls regarding trades as the July 31 deadline
approaches. He had conversations with two teams on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume (of calls) might increase a little, but the
conversations will be more specific as to so-and-so,'' Garagiola
said. ``You likely won't see us go for a veteran because there will
be no pennant drive _ let's be realistic _ and you probably won't
see us get somebody who's going to be a free agent at the end of
the season, if we get anybody at all. Anything we do will be tied
to the long-term aspects of our club.'' &QL; 
Anderson's dog barks &QL; 
Left-hander Brian Anderson, who started Saturday night's game
against Colorado and beat the Rockies for his first victory at home
this season, fouled a ball off the top of his right foot and still
is feeling some pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was barking pretty good yesterday (Sunday), but he should
be able to make his next start (Thursday in San Diego),'' Showalter
said. &QL;

FRANK X. ALTIMARI, FEDERAL APPEALS JUDGE, DIES AT 69
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Xavier Altimari, a senior Federal appeals judge who wrote
the ruling that affirmed the bans on begging in New York City
subways and transit terminals, died on Sunday at his home in Old
Westbury, N.Y. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was brain cancer, said his daughter, Vera Shields.
</P>
<P>
   As a judge, he played a central role in a number of noteworthy
cases, in particular the one in 1990 involving the New York City
subway system and its authority to prohibit panhandling. A federal
district judge had sided with lawyers for the homeless who argued
that beggars were within their constitutional rights, practicing a
form of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan
overruled that judge, 2 to 1, in unusually tart language, with an
opinion written by Altimari. The decision was later upheld by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Altimari wrote that ``whether intended as so, or not, begging in
the subway often amounts to nothing less than assault, creating in
the passengers the apprehension of imminent danger.'' He chastised
the lower court for honoring beggars' rights while snubbing the
concerns of the system's millions of riders. The same ruling upheld
a state law that makes it illegal to loiter in transit terminals
for the purpose of begging.
</P>
<P>
   In a case known as Doe vs. New York City, he wrote for a
unanimous court in 1994 that a person has a constitutional right to
privacy about whether he is infected with HIV. The plaintiff, known
as John Doe, sued the city, saying his rights were violated with a
news release reporting a city-brokered settlement of a
job-discrimination claim that he had filed against Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   While the release did not name him, the plaintiff contended that
its content allowed others to identify him. Altimari wrote the
17-page opinion in that case.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 case, a court panel also was unanimous in turning down
the descendants of a British loyalist who sought to reclaim the
445-acre Robins Island, near the eastern edge of Long Island, to
keep it as a nature preserve. It had been seized by New York state
during the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Altimari said the descendants, the
Wickhams, were a tad late. ``Whatever else we can surmise from the
historical record,'' he held, ``it is clear that even if Joseph
Parker Wickham had a right to title in Robins Island, he and his
heirs slept on this right for over two centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Altimari, a former Nassau County and State Supreme Court judge,
was named to the federal bench in Brooklyn by President Ronald
Reagan in 1982. Three years later, Reagan elevated him to the 2nd
Circuit Appeals Court, whose jurisdiction encompasses Connecticut,
New York and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   He sat as a judge in Manhattan and at the Long Island courthouse
in Uniondale, N.Y., where he continued to handle cases until early
March. As a senior judge, he retired from regular active service
but continued working as requested by the chief judge of the court.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Queens, N.Y., graduated from St. Francis College in
Brooklyn in 1948 and Brooklyn Law School in 1951. He practiced law
with Hoffmann &AMP; Altimari before going on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, who lives in Huntington, N.Y., he is
survived by his wife of 46 years, Angela Scavuzzo Altimari; three
sons, Anthony, of Bayville, N.Y., Nicholas, of Midlothian, Va., and
Dr. Michael, of Hicksville, N.Y.; a sister, Virginia LaFace of
Farmingdale, N.Y.; a brother, Carmine, of Stony Brook, N.Y., and 11
grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A PLAN FOR NIGERIAN DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 21:
</P>
<P>
   By setting elections in Nigeria for early next year and
promising a civilian government by the end of May, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar on Monday pointed his country toward democracy. Unhappily,
he did not remove himself or his fellow generals from power
immediately, leaving open the possibility that the military will
once again betray Nigeria with false promises of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking power after the death of Gen. Sani Abacha last
month, Abubakar has made welcome democratic gestures. He has
released a few dozen political prisoners, and on Monday said he
would free 10 more who are being held for supposedly plotting a
coup against Abacha in 1995. He has also criticized the
undemocratic Abacha regime and said his cabinet would include
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar has a better reputation than some of his predecessors,
but it would still be naive to trust him or his colleagues to carry
out a democratic transition. His speech, originally set for last
week, was probably delayed because of dissent from generals
reluctant to give up their perks. But this is no reason to let the
military linger in power.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha so destroyed Nigerian politics that the country must
essentially build an electoral system from scratch. But the
military should not be running the transition. With the death of
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of Nigeria's last presidential
elections, there is no clear civilian leader. But Abubakar should
appoint a panel of civilians from a wide geographical and political
spectrum to manage the transition, and step down.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Abubakar keeps the military in power until May, he must be
closely watched. France's announcement on Monday that it will work
to end the European Union's sanctions on Nigeria is premature. Many
Western countries seem eager to believe in Abubakar's good
intentions. We hope they are right. But it would be prudent to give
him every incentive to fulfill his promises.

OATES, MELVIN DISMISSAL TALK IS PREMATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It came flying out of nowhere the other day.
Right here in the middle of July, in front of God and everyone,
with the Texas Rangers battling on a daily basis for the division
lead.
</P>
<P>
   And by people who should know better, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire'' Doug Melvin and Johnny Oates if they don't win this
season, came the hue and the cry.
</P>
<P>
   Send'em packing.
</P>
<P>
   Run 'em out of town on a rail.
</P>
<P>
   String'em up by their guaranteed contracts and bring out the cat
o' nine tails.
</P>
<P>
   You can just imagine the lather we could work up if the Rangers
weren't holding at 10 games over .500 with a half-game lead over
the struggling Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but isn't it just a tad premature to be talking about
firing anyone? Can we roll the tape back to March, when national
publication after national publication tabbed the Rangers for a
third-place finish in the American League West? Even us ``homers''
figured them for no better than a distant second to the much more
talented Seattle Mariners (now if you want to start talking about
firing people ... ).
</P>
<P>
   So, how do we go from those expectations to win-or-else
ultimatums, while all the while conceding both Melvin and Oates are
good and talented people?
</P>
<P>
   There is no question Rangers fandom is growing restless and more
and more frustrated with this team's inconsistency. That and the
oppressive heat has the natives certainly working up an edge. A guy
spotted me in the coffee shop the other day and started ranting
about how tired he was of the Rangers' excuses. I glanced at the
sports section in my hand. The Rangers had just lost their second
consecutive after a six-game post-All-Star break winning streak
that had allowed them to run down the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' early collapse and the Rangers' excellent play,
fueled by a red-hot offense in the first six weeks of the season
definitely changed expectations. The division is wide open for the
taking and watching the Rangers fritter away their lead to the
Angels during a terrible June was more than some fans could bear.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Angels have hit on tough times, the major worry is
that both teams are allowing the left-for-dead Mariners to get back
into the race. Don't think it can't happen, especially now that
Randy Johnson seems to be getting hot.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have complicated matters by simply not playing well,
particularly defensively, since early June and it's not just the
physical errors that have hurt. They're not playing smart baseball
and that's unusual for an Oates-managed team.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, at the heart of the problem are some of Oates' most
experienced players. Second baseman Mark McLemore and catcher Pudge
Rodriguez have both recently made errors on plays they should never
have been trying to make. Will Clark's bat is hot but his
once-reliable glove has the tenor of a cold skillet. Let's not even
talk about his arm or range.
</P>
<P>
   On the left side of the infield, veteran Kevin Elster's range
continues to decline and third baseman Fernando Tatis plays with a
rookie's inconsistency, spectacular one moment, less than adequate
the next.
</P>
<P>
   The poor defense puts more pressure on a pitching staff that
cannot overcome the burden of dealing with extra outs.
</P>
<P>
   The trade for Esteban Loaiza was a good one _ he threw the ball
very well in his first start Saturday night _ but Melvin cannot
rest there. If he can package left-hander Darren Oliver in a deal
for a big-time starter, it's time to do it. He might win the
division without him, but if the Rangers are to stand a chance in
the playoffs _ right now they'd open up against the Yankees at
Yankee Stadium _ they must get even stronger in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I checked, no geniuses came out of spring training
figuring this as a win-or-else season for Melvin and Oates, who had
this team in postseason play for the first time two Octobers ago.
Yet, if they don't win this one now, it will definitely rank as a
major disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   A firing offense? That's a call that's way too early to make or
even ponder. There's too much baseball left to be played. People
calling for heads now, based on what might happen, will look a
little foolish if the Rangers' wind up dancing into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I reserve the right to change my mind, but I'd like to
think we'd start with double-secret probation before we get around
to firing people.

EDITORIAL: ENDING WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 21:
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the executive dining room of a local bank on Monday,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced his goal for New York City's poor.
``We're going to end welfare by the end of the century
completely,'' he promised. The old system would be replaced by a
``universal work requirement'' for anyone hoping to receive
financial help from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Like his crime and civility campaigns, turning welfare
recipients into independent citizens sounds like an aim worthy of
the mayor's energies and ambitions. One question is whether the
Giuliani administration is increasingly shifting people from
welfare to work or shoving them into other kinds of dependencies.
Another is whether citizens will be able to get the information
that will enable them to separate accomplishments from hype.
</P>
<P>
   In his text, the mayor argued that even Democratic heroes like
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Robert F. Kennedy felt that welfare
deprived citizens of dignity and incentive. As those views were
supplanted by a less discriminating compassion for the poor,
welfare rolls in New York City surged from 250,000 in 1960 to 1.2
million when the mayor took office five years ago. Since then about
400,000 people have left the city's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy plus shifts of some of the elderly poor and
disabled to federal rolls could account for a drop of almost
300,000 on the city's welfare roster, according to advocates for
the poor. What happened to the others is still a mystery, although
a state court has ordered the city to hand over welfare records to
The Times. Now, with a new system of Job Centers, the idea is to
shift recipients to work and drug treatment programs and to
discourage applicants before they apply in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's experimental Job Centers replacing welfare offices
in Greenwood, Jamaica, Long Island City and Staten Island require a
welfare applicant to meet with a ``financial planner'' whose job it
is to find alternatives to cash from the city. This planner also
reminds the applicant of a five-year lifetime limit on welfare and
gives notice that some work is necessary to receive a check.
</P>
<P>
   If the burden is on the welfare applicant to find other support
or to do the most menial private or public jobs to receive welfare,
the burden is on the city to make certain that the poor and their
420,000 children currently on welfare are not neglected. Drug
addicts, the disabled and new mothers must have help converting to
the mayor's work-for-welfare system. Decent child care must also be
available for those taking jobs to get their public checks, and
some kind of training is needed to shift those on workfare to real
jobs. If Giuliani wants to boast on the national political circuit
about ending welfare in New York City, he must be careful not to
create a beggar class in the process.

RANGERS HOPING FOR `NEW' LOAIZA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The reports general manager Doug Melvin
received regarding right-hander Esteban Loaiza mirrored those of
another pitcher the Texas Rangers acquired during November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a lot of the same things about Loaiza that I heard
about Aaron Sele,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   No one questioned their talent. Skepticism emanated from their
reputations as underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   A change of scenery sometimes remedies that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers develop a lot of times after they've been traded
once,'' Melvin said. ``I don't know why it is, whether expectations
are too high or whether it's a wake-up call for the pitcher. You
can go through all the top pitchers in baseball, and most are not
with their original club. So, you end up going for the good arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The early returns suggest that Melvin ``hit'' on Sele, who is
12-6 with a 4.15 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who are one-half game ahead of Anaheim in the
American League West, need a similar return from Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised by the trade,'' said Loaiza, whom the
Rangers acquired Friday in the trade that sent right-hander Todd
Van Poppel and minor-league second baseman Warren Morris to
Pittsburgh. ``There were no rumors. No one even mentioned it until
the day I got traded. I'm still shocked, but it's the best thing
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates touted Loaiza, 26, as a potential ace since his days
at the Class-A level in their farm system, yet that never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been inconsistent for us, but you can say that about a
lot of pitchers,'' Pittsburgh general manager Cam Bonifay said of
Loaiza, who went 6-5 with a 4.52 earned-run average in 14 starts
with the Pirates this season. ``He has a good arm, and he's taken
some steps forward in his time here. He can definitely be a good
pitcher for the Texas Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza's 94 mph fastball gives him the best arm in the Rangers
rotation. The right-hander's repertoire also includes a tight
slider, and his split-fingered fastball and curveball serve as
effective pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at every club's rotation and talk about some of
the top pitchers today, most of them are guys who are with their
second or third club,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Andy Ashby and Philadelphia's Curt Schilling serve
as Melvin's best examples.
</P>
<P>
   Sele benefited from a new locale and the influence of pitching
coach Dick Bosman. The Rangers expect Bosman will have a favorable
effect on Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Boz has a positive effect on every pitcher we have
here,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I have a great deal of
confidence in Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Kevin Elster, a teammate of Loaiza's with Pittsburgh
last year, viewed the pitcher as one of the reasons the Pirates
remained in the National League Central race until the final week
of the season despite their youth and limited resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat biased,'' Elster said. ``He's a friend of mine,
but he was one of five great starters we had last year. We had a
solid rotation. That's why we were in it last year until the end. I
think we made a great deal to get him. We're an improved club, and
we've got a guy signed through next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who is scheduled to earn $1.4 million in 1999, made his
first start for the Rangers on Saturday, giving up eight hits and
four earned runs in 52/3 innings. However, the defense failed him
with two errors and a passed ball, which led to two unearned runs
in a 9-8, 10-inning victory against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes us a better team,'' Elster said. ``We're a better
team than we were a couple of days ago.''

EDITORIAL: ADULTERY IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 21:
</P>
<P>
   The mores and values of military life are by necessity somewhat
different from those of the civilian world. But the gap cannot be
so great as to create a sense that the military is completely out
of step with life outside. Yet that has been true with some
Pentagon policies on sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by a committee appointed by Defense Secretary
William Cohen to change adultery prosecutions could help alleviate
some of the problem. Under the plan, adultery would remain a crime
under military law, but commanders would file charges only when the
conduct disrupts morale or the functioning of a military unit. They
would be discouraged from pursuing cases from long ago or with no
connection to current service. Enlisted personnel convicted of
adultery could still be discharged for bad conduct, but would not
automatically lose all benefits and pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The change would inject some common sense into prosecutorial
judgments. By reducing the crime, the Pentagon would also lessen
the perception of a double standard in which senior officers are
treated more leniently than enlisted personnel or junior officers
accused of the same conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ordered the review last year when Air Force Gen. Joseph
Ralston, who was in line to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, came under political attack because he had an extramarital
affair in the 1980s. Ralston's decision to withdraw from
consideration could hardly have been avoided after First Lt. Kelly
Flinn, the first female B-52 pilot, was discharged from the Air
Force for lying about an adulterous affair. Such behavior, critics
charge, has been tolerated in more senior male officers.
</P>
<P>
   Policing sexual behavior in the military has been particularly
susceptible to inconsistent standards. Only recently did the Army
announce that it was revising the rules for allowing generals to
retire. It did so after Maj. Gen. David Hale was allowed to retire
honorably despite the fact that he was under investigation for
allegedly coercing the wife of a subordinate into sexual relations.
A change in adultery prosecution rules should not make it less
important to pursue misconduct or harassment charges. But it could
reduce fears of unreasonable prosecutions based on private matters
that have nothing to do with military discipline.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 21`
</P>
<P>
   Robert Benchley once invented a ``Three Aeons for Lunch'' Club
where dead authors gathered to snipe at each other and to comment
on the prices their works brought at rare-book sales. It was not an
exclusive club. ``Shades of advertising men are admitted,''
Benchley explained, ``because advertising is really a form of
belles-lettres and, besides, they keep a club going.''
</P>
<P>
   Business in the ``Three Aeons'' barroom must have been brisk
this week, now that a panel appointed by Random House and its
imprint, the Modern Library, has produced a list of the 100 finest
English-language novels published in this century _ a list that is
a perfect mix, in its purposes, of mostly dead authors and
belletristic advertising. You have to wonder what James Joyce (1,
3, 77) might be saying to the runner-up F. Scott Fitzgerald (2,
28), for whom this is the best day's work in many moons, and just
who is picking up the tab for their cups of joy. Perhaps Booth
Tarkington (100).
</P>
<P>
   Of making lists of many books there is no end. The Roman
rhetorician Quintilian did it, and so did the editors of the
Harvard Classics. Some lists have been more democratic, reflective
of the fact that literature is not limited to masterpieces. Perhaps
this one was skewed by the fact that Modern Library's corporate
family publishes 59 of these 100 titles.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, what is curious about this list is the way it
slights the importance of literary influence, as opposed to pure
reader satisfaction. ``Ulysses'' is both a towering novel and a
towering influence. But it is more than a little peculiar to find
Fitzgerald ranked more highly than either Faulkner (6, 35, 54) or
Hemingway (45, 74), both of whom have had far greater impact on the
shape of American writing. Even James Dickey (42) would probably be
shocked to see his ``Deliverance'' ahead of any book by Joseph
Conrad (46, 47, 67, 85).
</P>
<P>
   Well, as the poet Auden once wrote in a verse-epistle to the
poet Byron (it might have been posted on the bulletin board at the
``Three Aeons''), ``Parnassus after all is not a mountain/ Reserved
for A.1. climbers such as you;/ It's got a park, it's got a public
fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to read this Modern Library list without caviling
(where, oh where, is Flann O'Brien?) or without thinking of all the
buildings in the United States that have the names of great authors
chiseled a little too high upon their facades to make out clearly
in the afternoon light. The streets will be littered with lists
like this when the millennium comes, and when the millennium goes
they will be swept into heaps and forgotten. After all, no list of
books in the world will make you as curious about literature as the
book you find on your own.

PIRATES BEAT METS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He came in billed as the savior of a franchise that
was very much in need of a marquee player. Instead, Mike Piazza has
become the symbol of the New York Mets' mounting frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely fair, because Piazza is hitting .330 in 46
games since his trade to the Mets. But the All-Star catcher is also
batting just .227 with runners in scoring position. And that has
only been magnified by the rest of the lineup's inability to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness was on view again Monday night at Shea Stadium,
where the Mets lost, 3-1, to the Pittsburgh Pirates. It did not
matter that Brian McRae hit another home run or that Masato Yoshii
had one of his strongest outings in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the first inning, the Mets loaded the bases
with nobody out and did not score. The tone was set for another
frustrating defeat, the Mets' 14th in their last 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was the first batter to come up with the bases loaded. He
lined out to second on the first pitch he saw from the Pittsburgh
right-hander Francisco Cordova. Piazza singled to prolong a
third-inning rally that quickly fizzled. But after he struck out in
both the fifth and eighth innings, the crowd of 18,088 booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very frustrated right now,'' Piazza said. ``I'm
trying to do my best. But I'm definitely disappointed with my
performance. And it compounds it that we're not playing well as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem unlikely that a player batting .330 with his new
team would be frustrated. But Piazza acknowledged that he set the
standard by which he would be judged with his performance last
season: .362, 40 home runs, 124 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most productive .330,'' said Piazza, who is
hitting .306 for the season with 16 homers and 55 rbi. ``I'll be
the first to say that. I'm not really ripping the cover off the
ball. I know I'm not hitting the way I should hit. And so it's easy
to say I'm hitting .330. But I don't feel like I'm contributing.
And I'm my own worst critic.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of others in the stands on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the situation,'' Piazza said. ``I don't question
their reaction at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine refused to comment on the booing, but it
was easy to see that he was angered by it. And he had plenty to say
about the standards by which Piazza is being judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the expectations should be very high,''
Valentine said. ``But I think they should be relatively realistic,
too. He hasn't produced to his standard with men in scoring
position. But it might be a standard we're trying to set here that
is unreachable by almost anyone. I think he's allowed to strike
out. If all we were seeing was strikeouts and pop-ups, that's one
thing. But there are some guys not hitting the ball anywhere close
to the way he is.''
</P>
<P>
   That would include the rest of the Mets' lineup, with the
possible exception of McRae. McRae, whose 14 homers are the most by
a Met this season, walked twice and homered in his first three
at-bats on Monday night. It was his fourth home run in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   McRae also delivered a perfect one-hop throw to Piazza from
center field to cut down Lou Collier at the plate and end a
fifth-inning threat.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pirates' 20-year-old third baseman, Aramis Ramirez, had
hit a two-run homer into the left-field bleachers in the top of the
second, the only runs the Pirates scored against Yoshii in his
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Mets (48-46) going 0 for 5 with runners in scoring
position, and their Nos. 4, 5 and 6 hitters _ Piazza, Todd Hundley
and Bernard Gilkey _ going 1 for 12 with six strikeouts, there was
little chance the Mets would catch up, even against a team that was
tied for last in the National League Central coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey has been in a funk all season. Hundley is still trying to
regain the swing that made him one of the most feared power hitters
in the league the last two years. Edgardo Alfonzo's numbers have
dropped considerably from last season. Butch Huskey has been up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus is falling on Piazza. He has not tried to dodge
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, everything went right,'' Piazza said. ``No matter
what you do, that's tough to measure up to. You're judged by that
standard. And I accept it. I'm not feeling sorry for myself at all.
I'm just saying it's one of those things. It's frustrating, because
obviously I'm expected to contribute a lot. It ain't fun sometimes,
I'll tell you that much.'' &QL;

DREIFORT RENDERS REDS HELPLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So this is why the Los Angeles Dodgers made such a
fuss over Darren Dreifort, even when a devastating arm injury
threatened his career two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And this might be why the Dodgers talked about Adrian Beltre as
if the 20-year-old Dominican third baseman was the second coming of
Mike Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's arm and Beltre's bat boosted the Dodgers to a 2-0
victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night in front of 35,775
at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort gave up only one hit _ a double by Willie Greene in the
second _ in eight innings and Beltre broke up a scoreless tie with
a run-scoring single in the seventh. It was Beltre's seventh RBI in
21 games since he was promoted from double-A.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-8) made his first career start against the Reds
memorable. He retired 13 of the first 14 batters he faced and
struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) was outstanding,'' Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman
said. ``His ball was heavy. His breaking pitch... there was a big
difference of speed that was keeping (the Reds) off-balance.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed as if Dreifort's effort would be wasted.
The Dodgers didn't score against journeyman right-hander Steve
Parris until the seventh, when Beltre singled sharply to left field
to drive in Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Parris (1-1) intentionally walked Matt Luke to face Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to get a hit anywhere and make (the Reds) pay for
that,'' Beltre said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort responded by getting the Reds to go down quietly in the
eighth. Former Red Jeff Shaw struck out the side in the ninth to
preserve the 27th one-hitter in L.A. Dodgers history and pick up
his third save with the Dodgers, 26th overall.
</P>
<P>
   How well was Dreifort's sinker working? Three of his first four
strikeouts came on pitches in the dirt. Not a single out was
recorded by a Dodgers outfielder until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``My slider was working pretty well,'' Dreifort said. ``It's
nice to able to keep the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the 1927 Yankees, or even the '98 Yankees, that
Dreifort was facing. The Reds are seventh in the league in batting
average and 11th in runs scored. But Dreifort's effectiveness was a
return to the form he showed in late May, when the 26-year-old won
three consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Charles Johnson, who caught one of the best
sinkerball pitchers in baseball in Kevin Brown when the two were
teammates with the Marlins, said Dreifort's future is bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he keeps pitching and maturing,'' Johnson said of
Dreifort, ``he's going to be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Dreifort ran into trouble, he made the pitch he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort began the fifth by walking two of the Reds' first three
hitters. But he induced a double-play ground ball from Pokey Reese
that was fielded easily by Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers turned the double play and the scoreless tie was
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Parris is with his fifth organization in six years. He does not
carry Dreifort's pedigree (Dreifort was the No.2 overall pick in
the 1993 draft), but on Monday night he was tough on the heart of
the Dodgers' order.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers let Parris off the hook in the first and again in
the third. In both innings, the Dodgers leadoff hitter reached
first on a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Guerrero bunted for a single on Parris' first pitch of
the game and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Juan Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman had talked before the game of the top of the Dodgers'
lineup needing to create RBI opportunities for Mondesi and Gary
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi grounded out. Sheffield popped out.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Johnson singled up the middle and Dreifort
sacrificed him to second. Again, a solid scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And again, the Dodgers didn't execute. Guerrero popped out on
second baseman Bret Boone's tremendous over-the-shoulder catch. The
light-hitting Castro (.211 average entering the game) flied out to
short left field.

SOUND AND FURY OVER TOP MODERN NOVELS LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE RUBENSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 100 best novels are not necessarily the 100 best novels.
</P>
<P>
   A New York publisher released a list Monday of what it called
the best English language novels of the century, but had no luck
persuading anyone else that the ranking was anything but another
work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a list is meaningless,'' said Ojars Kratins, an associate
English professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
whose speciality is the modern novel.
</P>
<P>
   The best 20th century novel, according to a committee of
scholars and writers hired by Modern Library, was ``Ulysses.'' The
next best novels, in order, are ``The Great Gatsby,'' ``A Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man,'' ``Lolita'' and ``Brave New World.''
Most of the books on the list are published by Modern Library _ the
company that commissioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Kratins called the list an ``advertising sales gimmick'' and
said he was not at all concerned that three of the last four novels
he has lectured on in his current class on 20th century novels
failed to make the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own criteria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulysses,'' the tough-to-read James Joyce masterpiece about a
single day in the life of a group of Dubliners, is a respectable
choice for best book, he said _ although he admitted that
relatively few people have read it.
</P>
<P>
   After that, said the professor, the list is off-base. ``Heart of
Darkness,'' at No. 65, should be much higher. ``Grapes of Wrath,''
at No. 10, should be much lower, or off the list altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very demanding,'' he said. ``It may be culturally and
historically important, but that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Kratins lectured Monday to his students about ``The Sound and
the Fury,'' which is ranked No. 6. But the next books on his class
list, including ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' ``Descent Into Hell'' and ``The
Female Man,'' failed to make the top 100 at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with that,'' said Kratins.
</P>
<P>
   Other book fans pointed out that Ernest Hemingway placed no
higher than 45th, that ``Catcher in the Rye'' was a measly 64th,
and that only eight of the books were by women.
</P>
<P>
   At Crown Books on Sloat Boulevard in San Francisco, clerk Andrea
Porter said the list seemed off base, too.
</P>
<P>
   The best book of the century, she said, was ``Beloved'' by Toni
Morrison. And her pal behind the counter gave her vote to ``The
Godfather'' by Mario Puzo. Neither book made the list.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said she could not remember ever selling a copy of
``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   A check of the store computer inventory showed that the store
last sold a copy of ``Ulysses'' in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a book you take to the beach,'' she said. ``The books
that people should read are not always the books that people
read.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 100 list was selected by a committee that included
writers Gore Vidal, whose books did not make the cut, and William
Styron, whose novel ``Sophie's Choice'' placed fifth from the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle book editor David Kipen lamented the failure of
``Gravity's Rainbow'' to make the list. He added, with a smile,
that the absence of any work by Danielle Steel was a ``willful
slight of San Francisco literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing up such a list, said Kipen, was ``for the birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you quantify something as quicksilver as literature?''
he said. ``How can you say `Ulysses' is 100 times more magnificent
than `The Magnificent Ambersons?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Modern Library is trying to sell Modern Library
books,'' the book editor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kipen said he had read only 37 of the 100 books on the list and
had not yet had the pleasure of reading ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect it to be as great as everyone says it is when I
finally get around to reading it,'' he said. ``Which I hope will be
someday soon.''

Coors-like 
game leaves 
sweet taste
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last-at-bat thrills continue
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Astros and Colorado Rockies dispelled the myth of Denver's
Coors Field on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter where Colorado's high-powered offense plays.
</P>
<P>
   No lead is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros watched a seven-run lead evaporate, then needed a
one-out RBI single from Tim Bogar in the bottom of the ninth to
escape with a 10-9 victory over the Rockies before a crowd of
25,491 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was typical of the year I've had so far with me going 0-2
(in the count),'' said Bogar, who entered the ninth batting .176 on
the season. ``Finally, a horseshoe fell in there. Helping the team
is what it's all about. (Manager Larry) Dierker had enough
confidence to leave me in there. It wasn't pretty, but we'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it almost wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which rallied from a six-run deficit to beat the
Astros on June 24 in Denver, staged a Mile High-type comeback with
eight runs in the final four innings to turn a seemingly
insurmountable 8-1 deficit into a 9-9 deadlock. The big blow came
with one out in the ninth on a two-run homer by Dante Bichette off
the Astros' Doug Henry (6-2).
</P>
<P>
   Bichette also hit a game-winning ninth-inning homer off Henry
that lifted the Rockies to a 7-5 win on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just threw too good a pitch to Bichette,'' said Henry, who
has allowed eight homers this season, four to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, losers of six straight games and 13 of 14 on the
road, rallied with two runs in the sixth and four in the seventh
off Astros starter Shane Reynolds, who received a no-decision in
his attempt for a sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second day in a row, the Astros' offense, which
matched a season high with 18 hits, wasn't done. Bogar's hit off
Colorado reliever Dave Veres provided the Astros with their second
victory in their last at-bat in as many days. They scored in the
12th inning Sunday to beat the San Francisco Giants 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   After Moises Alou walked, Carl Everett, who matched a career
high with four hits and drove in three runs, reached on a fielder's
choice and advanced to third on Tony Eusebio's single. Bogar
followed with the game-winner, the 15th time the Astros have won a
game in their final at-bat this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Astro baseball this year,'' Everett said. ``We haven't
given up. We've come from behind early in the game, late in the
game. We just don't give up. That's the kind of ballclub you need _
no matter what the situation is, you find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell and Craig Biggio each had three hits for the Astros,
who won their fifth consecutive home game to improve to 20 games
over .500 (59-39). The Astros, 6-23 all-time in Colorado, improved
to 4-1 against the Rockies at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he discussed pinch-hitting Ricky Gutierrez for
Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I went back and forth a couple of times,'' Dierker
said. ``I could have gone with Ricky. It's looking like maybe
(Bogar) is starting to come out of it. Getting a big hit in a
situation like that can really lift him up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had back-to-back four-run innings off Colorado
starter Jamey Wright in the fourth and fifth. They needed every
last run as Colorado chipped away at the lead on Todd Helton's
two-run homer in the sixth and drew within one with four runs in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Neifi Perez, Curtis Goodwin, Larry Walker and Bichette hit
consecutive singles, and Vinny Castilla drove in two runs with a
double off Reynolds to pull the Rockies within 8-7 _ all with two
out. Reynolds, who had won his last five starts, allowed seven runs
(six earned) and 11 hits in 6 innings before being relieved by C.J.
Nitkowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I hit a wall,'' Reynolds said. ``I just left
some pitches up. It was a situation where they have a bunch of good
hitters on the team and if you make some mistakes they are going to
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker had trouble getting the bullpen warmed up as the Rockies
had four hits off nine pitches from Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast with Shane,'' Dierker said. ``Every hitter
came up and hit the first pitch, and we couldn't get anybody warmed
up.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two clubs meet, every second _ and run _ counts.

<P>
   Relief workers continued counting the dead in Papua New Guinea
Monday, as fears rose that the giant wave that obliterated several
fishing villages on Friday swept away far more children than
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most saddening thing is that 70 percent of the survivors
have been adults _ most of the children are dead,'' the Rev. Austen
Crapp, the administrator of the Catholic Diocese of Aitape, told
reporters Monday at a hospital where hundreds of survivors have
been treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What chance would a 2-year-old or a 3-year-old child have?''
Crapp asked. ``It wipes out everything, destroys everything,
bounces people off trees, bowls them into the lagoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children may be hiding somewhere,'' he added. ``We hope
so. But the current fear is that they have drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australian aid workers opened a field hospital on high ground
and relief supplies began trickling in, Papua New Guinea's prime
minister, Bill Skate, toured the worst-hit villages and the Sissano
lagoon, choked with dead fish and hundreds of rotting human bodies
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday morning, Skate said the toll was 1,200 dead
with 6,000 people _ two-thirds of the population of the stricken
villages _ unaccounted for. He said he is not optimistic about
their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding more dead bodies now than Monday _ every minute
and every hour we find more dead bodies,'' Skate said. ``I will
always remember this as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials began to worry that the huge numbers of dead
might threaten the living through disease and contaminated water
supplies. The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald reported that
workers had dug a hurried mass grave in Aitape, about 20 miles to
the east of where the tsunami hit, and buried 90 people who died of
injuries after being taken to the hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven villages in the nation's remote and rugged
northwest were destroyed on Friday evening when a tsunami reported
up to 30 feet high pounded the coast. The tsunami was caused by an
earthquake that registered 7 on the Richter scale, followed 20
minutes later by a second quake that registered 5.7. Officials said
between 6,000 and 10,000 people lived in the area, mostly relying
on subsistence farming and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wave crashed into the house,'' a survivor, Raymond Nimis,
told The National newspaper of Papua New Guinea. ``People were
dying everywhere. Some died under the house. Others got rolled in
by the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Skate, who has declared a state of emergency, appealed to other
countries for help _ for doctors, food and building supplies. By
Monday, Australia had sent three C-130 transport planes full of
personnel and relief supplies, with a fourth expected on Tuesday.
New Zealand was also sending two planeloads of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred relief workers from Australia _ including 60 doctors
and nurses _set up a field hospital in Vanimo, about 50 miles away
from where the tsunami hit, in case of another earthquake. Several
helicopters, paid for by local mining companies, began ferrying
hundreds of wounded people there. Seventy gravediggers were also
airlifted to the Sissano lagoon, but found that many of the bodies
were too decomposed to be buried without machinery, The Morning
Herald reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some workers complained of a shortage of supplies, and in
Washington Monday, relief officials said it would be difficult to
get the needed supplies quickly to the area, which is mountainous
and covered with thick jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems in this area is how remote it is,'' said
Ann Stingle, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which is
helping to coordinate relief aid. ``It is two days by boat for
mobilizing a lot of the relief goods. So this is going to be quite
a logistical challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, nations expressed their condolences and
offered help. A Vatican spokesman said Monday that Pope John Paul
II was ``profoundly saddened'' by the disaster and hoped that the
``international community will show its solidarity by providing
prompt and effective assistance.'' The secretary-general of the
United Nations, Kofi Annan, offered to help assess the damage and
coordinate relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she
would visit the capital of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, on July
29. The spokesman, James Rubin, said Albright had announced plans
for a brief visit between meetings in the South Pacific before the
disaster. But now her visit may also include a pledge of aid, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be sure on one hand we are not causing an
undue logistical burden,'' he said. ``On the other hand, she has
asked the administration and the department to look at ways to be
helpful to them as they face this catastrophe.''

ELECTRIC CAR GOES WHEN YOU STEP ON THE GAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL TAYLOR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It looks like any other subcompact car _ that
slightly chunky design, with a truncated trunk _ and it drives a
bit like the Toyota Corolla it resembles.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where it is different: You get in, turn the ignition
key and the 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine cranks up and
idles quietly. Then, suddenly, after the water-cooled engine has
reached operating temperature, it just switches off by itself, as
if it had died.
</P>
<P>
   Step on the accelerator, however, and the little sedan moves
smartly and silently down the road, powered by its electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Gas engine? Electric motor?
</P>
<P>
   The car is known as a hybrid, and it offers the best of both
gas- and electric-powered cars: It gets great gas mileage, has
extremely low emissions and doesn't have to be plugged in to be
recharged.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is the first manufacturer to mass produce such a car,
which experts say may just be the automobile that comes closest to
easing the world's energy and pollution problems in one tightly
wrapped package.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are all working on cars like
this, and some have even been displayed at auto shows. But so far,
only Toyota, with its Prius model, has put a hybrid into mass
production.
</P>
<P>
   In its simplest form, the Prius is powered by a combination of
self-generating electric motor and gasoline-powered engine,
alternating from one to the other. When passing other cars or going
uphill, the Prius is driven by both the engine and the electric
motor.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Toyota brought half a dozen Priuses to San Francisco's
Exploratorium to show them off. These were Japanese-market cars _
with the steering wheel on the right. Since the Prius was
introduced in Japan in December, Toyota, which expected to sell
1,000 cars the first month, sold 3,500 in the first few weeks the
Prius was available.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says it expects to bring the Prius to U.S. showrooms
sometime in 2000. It currently sells for the equivalent of $17,000
in Japan, and the U.S. price will probably be $1,000 or $2,000
more. Toyota does not talk about it much, but press reports from
Japan indicate that the big car company is losing money on the
Prius because it is more expensive to produce than a conventional
car.
</P>
<P>
   Being a product of Toyota, one of the largest automakers in the
world, this is no bailing-wire-and-duct-tape special, something
that has haunted some electric car makers for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Prius is a fully developed factory car that meets
all international safety standards and has all the bells and
whistles the cosseted American consumer now takes for granted _ air
conditioning, power everything and a booming stereo system. On the
road, the Prius switches almost seamlessly between electric and
gasoline power _ if you didn't look at the little dashboard screen
that monitors both motors, you might not be able to tell which one
is running.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the car works: After the gas engine has warmed up and
switched off, you pull away from a parking place under electric
power.
</P>
<P>
   Then a complicated ``power-split device'' sends power from the
gasoline engine directly to the wheels or to the generator that
controls the electric motor. When you lift your foot from the
accelerator and the car is slowing down, the electric motor becomes
a generator, constantly charging up the 100 pounds of batteries
that are hidden in a compartment between the rear seatback and the
trunk. At a stoplight, where a gas engine is at its least
efficient, the Prius engine turns itself off, saving more gas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional electric cars, the Prius does not need an
external charger and is not tethered by a range of 70 or 80 miles.
The Prius' range is limited only by the size of its gas tank (13.2
gallons). Toyota says it can get up to 800 miles on a tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius is also one of the cleaner cars on earth: it is so
clean-burning that Toyota says it meets California's ``Super Ultra
Low Emission Vehicle'' pollution standards, a stringent level that
is not even supposed to go into effect until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no car that meets that standard now,'' said Jerry
Martin, spokesman for California's Air Resources Board, the agency
that sets emission standards for vehicles sold in California. ``It
is a standard that is incredibly clean, and this sounds like it
would be a very, very clean-running vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, at its San Francisco introduction Monday, Toyota
admitted its own research shows that in the past two years, the
number of Californians who are willing to pay a premium for an
``eco-friendly'' car has dropped 7 percent, more so than in the
rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They may care less about pollution, but consumers will
definitely pay for a car that is miserly at the gas pump. And the
Prius gets about 66 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it is not a car that auto experts can find much to
nitpick about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is a step in the right direction,'' says
Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety
in Washington, D.C. ``But it's not the ultimate solution, which is
an electric vehicle. Yet the problem there is that it's tethered to
a cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagging the U.S. car firms to devote more time and energy to
alternative-fuel cars, Ditlow said, ``Toyota has a little better
grasp on global warming and global politics. At some point, there
will be an emphasis on reducing (tailpipe) emissions and Toyota is
more willing to invest in the future, when that regulatory demand
hits. They want to position themselves to have something to sell
when the market demands it.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Collins &AMP; Co., a Marin County brokerage firm, auto
analyst Bruce Raabe said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is the beginning of a new type of vehicle.
Technology like this opens the consumer's eyes to change, and it's
important for a company that has financial strength to introduce
this, to take the calculated risk. I don't see any drawback.''

CRUISESHIP CATCHES FIRE OFF FLORIDA COAST

<P>
   MIAMI _ A cruise ship with more than 3,400 people on board
caught fire shortly after leaving the port of Miami on Monday
afternoon, generating huge clouds of dark smoke before U.S. Coast
Guard vessels came to the rescue and doused the flames.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night the authorities said no deaths had occurred on
board the Carnival Cruise Lines' vessel Ecstasy, which had just
embarked on a five-day, four-night trip. About 60 people were
reported injured, most for smoke inhalation. Eight passengers were
hospitalized, the Miami-Dade County Fire Department said, as were
two tugboat crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecstasy was scheduled to sail first to Key West, Fla., and
then to Cozumel, Mexico. The ship, 855 feet long and with 9
passenger decks, halted less than two miles off Miami Beach, where
it remained until Coast Guard tugboats towed it back to port on
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Local television stations talked by cellular telephone with
several people on board, who reported that after some initial
alarm, passengers put on life jackets and lined up in an orderly
fashion on upper decks at the front of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   As one passenger spoke to reporters, a voice over a loudspeaker
could be heard warning that ``no one is allowed to leave the
lounge.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said that the aft area of the vessel caught fire
almost as soon as the ship, which is registered in Liberia, left
port.
</P>
<P>
   The affected area, several decks high and about four porthole
windows deep, was said to house the ship's main laundry room and to
be full of towels and flammable cleaning substances.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was visible both from buildings in downtown Miami and
from the beach, drawing curious onlookers to the balconies of
apartment buildings and out of chic South Beach restaurants onto
the sand. Powerful jets of water could be seen pouring from the
half-dozen or so tugboats that were sent to put out the blaze and
remained on the scene for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the vessel's crew of more than 900 initially tried to
douse the fire, but were driven back by the intensity of the
flames.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news reports, the crew closed thick firedoors
as they withdrew, an action that prevented the fire from spreading
to the heart of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The fire aboard the Ecstasy is not the first one. On July 25,
1995, an electrical fire broke out on the ship while it sailed home
to Miami. One of its two engines were shut down, but there were no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Ecstasy was within two miles of shore, it was still
under the jurisdiction of the Captain of the Port, who ordered the
ship to anchorage, said Lt. Comdr. Pat Philbin, at Coast Guard
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard inspects cruise ships like the Ecstasy every six
months or so, Philbin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of those inspections, we actually require
them to go through fire drills and boat-lowering drills,'' he said.
``We also check for structural integrity, to make sure in the event
that they have a fire, they're able to contain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, Philbin said, was to seal off the area around the
fire to halt its spread, and then figure out how to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that sailors fear most at sea is a fire, because
there's just nowhere to go, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safety officials said those aboard were lucky that the fire
broke out while the Ecstasy was close to shore.

FOCUS OFF FIELD AS SEAHAWK CAMP OPENS

<P>
   CHENEY _ The more things change, the more they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   Look at John Friesz. A year ago, he opened training camp as the
Seahawks' starting quarterback, only to fracture his right thumb in
the season opener and lose the job to Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Friesz was again the No. 1 quarterback in the first two
practices of the team's training camp at Eastern Washington
University because Moon is holding out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously fun to be back playing coming off an injury and
it's enjoyable going out with the first unit,'' Friesz said. ``It's
what I prefer. But at the same time, Warren has turned into a
leader of this football team and everybody would love to see him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mueller, Seahawks vice president of football operations,
said he did not even talk to Moon's agent, Leigh Steinberg, Monday,
when the disgruntled quarterback met with Steinberg in Newport
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So the two sides remain millions of dollars apart fiscally, more
than 1,000 miles apart physically and light years apart
philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not willing to tear down what we've worked so
hard to built up,'' Mueller said of having to cut other players to
get money to appease Moon. ``And really that's what it comes down
to right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said he sent a letter to the club, restating his
position that Moon deserves to be compensated among the
highest-paid quarterbacks in the league and that the team's
insistence on a one-year contract is preventing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren had an unusual day,'' Steinberg said. ``He said he felt
like a kid who was at home when all the other kids were at
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Moon retiring is not an option, leaving Moon to
hold out and be fined for his absence or somehow reach an agreement
with the Seahawks on a reworked contract.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's absence put the practice-field focus on Friesz, and
budding backup Jon Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Friesz looked much sharper in the second practice than during
the morning session, a performance that prompted coach Dennis
Erickson to offer, ``John threw the ball this afternoon as well as
I've ever seen him throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz did throw deep on several occasions, but wasn't willing
to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think so,'' Friesz said when told of Erickson's
comment. ``I hope I can throw better.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz may never throw as pretty a ball as Moon, but he has come
a long way back from the sore-thumbed quarterback who threw three
interceptions during a 5-for-15 performance in a December loss at
Baltimore and also struggled at times during the team's four
minicamps this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good. It feels 100 percent,'' Friesz said.
</P>
<P>
   The thumb felt good from the first day he could throw again,
Friesz said, just because he could throw again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had so much fun throwing an object before _ whether
it be baseballs as a little kid or a football at this level,'' he
said. ``It was really good to get back on the field and throw again
just because it was taken away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Moon's absence, the Seahawks say they feel good about
their quarterback situation.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that they have constructed a team that can make
the playoffs without having a quarterback who must win games, as
long as he doesn't lose them.
</P>
<P>
   They continued the upgrading process this offseason by giving
money that Steinberg feels should have been targeted for Moon to
free-agent signees Ricky Watters, Darrin Smith, Kevin Glover and
Brian Habib.
</P>
<P>
   The club has offered Moon $1.85 million for this season, saying
Moon's age (42 in November) and salary-cap limitations prevent it
from offering a multi-year deal or more money on a one-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg is seeking a three-year contract that includes a $6
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that can be resolved,'' Mueller said. ``It's
not a problem like solving world peace, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's teammates say they understand his dilemma and are content
to carry on without him.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great quarterback and a guy we definitely need on this
team,'' Watters said. ``So I hope we get it worked out.''

MOON'S CAREER DOESN'T FIGURE WITH CAPPED-OUT SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ The only problem with Warren Moon is that he is
asking for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   How else would you characterize Moon's demand for a new
three-year deal that includes a $6 million signing bonus and a base
salary this season of $5 million?
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't know industry standards in the NFL, it doesn't
take a certified public accountant to see that Moon is asking for
mega-top dollar to throw the ball for the Hawks this season.
</P>
<P>
   If Trent Dilfer can make $5 million, Moon must figure he's worth
as much. So to make his point, Moon was nowhere to be found Monday
when the Seahawks opened training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Moon flew to Los Angeles, where he huddled with his
agent, Leigh Steinberg, who has apparently convinced Moon that the
Seahawks owe him a ton of career-ending cash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the $5,000 fines will start to mount for every day of
camp Moon misses. Maybe it seems like a small price to pay, since
Moon's agenda is quite grand in scope.
</P>
<P>
   A holdout for the first time in his 20-year career, the veteran
football slinger is trying to make one thing perfectly clear:
Someone should pay for Moon's Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   And that someone should be the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that negotiating tactic is that Moon has been
employed by the Seahawks for all of one year _ a year in which Moon
started off as the Seahawks' $500,000 backup and ended up the
starter, looking like the accomplished pro that he is.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only one season. And while his numbers were very good
and while his leadership has become an indisputably important part
of the Seahawks, Moon does not have the length of tenure to go for
the negotiating-table jugular.
</P>
<P>
   With such a contract upgrade as the one Moon and Steinberg are
asking, it's more than clear that Moon is asking for the Seahawks
to reward him as much for all his 20 years of pro service as he is
asking the Hawks to pay him fair market value.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mueller, the Seahawks' vice president of football
operations, could not dispute the fact that Moon and his agent are
attempting to make the Seahawks pay for the cumulative success and
longevity of Moon's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique situation,'' Mueller said. ``We can only pay him
for what he can do for the Seahawks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are too polite to point out that, after all, the team
only went 8-8 last season. They did not make the playoffs, not that
the disappointing season of offensive staleness, mental lapses on
defense and special teams were Moon's fault.
</P>
<P>
   But Moon might be stretching his luck by demanding Brett Favre
or Troy Aikman or Drew Bledsoe kind of money. Moon is not in the
prime of his career and, unfortunately for the Seahawks and
unfortunately perhaps for Moon as well, his prime was not spent in
a Seahawks uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Why does that matter? Because his lack of tenure here in Seattle
makes Moon different from Jim Kelly, Dan Marino, John Elway and
Aikman _ all of whom are Moon's peers but all of whom have
benefited from sticking with one franchise for their entire NFL
careers.
</P>
<P>
   For Moon, there is no 20-year backlog of good will in Seattle.
There is no overwhelming sentiment, it appears, on the part of the
Hawks to reward Moon for anything before or beyond his one very
good season last year with the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hawks appear to be quite clear that while they
would love to have Moon as their quarterback, they aren't losing
sleep over this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good football team, regardless,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than just about Warren Moon. This is about a
group of people we feel good about that we've put together. Here's
the way I look at it. We had a good team last year and John Friesz
was going to be our quarterback. Now we've done nothing but add to
it. We've added (center) Kevin Glover, (lineman) Brian Habib and
(running back) Ricky Watters. Now why wouldn't we be excited about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Moon has the right to ask for the moon. He set team records for
passing yards (3,678) and completions (313) last season. And it is
clear he is more than just statistics to his teammates, who prize
his experience and understanding of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But to stick with his top-dollar, three-year demand, Moon might
be backing himself into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   All the confidence and ego it has taken to make him one of the
best quarterbacks to play in the NFL, Moon should accept that the
funky route of his NFL career is as much responsible for the
position he is now in.
</P>
<P>
   Thwarted by the NFL after playing at the University of
Washington, Moon's career was forced to blossom in the Canadian
Football League. Once in the NFL, Moon's Oilers never could pull
off an AFC championship victory. In fact, Moon is 3-7 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Moon's chances for sticking were hurt by injury in
1996 and the legal trial that put ugly allegations of domestic
abuse squarely in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   When Moon signed his two-year deal with the Seahawks before the
'97 season, he said Seattle was where he wanted to end his career,
where he wanted his post-football life to flourish. If anyone had
told him at that time the Hawks would wind up offering him close to
$3 million with incentives for 1998, do you think he would have
been happy?
</P>
<P>
   He would have taken the money and run. So why is he passing now?
</P>

 &HT;    COLUMN: Thank God my old preacher had no pistol
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Was that a clinking noise in the collection
plate?'' Bang! ``Somebody in the third row is singin' off key.''
Blam! ``Okay kid, I warned you to sit down and shut up.'' Blooey!
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to another serene Sunday morning at your local house of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Thanks to an amendment recently passed by the
Kentucky General Assembly, pistol-packing preachers may legally
carry their concealed weapons into the pulpit. Kind of reminds me
of an old cowboy movie where the minister steps up to the lectern,
pulls out his six-shooter and fires a shot heavenward as he
commands his flock: ``Y'all sit and be peaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The incongruity of an anointed harbinger of peace packing heat
is staggering. One minister who campaigned for passage of what he
termed ``equal rights and equal protection'' under the gun law
explained it this way: ``I'm sure a bank would not want to lose its
depositor's money and obviously we do not want to lose the Lord's
money.'' Wonder if anybody has checked with The Lord to see how He
feels about it.
</P>
<P>
   If carrying weapons, concealed or otherwise, into a church can
be justified on the possibility of some bad guys grabbing the gold,
then the General Assembly ought to see what they can do about
pushing through an amendment to the Fifth Commandment - the one
that reads: Thou shalt not kill. Maybe it could be reworded: Thou
shalt not kill UNLESS some bad dude is lookin' to lam with the
lucre.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in Kentucky, I'm just glad nobody came up with
the idea of arming the clergy back when I was a kid. Old Preacher
Donaldson was scary enough without it. Man, all he had to do was
look at me over the tops of those scrunchy glasses he wore pinched
onto the end of his nose, and I felt the Spirit rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday mornings were not the Donna Reed show around my house. My
lame excuses and feigned illnesses made them torture - for
everyone. Mother never bought into my weekend bouts of anthrax,
leprosy, or whatever I could rustle up in her old doctor's book of
recommended ailments. Daddy just wanted to keep the peace and often
he'd plead with her to let me stay home, but Mother was too quick
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heathen!'' she'd hiss in my direction as she bounced my
breakfast onto the table. Then she'd warn my father of the eternal
damnation I would face if I didn't get my backside into that pew.
Daddy would shrug and go wait in the car for us to end the
skirmish. It was always ugly but the mighty midget always won.
Mother was 4 feet, 10 inches of tightly packed explosive ready to
detonate all over me. Whatever it took to get me under Preacher
Donaldson's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Many tense minutes later, she'd shove me out the door in my
Sunday finery. Daddy would be sitting behind the wheel of our old
``woody'' station wagon, jaw clenched, eyes straight ahead as
Mother dragged me out of the house and thumped me into the back
seat. I'm not sure, but I suspect the inside back door handles had
been removed.
</P>
<P>
   As we pulled out of the drive, Mother would tuck a stray hair or
two up under her hat and then pull on her gloves. That's when the
lecture began. She talked to the windshield as my father pretended
not to hear. ``I hope when you have children of your own...'' she'd
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Theme and variations. I heard it for 33 years and then when I
finally did have a child of my own, she switched the format to fit.
``Now that you have a child of your own, you owe it to him to...''
Eventually, I joined Daddy in his deaf and dumb act.
</P>
<P>
   My reluctance to seek salvation at the hands of old ``Screecher
Preacher'' (my irreverent nickname for him because of his tendency
to holler at us when he got into a particularly pithy part of the
sermon) was no secret. I was scared to death of the man,
particularly since I knew God was on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like most Sundays, Preacher would take me aside after
services to call me to account for my latest ungodly behavior. The
morning I made change from the collection plate was the worst. I
was thinking ice cream, but he had sacrilege in mind. As he
rumbled, I stared at my shiny Mary Janes feeling about as low as a
snake's belly.
</P>
<P>
   But I survived. And now I'm just thankful old Screecher didn't
have a license to carry. I'd have been a goner.

   PITTSBURG, N.H. _ When Peggy and Brian Mallett return to their
home in Farmington, N.H., a three-hour ride, it always seems they
have been very far away for a very long time. Even if they've just
been away fishing for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lachance and his 15-year-old son, Jerry Jr., felt the same
way. Teacher and student went fishing on Lake Francis a few days
after school ended. Once there, they say, the rest of the busy
world just drifts away.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that about any fishing paradise _ an escape from
the beehive, salve for the agitated soul, a retreat to God's
country, and all that.
</P>
<P>
   But here in northern New Hampshire, where the mighty 435-mile
Connecticut River rises from a mountain stream and some valley
bogs, one of the few New England outbacks remains so pure and
pristine that it deeply transforms world-weary visitors as few
other places can.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the silence of the place, or nights so dark the
Milky Way hangs off the ends of your fingers. Perhaps it is just
that after 8 p.m. you better not need gas, a restaurant meal, or
lights to guide your way and help you see the giant blocks of moose
that loiter along the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that this is really wild country,'' says Lisa Savard,
a flyfishing guide who owns and runs Lopstick Lodge in Pittsburg.
``We get high-quality outdoor people around here. we don't get the
yahoos because we have nothing to offer them. We don't even have
many cars around. Somehow the mountains are a natural barrier. You
have to give an extra push to get away through them.''
</P>
<P>
   That barrier seems psychological. Though many tourist guides
omit this upper Coos County region from the established travel
routes of northern New England, the road here is not difficult. If
Franconia Notch is the exit from the White Mountains, then Route
145 from Colebrook is the gateway to the northern outback.
</P>
<P>
   The two-lane road winds and plunges through rolling green
country _ the watercolored hills in a children's book. Cows graze
on the hillsides, and the vast undulating farmland stretches away
into the blue distance.
</P>
<P>
   The road passes over a final chasm 200 feet above the
Connecticut River, and then you are in Pittsburg. Its center is
marked by a gas station/fishing tackle shop and the General Store,
a cavernous Victorian farmhouse with sparse shelves and a
chattering coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   The woman back in a Colebrook grocery store had it about right
when she said, ``No one from here goes up there much. There's
nothing much up there but moose and fishing.'' For some, a
description of Paradise itself. Or at least, after the outdoor
amusement park atmosphere of the White Mountains 60 miles below,
``This is the real outdoors,'' says Gene Finney, who has come here
to trout fish (and only that) for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week a year is all I need,'' he says. ``I need one week in
this place, fishing ... that's all I ask. And if a whole lot of
people start coming here in cars and vans and they have to build
the place up for them, then I'll have to find someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Finney is talking about places down in the White Mountains like
Santa's Village and Six Gun City, Story Land, Indian Head Resort,
and the Mill at Loon _ a tourist culture dedicated to the unending
manufacture of high-energy fun for people who, it is assumed, can't
find it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People in this northern outback of Pittsburg literally feel
above all that. ``The earth up here has its own smell,'' says Lisa
Savard, who, with her husband, Tim, guides flyfishermen from novice
to expert. ``It's the thick fir forest, and you hear birds instead
of cars. People come up here just to look a loons and maybe moose
and go fishing. They're looking for some real beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa, whose grandfather, Sidney Wheeler, guided flyfishermen in
this region through the first half of the century, was working in
Hunters Angling Supply when she met Tim, her second husband,
working for the same company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only grandchild (of Wheeler) who fished,'' she says,
``and Tim and I started fishing together. We became fishing
buddies, fishing for Atlantic salmon in New Brunswick, and all
sorts of trips. Flyfishing was a qualification for a mate, and so
were married last year. And I'm thinking, `Look at what good things
you can get in flyshops.'''
</P>
<P>
   The couple live year-round at the main house at Lopstick Lodge
with its nine brownwashed cabins overlooking a 10-mile expanse of
First Connecticut Lake and the mountains beyond. In summer, they
say, the timeless beauty of the place is the soul food that makes
life easy to live here. But winter is deep, vigorous, long, and
relentless, says Tim. The cords of wood that need splitting to keep
the stove going, the amount of maintenance to the 10 cabins that
after fishing season serve hunters and then snowmobilers. All of it
makes living difficult and essential. But, he says, ``This is what
I want to do for the rest of my life. I can't imagine ever
retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   One day recenlty was typical for the Savards. Both had fishing
clients out on the river, teaching the tricky intricasies of
flyfishing, the most artistic form of the sport. Between the two,
they will guide 100 days in a good season, along with keeping up
with the tasks and duties of running the lodge. ``It's like taking
care of 10 old houses,'' Lisa chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Tim had a day off. At first light, he was off to
the river for a morning of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just our business, it's what we love,'' says Tim.
``Guiding is most enjoyable at the entry level. With beginners we
have the chance to turn people on to something we enjoy so much.
This is not an easy thing to learn, and their success is our joy.
Just getting people to a level of proficiency so that they can
enjoy flyfishing, that's the fun in what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Strung along the upper Connecticut River are four lakes, the
first one at the Quebec border. It requires a walk just under a
mile through thick fir forest, and then a fight through the
shoreside vegetation to reach Fourth Lake, which is more a small
pond than a lake, and whose chief significance is its status as the
ultimate start of the Connecticut, New England's longest river that
forms the border of New Hampshire and Vermont before bisecting
Massachusetts and Connecticut, where it meets ocean in Old Saybrook
on Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The four lakes below it _ Third, Second, First, and Lake Francis
_ are larger, ranging from the 278-acre Third Lake to the
2,800-acre First Lake, largest in the chain. All are accessible,
near well-maintained roads, but never is there the least sense of
crowding at any boat access points or out on the water.
</P>
<P>
   All but the Fourth Lake is stocked seasonally with trout and
salmon, though there are wild strains of brook and brown trout and
salmon as well.
</P>
<P>
   Between the lakes, the river flows from dam to dam. Where lake
fishing is largely trolling from boats, river and stream fishing
requires legwork, often a hike into streamside, then wading out on
rocky bottoms which, in the moving water, can make the footing
tricky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One day recently Sarah and Glen Lagrange were fishing the
riffles and pools below Second Lake. It had rained most of the
night, and the morning light threw silver shafts through the
drenched canopy of fir and maple foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sarah and Glen, retirees from Toronto, cast flies into the
eddies. Separated by 50 yards of noisy water, the couple communed
in silence, they said, at a sport they have pursued only for the
last 10 years, but in the place they love best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing for salmon in Scotland is spectacular in a way,'' says
Glen, ``but it's all part of some regimen. Everywhere you find
that, even on the Mirimachi (New Brunswick). But down here it's
just so easy to go fishing. And it's so pretty ... and quiet
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's one other thing that people don't think about
(with fishing),'' says Sarah, his wife of 44 years, when the two
had stopped to have coffee from a metal Thermos. ``You do this all
day, on your feet, and it's real exercise, I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Peggy and Brian Mallett, the trip through the notches to the
north country is more than an outing. They come here for weekends
and spend two weeks of vacation flyfishing on the lakes. All
morning one day recently, the Malletts, who work at Janco, Inc., in
Farmington, N.H., were in hot pursuit of a big brown trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept seeing him after the bait (live-lined shiner) all
morning, and finally Brian hooked up and landed him,'' said Peggy,
as she inspected the 4-pound carcas. He's a beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the lure of big brown trout that keep the
Malletts coming up from what they view as the congested world to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fished all over, Lake Champlain and fishing derbies. But
nothing is like this area. It's just so quiet. When you're here,
you're really getting away.''
</P>
<P>
   But could one go stir crazy in all this silent splendor of this
rolling lake country in northern New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   ``About two or three times a year I have to get out,'' confesses
Lisa Savard. ``I need a little more civilization. But by the time
I'm at the Hookset toll booth ... That's when I know it's time to
come back home.''

THE TRAVELING GETS LONELY IN NORTHERN MAINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAXTER STATE PARK, Maine _ George Lankton was raising a roof in
the form of a tarp strung from trees. Kristen Haberin was cooking
soup in a one-burner propane stove.
</P>
<P>
   They had been on the road for hours, and about mid-morning they
had passed out of Maine's well-worn tourist route along the craggy
coast and entered the outback region of the state known as the
``North Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer cars along the road now. As they pushed north the seafood
restaurants and factory outlet stores gave way to a country store
about every 10 miles _ half a day's ride by wagon, which was the
transportation when these little all-purpose stores were the only
commercial enterprises in the vast and brooding landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the road itself ended, and for a dusty, rumbly hour
the couple were driving the gravel packed roads and passing town
line signs that read ``T3-R9'' (for township location).
</P>
<P>
   Now Heberin and Lankton had their soup and looked out at the
sky. Most views showed an improvement from the morning's overcast,
but on one side, blocking out the sky for a mile above them, rose
the dark immensity of Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've camped all over, but never this far away,'' said
Haberin. The couple, from Coventry Conn., had always heard of
Katahdin (Kette-Adene, Abenaki for ``Greatest Mountain), the
5,267-foot high northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Last
week they made the long push upcountry to see it and the camp
around it.
</P>
<P>
   Where hundreds of thousands of tourists annually visit Mt.
Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains _ which features an
auto road and cog railway to the top, with endless tourist
amusements and shopping spread around the base _ only a fraction as
many get into Maine's mile high peak and the vast outback beyond
it, about 300 miles north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly outside of Greenville (west) or Millinocket (east), the
paved roads abruptly give way to gravel-packed logging roads, and
for the next hundred miles (Katahdin is actually central Maine) the
land becomes a wild uninhabited chain of lakes, rivers, mountains,
and dense forest land. Under state control, it is called the
Allagash Wilderness Waterway, replacing the older North Woods tag,
which natives still use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who come up here are pretty serious outdoorsmen,
but not all,'' says ranger Pete McFarland. ``Sometimes people climb
up Katahdin underestimating how big it is and what a long climb it
can be. They get up there drenched with perspiration, then a shower
comes up and thw wind blows, and they're up there shivering and too
tired to climb down.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, park rangers had to call in a helicopter rescue
for a woman who, shortly after knee surgery, tried to take on
Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looks so pretty up there a lot of people get
deceived,'' said another ranger at the Baxter station. Indeed, the
trek up to Katahdin's summit can be accomplished by most reasonably
healthy people. Yet, rangers point out, the turnaround climb is a
seven-hour proposition, and any trek up the mountain should be
carefully prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Katahdin and Baxter State Park, though a large tract in itself
at 315 square miles, is only one relatively small corner of the
North Woods, which even in high season (after black flies and
before the snow) are sparsely populated by generally only the
hard-core outdoors enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Jack Richards and his 16-year-old son Jack Jr., come
to canoe. From the southernmost point of the Allagash at Telos
Landing on Telos Lake to Allagash Village on the St. John River 98
miles to the north, lies perhaps the longest single organized canoe
trip in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to get out there very far before you know
you're alone,'' says the senior Richards, who has made several such
treks with his son, but never covered the whole distance. ``Some
one of these summers, we have to plan the whole thing and just go.
Or it's always going to be out there nagging on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the Connecticut couple, hike and ride mountain
bikes, though the latter activity is controlled by the park
service, which guards strictly against environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take mountain bikes up to the Allagash,'' says
Lankton. ``But they won't let you on the trails up there _ with
good reason. So we'll ride the logging roads down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 90 percent of the North Woods is owned by pulp paper
companies, which have checkpoints to log in visitors to the region.
So, too, Baxter checks in all cars and asks people their plans _
simple safety precautions, they say, in case people get lost. At
any one time a thousand people are in the park overnight, and the
rangers know the inevitable call can come any night _ someone lost
on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But down in the lowlands, where hundreds of miles of logging
roads crisscross the forests and bogs, getting lost is as easy as
forgetting the last three forks in the road. The very logging roads
that make almost every lake and mountain accssible by car can
quickly become as tractless and confusing as the wilderness itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lost on these roads before,'' admits Harlan Reed, a
fishing guide with a camp on the Penobscot River. ``At least when
you're in a canoe you know where the river's going and it's pretty
hard to get lost. Even hiking trails aren't bad. But these roads in
the woods _ you can drive all day and get more lost every mile you
go.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the great draws of the region is the wildlife. Black bear
(the state university's fighting symbol, despite the shyness of the
animal), coyote, white-tail deer, and jackrabbits are common
animals. The woods ring with the call of loons and the
white-throated sparrow _ a bird heard only brielfly in lower New
England during the spring migration north.
</P>
<P>
   But the one animal everyone wants to see has become the
unofficial state symbol _ moose. ``If I talk to 50 campers a week,
49 of them will ask how do they get to see a moose. The state even
has a book out about it,'' says Reed, who has been coming to the
North Woods most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Maine's vast outback, spotting moose is as easy as
rising at dawn and staking out a bog or small stream. Evening hours
are also good. After years of clear-cutting the pine forests by
loggers, what is left are growing hardwood thickets which state
biologists term ``the great salad bowl'' for moose.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the visitors center at Baxter is a blackboard on which
visitors log in latest moose sightings, such as one last week ``7/8
_ Really huge bull moose at Abol Stream.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fishing in some areas is excellent _ indeed, Penobscot
River brown trout fishing is legendary, as is Moosehead _ it is at
best only part of the picture for most travelers to the Maine
backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking, canoeing, and kayaking are the most popular activities.
But on the two big rivers that flow out of Moosehead (the largest
lake in the continental US contained within the borders of a single
state) the last remaining whitewater in the northeast gave rise 25
years ago to the rafting business.
</P>
<P>
   Purist outdoor enthusiasts have scoffed at using the rivers for
amusement park rides for casual visitors. But with low
environmental impact, rafting has come to be viewed in a more
benign light by most over the years as simply another recreational
use of the rivers, and good clean fun.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wayne Hockmeyer founded Northern Outdoors 23 years ago on
the Penobscot as well as the Kennebec, Dead River in Maine, and the
Hudson in New York, an offbeat amusement has grown into a sport
that draws tens of thousands each year.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical summer day, about 1,000 rafters will bump, splash,
and scream their way down through famous rapids known as Cribworks
and Magic Falls before the rafts are landed in a wilderness setting
for a cookout. Then the afternoon session, followed by a video
showing of the days' activities, gives rafters a full day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a family myself,'' says Jim Yearwood, manager and
part-owner of Northern Outdoors, ``and I'd consider this a very
affordable vacation. We sometimes combine rafting with days of
kayaking, fishing, rock climbing and hiking.''
</P>
<P>
   Such packaged trips appeal often to groups who want to vacation
together at a group rate, says Yearwood, with planning left to
professionals. Registered Maine guides working for Northern
Outdoors accompany the trips on the river and into the backwoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe way to experience the wilderness in all aspects,''
says Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting took grew so fast through the last two decades on the
few whitewater rivers left in the northeast that the state had to
step in and regulate the numbers. The current limit allows 1,000
rafters on the river weekdays and 800 on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade from 1985 to 1995, rafters on Maine's three
northern rivers increased from 44,540 to 80,337 annually, according
to state figures. ``We've settled in at about that figure now,''
says Yearwood, exaplining that the several rafting outfitters had
to work out schedules and quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-timers in the outback still consider rafting a rather
frivilous activity, compared to traditional uses such as fishing
and canoeing. The highly packaged rafting trips, they say, are
little more than thrill-seeking ammusements compared with the
subtler, more traditional ways to appreciate the northern
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it helps bring in money,'' says Ron Ewell, a logger who
has spent his life between Quebec and Millinocket. ``But it sure
has changed the river. We used to have river drives with timber,
and now it sometimes looks as thick as that with these rafts.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has viewed rafting as a serious threat to the
wilderness here. Not compared to the potential development of
Moosehead Lake, where one of the principal land owners, South
Africa Pulp and Paper, is trying to sell off nearly 100,000 acres
of forest land this summer, including 60-miles of Moosehead Lake
shorefront.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the high-flying '80's, realty developers did manage to
besmirch some of the land around Moosehead with unimpeded and
haphazard building in the ``vacation home'' market.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, if South African Pulp and Paper, and others,
do unload its wilderness land to investors, state and federal
planners in Maine vow to fight for regulations and protection of
the North Woods.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the Moosehead Messenger in Greenville, the
gateway town to the wilderness, calls for the public puchase of the
land ``to protect ourselves from the whims of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a sense of the inevitable. Says Paul Deitz, a new
landowner along the Moosehead shore, as he looked out over the lake
from the top of Squaw Mountain one evening last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too beautiful here, too easy to reach, and there's
so much of it ... everyone wants a piece of a place like this. Once
the people start coming and it catches on, there'll be no stopping
them.''

   &UR; In the far reaches of New England outdoor purists can still
find their paradise, a silent, pure, pristine outback that
transforms world-weary visitors and inspires the jaded through
magnificence. In a three-part series, Globe outdoor writer Tony
Chamberlain focuses on the headwaters of the Connecticut River in
New Hampshire, Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, and Baxter State Park
in Maine.

   TRAVEL-NORTH-NH-SPCL (Pittsburg, N.H.) _ In northern New
Hampshire, where the mighty 435-mile Connecticut River rises from a
mountain stream and some valley bogs, one of the few New England
outbacks offers the beauty of natures solitude. By Tony
Chamberlain. 1700 words. PHOTO

<P>
   WHETMORE, Vt. _ It was a curious walk.
</P>
<P>
   The woman down in the general store along the lakeside, just
taking hot bread out of the oven on a dank, rainy morning, had
said, ``You should climb up on the mountain. You haven't really
seen what it looks like around here until you walk up the mountain
and see it from up top.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, standing on a broad and leafy hilltop, Mt. Hor,
that rises 1,000 feet above Lake Willoughby and the plains below, I
heard the slow approach of something large behind me. In the
windswept silence, an alarming sound _ bear, moose?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, only cows. Black-and-white ones, the Ben &AMP; Jerry variety,
lumbering over to check out a stranger in their rarefied world. In
this land of lustrous green hills and silos, it is clear there are
more of them than there are of us, for in a two-hour walk, cows
were the only company.
</P>
<P>
   It's less obvious by day, but in the woods, there are the moose,
deer, and smaller wildlife, and the waters of this country brim
with fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northeast Kingdom'' is the name given to the region of
northernmost Vermont that lies between the Connecticut River on the
east and the Green Mountains to the west. The name rings faintly
with religious overtone, and that is not by accident. ``If you
lived all your life here, then died and went to heaven,'' goes an
old saying, ``you wouldn't have had much variety.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sheppard's boyhood memory of the place was full of such
promise _ of a place so serene, simple, and beautiful, it might
only have been a memory of idealized childhood.
</P>
<P>
   A fashion jewelry salesman in New York City, Sheppard lives with
his wife, Barbara, and their two daughters, Penny and Caroline, in
Oceanport, N.J. The Sheppards do much of their family vacationing
on the Jersey Shore beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was this memory Chris had. From the time he had
lived in St. Albans, Vt., ski-raced at Jay Peak, and swum and
fished on Lake Willoughby, a vision of the place had stayed with
him.
</P>
<P>
   On a damp morning last week with nothing but loon cries in the
early mist, Chris rowed his two daughters out on Willoughby. An old
painted aluminum boat, stout wooden oars in his hands ... it all
felt just as he remembered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step back in time,'' said Sheppard, now listening to
wavelets stirred by the morning breeze lap against the hull of his
rented rowboat. ``It's just like it always was up here ... no
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed silence and simplicity are what draw a relatively few
tourists to this outback corner of New England. While visitors
motor down from Quebec on the northern border, lower New England
with its prepackaged tourism and high-energy advertising keeps most
summer vacationers on the Cape Cod beaches or the populated lakes
that buzz with motorized activity from July 4 to Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was always so different, so special,'' said
Sheppard, noting that such areas are caught between a need for
tourist dollars for economic survival and this product itself, the
elemental closeness to nature that gives the few real outback areas
left their allure. ``I wanted my children to see this while it was
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   That ominous note is heard more often these days around the
Northeast Kingdom, especially by sportsmen's groups who fear that a
kind of gentrification is taking place that threatens the
traditional relationship between natives and the wilderness around
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Vermonters,'' as some call themselves, describe a
time-honored tradition of open-range hunting dating to colonial
days. But as the region slowly becomes discovered by a new
generation seeking the ancient charms of the place and willing to
move away from the cities south of here, the old relationship
between man and land is being challenged, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move up here and post (place `No Trespassing' signs on)
land that's been hunted for three centuries,'' said a Newport man
who asked not to be identified because of his ongoing ``troubles''
with some new landownders in the region. ``I don't mind regulations
on motors in small lakes and things like that. That's got to
happen. But when some of the best hunting land closes, that hurts.
That's what changes up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the July Vermont Outdoors Magazine, Northeast Kingdom
columnist Barry Cahoon describes a recent episode of a clash
between newcomers and the land they seek to inherit by way of
mortgage. The tale is part of the picture, says state fisheries
biologist Len Girardi, of the ``Disneyfication'' of wildlife by the
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   In May, an ``abandoned'' newborn moose calf drew the attention
of residents around Sheffield, though Ken Denton, a game warden,
admonished people to leave it alone after he moved it off the road
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denton made repeated visits to Sheffield as residents
continued to intervene on behalf of the the young moose's
`welfare,''' writes Cahoon. ``Warden Denton reported one person
spent at least one night sitting beside the calf after having
placed a blanket over it ... to keep the young moose from
`freezing' and to protect it from predators.''
</P>
<P>
   Denton learned from one resident that a cow moose, undoubtedly
the mother, had been seen approaching the calf but veering away
because of the proximity of humans, who he also suspected had been
feeding the calf.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this misguided altruism is that the young moose,
now contaminated by human contact, had to be taken to a wild animal
rehabilitation facility, then most likely to a zoo for the rest of
its life.
</P>
<P>
   Natives familiar with mooseways, of course, know that northern
New England is the southern range for the hardy species and that
even a newborn was not about to freeze to death in high spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in the Northeast Kingdom we take pride in our rural
heritage and our connection with the land,'' concludes Cahoon.
``Which makes this recent event all the more disturbing. Let it be
a wake up call.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But such incidents still amount to lovers' spats within what
outdoor enthusiasts still regard as one of the last best
sportsmen's haunts in New England.
</P>
<P>
   At the very top of the state lies Lake Mephremagog, a long, thin
glacial lake with 30 of its 38 miles stretching into Canada. Hardly
outback country, Newport is a bustling tourist town on the south
shore of Mephremagog, complete with restaurants, hotels, shopping,
and even a paddlewheel excursion boat with a yellow fringe canopy.
Still, Mephremagog is so vast that fishermen can and do find their
way to the quiet deep haunts in pursuit mostly of togue and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization also buzzes in Island Pond, Lyndonville, and St.
Johnsbury, the biggest towns in the region. But even out in the
coutryside are signs of what promoters of the region like to
describe as the marriage of wilderness and civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the Jay General Store for coffee, for instance, and
proprietor Peggy Moran leads you out to the adjoining art gallery.
Dominating the hundreds of oils and watercolors is the work of Will
Moses, whose serigraphs and lithographs of Vermont country life
echo hauntingly of scenes painted by his famous great grandmother,
Grandma Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Guns and ammo, fishing gear and bait, homemade pies and serious
art _ all in easy proximity along a country road here where cars
slow down to pass tractors towing wagonloads of hay from field to
barn.
</P>
<P>
   And again, the billowing green stillness that draws its
relatively few aficionados is a mixed blessing in this New England
outback. Said Moran, ``Of course we're here because of the beauty,
but (the businesses) could use some help from tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the winter problem. The Northeast Kingdom is
one of the heaviest snow belts in the country _ up to 300 inches a
year _ making daily life difficult at best. In Jay, Burke,
Craftsbury, and a few other ski areas, winter is prime time for
visitors. But life in much of the region groans along under the
heavy mantle of the interminably long winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to be feast or famine up here,'' said Conrad Klefos,
marketing director for Jay Peak Ski Area and an 18-year resident of
the Northeast Kingdom. ``We're the biggest employer in the region,
and that's 80 in summer to about 325 during ski season. Most others
do logging and farming. But most people aren't here because they
have to be. They're either born here or came here for the beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Klefos, an avid hunter and fisherman who relocated from New
Hampshire, where he worked at Sunapee, came to look at Jay in 1980.
``I thought I was just cruising through,'' he said with a chuckle.
Of the winters, he says the Northeast Kingdom gets at least three
times the snowfall of even southern Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see flurries in early September, and the snow can last
until May. It's a long, long stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it is a summer idyll across spectacular Lake Willoughby,
its two towering granite peaks rising over a 300-foot-deep fiord. A
morning sun burns at the fog hanging off the overhanging cliffs as
Lew Mutty and his two sons, Chris and Mike, paddle their canoe in
pursuit of prized lake trout.
</P>
<P>
   The Muttys are from New Bedford, Mass., back visiting family in
this country, which Lew describes as ``the way Vermont was 300
years ago.'' Mutty remembers Cape Cod when it was more like
Vermont's lake country and notes how overrun the once rural
seashore has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better here than down the Cape,'' he said. ``It's
exciting to explore places where you just don't find other people.
It's bound to change sometime, I guess. Sometime people are going
to figure it out. How beautiful it is and how easy it is to get
here.''

 &HT;    ``Controvercial'' Cerebral Palsey summer camp improves
children's conditions
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ At this summer camp, the day begins
with a wading pool full of sage tea and ends on a huge rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   In between come ropes and ladders, rubber rings, dowel rods and
a form of holistic therapy developed in Budapest by a Jewish
physician hiding from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   To the mothers and fathers who have contributed $2,750 each to
the six-week camp, conductive education is a glorious discovery for
children with cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   The United Cerebral Palsy Association in Washington, D.C., isn't
so enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are wide claims, but absolutely no studies,'' says Dr.
Murray Goldstein, medical director of the association's research
and education foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But the parents and children _ five girls and three boys _ feel
their own experience is all the proof they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, my son was in a wheelchair 60 percent of the
time,'' declares Valerie Rueckert. ``Now he doesn't use the chair
at all. He's on a walker, or two canes at school and home, and his
goal is to go back to school this fall with just canes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rueckert is president of the South Florida Centre for Conductive
Education Inc., a nonprofit organization she and several other
local parents founded a year ago to bring the Hungarian technique
here. Last summer, the camp was held in the parish hall of a local
church. This year, the center is using a classroom at Allamanda
Elementary School, donated by the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this camp is it's six hours a day, five days a
week,'' Rueckert says. ``It's concentrated and intense, and all the
children are together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral palsy is a motor disorder caused by an injury to the
central nervous system, usually before or during birth. It is
neither genetic nor degenerative, but people who have it experience
varying degrees of spastic paralysis. Children with CP are often
born prematurely, such as Rueckert's son, Billy, now 9, who arrived
seven weeks early.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Rueckert says, she paid $60 for a 30-minute therapy
session at local clinics. Cost of the camp breaks down to about $92
an hour for 180 hours.
</P>
<P>
   For their $2,750, the families get Edit Revay and Edina Kijatz
Nagyne, both 32 and ``conductors'' at The Peto Institute in
Budapest, founded in 1950 by Dr. Andras Peto, who died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s, the center says, Peto was a Viennese-trained
physician hiding from the Nazis with a Budapest family whose
11-year-old daughter had cerebral palsy. Studying the girl's daily
routine, he began to develop the technique that was later
formalized as conductive education. Today, the institute works with
CP children as well as offering four-year training courses for
conductors like Revay and Nagyne.
</P>
<P>
   For the first two weeks of camp, each day begins with a blue
wading pool full of sage tea. Soaking in the pool relaxes muscles
and decreases spasticity. After two weeks of immersion, the
technique is modified and simple sage-soaked packs are laid on the
joints, followed by a half-hour of deep massage and reflexology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day is taken up with exercises performed on mats, or
seated at tables, or using simple wooden stools and chairs built to
Peto specifications by some of the campers' fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting my feet flat and straight,'' Revay calls, and the
children repeat the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm straightening my elbows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lifting my left arm.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each day, they practice falling forward onto the
mats and catching themselves. In the transition from wheelchair to
walker to canes, some falls are inevitable, so they are learning to
fall safely. Those who find the exercise too difficult, or
frightening, use a giant rubber ball to roll forward onto their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that much difference from traditional therapy,''
Rueckert says, ``except for the concentration. It's inch by inch.
Little goals. Constant work.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hollis, the assistant director of child development at
St. Mary's Medical Center, has come to observe conductive
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``These parents need to be open to anything,'' Hollis says,
choosing her words carefully. ``I don't think anyone should put all
their eggs in one basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the technique controversial?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat controversial,'' she concedes. ``There's not a
lot of medical literature on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that lack of medical literature that troubles Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have _ and I don't mean to be derogatory _ is the
experience of various parents, and they never discuss bad cases or
failures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is the result after five years, Goldstein asks? What kinds
of patients are most helped, and which least?
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, he recalls, an English group seeking
government support compared traditional therapy with conductive
education and found no difference in results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studies that need to be done have not been done,''
Goldstein says. ``I've been encouraging them in meeting after
meeting to set up carefully designed clinical trials and they say,
`Absolutely, we need to.' And then I never hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the five girls and three boys attending this year's camp,
and their parents, say conductive education works.
</P>
<P>
   ``My right arm is straighter,'' says Christina Ford, 9, a
third-grader at South Olive Elementary School who attends the camp
with her twin sister, Danielle. Her mother, Susan, agrees.
``Christina can walk the length of the room now,'' she reports,
``and Danielle can do 20 steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp ``got me out of my chair completely,'' Billy Rueckert
says.
</P>
<P>
   Then he lowers himself to the floor, rolls the length of the
room on exercise mats, pulls himself to his feet on the back of a
chair and walks between two parallel bars, smiling all the way.

 &HT;    Senior computer use rising in US
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Tillie Hess' first day of computer class and her cursor
keeps disappearing from the screen.
</P>
<P>
   She leans closer, squints and tentatively pushes the
``mouse-thing'' around until the pea-size arrow reappears. The
minor success elicits a small smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I clip?'' Hess asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Click,'' computer instructor Diana Bruens says patiently.
``You click the mouse on the icons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Icons?'' Hess asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures,'' Bruens says, pointing. ``The little pictures
on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooh, the pictures.'' Hess nods.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks and four classes later Hess, 80, has stopped looking
for the carriage return and is predicting cybersuccess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to talk to my grandson on e-mail,'' she says. ``He
gave me a computer so I can go online.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hess arrives, she'll have plenty of company from 70-, 80-
and 90-somethings from around the country. The Internet is quickly
becoming the favored province of a generation that used to write
with fountain pens.
</P>
<P>
   Adults over 60 have quietly become the fastest-growing segment
of computer users, according to Ann Wrixon, the executive director
of SeniorNet, a San Francisco-based computer service created nine
years ago to help seniors become computer-literate.
</P>
<P>
   Forget knitting _ about 8 million seniors are wired and the
number is doubling every three months.
</P>
<P>
   Geriatric experts cite it as a blessing. At an age when
isolation can be debilitating, the Internet is a giant, electronic
social network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine living without it,'' says Hy Slutskin, an
82-year-old suburban Delray Beach great-grandfather of four who has
been online for two years. Though married and active, Slutskin is
limited by a heart condition and spends five hours a day at his
computer. His devotion is literally written in sweat: His mouse is
marked by three distinct spots where his palm and fingers rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have it, I'd probably just watch too much TV,''
Slutskin says.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the statistical confluence of increasing
technology and the skyrocketing elderly population is poised to
redefine America.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will older Americans drive the computer industry, they
will become a greater force in staffing it. Craig Spiezle,
Microsoft's director of market development, said his company is
counting on older Americans becoming future designers and employees
in an era where there is already a shortage of high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, retirement communities will find that fast
cable modem connections to the Internet are as important as nearby
golf courses in attracting elderly residents, said Mary Furlong,
chairman of ThirdAge Media, an online business providing
information to older Americans and the companies trying to reach
them.
</P>
<P>
   What's the draw? Besides e-mail, seniors say they are going
online to access medical information, keep track of investments,
trade jokes, read newspapers in other cities and organize volunteer
committees.
</P>
<P>
   But before they launch into cyberspace, a typical septuagenarian
has to learn the basics. Computer courses _ starting with how to
turn the machine on _ are sweeping senior centers and adult living
communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At King's Point, 250 seniors chosen by lottery have taken a
12-hour course since January. There are 500 more on a waiting list,
Bruens said. SeniorNet has opened 141 learning centers around the
country and expects to add dozens more this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no frame of reference for this stuff, so we spend a
lot of time on the mouse and how it works,'' Bruens says at Kings
Point. ``A lot of them are afraid they are going to break the
computer.''

 &HT;    Toon museum looks for punchline to attract tourists
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON _ Mickey Mouse put Orlando on the map. Why couldn't
Beetle Bailey do the same for Boca Raton?
</P>
<P>
   Tourism was on the mind of government officials in 1994 when
they lured the International Museum of Cartoon Art to Mizner Park
with start-up money and dirt-cheap land. Boasting one of the best
collections of its kind, the cartoon museum seemed like a
can't-miss attraction for both scholars and fun-lovers.
</P>
<P>
   But more than two years after opening its doors to a
half-completed building, the cartoon museum is still seeking a
punch line. Museum officials are happy to be up and running. But
they concede that management changes, inadequate money raising and
make-shift galleries are keeping the museum from reaching its
potential as a must-see destination.
</P>
<P>
   The museum ``just doesn't deliver as dramatically as it should
to meet the expectations audiences have for a cartoon museum,''
said Dennis Barrie, the museum's former adviser, who was director
of the $94 million Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in
Cleveland. ``It needs to upgrade its whole presentation, and the
feel of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Founder Mort Walker, the creator of Beetle Bailey, who brought
the museum to Boca Raton when it outgrew its suburban New York
home, said the ``biggest challenge is the same one facing every
other museum in the country _ raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our programs seem to be going good. Our attendance seems
to be going good. I'm not in the least bit discouraged. I could be
happier. But, good God, we're in a start-up situation.''
</P>
<P>
   More like a Catch-22 situation, said Barrie. And one that may
stem from a decision to open the Mizner Park building in two
phases. With only the first floor open, the museum has a temporary
feeling that doesn't present exhibits to their best advantage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those temporary (exhibition) walls! They look like they could
be wheeled right out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Lively, well-mounted exhibitions attract visitors. And ticket
sales are essential to the museum's bare-bones, $1 million annual
operating budget, noted Abbie Brennan Roeloffs, the museum's acting
director. ``Improving the space was the very first thing I noticed
that needed to be done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So the museum may try an intermediate step _ a $1.5 million
renovation of the first floor that would upgrade the galleries,
theater and education facilities, and include some interactive
exhibits. Part of the money could come from a $500,000 construction
grant from the state, and part from a $1 million gift from the
Hearst Foundation. Another $500,000 would have to be raised,
Roeloffs said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin next autumn and be completed in 2000.
The renovation would push back completion of the entire $15 million
project indefinitely. Officials had hoped to finish the building by
1999, including a second floor filled with the sort of high-tech
exhibits that are all the rage in American museums.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable change isn't a ``fall-back position,'' said
Roeloffs. ``It's a responsible, strategic decision. We're answering
what our community and our patrons are telling us about the
museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundraising has been a problem for the $15 million project from
the start, officials said. The operating budget is in the black.
But the cash flow is tight, Roeloffs said, largely because the
museum has no endowment to dip into.
</P>
<P>
   With only 10 full-time employees, the museum is understaffed,
relying heavily on 150 volunteers. The museum has raised only $7.5
million in construction money, largely from the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   A board of trustees, loaded with big-name artists and industry
executives, is also supportive. But the museum must do more to
attract local donors, according to Will Ray, president of the Palm
Beach County Cultural Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boca Raton philanthropy has not done its part for the
museum,'' he said, noting that the largest individual gift remains
$1 million from California resident and Peanuts creator Charles
Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single gift from a Boca resident is $250,000 _ from
Mort Walker and his wife, Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little disappointed that we haven't had more local
support,'' said Joseph D'Angelo, president of the museum's board of
trustees and chairman of King Features Syndicate. ``But it takes
time for institutions to become part of the community, including
the Kravis Center. It's a small miracle that we have such a
beautiful building up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Roeloffs disagrees that local support has been lacking, noting
that $2.5 million has been raised from South Florida donors and
corporations, such as SunTrust bank. ``I don't think Boca Raton has
let us down, but I don't know that we've done enough to include the
community in our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum attracted roughly 55,000 visitors in its second year,
down from 70,000 during the first year. ``A 20 percent drop off
after the first year is not unusual for any new museum,'' Roeloffs
said. Roughly 145,000 people have visited the museum since it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting visitors is a challenge. D'Angelo said the museum
``never wanted to become a fun house. On the other hand, it has to
be more user-friendly. Some people walk through and think it's
terrific. I thought it would be more interactive. But that will
come when we achieve a higher profile and shake more dollars
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's greatest asset is its extraordinary collection,
observers agree. Numbering more than 160,000 objects, the archive
includes classic comic strips, political cartoons, animation art
and films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never wanted to become Disneyland,'' Walker said, adding
the museum has tried to walk the line between scholarship and
entertainment. ``One of our functions has always been to convince
the world that cartoons have (artistic and cultural) value.''
</P>
<P>
   But so does old-fashioned pizazz, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've had a lot of generic-type exhibitions _
Cartoons Go To War, The Art Of Animation. But the exhibitions that
really seem to bring people out are the ones that have a star, like
Garfield.'' A Garfield retrospective is at the museum through Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges go beyond exhibitions, said cultural council
president Ray. ``The museum has lacked consistent management,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the building opened, Fritz Jellinghaus worked as
development director, also serving as a kind of acting director. He
left for a position at a New York museum. Last year, Kip Eagan
became director after heading the Palm Beach Community College
Museum of Contemporary Art in Lake Worth. He resigned in May,
saying he wanted to return to his first love _ fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Roeloffs, 45, who was serving as a private consultant, was named
acting director. From 1989-1994, the Tequesta resident was
associate director of the rock and roll museum under Dennis Barrie.
Her speciality is finance and organization, and she helped raise
money for the popular I.M. Pei-designed building.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the most organized people I've ever dealt with,''
said Barrie. ``She has a great ability to plan things out for the
immediate and long-term future. Organization supplies stability.
And the museum needs to do some long-term planning for five and
even ten years.''
</P>
<P>
   Any new museum faces problems, said George Bolge, director of
the Boca Raton Museum of Art, which plans to build a new facility
at the opposite end of Mizner Park, and may compete for some of the
same dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes three to five years to get a new museum up to
speed,'' he said. ``As much as you plan, when you open the doors
there are always a host of contingencies that pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear now that they probably needed more funding from
the very beginning,'' said Barrie. ``But it's a great concept, with
wonderful people involved. It's blessed with a superb collection,
many assets, and it ultimately will be a wonderful facility.''

BUYING TESTIMONY IS SELLING JUSTICE, SAYS COURT 
</HEADLINE>

   No deals. The federal government can't promise a witness
leniency in exchange for his or her testimony. That's what a
three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
said to federal prosecutors on July 1. The ruling sent shock waves
through federal law enforcement agencies and offices of U.S.
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-reasoned ruling, but it didn't last long. On July
10, the court issued an order to vacate the ruling and ordered a
rehearing of the case before the entire 12-judge appellate court in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the shock waves bounced back, built up as high as a
tsunami to drown out the three judicial voices of reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Tenth Circuit Court's decisions affect Wyoming, Colorado,
Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma, but the influence of such a
decision reaches the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The case, U.S. vs. Singleton, involves the transport of cocaine
from California to Wichita, Kansas. Sonya Singleton, allegedly one
of the drug dealers, was charged with multiple counts of money
laundering and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Before trial, her
attorney moved to suppress the testimony of Napoleon Douglas, an
alleged co-conspirator, because Douglas had been promised leniency
in return for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton's attorney asserts that the federal government's
promise of leniency violates the ``bribery of witnesses'' section
of the U.S. Code.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Title 18, Section 201(c)(2), states in plain English
``Whoever directly or indirectly, gives, offers, or promises
anything of value to any person, for or because of the testimony
under oath ... or to be given by such a person as a witness upon a
trial ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not
more than two years, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court notes in its July 1 ruling that the government
had promised not to prosecute Douglas ``for any other violations of
the Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act stemming from his
activities currently under investigation, except perjury or related
offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers argued that dropping charges isn't really
``anything of value.'' Nonsense, said the court, facing fewer years
in jail is something ``of value.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the request to narrow the construction of the law so
that it doesn't apply to federal prosecutors, the court simply
states: ``Courts may not create their own limitations on
legislation, no matter how alluring the policy arguments for doing
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also argued that the opening word, ``Whoever,''
in Section 201(c) of the U.S. Code does not refer to the federal
government. The court disagrees. It contends that there are only
two classes of cases in which inclusive language does not apply to
the government _ those that would limit its sovereign rights or
prerogatives and those that would create an absurdity if applied to
the government, like a speed limit applied to a police car in
pursuit of a suspect. Neither exception fits the bribery of
witnesses section of the U.S. Code.
</P>
<P>
   The court made short shrift of the government's position: ``The
anti-gratuity provision of Section 201(c)(2) indicates Congress's
belief that justice is undermined by giving, offering, or promising
anything of value for testimony. If justice is perverted when a
criminal defendant seeks to buy testimony from a witness, it is no
less perverted when the government does so. ... Further, the
interests of the United States as sovereign militate in favor of
applying Section 201(c)(2) against federal prosecutors. The
sovereign's interests are in the enforcement of its laws and the
just administration of its judicial system; applying Section
201(c)(2) to all parties in that judicial system advances both
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court harkens back to Magna Carta's basic principle
_ ``the king is subject to the law.'' The U.S. Constitution is
founded on that same principle _ the government is not above the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The court might have gone further into Magna Carta. Section 40
states: ``To no one will we sell ... justice,'' a principle
essential to any meaningful court of law. Buying testimony is
selling justice.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the appellate court is well aware that
they are challenging a prosecutorial practice that has been in
vogue for nearly 40 years: ``No practice is more ingrained in our
criminal justice system than the practice of the government calling
a witness who is an accessory to the crime for which the defendant
is charged and having that witness testify under a plea bargain
that promises him a reduced sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 1 ruling suppresses Douglas' tainted testimony as
illegal and sends the case back down to the trial court for a new
trial without his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long it has been done, buying testimony is
antithetical to any notion of justice.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 150 years in this country, suspects had been beaten,
starved and threatened with death or denied medical aid in order to
get a confession _ until the U.S. Supreme Court took a firm stand
against such brutal practices in Brown vs. Mississippi, 1936. In
that case, a black man was whipped with his belt in the basement of
police station and then hung with it until he lost consciousness,
then revived and the process repeated _ until, at last, he could
take no more and signed a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Confessions gained through the use of physical or psychological
pain are unreliable. A person signs a confession in order to stop
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the beating is the suspect's reward for signing a
confession. In a sense, it is bought testimony _ ending the beating
is something ``of value.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 1 ruling was right. And a long-standing government
practice has finally been called what it is _ wrong. The full Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals should stand firm on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   If the full court agrees with the July 1 ruling, it may make law
enforcement more difficult, but it will help preserve this nation's
belief in justice and fair play.

 &HT;    WWII expert finds film's battle scenes chillingly true to life
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In 30 years, war historian Stephen E. Ambrose has
interviewed thousands of veterans. He's heard it all, chilling
facts and shocking details, most of which have found their way into
his raft of books, including the current best-seller ``Citizen
Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing could prepare him for Steven Spielberg's D-Day epic
``Saving Private Ryan,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Credited as the movie's historical consultant, Ambrose recently
viewed the film alone in a 1,000-seat theater in New Orleans. The
room dimmed, and for the next 30 minutes the screen crackled with
images of relentless battle. Smoke, machine-gun fire, grenade
explosions, scattered body parts, young men screaming for their
mothers. Ambrose sat there, agape.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the opening scene was done, I yelled up to the
projectionist, 'Cut!' I had to recover. I was just wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Dallas hotel room last weekend, the 62-year-old author,
journalist and former professor sighs. ``I think it's the best war
film ever made. A hundred years from now this will be the
touchstone for World War II films.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Ambrose had no idea he was the film's historical
consultant until DreamWorks invited him to see the finished work.
The filmmakers used as source material three of Ambrose's
nonfiction books, ``Citizen Soldiers,'' ``Band of Brothers'' and
the acclaimed best-seller ``D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic
Battle of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I'm a consultant; they consulted my books,'' says
Ambrose. ``I saw all kinds of scenes in the movie, and I know
exactly where they got them from. But I was not involved in writing
the script. I didn't have to do a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a rumor that Spielberg was making a movie about D-Day,
and I really didn't understand how he could do it and not talk to
me. But he's Steven Spielberg, he can do whatever the hell he wants
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose is being paid his standard speaker's fee to take part in
the film's five-city promotional tour. (``I ain't gonna do this for
free,'' he says.) Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks and Matt Damon are
also on the tour, plumping a combat movie even the director says is
too graphic for anybody under age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, who was in the military but never saw combat, might
agree. He believes the carnage depicted in ``Ryan'' may serve as an
antidote to classic war films that cast battle in a nimbus of
benign glory. There are elements in ``Ryan,'' he says, that are
unprecedented in the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never seen a movie in which a G.I. shoots a German
whose got his hands up saying 'Comrade,' though it happened all the
time,'' says Ambrose. ``I've been interviewing veterans for 30
years and I've heard stories that chill your heart. But the
American public wouldn't have stood still for a scene like that in
1945, or '55 or '65.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw Daryl Zanuck's 'The Longest Day' the thing
that struck me very hard was that, when actors spoke, the sounds of
battle mysteriously faded away and you didn't miss a word,'' he
continues. ``That's not the way it happened and that's not the way
it happens in Spielberg's movie. You lose a lot of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Zanuck film, when a G.I. gets shot, he's dead. . . . He
never knew what hit him; he didn't suffer. Well, that happens in
maybe 1 percent of the cases. Guys do get shot between the eyes.
But 98 percent know damn well what happened and they suffer; they
know they're dying. And Spielberg gets it exactly right. I've heard
this so many times in my interviews: A wounded man dying before
your eyes wants (his) mother, water, a cigarette and morphine.''
</P>
<P>
   After his initial screening, Ambrose took a WWII veteran to see
``Ryan.'' The only thing he noticed missing was ``the smell of
battle,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But other than that, this is how it happened. People are going
to look at this movie and say it couldn't be that bad. I guarantee
you it was that bad. I saw on the screen what I've been hearing
from veterans for 30 years. I never thought I'd see it on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose's first books were about the Civil War. The arena of
WWII came to him. ``Dwight Eisenhower read one of my books, called
me up and asked me if I'd be interested in writing his biography,''
he recalls. ``I was 28. I picked myself up off the floor, and I
said, 'Yes, sir.' ``
</P>
<P>
   He says the narrative kernel for ``Saving Private Ryan'' was
taken from his book about the 101st Airborne, ``Band of Brothers.''
In it, a soldier named Fritz Niland loses three brothers in one
week during the war. His mother receives all three telegrams on the
same day, and the Army decides to pull Niland out of the war and
send him back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of the movie is it takes that story and asks what
if they hadn't found him,'' says Ambrose. ``At that point it
becomes fiction, and I don't have any idea if the Army would have
sent a squad out for one guy. But it sure gives Spielberg a
wonderful device for taking you through Normandy in that first
week.'' Ambrose says he isn't a bit bitter about his late
involvement with the film and not getting a paycheck for all his
books provided .
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Titanic books on the best-seller list,'' he says.
``I'm gonna do fine out of this. Just fine.''

 &HT;    Florida seniors learning soft movements of tai chi
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ East is meeting West Palm Beach in
Century Village these days.
</P>
<P>
   Tai chi _ ``the grand ultimate'' in Mandarin _ is a Chinese
martial arts technique at least 1,000 years old. When practiced as
an exercise, its slow movements and graceful postures, one flowing
smoothly into the next, is an ideal workout for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think exercise has to be fast to be effective,''
explains Jerry Ziffer, 43, a professional massage therapist whose
tai chi class in this mile-wide retirement community is 1 year old
this month. ``I compare tai chi to a microwave oven as opposed to a
conventional oven. A microwave cooks from the inside out. It
massages and develops circulation in all your organs.''
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, as many as 150 Villagers gather in the
clubhouse gym to meditate through movement in four weekly classes.
At Monday's class, 15 women and Herb Schindler showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of men are too macho to stand out here with all these
women,'' bragged Schindler, 77, ``but I know what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   With environmental mood music playing on the boom box, Ziffer
leads the group of seniors through the 13 basic postures. Some of
the people are surprisingly graceful and some lag behind. Some get
and their left and right hands mixed up, and some find the slow
motions surprisingly tiring after a half-hour or so. But they all
say tai chi offers them something they didn't find in sit-ups and
leg lifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lower back problem,'' reports Belle Sohnen, 65. ``My
doctor says I have to exercise and walk, and since I don't like
either one, I told him I'd do tai chi and line dancing instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Glotzer, 74, favors tai chi because it doesn't
aggravate her arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his worst student, and I don't care,'' she says. ``When I
did the exercise bike, it threw my knees out, but this is calm and
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowena Spilken, 85, practices tai chi in search of
transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts me into a spiritual feeling I can't get any other
way,'' she said. ``It makes me feel light and ethereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I only weight 90 pounds, so it's not hard for me to
feel light.''

 &HT;    ABC's new turn-on: Sex With Cindy
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Sex With Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it. You're curious. And that's what ABC hopes will happen
when Crawford's racy special with that title airs in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we want ratings,'' says Crawford, the program's
host. ``The show is about sex. It's like the sexual state of the
union, so (the title) is a bit provocative and hopefully will get
people curious enough to tune in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the one-hour special, the leggy supermodel with the world's
most famous mole tours America and talks sex. Filmed in New York,
California and Madison, Wis., Crawford talks to a husband who met a
woman on the Internet and had an affair. She examines how couples
in long-term relationships can keep the sex hot and chats to teens
about sexual responsibility. Even such celebrities as Brooke
Shields, Howie Mandel and French Stewart share their thoughts on
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the one-night stand issue. Yes, she's had one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked guys who ever had a one-night stand, every guy
said he had one,'' says Crawford. ``I asked the women and not one
said `Yes.' Now, I don't believe that. There's still a stereotype
that women shouldn't have one-night stands, so none of them would
cop to it. So I was the only woman with my hand raised, which was
pretty embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, sex is used to sell everything from cars to prime-time
news shows. Crawford, who has a three-year development deal with
ABC, actually thinks all those sexual images are causing people to
have less sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can just get off in so many other ways,'' she says.
``You read books that take place a hundred years ago and the
glimpse of an ankle or the back of someone's neck was a real-turn
on. But, now, you're driving in your car and you see (actor)
Antonio Sabato Jr., like, laying there in his underwear with this
incredible body, and you go home and your husband maybe doesn't
look quite that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Crawford is also a fantasy woman. Does the image
overwhelm her ability to make friends?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Cindy, a woman,'' she explains, ``who works for this
machine called Cindy Crawford. I always say that's a thing. It's a
creation, it's hair, it's make-up. it's photography, it's an image.
She's part of me, but there's a separation. The first half-hour,
everyone wants to get their picture taken with (the image) . . .
then they realize I'm from the Midwest, too, and have friends that
look just like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford says one of the show's funniest moments was when she
talked to a guy who has a 60-second rule for his one-night stand
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said (the woman) has to get up 60 seconds after the act is
completed, or (she) has to spend the night and that means he'll
probably have to call her again,'' says Crawford. ``I was like,
`And people go out with you?' I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're tuning in expecting Crawford to talk about intimate
details of her sex life with her new husband, restarateur/model
Rande Gerber, or her ex, Richard Gere, forget it. It's just a
title, folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be fair to my ex-husband to talk about
my sex life with him because he's a famous person and people know
him and I would be violating his privacy,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nobody's really comfortable talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, people were giggling and blushing and poking each
other,'' she recalls. ``I think that's the whole point of the show.
Sex is hard to talk about. I mean, I was blushing myself.''

 &HT;    Sellers rejoice over Christian book boom
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS, Texas _ Baby boomers looking for the meaning of life,
Generation Xers wanting to avoid the mistakes of their parents,
business professionals seeking new leadership and a general
population wondering about the millennium have one thing in common.
</P>
<P>
   They are buying millions of Christian books.
</P>
<P>
   Book sales are estimated by industry analysts to account for
$1.2 billion _ and rapidly rising _ of the Christian retail market.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has experienced double-digit growth since 1993 as
mainstream Christians, who once thought of Christian books as the
staple of fundamentalists, are now finding ones that feed their
appetite for spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into a high-tech, fast-paced culture there is a
general growing hunger for spirituality,'' said Tom Mockabee,
senior vice president and publisher at Zondervan, one of the
country's largest Christian publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too long ago, New Age books filled the hunger and it never
really satisfied,'' said Terry Walsh of the B&AMP;B Media Group, a
Chicago-based publicity firm that handles Christian authors. ``Now,
they are coming and looking at Christian books for satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian books are so popular, they are popping up in airport
gift shops. Sales are so strong that many of the nation's largest
secular bookstores, Borders, Barnes &AMP; Noble, Waldenbooks and B
Dalton are cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnes &AMP; Noble, B Dalton and Waldenbooks _ all of them are
adding buyers familiar with our market,'' said Trevor Overcash of
AMG Publishers, which specializes in Bibles and Bible-related
books.
</P>
<P>
   And large commercial discount stores, like Wal-Mart and Kmart,
have jumped on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion books really sell,'' said Mark Tauber of HarperSan
Francisco, the religious publishing arm of HarperCollins
Publishers. Already Wal-Mart, its Sam's Club subsidiary, and Kmart
have ordered 100,000 copies of a devotional book, ``365 W.W.J.D.?''
(What Would Jesus Do?), due out later this year. It shows that
secular stores are eager to grab hold of the latest Christian
craze.
</P>
<P>
   The crossover to secular stores is celebrated by Christian
publishers who are quick to point out that a decade ago those same
stores showed little interest in stocking their books.
</P>
<P>
   At the Christian Booksellers Association's annual industry trade
show that ended Thursday in Dallas, the up-and-coming books will
give readers plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an ice-cream pavilion; there's so many different
flavors,'' said Lew Schoettle, the owner of Schoettle Publishing in
Hayesville, N.C., who had a booth at the show.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent on the exhibit floor was the flood of angel
books that until recently seemed to dominate the market. ``The
angels have flown on to a higher realm,'' said Phyllis Tickle of
Publisher's Weekly, which tracks trends in secular and religious
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a decline in scholarly books,'' observed Charles
Rosenberg, who owns Rose Printing Co. in Austin. More than 50
percent of the books Rose publishes are Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new books break down denominational barriers,
drawing from traditional Christian values but stopping short of
favoring a particular denomination. Instead of preaching, books at
the booksellers show offered food for thought and guidance for a
better way of living.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers are turning to authors like Philip Yancey, whose
most recent book, ``What's So Amazing About Grace?,'' explores
issues of forgiveness, and Richard Foster, whose Celebration of
Discipline outlines spiritual disciplines for a more fulfilling
life. Foster's book has sold more than 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I write is aimed at people who have given up on the
superficiality of modern culture, including the modern religious
culture,'' Foster said. His next book, ``Streams of Living Water:
Celebrating the Great Traditions of Christian Faith,'' is about to
be released.
</P>
<P>
   Generation Xers are demanding ``how-to'' books that cover
everything from how to prepare for marriage to how to be a good
parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Xers are saying, `We saw divorce in our family and I'm
not going to go there,''' Tickle said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, books on the American family that help people cope with
everyday life and support basic values, such as honesty and
integrity, are expected to be the next biggest trend. Virtually
every major Christian book publisher offers a complete line of
titles that deal with marriage and family issues. There are even
speciality books, like ``The Attention Deficit Child'' by Grant
Martin. Martin, a Washington-state psychologist, presents medical
information, deals with psychological issues and offers advice to
help parents cope. He also tells them how God fits into the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   Also booming is faith in the workplace. It's not about
proselytizing to co-workers, but how to revive decency and
compassion in what many workers are perceiving as a cold, cruel
corporate world, said Martha McClendon of Broadman and Holman, a
leading Christian publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust is ethics, and business etiquette and being a
strong leader,'' she said. ``You don't want to treat someone like a
dog at work and then on Sunday go sing in the church choir.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Nielsen, a salesman for Rose Printing, said he is noticing
books that repeat a familiar message. ``The end is coming,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fallen televangelist Jim Bakker was at the booksellers show to
publicize the upcoming release of his newest book: ``Avoiding the
Dangers of Materialistic Christianity in the End Times: Prosperity
and the Coming Apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   Books about the Rapture and Apocalypse are starting to hit
bookstore shelves, but the number of titles should explode in the
months ahead as curiosity about Christianity's next 1,000 years
heightens with the impending millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty wild line we're going to cross,'' Tauber said.

 &HT;    Drug takes bite out of arthritis in dogs
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A drug that failed in humans is the key to
relieving the aches and pains of doggie arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Rimadyl (carprofen) is being heralded as the biggest thing in
animal health news in years, said Dr. Mark Hartwell, a veterinarian
at Arbor Animal Clinic in North Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The medicine originally was created as a nonsteroidal pain
reliever for people, but it turned their skin yellow when it was
used in drug trials by its manufacturer, Pfizer, said Hartwell. The
drug was shipped off to the pharmaceutical company's animal health
division, where it was studied and tested for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since vets can prescribe human drugs, it's not often we get a
new veterinary drug,'' he said. ``In veterinary medicine, this is a
big breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer estimates that one in five dogs eventually will develop
canine arthritis. Before Rimadyl, veterinarians usually first tried
aspirin, which can cause stomach upsets and sometimes impair kidney
function, Hartwell said. The next choice was phenylbutazone
(Butazolidin), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that also is
harsh to stomachs and can lead to bone marrow problems. Rimadyl
doesn't produce such adverse side effects, said Hartwell.
</P>
<P>
   But Rimadyl is not cheap, said Hartwell. The drug is prescribed
based on a dog's weight, and it is given twice a day. A bottle of
100 caplets for a large dog can cost nearly $100.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hartwell said, the drug's cost is offset by the results
it creates. He said he has been using Rimadyl on dogs for two years
and the change in his four-legged patients is amazing. (The drug is
for dogs only.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot of dogs that are alive today wouldn't be without
this drug,'' he said. Many canine arthritis sufferers were
euthanized when efforts to treat the pain failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that a very, very small percentage can develop liver
problems, but that doesn't scare us,'' he said. ``The condition is
reversible, meaning if you take the dog off (the medication) the
condition goes away.''

 &HT;    Women prefer being caught flat-footed
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Only a decade or two ago, the click click click of high
heels on hardwood or tile floors was the sound of women at work.
</P>
<P>
   Not every woman, of course. Nurses squeaked by in thick-soled
comfort shoes, cowgirls clomped around in work boots and those who
could get away with it wore tennis shoes or some other footwear
designed less for success than for casual comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many work situations where dressy clothes were
required, high heels reigned. Now _ despite holdouts who don't
consider themselves dressed without an extra inch or two spiked
beneath their feet _ the high heel is losing ground as woman's work
wardrobe staple.
</P>
<P>
   A national telephone survey of 500 women conducted this spring
by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society found 24 percent
of working women wear high heels on the job, down from 37 percent
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for women's feet, because according to the
orthopaedic society , more than 90 percent of all major forefoot
problems occur in women.
</P>
<P>
   High heels place undue pressure on the forefoot and have been
shown to lead to bunions, hammertoes, heel pain and other foot
problems, the orthopaedic society says. Pressure on the balls of
the feet increases with heel height, and a 3-inch heel creates
seven times more stress on the forefoot than a 1-inch heel.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend toward sensible shoes may have as much to do with
fashion and comfort as a conscious nod to health. Pairing high
heels with much of today's casual wear makes about as much sense as
sipping expensive champagne while eating pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Ntina (pronounced ``Dena'') Antoniou, 25, office
manager at Girl Games, glanced around at the footwear in her
all-female office one recent afternoon and reported an assortment
of Doc Martens, Birkenstocks and tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person here who wears heels is a salesperson who
hasn't worked here very long,'' says Antoniou, one of the
twentysomethings who are driving the trend toward low-heeled shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I (wore heels to work) once with a pair of pantyhose
and said never again. It always just seemed absurd to me. People
are just a lot more individual these days. I don't see a lot of
young women walking around in pantyhose and skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   High heels, she says ``seem like more of an evening thing. If
you're gonna get dressed up and go to the opera maybe. With an
evening gown, they're just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even women who still wear more traditional work uniforms have
discovered the attraction of dressy, low-heeled shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: Liz Oubre, 40, a teller at Security State Bank &AMP;
Trust in Spicewood, who discovered flats several years ago ``and
has never gone back.'' Oubre doesn't make exceptions even for
dress-up occasions. ``I tried to wear them (high heels) for that
and couldn't,'' Oubre says. ``They're just uncomfortable now.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Remer, who sells shoes at Leon's Fashions, says he began
noticing a swing away from high heels about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that there's a trend toward comfortable,
low-heeled shoes,'' he says. ``Even the ladies who used to wear a
high heel aren't wearing them as high. Years ago 2 1/2 to 3 inches
were standard and 3-inch heels really don't exist anymore. Now 2
1/2 would be considered high,'' says Remer, who's been in the shoe
business about 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Remer says, ``the older women who can still wear
high heels really want to. They're in a mindset. They were brought
up with the notion that it's dressy, that it makes the leg look
prettier.''
</P>
<P>
   But pretty legs can make for painful feet and joints,
podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons are fond of pointing out.
</P>
<P>
   Though not all foot injuries are caused by shoes, the wrong
footwear can certainly exacerbate them, says Austin podiatrist
Wendy Stinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will come in thinking they need surgery, when all they
need to do is wear some better fitting shoes,'' Stinson says.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson has been appalled at local business dress codes that
require particular heel-heights, even when their female employees
are suffering because of foot pain.
</P>
<P>
   She wears athletic footwear to work and encourages her employees
to do the same. For the occasional dressy occasions, she wears a
shoe with a 2 to 2 1/2-inch heel. Even wearing them for just a few
hours, ``they kill my feet,'' Stinson says, ``and there's nothing
wrong with my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   But she agrees with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle
Society that it's unrealistic to ask women to never wear heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman goes to a foot specialist and he tells her not to
wear dressy shoes, that's just not going to work,'' Stinson says.
``There's got to be a bit of a compromise.'' She offers these tips
for buying comfortable shoes that fit properly:
</P>
<P>
   Most people buy shoes too small. Measure both feet (and buy the
larger size). You should be able to wiggle your toes in your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Always shop for shoes wearing the socks or hose you'll wear with
the shoes you buy.

 &HT;    Couple to open preschool for poor kids with $70,000 of their own
cash
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people just talk about things.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about volunteering at a school. They talk about having
the old man next door over for dinner. They talk about winning the
lottery and doing great things for all the lost children in this
world.
</P>
<P>
   They talk.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the people who do. The people who take their dreams
and run.
</P>
<P>
   The people like Sabrena and Calvin Darville, who are opening a
preschool in a low-income housing development with $70,000 of their
money.
</P>
<P>
   No lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an absolute blessing to us,'' said Beth Kincey,
director of operations for the Palm Beach County Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``As corny as it sounds, they are just incredibly sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   And incredibly tired.
</P>
<P>
   He's a retired assistant principal at Lake Shore Middle School
in Belle Glade. She's a former teacher at H.L. Johnson Elementary
School. They have a 3-year-old son, Calvin, but they call him
Snooky. They are a dedicated couple with an improbable dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to give back to our community,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrena grew up in Pahokee, in the projects, the first of eight
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life turned around when I went to live with my
grandparents,'' she said, something she did in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin worked in the Glades schools for 42 years, teaching,
counseling and administrating, and has seen it all. The drugs. The
crime. The families pulled apart by the poverty and the lack of
education.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also seen sweet, sweet success. The kids who, given the
right mix, pulled themselves into successful relationships and
jobs. The kids who kept coming back _ and giving back.
</P>
<P>
   So when Sabrena and Calvin, who live in Wellington, turned off
Military Trail that one day about two years ago and found Dyson
Circle just off Sunny Lane in West Palm Beach, they knew they'd
found a place where they wanted to invest their money _ and their
souls.
</P>
<P>
   The dry, dirty yards. The shirtless kids roaming aimlessly along
the canal. The winding trail of plain, turquoise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a situation very similar to this,'' says Sabrena.
</P>
<P>
   The county housing authority runs six low-income projects, and
this will be the first day-care center in any of them. With that,
Beth Kincey is thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have wanted to do this for some time,'' she said, ``but we
didn't have anyone to run the gantlet.'' Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``So to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it's going to work: The Darvilles will lease the
building, Dyson Circle's old, community center, for $1 a year. The
Darvilles are paying to virtually gut the building and turn it into
a licensed day care, something that has not been cheap considering
they've spent $6,000 alone for the center's four fireproof doors.
The exhaust system in the kitchen cost another $5,000. Plumbing.
Electrical. Architect plans. Contractor fees. They're going to
spend about $70,000, Calvin estimates, on everything from sod to
nap mats.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they sure didn't get it from us,'' says Kincey about the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The preschool, called Little Achievers, will take children from
the neighborhood on a first-come, first-serve basis and will try to
hire some workers from within. Kincey estimates that of the 134
units at Dyson Circle, at least 84 of them are occupied by
families. She thinks there's about 100 preschool kids living at
Dyson Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The center will be able to take about half of those, but Kincey
says not everyone in the development needs day care.
</P>
<P>
   The Darvilles will get started with a $55,000 grant from the
Children's Services Council to start a fine arts program and staff
and run parenting classes, something Kincey said has been needed
for a long time. Preschool fees will be low because the day care
will be federally subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents are already incredibly excited,'' Kincey says.
``Every day they're beating on the door, saying, `Can my kid come
here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sign 'em up, says Sabrena Darville, who also has this to say:
These kids are getting all new stuff. No tables all marked up with
some other kid's doodling. No little chairs with wobbly legs. She
wants new stuff, new, new, new. So she took their money, sat down
with a catalog and ordered $4,000 worth of red tables and blue
chairs and bright mats and everything else it takes to start a
preschool from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are always getting stuff that's second hand,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Darvilles aren't certain it's all going to come
together in time for their opening on Aug. 19, the same day public
school starts back up. There's still so much to do. But the
Darvilles have always been able to look ahead. That's what keeps
them going.
</P>
<P>
   And looking ahead a year, or two, or 10, when the fruits of
their labor have taken root. When the children of Dyson Circle know
them by name and remember them as the loving couple who came in and
gave them a place to hang.
</P>
<P>
   When the Darvilles see today's 12-year-old bad boys turn into
tomorrow's success stories, they might very well forget the money
they've spent and the contractor who's always late and the 18-hour
days that leave them exhausted each night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Calvin Darville, who didn't get where he is in life
being a shy guy, has this wish list he's bound and determined to
get in the newspaper:
</P>
<P>
   Mulch. Trees. Sod. Playground pavilions. Manpower. Curtains.
Toys. Books. More manpower. More mulch. More sod.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to beg,'' says the tall, skinny man with a
perpetual grin, ``you might as well do it up right.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess you could say the same about dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   To help get Little Achievers Preschool off the ground, call the
school at (561) 684-6966.

 &HT;    COLUMN: The old friend and the sea
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY LARGO, Fla. _ Legends and grits seem an unlikely combination
but
</P>
<P>
   that's how I heard about Harvey - sandwiched into a corner of
Harriette's Restaurant over a bowl of grits and a side order of
bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and I went to school together - Miami Senior High, Class
of '51. I remembered him as a smart kid with a playful smile who
occasionally had a problem with the tardy bell.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey sat a couple of rows behind me in homeroom - as close to
the back door and as far away from the teacher as he could get -
for a good reason: morning roll call. If Harvey wasn't around when
the teacher got to his name, one of his buddies would answer for
him in a slurred voice usually masked by the back of a hand. Later,
we suspected the teacher knew what was up but chose not to make an
issue of it. Harvey always showed up eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Many mornings he'd do his 'crab walk' through the back door,
making himself so short he'd have to slither up into his chair. A
couple of times I remember him sliding in on his belly. That really
cracked us up - that and his goofy grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So tell me about Harvey,'' I said to my old friend across the
breakfast table, my voice getting lost in the din of Harriette's
regulars. ``Didn't he used to hang out around here?'' He nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey and I were on the football team,'' he begins. ``I'll
never forget the night he kicked the two extra points that beat
Jackson and kept our 28-year winning streak going. The whole team
felt indebted to him for that.'' I can't help smiling at the
memory. Harvey was everybody's hero that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``After high school, Harvey gave the University of Miami a shot,
didn't like it and dropped out. Then he got drafted. I ran into him
once at Camp Gordon. When he got out of the Army, he came home and
went to work for the City of Miami Fire Department. He married and
had some kids and then he had his accident.''
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Harvey was on the back of a fire engine
headed out on a call. As the truck was pulling into position, he
swung off the back ready to hook up to the hydrant - only there was
a telephone pole in the way. Harvey hit it dead on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a coma for six weeks and they didn't expect him to
live.'' But Harvey survived, eventually divorced, and then
disappeared into the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had always been Harvey's ambition to have a sailboat and
roam around the Bahamas. Said he wanted to be a beachcomber and
just go with the wind. When he dropped out of sight, we kind of
figured he'd gone chasing his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one night in 1975, my friend ran across Harvey in the old
Pilot House restaurant in Key Largo - a hangout for commercial
fishermen. Harvey was barefoot, wearing cut-offs and an undershirt,
and sporting a full beard. It was reunion time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept track of Harvey over the years, and I always knew where
to find him. He led a simple life. Had two big sailboats he was
always working on, caulking and getting them ready to go, but they
never were. He was always either in a boat or, if it was too hot,
in the back of an old milk truck he'd fitted out with bunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd set up kind of a kitchen on the docks, made it out of
driftwood. Built himself a table and a rack to hang the spoons and
frying pans on. Afternoons, he'd head over to the commercial
fishermen's docks and any of the fish they didn't want, including
backbones, cheeks, and heads, he'd take to his kitchen for soup or
stew. Vegetables he scrounged from the dumpster behind the
Winn-Dixie. Harvey wasn't into spending money for food. He
scavenged what he ate and he always fixed enough to feed the whole
boatyard. Everybody was welcome to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nights, Harvey filleted fish over at the Pilot House
for the ``$3 and all you can eat'' fish fry. Ten cents a filet he
got and before long, Harvey was a tourist attraction. 'They
screened in his little fish filleting table so folks could watch
him and the flies couldn't get to the fish. Harvey could skin and
filet a grouper and have it ready for the pan in ten seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   When the supper trade was over, Harvey would go in and make
himself a sandwich. He'd get a piece of whole wheat bread and
whatever fish was left over, put some tartar sauce on it, a piece
of cheese and some tomato, and toast it in the oven. Pretty soon,
the help was doing the same. Finally, the owner put it on the menu
and called it a 'Harvey's special.'
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is still there and so is the sandwich, but
Harvey's gone. He died a couple of years ago without ever having
floated a boat or combed a Bahamas beach - his only legacy, a
legend and a sandwich. Plenty for a simple man.

   RYAN-REAL _ AUSTIN _ In 30 years, war historian Stephen E.
Ambrose has interviewed thousands of veterans. He's heard it all,
chilling facts and shocking details, most of which have found their
way into his raft of books, including the current best-seller
``Citizen Soldiers.'' In a Dallas hotel room last weekend, the
62-year-old author, journalist and former professor sighs. ``I
think it's the best war film ever made. A hundred years from now
this will be the touchstone for World War II films.'' (Garcia,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   NEWSSTAND _ ATLANTA _ THE FACE OF WAR: So far, reviewers are
unanimous in applauding ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Entertainment
Weekly's ($2.95) Owen Gleiberman calls the movie ``a masterpiece''
and lauds Spielberg as ``our most spectacular poet of war.'' David
Ansen of Newsweek ($2.95) and Richard Schickel of Time ($2.95) join
Gleiberman in a chorus of praise for Tom Hanks and his band of

<P>
   DOWNS _ Used to be when Coach Andra assigned Frank Harman to a
relay team on the Boca Raton YMCA Swim Team, the other kids would
groan. Big, loud, rude groans. But not any more. Frank Harman, in
his honest, special way, has taught kids and parents alike that
there's more to swimming than a chromosome count. A story of a
down's syndrome kid who swims with non-disabled kids. (Minor, Palm
Beach Post) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

<P>
   WIDOWS _ Headed to Pennsylvania for a business trip on April 4,
Michael Fisher told his wife Nancy that he'd be back that night. He
never made it _ he and three colleagues were killed in a mid-air
collision. While most of this country's 11 million widows are more
than 60, Nancy Fisher is a young mom. Like NBC anchor Katie Couric,
she lost her husband while their children were still small.

   WIDOWERS _ At the weekly meetings of Young at Heart, a group of
widowed members of an Atlanta area church, it's easy to pick out
Eugene Moore. He's the only man. Moore, 89, is part of that
vanishing demographic, the widower. Outnumbered by widows almost
five to one nationally, widowers are even rarer at Moore's age.
(Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   TRAVEL-RIOSANJUAN _ A trip to Rio San Juan, Dominican Republic
with an Atlanta oldies radio station's ``World Tour.'' Several
times a year, the station takes listeners to some tourist

and the tours book up almost immediately. (MLongino, Atlanta

   PALSEY-CAMP _ PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ To the mothers and
fathers who have contributed $2,750 each to the six-week camp,
conductive education is a glorious discovery for children with
cerebral palsy. The United Cerebral Palsy Association in
Washington, D.C., isn't so enthusiastic. But the parents and
children _ five girls and three boys _ feel their own experience is
all the proof they need. (Hayes, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SENIOR-COMPUTERS _ Adults over 60 have quietly become the
fastest-growing segment of computer users, according to Ann Wrixon,
the executive director of SeniorNet, a San Francisco-based computer
service created nine years ago to help seniors become
computer-literate. Forget knitting _ about 8 million seniors are
wired and the number is doubling every three months. (Belkin, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TOON-MUSEUM _ More than two years after opening its doors to a
half-completed building, the cartoon museum in Boca Raton, Florida,
is still seeking a punch line. Museum officials are happy to be up
and running. But they concede that management changes, inadequate
money raising and make-shift galleries are keeping the museum from
reaching its potential as a must-see destination. (Schwan, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS _ AUSTIN _ Only a decade or two ago, the click click
click of high heels on hardwood or tile floors was the sound of
women at work. Still, in many work situations where dressy clothes
were required, high heels reigned. Now _ despite holdouts who don't
consider themselves dressed without an extra inch or two spiked
beneath their feet _ the high heel is losing ground as woman's work
wardrobe staple. (Bonnin, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN-BOOKS _ DALLAS, Texas _ Baby boomers looking for the
meaning of life, Generation Xers wanting to avoid the mistakes of
their parents, business professionals seeking new leadership and a
general population wondering about the millennium have one thing in
common.
</P>
<P>
   They are buying millions of Christian books. Book sales are
estimated by industry analysts to account for $1.2 billion _ and
rapidly rising _ of the Christian retail market. (Perkes, Austin

   TAICHI _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ East is meeting West Palm Beach
in Century Village these days. Tai chi _ ``the grand ultimate'' in
Mandarin _ is a Chinese martial arts technique at least 1,000 years
old. When practiced as an exercise, its slow movements and graceful

   DOG-DRUG _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A drug that failed in humans is the
key to relieving the aches and pains of doggie arthritis. Rimadyl

Animal Clinic in North Austin. (Martin, Austin American-Statesman)

Draluck was walking, an ordinary man out for an evening stroll.
He's fed up. So are many people in suburbs where residential
streets have become road courses. (Skube, Atlanta

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people just talk
about things. Then there's the people who do. The people who take
their dreams and run. The people like Sabrena and Calvin Darville,
who are opening a preschool in a low-income housing development
with $70,000 of their money. No lie. (Minor, Palm Beach Post)

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ KEY LARGO, Fla. _ Legends and grits seem an

   RYAN-REAL _ AUSTIN _ In 30 years, war historian Stephen E.
Ambrose has interviewed thousands of veterans. He's heard it all,
chilling facts and shocking details, most of which have found their
way into his raft of books, including the current best-seller
``Citizen Soldiers.'' In a Dallas hotel room last weekend, the
62-year-old author, journalist and former professor sighs. ``I
think it's the best war film ever made. A hundred years from now
this will be the touchstone for World War II films.'' (Garcia,

   NEWSSTAND _ ATLANTA _ THE FACE OF WAR: So far, reviewers are
unanimous in applauding ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Entertainment
Weekly's ($2.95) Owen Gleiberman calls the movie ``a masterpiece''
and lauds Spielberg as ``our most spectacular poet of war.'' David
Ansen of Newsweek ($2.95) and Richard Schickel of Time ($2.95) join
Gleiberman in a chorus of praise for Tom Hanks and his band of

   DOWNS _ Used to be when Coach Andra assigned Frank Harman to a
relay team on the Boca Raton YMCA Swim Team, the other kids would
groan. Big, loud, rude groans. But not any more. Frank Harman, in
his honest, special way, has taught kids and parents alike that
there's more to swimming than a chromosome count. A story of a

   WIDOWS _ Headed to Pennsylvania for a business trip on April 4,
Michael Fisher told his wife Nancy that he'd be back that night. He
never made it _ he and three colleagues were killed in a mid-air
collision. While most of this country's 11 million widows are more
than 60, Nancy Fisher is a young mom. Like NBC anchor Katie Couric,
she lost her husband while their children were still small.

   WIDOWERS _ At the weekly meetings of Young at Heart, a group of
widowed members of an Atlanta area church, it's easy to pick out
Eugene Moore. He's the only man. Moore, 89, is part of that
vanishing demographic, the widower. Outnumbered by widows almost
five to one nationally, widowers are even rarer at Moore's age.

   TRAVEL-RIOSANJUAN _ A trip to Rio San Juan, Dominican Republic
with an Atlanta oldies radio station's ``World Tour.'' Several

and the tours book up almost immediately. (MLongino, Atlanta

   PALSEY-CAMP _ PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ To the mothers and
fathers who have contributed $2,750 each to the six-week camp,
conductive education is a glorious discovery for children with
cerebral palsy. The United Cerebral Palsy Association in
Washington, D.C., isn't so enthusiastic. But the parents and

   SENIOR-COMPUTERS _ Adults over 60 have quietly become the
fastest-growing segment of computer users, according to Ann Wrixon,
the executive director of SeniorNet, a San Francisco-based computer
service created nine years ago to help seniors become
computer-literate. Forget knitting _ about 8 million seniors are
wired and the number is doubling every three months. (Belkin, Palm

</P>
<P>
   TOON-MUSEUM _ More than two years after opening its doors to a
half-completed building, the cartoon museum in Boca Raton, Florida,
is still seeking a punch line. Museum officials are happy to be up
and running. But they concede that management changes, inadequate
money raising and make-shift galleries are keeping the museum from
reaching its potential as a must-see destination. (Schwan, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS _ AUSTIN _ Only a decade or two ago, the click click
click of high heels on hardwood or tile floors was the sound of
women at work. Still, in many work situations where dressy clothes
were required, high heels reigned. Now _ despite holdouts who don't
consider themselves dressed without an extra inch or two spiked
beneath their feet _ the high heel is losing ground as woman's work
wardrobe staple. (Bonnin, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   CHRISTIAN-BOOKS _ DALLAS, Texas _ Baby boomers looking for the
meaning of life, Generation Xers wanting to avoid the mistakes of
their parents, business professionals seeking new leadership and a

   They are buying millions of Christian books. Book sales are

   TAICHI _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ East is meeting West Palm Beach

<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be a week for just about every health problem
that afflicts a significant number of Americans. But where is the
week for those ``poor, poor feet'' celebrated in song a generation
ago in ``The Pajama Game''? Let's face it, our feet take a beating,
bearing our full weight for a lifetime of walking and running,
often in shoes that squeeze, rub or deform them.
</P>
<P>
   With age, the shape and condition of our feet change, setting
the stage for a host of discomforting problems that can sometimes
make it difficult to walk.
</P>
<P>
   People tell me I don't look my age (57), but there's no lying to
my feet, which, according to estimates made by the American
Podiatric Medical Association, have endured well over 100,000
miles, probably 200,000 or more. By the age of 50, the association
figures, the average American has logged 75,000 foot miles, and my
activity level is hardly average.
</P>
<P>
   And do my feet know it! They have lengthened, growing a size and
a half since adolescence, and widened at the forefoot. They will no
longer tolerate being confined in classic women's dress shoes with
their narrow, pointed toe box.
</P>
<P>
   Three toenails have become weird-looking; I've developed
psoriasis on one big toe (after an injury) and tendinitis on the
top of one foot; I get recurring corns on the balls of both feet
and one little toe, and when I wear thin-soled shoes, I am
painfully aware of every imperfection on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   I have good reason to believe I am not alone. As the number of
people over 50 swells, so will the patient loads of foot
specialists and, I hope, the choice of shoe styles that are kind to
tender, tired feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Changes With Age
</P>
<P>
   Every body part suffers the slings and arrows of age, and feet
are no exception. A survey conducted in April among 1,000 adults by
Yankelovich Partners disclosed that nearly half of Americans at any
given time have some type of foot or ankle problem and that for one
in five, foot or ankle problems have forced them to alter their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   As with shoes, the soles of the feet gradually lose their
natural cushioning _ and therefore, their shock-absorbing ability _
because protective fat pads degenerate. Upon reaching the
75,000-mile mark, half the natural padding under the ball of the
foot may have been lost, and beyond 75,000 miles the deterioration
seems to accelerate, podiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   The scores of ligaments and tendons that hold together the 26
bones and 33 joints in each foot become stretched, resulting in
feet that are wider and longer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Deland, foot and ankle specialist at the Hospital
for Special Surgery in New York, reports that as people age, the
risk increases for developing an often unrecognized condition
called posterior tibial tendon insufficiency. If untreated in its
early stages, it can result in an inability to walk.
</P>
<P>
   You should expect your shoe size to change with age, probably to
a size larger at 50 than it was at 20. You may also need greater
width at the forefoot (but probably not at the heel), which may
necessitate buying more expensive shoes that are made with a
combination _ for example, a C width at the forefoot and a B at the
heel. Alternatively, fit the forefoot properly and use pads on
either side of the heel (but not a U-shaped insert) to keep the
shoe from slipping off the heel.
</P>
<P>
   Toe and joint deformities become increasingly common with age.
For example, the podiatric association reports that after the age
of 50, the incidence of problems like hammer toes, bunions,
arthritis in the foot and ankle, and toenail abnormalities
increases by at least 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Common Podiatric Problems
</P>
<P>
   The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society describes these
as often seen in older people.
</P>
<P>
   HAMMER TOES AND CLAW TOES: These deformities result from years
of wearing shoes with overly short and narrow toe boxes, the shoes
so many women force their feet to endure in the name of fashion.
One or more toes eventually curl under the stress, resulting in
bony protrusions that develop painful corns when they rub on shoes.
While the toes remain flexible, the discomfort can be eased by
using a toe pad (sold in pharmacies) and wearing shoes with roomier
toe boxes.
</P>
<P>
   BUNIONS: These are prominent bony bumps that develop on the side
and base of the big toe, again usually the result of years of
wearing narrow, pointed shoes and high heels. The toe itself turns
inward, and the pressure of the shoe on the bump can cause painful
swelling and inflammation. You can protect a bunion with a
doughnut-shaped moleskin pad. Wear roomy shoes of soft leather or
sandals that do not rub against the bunion. Sometimes custom-made
orthotics (shoe inserts) can help. Severe cases may require
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   CORNS AND CALLUSES: These result from pressure of shoes during
standing and walking. They most often occur on the ball of the foot
and the toes. Doughnut-shaped pads can relieve the pressure, and so
can wearing roomier shoes with padded innersoles. If a corn
develops between the toes, a piece of lamb's wool can keep the toes
from rubbing together. Soak your feet in warm water to soften corns
and calluses and then file them down with a pumice stone (never use
a razor). Experts are reluctant to recommend over-the-counter acids
for corn removal since they sometimes cause complications,
especially in people with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   INGROWN TOENAILS: These can happen at any age, usually because
the nails were trimmed too short or in a curve instead of straight
across. Shoes that compress the toes can compound the problem and
result in the nail growing painfully into the soft tissue of the
toe. Treat by soaking the foot in warm water twice a day and
keeping a small piece of cotton between the nail and flesh. If an
infection develops, a doctor may have to prescribe an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   FALLEN ARCHES: Those who were born with arches can lose them
with age as the ligaments that support the arch become too loose or
stretched to hold it up. If this results in fatigue or pain in the
feet, legs or lower back, custom-made orthotics that support the
arch may bring relief.
</P>
<P>
   MORTON'S NEUROMA: The nerve sheath between the base of two toes
can become irritated and swell, causing burning, cramping, numbness
or severe pain that may feel as if you just stepped on a nail. The
discomfort may force you to stop what you are doing, remove your
shoes and massage the area for relief. Surgery, only sometimes
necessary, is successful in at least 80 percent of cases, but the
neuroma may recur. Usually all that is needed to relieve the
irritation is to wear roomier shoes with low heels and place
protective pads under the involved area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Workout for Your Feet
</P>
<P>
   You can foster flexibility in your feet and ankles with a brief
series of daily exercises. While sitting on a chair, straighten
your knees to raise your feet. Circle each foot to the right 10
times, then to the left. Next, extend and flex your feet by
pointing the toes outward then toward your body. Repeat this
exercise 10 times. Finally, stand on the balls of your feet and
raise yourself as high as you can, holding the position for a
minute, and then drop back on your heels. Repeat this exercise 10
times.
</P>
<P>
   If You Have Diabetes
</P>
<P>
   People with diabetes need to be especially careful about foot
care because their disease can impair nerve sensations and
circulation to their feet and greatly increase the risk of injuries
and their ability to heal. Neglected foot problems can lead to
amputation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases has produced a helpful booklet ``Take Care of Your Feet
for a Lifetime'' (NIH publication number 98-4285), that includes
the following tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Check your feet daily for cuts, blisters, red spots and
swellings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash your feet daily in warm _ not hot _ water and dry them
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Apply a thin coating of skin lotion daily to the tops and
bottoms of your feet, but not between the toes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep toenails trimmed straight across and use a pumice stone
to smooth corns and calluses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always protect your feet by wearing socks and comfortable
shoes that ``breathe'' (avoid nylon socks and vinyl, plastic and
rubber shoes). Keep slippers at bedside.
</P>
<P>
   _ Protect your feet from temperature extremes. For example, wear
socks at night if your feet get cold, and avoid walking barefoot on
hot sand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foster circulation through regular exercise, keeping your feet
up while sitting, making circles with your feet and wiggling your
toes twice a day, and not sitting with legs crossed for prolonged
periods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call your doctor right away if any foot problem develops that
does not begin to heal within a day.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a free copy of the booklet, write to ``Take Care of
Your Feet for a Lifetime,'' 1 Diabetes Way, Bethesda MD 20892-3600
or call the message number, (800) 438-5383, and leave your name and

   INTERNET-COPS (San Antonio) _ From on-line wanted posters to
maps of crime spots, police forces around the country are exploring
new methods to reach the public using the World Wide Web.
``Traditionally, police departments have been very closed with
their information,'' said Clara Zainie of the San Antonio Police
Department. ``One of the tenets of community policing is to try to
share with the public as much information as possible.'' By JOHN
TEDESCO.

   SALMON (San Francisco) _ In the old days of San Francisco,
fishermen returning from the sea hawked fresh catches right from
the docks to people hurrying home to cook dinner. In a desperate
move to get a decent price for their prized California salmon,
local fishermen are returning to that tradition. By JANE KAY.

   EYE-SURGERY (Albany, N.Y.) _ Mary Weidman was scuba-diving off
the island of St. Lucia in January when she lost a contact lens.
The mishap kept her out of the water and convinced her that
contacts no longer fit her active lifestyle. Citing the scuba
incident as a turning point, she underwent corrective laser surgery

   TV-FANTASY-ISLAND (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Outdated is what you
would expect from a remake of ``Fantasy Island,'' ABC's hit from
1978-84. But before we were able to really bury it, something
bizarre happened: The pilot for the newer, darker ``Fantasy
Island'' turned out to be good. Really good. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-BRIAN-WILSON (Pasadena, Calif.) _ It was a poetic moment.
While the MTV Networks were presenting their goods to the nation's
TV critics, outside the packed room you could hear the faint,
lovely sounds of a piano. The pianist was Brian Wilson, the former
Beach Boy who along the way may have lost his band, two brothers
and some of the sweetness of his voice, but not his musical genius.
By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   TV-PAX-NET (Pasadena, Calif.) _ If you're going to launch the
nation's seventh major broadcast network _ in an era when

   BBN-RECORDS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Mark McGwire and Juan Gonzalez
could become legends, but they will never be Joe Bauman. Joe Bauman

</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y. ) _ Most states hold their primary
elections in the spring, before public attention to politics wanes
on languid, sunsplashed summer afternoons. Not in New York, though.
Here, in the home of the most exclusionary election code in
America, primary elections are held in September, when voters are
concerned mostly with their fading tans. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Our obsession with ``the
weather'' is getting out of hand. Because we have satellites,
balloons and state-of-the-art gauges for wind and rain, because we
can see systems and fronts coming at us from thousands of miles
away, you would think we invented weather. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

 By ANTHONY DEPALMA 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Toronto has never been a bigger attraction than it is right now:
In January, five surrounding suburbs were incorporated with the
central core, transforming Toronto overnight into the fifth most
populous city in North America, surpassed by only Mexico City, New
York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
 &HT;    The new mega-city government, led by Mayor Mel Lastman, who
boasts that he once sold a refrigerator to an Eskimo, is intent on
proving that (at least in this case) bigger is not only better but
busier, brighter and far more beguiling.
 &HT;    Toronto's charms as an international city that works are well
known. Through good planning and good luck, it is a city that
focuses far more of its energy on creating the future than on
correcting the mistakes of the past.
 &HT;    It is, some say, New York without attitude, and what it lacks in
presence it makes up for with activity, especially in summer.
 &HT;    When the beacon atop the Canada Life Assurance Building on
University Avenue is capped by the green light that signifies clear
and sunny weather (red means overcast; flashing white, snow),
Toronto heads outdoors.
 &HT;    The theater and entertainment district around the CN Tower and
the Skydome downtown stays thronged until late at night, and even
the disappointing waterfront on Lake Ontario _ cut off by an
elevated highway _ has something happening almost every day
throughout the summer.
 &HT;    The 1,815-foot CN Tower (equivalent to 187 stories) provides a
modern, unifying image for the city. But it is the many robust
neighborhoods, each with its own ethnic flavor or historical
ambiance, that really show off what Toronto stands for. It has at
least three Chinatowns, two Little Italys and a Greek neighborhood
that stretches for miles.
 &HT;    On a quick stroll, visitors can find window displays of fresh
cannoli, smoked whole squid or boxes of exquisite Cuban cigars. But
find one of Toronto's cigar bars and smoke the stogies there.
Taking them across the border is prohibited.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Two special exhibitions highlight this summer in T.O., which is
what some residents call Toronto. The first is the only North
American showing of the Courtauld Collection of Impressionist and
postimpressionist paintings from the Courtauld Institute in London.
 &HT;    Manet's ``Bar at the Folies-Bergere'' and other famous works
will be on display until Sept. 20 at the Art Gallery of Ontario,
317 Dundas Street West, at the edge of Chinatown.
 &HT;    Exhibit schedule: Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. General
museum hours: Tuesday to Friday, noon to 9 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Exhibit admission: $14 weekdays, $17.50
nights and weekends but subject to change. (Prices calculated at 71
cents to the Canadian dollar.) Telephone: (416) 979-6675. For
exhibit tickets: (800) 461-3333.
 &HT;    The other special stop this summer is the Royal Ontario Museum,
100 Queen's Park, (416) 586-8000, where 250 objects from the
Victoria and Albert Museum in London _ including a huge plaster fig
leaf designed to shield Queen Victoria's eyes from the offending
parts of Michelangelo's ``David'' _ will be on display.
 &HT;    ``A Grand Design: The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum'' is
on view until Sept. 13. Hours: Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 6
p.m., Tuesday until 8 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission:
$10.65. Advance tickets are through Ticketmaster, (416) 870-8000.
 &HT;    At the Lake Ontario waterfront, around Queen's Quay, the annual
Harbourfront Centre Summer Fete offers concerts, dance performances
and films every weekend throughout July and August. Most concerts
are free. Information: (416) 973-3000.
 &HT;    Also back this year is the eight-hour explosion of color and
sound that is the Caribana Caribbean parade, scheduled for Aug. 1.
The parade will leave from Exhibition Stadium at around 10 a.m. and
move up Lakeshore Boulevard, which will be lined with food stands
and vendors' booths. Information: (416) 465-4884.
 &HT;    Toronto is big on films. From Sept. 10 to 19, some 300 films
from over 50 countries will be shown at the Toronto International
Film Festival, most for the first time in North America.
Information: (416) 968-3456.
 &HT;    And if you haven't had enough of ``Titanic,'' the film will be
shown in wide-screen format at the Cine sphere theater at Ontario
Place, 955 Lakeshore Boulevard West, (416) 314-9900, nightly at
8:30 through the summer. Admission: $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    It is tempting to think that Toronto is all future and no past.
But a visit to the difficult-to-reach Historic Fort York, Garrison
Road off Fleet Street west of downtown, (416) 392-6907, allows a
look at the city's history.
 &HT;    The fort dates from 1793 and is now surrounded by a maze of
railroad tracks and superhighways. Guided tours are available in
summer, and fabulous photo opportunities to combine the oldest
buildings in Toronto with the futuristic CN Tower.
 &HT;    A beer festival is scheduled for Aug. 7 to 9. Regular admission:
$3.55. Open year round, with the longest hours in summer, from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    Another reminder of the past is the house of William Lyon
Mackenzie, Toronto's first mayor. The small brick town house at 82
Bond Street, a block east of Eaton Center (the huge downtown mall),
was his home from 1859 till his death in 1861. He became mayor in
1834, when the city had only 9,252 inhabitants, and later led an
ill-fated rebellion against the Crown. Open noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday
through Sunday. Admission: $2.50. Information: (416) 392-6915.
 &HT;    This year, Olde Town Toronto Tours, (416) 798-2424, is running
double-decker buses throughout the city. A two-hour tour costs
$17.75, including an all-day pass allowing visitors to get on and
off where they wish. Buses leave every half-hour from near the
Citibank Building, Front and York Streets.
 &HT;    After one has experienced both past and future, the O2 Spa Bar
at 2044 Yonge St., (416) 322-7733, offers an unusual respite. It is
one of North America's first oxygen bars, a place to sip fresh
fruit juices while inhaling plain or scented oxygen. Twenty
minutes' worth of 99.9 percent pure oxygen at the bar is $11.35.
Open from Tuesday to Friday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 10 to 9
p.m., Sunday and Monday noon to 6.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Families are welcome at the Delta Chelsea Inn, 33 Gerrard St.
West, (416) 595-1975, fax (416) 585-4302. Children under 18 stay
free in their parents' room, and those under 6 eat free. There is a
supervised playroom.
 &HT;    For $3.55 per child for two and a half hours, parents get time
alone. For peace of mind, they also receive a pager. Rooms have
been recently renovated in cheery pastels and florals. Doubles,
from $132.
 &HT;    If you want to be on the waterfront, the 968-room Westin Harbour
Castle, One Harbour Square, (416) 869-1600, fax (416) 361-7448, is
a moderately priced choice, especially with a summer package.
There's an indoor pool, outdoor deck and a revolving restaurant on
the 35th floor. Rates: doubles from $141, but the Westin Good-Buy
Getaway rate brings that down to $113 until the end of September.
 &HT;    Budget: Best Western Primrose Hotel, 111 Carlton St., (416)
977-8000, fax (416) 977-6323. Slightly away from downtown, the
337-room hotel is still just down the street from the Canadian
hockey palace, Maple Leaf Gardens. The comfortable rooms have king,
queen or two double beds. Double rooms from $106.
 &HT;    Luxury: For convenience and luxury, few hotels beat the Four
Seasons, 21 Avenue Road, (416) 964-0411, fax (416) 964-2301, in the
ritzy Yorkville neighborhood. The 380-room hotel underwent a $5.6
million refurbishment this spring. Soothing cream tones and
tasteful upholstery make the rooms decadently comfortable. Doubles:
from $192.
 &HT;    The Sutton Place Hotel, 955 Bay St., (416) 924-9221, fax (416)
924-1778, is one of Toronto's most luxurious European-style hotels.
Its 292 rooms and suites are among the most spacious in the city.
The furnishings are lush and the rooms bright and airy, especially
those overlooking Yonge Street. Double rooms start at about $135.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The area around College and Clinton Streets in West Toronto's
Little Italy was recently selected as one of the hippest places in
North America by the Utne Reader magazine. One of the oldest
restaurants in the neighborhood is the Cafe Diplomatico, 594
College St., (416) 534-4637.
 &HT;    This place is the essence of Toronto neighborliness: a sidewalk
patio lined with petunias, a jukebox and plenty of opportunity for
people watching.
 &HT;    The menu at ``the Dip'' retains the hearty fare on which it was
founded. Specials are the ubiquitous vodka rose sauce with choice
of pasta, and extra large panzarotti _ a baked pizza dough with
choice of stuffing. Dinner for two with a bottle of Chianti is $46.
The cafe is open daily from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (until 3 on Friday and
Saturday).
 &HT;    There are many good restaurants in Chinatown on Spadina Avenue,
but make every effort to get into the Lee Garden, 331 Spadina
Avenue, (416) 593-9524, even if it means sharing a table with
strangers (they may not be strangers after you wait on line with
them for 20 minutes).
 &HT;    Plastic table coverings do not detract from the exquisitely
prepared food: quail rolled in lettuce, deep fried and sweetly
delicate soft-shelled crabs. A meal for two with beer and tea is
about $45. Dinner daily.
 &HT;    Long considered one of Toronto's best restaurants, Scaramouche,
Benvenuto Place, (416) 961-8011, remains a place to go for a
special night. Its location on a small rise gives it a striking
view of North America's newest big city.
 &HT;    As meticulous with the menu as it is with reservations, Keith
Froggett's restaurant delights in surprise. Arctic char poached in
aromatic water, served with Ontario asparagus and fingerling
potatoes, is $20. Dinner for two, with wine from the extensive
list: $125. Dinner only, Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    Rodney's Oyster House, 209 Adelaide St. East, (416) 363-8105, is
less formal. It is easy to miss the entrance, but there is nothing
subtle about Rodney's itself, where many other restaurants come to
buy their seafood.
 &HT;    The long bar is piled with more than a dozen types of oysters,
purchased by the piece and taken raw. A quieter back room retains
the free spirit of the place. Steamed clams and bowls of
periwinkles are also available. Price: about $75 for two, with
drinks. Open 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    For a taste of hearty Canadian fare, try the Acadian Room at the
Royal York Hotel, 100 Front St. West, (416) 860-6949. Seafood
chowder, Quebec duck with lavender wild honey, and delicious
Canadian salmon are served in the kind of dark-wood, country-lodge
setting that goes with the nation's image. Dinner for two, with an
Ontario wine, about $100. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily (no
lunch Saturday).
 &HT;    For a bite on the run, try an enormous grilled hot dog from one
of more than 1,000 street vendors in Toronto. On a hearty yellow
bun, they usually take two hands to handle. Lunch for two, with
soda (called pop in T.O.), about $4.

Royal York Hotel, 100 Front St. West, (416) 860-6949. Seafood
chowder, Quebec duck with lavender wild honey, and delicious
Canadian salmon are served in the kind of dark-wood, country-lodge
setting that goes with the nation's image. Dinner for two, with an
Ontario wine, about $100. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily (no
lunch Saturday).
 &HT;    For a bite on the run, try an enormous grilled hot dog from one
of more than 1,000 street vendors in Toronto. On a hearty yellow
bun, they usually take two hands to handle. Lunch for two, with
soda (called pop in T.O.), about $4.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This is high season for family travel, a time for amusement
parks, beaches, campgrounds _ and stress. That's right, stress.
 &HT;    ``Family travel can be very stressful if you don't do the right
things,'' says Christine Loomis, author of the new handbook
``Simplify Family Travel'' (Reader's Digest, 1998; $17.95).
 &HT;    However, Loomis adds that family travel can also be unstressful
_ if one plans properly. ``The problem is that when you have
unrealistic expectations, you're set up for failure,'' she says.
 &HT;    Loomis, the travel editor of Family Life magazine, has written a
book that is less about where to go with your family than how to
plan the trip. Part of Reader's Digest Simpler Life series, the
slim hardcover book is spiral-bound, perfectly made to slip under
the front seat of the family minivan.
 &HT;    Loomis discusses choosing a place, planning the trip, packing
the right way and getting there. She has chapters on health and
safety, on lodging and dining, and an entire chapter devoted to
play.
 &HT;    She even has a chapter devoted to lists and child-proofing a
hotel room. The hour-by-hour sample itinerary for visiting a theme
park for a week is a must-read for families with small children.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to show how you have to build in free time to any
schedule that you have,'' Loomis explains. ``One problem some
parents have is that they want their kids to see and do a lot. But
you wind up as stressed as when you left. Kids cannot go all day,
every day. They're slower.''
 &HT;    Loomis is quick to add that this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
 &HT;    ``It's good for kids to be slower,'' Loomis says. ``It slows us
down too and that's one of the great things about traveling with
kids. It gives the whole family time to hang out. We're all
overscheduled and what kids really want is time with their parents.
You don't have to spend any money to give them that.''
 &HT;    Loomis, who has a 7-year-old son and two daughters, ages 10 and
16, has a wealth of practical advice. If the family has been
driving all morning, she says, don't stop at a restaurant. Instead
choose a picnic area or someplace with open seating that allows the
kids to move.
 &HT;    To keep kids involved, give each child a disposable camera to
photograph their trip and have the film developed at one-hour labs
along the way.
 &HT;    And pack carry-ons with at least one outfit per person in case
the checked luggage gets lost en route.
 &HT;    ``My family did major RV trips the last two summers and spent
weeks on the road,'' Loomis recalls. ``We took turns picking what
we'd do when we stopped. The rule was that you couldn't bribe the
other person. So my son picked Oscar's Dreamland in Billings,
Mont., which turned out to be 15 acres of old farm equipment. We
had the best afternoon because we laughed so much. We ended up with
great memories.''
 &HT;    Loomis says the best family vacations revolve around things that
everyone might enjoy.
 &HT;    ``Some people like five-star resorts,'' she says, ``while others
like a cabin in the woods and some need to be by the water. You
need to choose vacations that meet everybody's needs to some
degree. The best vacations are those where you've given the kids
some input into what you're doing.''
 &HT;    But there are vacations that aren't well-suited to some
families.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people think that the beach is great with a baby,''
Loomis says. ``It's probably the worst choice. Babies need to eat
and sleep and that means one parent is going back and forth to the
room. And babies shouldn't be exposed to that much sun.''
 &HT;    For young children, Loomis suggests camping vacations.
 &HT;    ``I'm from Colorado where there are lots of serious campers,''
she notes. ``But with kids, you have to scale back. Car camping
becomes a viable way to experience the wilderness. It's different,
but it's no less rewarding. And RVs are a great way to travel.
You've got a refrigerator, which is great if you need to keep
formula. It's a safe environment that stays the same, which is good
for babies, toddlers and preschoolers who like routines. And it
solves the 'I'm-really-uncomfortable-in-the-backseat' blues.''
 &HT;    And what was the best vacation that Loomis and her family have
taken?
 &HT;    ``An RV trip,'' she says. ``We've seen more of America that way.
Two summers ago, we covered 23 states and one province. Last
summer, we did five or six national parks. The great thing about an
RV is that when you see a sign and it sounds interesting, you can
just go.
 &HT;    ``One of my daughters loves history, so we saw Truman's house
and Lincoln's house. My older daughter is into adventure, so went
rafting. And my son loves everything.''
 &HT;    Loomis' most valuable advice: Go with the flow.
 &HT;    ``It's never going to be perfect,'' she says. ``What your family
is at home is what they are on vacation. Humor and flexibility are
crucial.''

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Summer's here _ a time when a running car engine can sound like
a siren's call for many mature travelers looking to take a
vacation.
 &HT;    Here are some ideas to tease your wanderlust into action:
 OREGON TRAIL  
 &HT;    A number of ``interpretive centers'' along part of the Oregon
Trail _ from the town of Ontario, Ore., near the Idaho border to
Oregon City near Portland _ help to make this trek through American
history more interesting than ever.
 &HT;    The fifth and newest center, the Tamastslikt Cultural Institute
(pronounced tuh-must-slikt), (541) 966-9748, five miles east of
Pendleton, Ore., presents the adventures that created the Oregon
frontier.
 &HT;    To help make the 350-mile drive along the trail more meaningful,
ask for a brochure called ``A Guide to the Oregon Trail'' as well
as a brochure/map titled ``Then &AMP; Now,'' which details the path's
many attractions.
 &HT;    Tamastslikt, which means ``interpreter'' in the Walla Walla
language, is the only center along the Oregon Trail designed by,
and dedicated to, Native Americans. It describes three tribes
before and after settlement by emigrants. The complex includes the
Wildhorse Gaming Resort, a 100-unit hotel, 18-hole golf course and
100-space RV park.
 &HT;    Each of the interpretive centers has a unique focus:
 &HT;    Starting east in Ontario, Ore., is the Four Rivers Cultural
Center, (888) 211-1222, which uses interactive exhibits to show the
melding of cultures. Watch for the internment camps that held
Japanese-Americans released from World War II as well as the
influence of the Northern Paiute people and Mexican vaqueros.
 &HT;    Five miles east of Baker, Ore., is the National Historic Oregon
Trail Interpretive Center, (800) 523-1235, at Flagstaff Hill _
where pioneers caught their first glimpse of the promised land.
Here, visitors experience hands-on history, including the chance to
walk in the wagon ruts made by the emigrants more than a century
earlier.
 &HT;    Then comes Tamastslikt followed by the Columbia Gorge Discovery
Center, (541) 296-8600, at The Dalles. As the official interpretive
center for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, the
Columbia unit dishes up details about fiery volcanoes, massive
landslides and raging floods.
 &HT;    The final stop is the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive
Center, (503) 657-9336, at Oregon City _ also the last destination
for thousands of pioneers. Here, one can find three 50-foot-high
covered-wagon-shaped buildings, an amphitheater and the Heritage
Gardens. On summer evenings, the Oregon Trail Pageant is performed.
Senior discounts are offered at all the centers.
 RENO'S ART  
 &HT;    The Uptown Downtown ARTown Festival in Reno, Nev., brings more
than 200 events to this city during the month of July.
 &HT;    Many events are free _ like the Roads, Rails &AMP; Runways
transportation exhibit at the National Auto Museum on the Truckee
River. You'll see the Virginia &AMP; Truckee Railroad, Reno's trolley
system, early Nevada airfields and the Lincoln Highway showcased in
a unique auto museum.
 &HT;    During regular exhibits, admission for seniors is $6.50 compared
to the regular $7.50 price.
 &HT;    Also look in on The Great Basin Chautauqua under the tent at
Rancho San Rafael Park, where actors portray such historic figures
as Galileo, Mohandas Gandhi and Isaac Newton and describe the
progress man has made over the last 10 centuries.
 &HT;    The historic districts of Reno can be explored through walking
tours, and unique cultural events like ballet performances and jazz
recitals will take place in a developing river-front setting. For
information on Reno, call (800) 367-7366. The ARTown hotline is
(702) 334-2536, or visit www.artown.org on the Web.
 DRIVE NEWFOUNDLAND  
 &HT;    Maxxim Vacations, a Canadian travel company specializing in the
Atlantic provinces, is offering an 11-day cross-island
bed-and-breakfast tour of Newfoundland that costs about $100 per
day _ including airfare and a car.
 &HT;    The trip starts in St. Johns, where tourgoers take a
double-decker bus tour, and includes a two-night stay in
picture-perfect Trinity. The tour then heads toward Gros Morne
National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Park, and travels along the
Viking trail to Lanse aux Meadows. There are overnights at
bed-and-breakfasts and country inns.
 &HT;    The prices for the Newfoundland Hospitality Tours _ including
airfare _ are $1,159 from Boston, $1,389 from Chicago and $1,439
from Los Angeles. For more information, call (800) 567-6666.
 BOGEY &AMP; BACALL IN OHIO  
 &HT;    Mansfield, Ohio, which is midway between Cleveland and Columbus,
has put together a trio of packaged getaways designed to showcase
Richland County. And best of all, each carries a 10 percent
discount for travelers ages 55 and older.
 &HT;    Mansfield boasts Ohio's only Rails-to-Trails path and was the
site of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's nuptials.
 &HT;    The ``American Nostalgia'' package, for example, includes a ride
on the Richland Carrousel, a tour of the historic Malabar Farm
House and dinner at selected restaurants. The price: $67.49 for
seniors, compared to the regular starting price of $74.99 per
night.
 &HT;    The ``Back to Nature'' package starts at $89.99 _ $81 for mature
travelers _ and includes a bike or skate rental.
 &HT;    ``Holiday Magic,'' which will take place between Nov. 27 and
Dec. 31, starts at $89.99 _ $81 for seniors _ and includes
admission to the Winter Wonderland Holiday Lights Festival.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 642-8282 or visit
www.mansfieldtourism.org on the Web.
 SENIORAMA  
 &HT;    The 43rd annual production of ``Seniorama, Life Upon the Wicked
Stage'' will be presented up to five times daily from Sept. 23 to
Sept. 26 in the Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz, Calif. Tickets for
the musical, which is produced by Senior Citizens' Opportunities,
are $12 a person.
 &HT;    The show can be combined with either a brunch or dinner and a
steam train ride through the Redwoods.
 &HT;    The senior rate for the train ride is $15; for either meal, add
$13.99. The total cost: $28.99.
 &HT;    For more information on Seniorama, call (408) 423-6640; for the
steam train ride, (408) 335-4484.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Summer's here _ a time when a running car engine can sound like
a siren's call for many mature travelers looking to take a
vacation.
 &HT;    Here are some ideas to tease your wanderlust into action:
 OREGON TRAIL  
 &HT;    A number of ``interpretive centers'' along part of the Oregon
Trail _ from the town of Ontario, Ore., near the Idaho border to
Oregon City near Portland _ help to make this trek through American
history more interesting than ever.
 &HT;    The fifth and newest center, the Tamastslikt Cultural Institute
(pronounced tuh-must-slikt), (541) 966-9748, five miles east of
Pendleton, Ore., presents the adventures that created the Oregon
frontier.
 &HT;    To help make the 350-mile drive along the trail more meaningful,
ask for a brochure called ``A Guide to the Oregon Trail'' as well
as a brochure/map titled ``Then &AMP; Now,'' which details the path's
many attractions.
 &HT;    Tamastslikt, which means ``interpreter'' in the Walla Walla
language, is the only center along the Oregon Trail designed by,
and dedicated to, Native Americans. It describes three tribes
before and after settlement by emigrants. The complex includes the
Wildhorse Gaming Resort, a 100-unit hotel, 18-hole golf course and
100-space RV park.
 &HT;    Each of the interpretive centers has a unique focus:
 &HT;    Starting east in Ontario, Ore., is the Four Rivers Cultural
Center, (888) 211-1222, which uses interactive exhibits to show the
melding of cultures. Watch for the internment camps that held
Japanese-Americans released from World War II as well as the
influence of the Northern Paiute people and Mexican vaqueros.
 &HT;    Five miles east of Baker, Ore., is the National Historic Oregon
Trail Interpretive Center, (800) 523-1235, at Flagstaff Hill _
where pioneers caught their first glimpse of the promised land.
Here, visitors experience hands-on history, including the chance to
walk in the wagon ruts made by the emigrants more than a century
earlier.
 &HT;    Then comes Tamastslikt followed by the Columbia Gorge Discovery
Center, (541) 296-8600, at The Dalles. As the official interpretive
center for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, the
Columbia unit dishes up details about fiery volcanoes, massive
landslides and raging floods.
 &HT;    The final stop is the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive
Center, (503) 657-9336, at Oregon City _ also the last destination
for thousands of pioneers. Here, one can find three 50-foot-high
covered-wagon-shaped buildings, an amphitheater and the Heritage
Gardens. On summer evenings, the Oregon Trail Pageant is performed.
Senior discounts are offered at all the centers.
 RENO'S ART  
 &HT;    The Uptown Downtown ARTown Festival in Reno, Nev., brings more
than 200 events to this city during the month of July.
 &HT;    Many events are free _ like the Roads, Rails &AMP; Runways
transportation exhibit at the National Auto Museum on the Truckee
River. You'll see the Virginia &AMP; Truckee Railroad, Reno's trolley
system, early Nevada airfields and the Lincoln Highway showcased in
a unique auto museum.
 &HT;    During regular exhibits, admission for seniors is $6.50 compared
to the regular $7.50 price.
 &HT;    Also look in on The Great Basin Chautauqua under the tent at
Rancho San Rafael Park, where actors portray such historic figures
as Galileo, Mohandas Gandhi and Isaac Newton and describe the
progress man has made over the last 10 centuries.
 &HT;    The historic districts of Reno can be explored through walking
tours, and unique cultural events like ballet performances and jazz
recitals will take place in a developing river-front setting. For
information on Reno, call (800) 367-7366. The ARTown hotline is
(702) 334-2536, or visit www.artown.org on the Web.
 DRIVE NEWFOUNDLAND  
 &HT;    Maxxim Vacations, a Canadian travel company specializing in the
Atlantic provinces, is offering an 11-day cross-island
bed-and-breakfast tour of Newfoundland that costs about $100 per
day _ including airfare and a car.
 &HT;    The trip starts in St. Johns, where tourgoers take a
double-decker bus tour, and includes a two-night stay in
picture-perfect Trinity. The tour then heads toward Gros Morne
National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Park, and travels along the
Viking trail to Lanse aux Meadows. There are overnights at
bed-and-breakfasts and country inns.
 &HT;    The prices for the Newfoundland Hospitality Tours _ including
airfare _ are $1,159 from Boston, $1,389 from Chicago and $1,439
from Los Angeles. For more information, call (800) 567-6666.
 BOGEY &AMP; BACALL IN OHIO  
 &HT;    Mansfield, Ohio, which is midway between Cleveland and Columbus,
has put together a trio of packaged getaways designed to showcase
Richland County. And best of all, each carries a 10 percent
discount for travelers ages 55 and older.
 &HT;    Mansfield boasts Ohio's only Rails-to-Trails path and was the
site of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's nuptials.
 &HT;    The ``American Nostalgia'' package, for example, includes a ride
on the Richland Carrousel, a tour of the historic Malabar Farm
House and dinner at selected restaurants. The price: $67.49 for
seniors, compared to the regular starting price of $74.99 per
night.
 &HT;    The ``Back to Nature'' package starts at $89.99 _ $81 for mature
travelers _ and includes a bike or skate rental.
 &HT;    ``Holiday Magic,'' which will take place between Nov. 27 and
Dec. 31, starts at $89.99 _ $81 for seniors _ and includes
admission to the Winter Wonderland Holiday Lights Festival.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 642-8282 or visit
www.mansfieldtourism.org on the Web.
 SENIORAMA  
 &HT;    The 43rd annual production of ``Seniorama, Life Upon the Wicked
Stage'' will be presented up to five times daily from Sept. 23 to
Sept. 26 in the Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz, Calif. Tickets for
the musical, which is produced by Senior Citizens' Opportunities,

 &HT;    Commentary: Smile, it's family portrait time
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When my folks had their 50th anniversary, all they
wanted from their three children as a gift was a family portrait.
That sounds like a simple request.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't.
</P>
<P>
   First, we all had to be in the same place _ Missouri _ at the
same time. This meant my brother flew in from California and we
drove 700 miles from Texas. My sister and her family are the only
ones who live fairly close to the home place.
</P>
<P>
   Since we planned to all be there anyway to host the party, the
travel was not as difficult as it first seemed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, travel was a snap compared to color-coordinating the
clothes we'd wear in the portrait. This, of course, had to be
determined before we left home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What colors are we going with?'' I e-mailed my brother and
sister in the weeks preceding the trip.
</P>
<P>
   No response.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be captured for posterity, we really ought
to give some thought to how we're going to look,'' I e-mailed
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wear whatever you want,'' was my brother's response.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. He doesn't have children. He doesn't know the results such
advice can bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue,'' my sister wrote back.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I can work with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripes, solids or plaids?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mix it up,'' was the response. This obviously was a topic of
little interest to my siblings. Actually, it was a topic of little
interest to anyone except me. All right, so I'm just a wee bit
obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to just focus on the five of us. At least we'd wear
something that looked good together. We had a family meeting two
nights before we left for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to your closets and bring me your blues,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Out came an odd assortment of bright blues, teal blues, aqua
blues, navy blues and denim blues ... and my husband with an old
B.B. King cassette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many blues. Bring me variety so we can pick and choose,''
I said.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Nikes, Adidas, Umbros, soccer shirts, wind shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. Variety in color, not style. Keep it dressy,'' I told
them.
</P>
<P>
   On and on we went until finally all five of us had something
that more or less went together and looked halfway decent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about shoes?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will see our feet,'' one of the boys said. ``The shots
will just be from the waist up.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that true? I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we'll worry about shoes later,'' I said. It was a bad
decision, I discovered, when we were hundreds of miles from every
shoe we owned.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the photo shoot was a frenzy of ironing,
showering and grooming. Looking good comes easy for some folks; not
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put that shirt on until after you eat breakfast!'' I
ordered. My husband didn't appreciate the advice. Better not to
have spilled milk than to cry over it, I always say.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone got dressed, I hurried to do the same. Donning my
outfit, I went for my shoes and realized I didn't have anything but
my old, scruffy sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will see your feet,'' everyone comforted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrow something from Mom,'' my sister advised solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   I did.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffing toilet paper in the toes, I stumbled off to the studio
with the clan.
</P>
<P>
   The first pose of the day? The three women front and center, on
stools, feet prominently displayed.
</P>
<P>
   I did the only thing I could. I wrapped my ill-shod feet behind
the stool legs as inconspicuously as possible and hoped I wasn't
leaving a TP trail.
</P>
<P>
   Smile!

`FANTASY ISLAND' IS BACK, AND NOT SO BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Mr. Roarke is still there. So is the
seaplane. The matching suits are still in the closet, but they
won't be for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the white ones burned,'' Roarke tells an aide. ``I think
they are a little dated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little dated'' is what you would expect from a remake of
``Fantasy Island,'' ABC's hit from 1978 to 1984. We should have
seen this coming after the UPN resurrection of the show's former
Saturday night partner, ``The Love Boat'' earlier this year.
``Fantasy Island'' should have been an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   But before we were able to really bury it, something bizarre
happened: The pilot for the newer, darker ``Fantasy Island'' turned
out to be good. Really good.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment who has taken
her share of hits over programming in her two years at the helm,
knew the abuse would have been merciless if the network merely
resuscitated a hackneyed chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be good to put it on the schedule,'' Tarses said.
</P>
<P>
   It is, both on ABC's fall schedule (Saturday, 9 p.m. Eastern),
and good. Gone is the paternal benevolence of Ricardo Montalban.
Today's Mr. Roarke is Malcolm McDowell, whose warmest smiles can
still give you the willies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play characters who have an edge,'' he says, an
understatement from the 55-year-old who is most vividly remembered
as Alex, the sadistic gang leader in the cult classic ``A Clockwork
Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge? Try creepy. Montalban's pure white suits have been ditched
in favor of gray Armani. So is the pureness of Mr. Roarke. With a
snap of his fingers Roarke can replace storm clouds with blue
skies. Fantasies can go horribly wrong, psychologically and
physically. And it appears he can bring back the dead.
</P>
<P>
   So is he good? Is he evil? Is he God or the devil himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is somewhere in between,'' McDowell said. ``He is
an unpredictable character who has a mystery. I can create any
layers I want.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences from the original. For one, the old
Mr. Roarke never called a guest impaled on a stalactite ``a
wussie.'' But then again, McDowell doesn't care about the old show
or its reputation as being just slightly more hip than ``Lawrence
Welk.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's never even seen it, and doesn't plan to see the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No curiosity at all,'' the English actor said. ``I just don't
want to spend the time looking at something that is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   People book trips to ``Fantasy Island'' through a New York City
travel agent, played by veteran Fyvush Finkel (there were three
guest storylines in the pilot, although the number will be cut to
two to keep focus on the island staff). Tattoo is a memory,
replaced by three aides played by Edward Hibbert (``Frasier''),
Louis Lombardi (``Ed Wood,'' ``NYPD Blue'') and Madchen Aimick
(``Twin Peaks'' and the short-lived ``CPW''). The show is shot on
the Hawaiian island of Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   The characters Harry (Hibbert) and Cal (Lombardi) make it clear
that working for Roarke, an acerbic boss, is a payback and that
they are serving some sort of a sentence. The unnamed debt seems
more spiritual or karmic than monetary. So is purgatory back in the
form of a tropical island?
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said it's more than purgatory. ``Oh yeah; it's a
prison,'' he said. But Roarke is more than a warden. He is an
inmate, too, sentenced by the unknown, unseen boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Roarke was obsessed with time, because he has
bags of it because he is there for infinity,'' McDowell said. ``He
is obsessed with clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual is ``in'' on television, from ``Touched by an Angel''
to ``7th Heaven.'' So what is the, gulp, message of ``Fantasy
Island?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be preachy,'' McDowell said. ``We are not
going to intellectualize `Fantasy Island.' No, no we are not. But
we may watch it.
</P>

IN CALIFORNIA, SALAD DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Rushing to the defense of restaurateurs,
California Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a measure
legalizing the use of raw eggs in Caesar salad.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly seven months, California restaurants were required by
state regulation to omit raw eggs from their Caesar salad dressing,
unless it was made at the customer's table.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation written by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, exempts the raw egg from safety regulations for
under-cooked foods. It's a pro-choice salad law, Migden said,
requiring only that customers be informed their salad contains raw
egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caesar salads legal again!'' Midgen declared Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This half-baked law is now finally cooked,'' Migden said of
the old regulations. ``I am pleased that this bill whips up a
recipe combining good policy and good food as ingredients. It
considers the needs of those who cannot eat raw eggs for health
reasons ... while preserving choice in restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a Republican, signed Migden's measure into law on
Saturday. The law took effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea because without the egg, it's not a Caesar
salad,'' said John Konstin, the owner-manager of 90-year-old John's
Grill on Ellis Street in San Francisco. ``We just do it the
traditional, classic way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lauren Beth Rudolph Food Safety Act, which went into effect
Jan. 1, requires restaurants to cook foods to internal temperatures
intended to kill E. coli, salmonella and other harmful bacteria and
germs. It was named for a 6-year-old girl who died after eating a
fast-food hamburger tainted with E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions are when customers specifically request that
their food be cooked rare or when the dish traditionally involves
raw food. In both cases, diners are expected to know the risk
they're taking.
</P>
<P>
   With Caesar salad, regulators said raw egg could be used only if
the dressing is prepared at the customer's table. If it was made in
the kitchen, it could not contain raw egg. Instead, many chefs
started using pasteurized eggs, eggs that have been heated quickly
to kill bacteria without losing their liquid texture.
</P>
<P>
   The dressing for Caesar salad is made of raw eggs, olive oil,
garlic and lemon juice.

AS PRODUCTION OUTSTRIPS DEMAND, OIL PRICES KEEP FALLING

 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AHMADI, Kuwait _ The last time oil prices were lower than now,
Grand Funk Railroad was on top of the music charts, bell bottoms
were in, and Watergate was engulfing Richard Nixon's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The reason prices are at 1973 levels, industry specialists say,
can be summed up in one word: overproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Persian Gulf, which holds more than 40 percent of
the world's known oil reserves, companies have been overproducing
crude for months, pushing prices lower and lower.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the price for benchmark Arab light crude dipped
to under $11 a barrel. That represents a more than 40 percent drop
in six months and a dramatically more precipitous drop when
compared with the high of $41 a barrel just before the 1991 Gulf
War. With prices adjusted for inflation, experts say, the price of
crude is lower than any &UR;  &LR; time since the summer of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting price of crude has been followed by tumbling
gasoline prices. At most US self-service pumps this week regular
unleaded gasoline was about $1 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to the good old days on gas prices,'' says
Hani Iskinder, Chevron's manager for the Persian Gulf. ``It may be
bad for oil companies, but it's great for American consumers. And
it has a positive effect on the American economy, helping to keep
the 1990s boom going.''
</P>
<P>
   Two main factors are at work here, industry experts say: a drop
in demand caused by economic crises in the former ``tiger''
economies of Asia, and a sharp increase in supply caused by OPEC
overproduction and the oil-for-food agreement between Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the price drop lie in the blistering desert
terrain of oilfields such as Kuwait's Burgan Sands, in Ahmadi, 24
miles south of Kuwait City. On a recent afternoon here, with
temperatures over 115 degrees, a maze of pipes flowing with crude
stretched for miles across the desert. Orchards of 10-foot-high
pumping stations known in the industry as ``Christmas trees''
sprouted from the sand for as far as the eye could see. On the
distant horizon refineries spit orange flames into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   This furiously pumping field, and others like it in Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, are producing more
oil than ever, and they're doing it more efficiently. Using
high-tech exploration and improved drilling and extraction
techniques, companies are drawing more barrels a day than ever out
of vast reserves that lie like sunken black pools of treasure
beneath the desert landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And with the recession in Asia creating less demand for all this
oil, experts say, most OPEC countries are cheating on quotas that
are spelled out in the complex agreements that hold together the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The 11 member
countries produce the oil beyond their quotas to make up for the
cheaper price. It is a spiral that forces prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The Burgan Sands of Kuwait, which produce more than half of
Kuwait's 2.2 million barrels a day, form the world's second-largest
oil field, invaded by neighboring Iraq in August 1990. After the
Gulf War, as Iraqi troops retreated in February 1991, they set
these oil fields ablaze. The rusted and burned-out remains of Iraqi
tanks and troop carriers can still be seen along the roadside.
Kuwait, along with international teams of firefighters, had to
fight for months to put out the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the war has had profound consequences for the
world oil market, some of them leaving Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein with the last laugh as he squeezes his neighbors' oil
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem that falling crude prices would hurt
Hussein's Iraq as much as other producers, there is another side to
the UN oil-for-food deal, experts say. After Hussein backed down
from his saber-rattling earlier this year, UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan granted a huge increase in the revenue ceiling for Iraqi
exports to $5.2 billion from $2 billion every six months. That
dumps some 2 million barrels a day on the world market without
regard to price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the UN foolishly based the ceiling on revenue instead
of volume, the program is a market wrecker,'' stated the June 22
lead editorial in the respected industry publication Oil and Gas
Journal. ``The lower prices go, the more Iraq produces in pursuit
of the revenue cap, feeding a surplus and weakening prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting what he wants. His neighbors are frantically
slashing production in defense of crude values. Their revenues are
plummeting. Their populations are getting restive. No one should
doubt that Hussein is cunning enough to have pulled this off,'' the
editorial stated.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the answers also lie beyond the Persian Gulf. The
industry has changed profoundly since the days in the 1970s and
'80s when OPEC could wield its might and create oil shocks that
seemed to portend ever higher prices. Today, oil is coming into the
market from every corner of the globe, including Venezuela, Mexico,
the North Sea, and Indonesia. And more exploration is going on
around the Caspian Sea and offshore West Africa. This
diversification weakens OPEC's ability to send prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of OPEC may well be over,'' says Chuck VanAllen, vice
president of Saudi Arabian Texaco Inc. ``We are looking at the new
world order in the global oil markets where the Saudis, the
Venezuelans, and (non-OPEC member) Mexico will be the major
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have even suggested that a clandestine movement is
afoot to create a group of producers to guide world prices led by
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi. Remarks made by Naimi in a
June 26 Wall Street Journal article fueled such speculation. The
interview also provided a candid admission by Naimi that OPEC does
not have great credibility in its recent promise to cut up to 2.5
million barrels a day from the world production of 73 million
barrels a day. Critics say OPEC's promises are too little too late,
and that reserves have grown so large that even if OPEC did live up
to its promise, the cuts would have no impact for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the price collapse has cost OPEC's members
an estimated $45 billion in lost revenue, roughly one-third of
their total income, with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Eliyahu Kanovsky, one of the world's leading experts on oil,
predicted the collapse of oil prices in a series of research papers
for The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s and '80s there were ``lots of doomsday
predictions that the oil cartels would take over the world, but
I've always been skeptical,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices of oil dropped equally low in 1986, he says,
they recovered within weeks, whereas this slump has seen a steady
and rapid decline for six months. And OPEC's promises to cut
production have done little to improve the market. This is proof,
he says, that we are down to the underlying or ``fundamental
price'' of oil.
</P>
<P>
   But Ann-Louise Hittle, chief researcher on world oil for the
consultancy group Cambridge Energy Research Associates of
Massachusetts, cautions: ``If you wait long enough every forecast
in oil comes around. It is a very volatile commodity. But it is
certainly true that we have an overabundance of supply and a
dramatic drop in world demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hittle points out that ``largely due to the Asian economic
crisis,'' the growth in demand for oil dropped 50 percent in 1998,
down to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kanovsky maintains that falling oil prices will increase
instability in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. ``But it
will also have a ripple effect in more diversified economies like
Egypt, which relies on oil for about 40 percent of exports, and
Syria, which relies on it for about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous drop. Some countries can cope with it, some
cannot. Saudi Arabia, for example, is going to have problems,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 25 years, the Gulf states have resolved domestic
problems _ such as the lack of democracy and the violation of human
rights _ by throwing petro dollars at its citizens in the form of
free health care, housing, and the promise of jobs. The price
crisis, which is projected to produce a $10 billion budget defecit
for the government of Saudi Arabia, could make it impossible for
these countries to sustain this kind of approach and create
political and social turmoil in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the region's problems are intensified by the oil
crisis,'' says Shafeek Ghabra, a political science professor at
Kuwait University. ``The challenge will be to keep moving forward
with democracy, fufilling promises to a surging population of youth
and addressing the needs of the disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat says fallen oil prices will continue for the
foreseeable future, but that the Gulf states should see this as an
impetus to diversify their economies and continue to open them to
the free market.
</P>
<P>
   One Kuwaiti government official said: ``It is a crisis. The
situation is very bad for us. ... We are working toward a
diversification of our economy. We know we need to do that.''

LATE HONORS FOR AN ADMIRAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Admiral William Brown was an Irish emigrant and
one-time Boston resident who founded the Argentinian navy in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires, he has streets, buildings, squares and parks
named after him.
</P>
<P>
   And he's a source of pride in his hometown of Foxford, Ireland,
where his fans hope to build a naval museum (albeit 17 miles
inland) to their native son.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, Bill Brown doesn't even register on the scale of
famous people who slept here. A few days ago, City Hall officials
said they were not familiar with Brown. But Monday after brushing
up on his history, Mayor Thomas M. Menino decided to accept a
bronze bust of the long-departed admiral with a hearty thanks and a
nagging uncertainty about what he would do with the patinized puss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Monday night, the mayor was scheduled to take stewardship of
the bust aboard the Argentine tall ship ARA Libertad, slated to
join in a salute to the USS Constitution later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The intended ceremony came as a victory for Marian Trench, 27,
of Ireland, a manager of the Foxford Admiral Brown Society that is
trying to spread the word about the Irish-American-Argentinian
naval hero.
</P>
<P>
   Trench and the bronze of the admiral came to Boston Sunday in
the wake _ literally _ of the Libertad. She hopes to educate public
and private minds here about a Bostonian, albeit only briefly a
Bostonian, who went on to a brilliant naval career south of the
equator.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertad is one of nine tall ships and nine modern warships
from seven countries that will pay tribute Thursday to the USS
Constitution, which later this week will be celebrating the 200th
anniversary of its first sail.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, celebration eve, Libertad will sponsor an
``Irish Night'' of song and dance to raise money for the Foxford
Admiral Brown Society and the museum that the small town in County
Mayo, Ireland, hopes to build someday.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Javier Armando Valladares, second-in-command of the
Libertad, holds high regard for Brown, whose portrait hangs
prominently between two portholes in the vessel's stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very big in Argentina, very famous. I think much more so
than here in Boston,'' Valladares said. No doubt this is partly
because Brown was only 9 years old when he lived here, making no
historical impression _ or any impression at all _ during his stay.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1777, Brown emigrated with his father to Boston in 1786.
This is pretty much all that's known about the Boston angle,
according to the Foxford Admiral Brown Society. The lad next popped
up on the record as a cabin boy in the American merchant marine in
1797 when he was kidnapped by the British to fight the French at
sea. A few captures and escapes later, Brown ventured to what is
now Buenos Aires to set up a trading business in the Spanish
colony.
</P>
<P>
   When rebellion against Spain broke out in 1810, Brown deftly
boarded a Spanish warship and commandeered it to win the first
skirmish of a revolution that eventually won independence for
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   His expertise as a naval commander was knowing when to fight and
when to withdraw and wait for a better opportunity. In a later
conflict, Brown, with 11 vessels, vanquished a Brazilian fleet of
31 ships.
</P>
<P>
   He is the stuff of legend in Argentina, as is his daughter
Elisa, who committed suicide by walking into the sea when her
husband, a naval captain, died in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he is not sure as yet what to do with the bust,
which easily would fit into an orange crate. Boston already has one
public tribute to an Argentinian, a statue of one Domingo Faustino
Sarmiento, a 19th century politician, bequeathed to the
Commonwealth Avenue Mall as a thank-you from Argentina for creating
the excellent American school system (150 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brown was not a quick sell to the mayor or other City Hall
officials, in part because he has the name recognition of a Doe or
Jones. Another reason is that the bust is heavy _ about one-third
Trench's weight; she got tired of carrying him on the subway.
Raising world awareness for the admiral is no junket, she pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hefty. But he is going to look very nice in some pocket
of the city someday,'' Trench explained Monday, gently brushing
wisps of styrofoam packing material from the admiral's visage.

STUDENTS' TOP 100 HAS MORE NOVEL CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Studs Lonigan have the staying power of
``Winnie-the-Pooh''? How can a list of the century's best novels
leave out Doris Lessing, Flannery O'Connor, and Toni Morrison?
Should ``A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' really be counted as
a 20th century English language classic?
</P>
<P>
   These questions and many like them will be part and parcel of
the grousing and guffawing that will go on in book circles and on
beaches for the rest of the summer, once the Radcliffe Publishing
Course releases its roster of the best 100 novels written.
</P>
<P>
   The Radcliffe list, made public officially Tuesday, was drawn up
by a group of 20-something future editors and publishers attending
an intensive summer publishing program on the Cambridge, Mass.
campus. Christopher Cerf of Random House asked for the list,
assuming that the students' choices would offer comparison to a
roster of 100 great titles chosen by the editorial board of the
Modern Library, a division of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does. The Modern Library board list, for example,
includes works by only eight women. About a third of the authors on
the Radcliffe list are female, and the names of Morrison, Virginia
Woolf, and Edith Wharton appear more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Three children's classics _ E.B. White's ``Charlotte's Web,''
A.A. Milne's ``Winnie-the-Pooh,'' and L. Frank Baum's ``The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' _ are in the Radcliffe top 50. There are
no children's books among the Modern Library board choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's books are not viewed as classics by an older, male
group,'' said Lindsey Hess, director of the Radcliffe Publishing
Program. ``That's certainly a female sensibility, and many
(publishing course students) are women and many are women of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess noted that while ``you see a lot of Alice Walker, Toni
Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston'' among choices made by the younger
group, ``it's interesting to see that certain classics are the
same.'' Four of the titles in each group's top 10 overlap: F. Scott
Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby''; James Joyce's ``Ulysses''; John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath''; and William Faulkner's ``The
Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   While traditionalists may consider some of the younger group's
titles ephemeral _ ``A Hitchhiker's Guide,'' for example _ the
Radcliffe group included some classics the Random House board
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ```To Kill a Mockingbird' is not on theirs,'' said Hess. ``I'm
assuming it was an omission on the part of the advisory board.
Otherwise, it's just stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the Radcliffe list rep-resents a number of women and
minority authors as well as many contemporary writers, the choices
do not appear to be made on the basis of political correctness.
``We have John Updike on our list,'' Hess noted. ``He isn't on
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Random House was to have unveiled its list at Radcliffe
Friday, word of the choices leaked Sunday, and they were announced
Monday on the ``Today Show'' and in The New York Times. Radcliffe
tried, and failed, to keep its list under wraps.

IT'S MUCH MORE THAN A MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ This city maintains a beautiful system of
well-kept parks. It offers extensive walking, biking, hiking, and
cross-country skiing trails. It has a rich frontier history that it
recalls in fine museums and restored forts, and celebrates with
extravagant annual festivals. It is home to first-rate restaurants
and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have much time, however. So we went to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a particularly outrageous waste of time, doesn't it?
To travel thousands of miles, to a lovely outpost in a beautiful
section of a fascinating country, and use a few precious hours to
do a bit of shopping?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that's not the allure of the West Edmonton Mall, though
some visitors undoubtedly must come to snap up bargain merchandise
because the American dollar's exchange rate is so good. Nope, we
came in search of thrills, chills, showmanship, and other sorts of
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Mall of America in Minnesota. This is the world's
largest indoor shopping megastructure, and shopping is hardly what
it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much better, much bigger, much nicer. It's just
better,'' said Ali Hyman, 14, who decided to see the West Edmonton
Mall during a recent visit with her mom from their home in New
Canaan, Conn. And Hyman should know: She lived near the Mall of
America for two years before moving east last year.
</P>
<P>
   Walk through one of the 58 entrances here, and a whole new world
appears. In addition to the 800 stores (we don't care about them
anyway, remember?), the place contains _ among many, many, many
other things _ two 18-hole miniature golf courses, one of which you
play in near darkness under black lights; a regulation ice-skating
rink; a sports museum; a casino; nightclubs and restaurants
including Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe; underwater rides
in a full-size submarine; and a bungee-jumping facility.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few more attractions at the mall, which spans the
equivalent of 48 city blocks: A huge, 20-ride amusement park that
features two roller coasters, the biggest children's climbing
structure you've ever seen, and a host of low- and high-tech games;
a wave pool the size of five football fields; live performing
dolphin shows every few hours; a 28-lane bowling alley with 25 pool
tables; and camps where parents can sign their children up for
half- or full-day stays, any time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and for visitors who just can't seem to cram it all into
just a day, there's a hotel right on the premises.

CONGRESS NEEDS TO PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND FIND THE VITAL CENTER. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The right to sue a managed-care operation for mis,
mal or nonfeasance has next to nothing to do with the election year
politics of the escalating battle over patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it continues to dominate discussion of the issue
here, for one substantive reason and for a typical
Washington-insider reason. Understanding these reasons is a
necessary prelude to getting at the core of this worthwhile fight
over affordable access for most ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The insider cause is classic special interest politics, pitting
doctors and lawyers against insurance companies and their health
maintenance organization offshoots. Very large sums of campaign
money and special interest TV advertising are involved, which is
why this aspect of the fight has drawn in everyone from President
Clinton and Speaker Gingrich on down. Nothing good comes from this
wrangling, especially since it blocks public discussion of more
basic issues.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a substantive issue behind the special
interest politics: There is no point in expanding the rights of
patients to choices, unfettered access to care, and more
information, if there is no effective means of enforcing those
rights. And one reason we have courts is to provide a place where
citizens can assert their rights and make people who misbehave pay
for their misdeeds, creating an incentive to treat consumers
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's maneuvering on Capitol Hill has produced two new
wrinkles to go with what was already there _ a congressional
Democrats' proposal backed by the Clinton adminstration. There is
an outline of what many House Republicans will support, from which
most conservatives dissent; and there is another outline from
Senate conservatives, from which several moderate Republicans
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The two GOP outlines, however, agree on one basic point:
continued denial of the right to sue in cases of injury or wrongful
death. Along with the Democrats, the Republicans suggest a much
more extensive appeals process for consumers who are denied care,
but their grievance procedures would be controlled in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking bipartisan compromise, there is an obvious way
to organize a vital center in this debate: Give professional
grievance panels the power to award damages to consumers with
legitimate grievances, which would make many lawsuits unncessary.
President Clinton, though, has correctly insisted that the right to
sue remain at the end of the process, and that an insurance company
must be liable for its misdeeds in the same way doctors are.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, it will take votes in the House and Senate to
resolve this, and a test of conservative good faith will be if
votes are allowed or if the majority uses its clout to create
gridlock as happened with tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Getting past the legal issue is important, because the real
fight as far as ordinary Americans are concerned is over access to
the best care. One reason the House Republicans are divided is that
the outline Gingrich put forward would, like the Democrats' fully
developed proposal, cover all of the roughly 150 million American
consumers of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, the Senate conservatives would restrict their
already limited expansion of patients' rights to the nearly 50
million people who are covered under plans by employers, for the
most part large corporations, who self-insure. Their argument is
that the states can and should regulate the rest of the market, an
assertion that flies in the face of the documented hodgepodge of
laws and rules that currently litter the national landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The other argument has been that detailed and broad new rights
for consumers would lead to dramatic escalation of costs, but that
was politically destroyed last week by the Congressional Budget
Office's analysis of the Democrats' plan showing minimal impact _
to the tune of perhaps two bucks more per month in premiums for a
typical worker.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the battle lines are getting drawn, but the
experience thus far in this do-little year does not teach that
clear battle lines are a prelude to resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, which has emerged in the campaign finance
reform fight as well as on tobacco, is whether majorities will be
allowed to form and assert their will on the House and Senate
floors.
</P>
<P>
   And a great deal more than the ability to sue an HMO is at
stake.

BOY SCOUTS, CHURCH SPAR ON GAY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America has ordered the Unitarian Universalist
Association, a liberal denomination with long roots in New England,
to stop giving out religious awards to scouts who are Unitarians
because the church promotes gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts considers homosexuality immoral and forbids gays
from joining the organization, a position that has been roundly
criticized by human rights groups and a number of religious
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The Unitarian church went one step further and condemned the Boy
Scouts' stance on homosexuality in a widely disseminated manual on
Unitarian practices and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the manual, Boy Scout officials recently told the
Unitarian church not to dispense the religious award emblems that
are given by many religious denominations to Boy Scouts who are
members of their faith. While these emblems are not the well-known
merit badges scouts earn for mastering specific tasks, they can
still be worn on scouting uniforms as badges of honor. Hundreds of
Unitarian religious awards are given out every year, denomination
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Religious Boy Scout awards have been given out for decades by
several different denominations, including the Roman Catholic
Church and several Protestant, Jewish and Muslim denominations.
</P>
<P>
   John Buehrens, president of the Boston-based, 250,000-member
Unitarian Universalist Association, said Unitarians had no
intention of abiding by the Boy Scouts' demand. He called the
Scouts' order ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Boy Scouts declined to comment on the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect other people's rights to disagree with us and we
simply ask people to respect our rights as a private voluntary
organization,'' said Gregg Shields, national spokesman for the
Scouts, which is headquartered in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Boy Scouts organization has been busy
fending off court challenges to its exclusion of gays, as scouts or
scoutmasters. In separate legal rulings four months ago, the Boy
Scouts of America won one court ruling and lost another.
</P>
<P>
   The California Supreme Court ruled in March that as a private
social organization, the Boy Scouts were exempt from civil rights
law prohibiting membership bans.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court in New Jersey, however, ruled in March that the
Scouts were a public organization and had to obey the state's
public accommodations law forbidding discrimination against gays.
Similar cases involving gays and the Boy Scouts are pending in
Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy erupted after the Unitarians criticized
the Boy Scouts' position on homosexuality in a manual that the
church distributes to teenagers on Unitarian practices and beliefs.
The manual describes the denomination's ``ongoing concern regarding
the homophobic and discriminatory attitudes of the national
leadership of the Boy Scouts of America.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter in May to Unitarian officials, Boy Scout officials
chastized the church for its criticism and mothballed the religious
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until such time as the (Unitarian) materials can be redrafted
to a form acceptable to the Committee, youth may not be awarded
Unitarian Universalist religious emblems in scouting or wear the
emblem on a scout uniform,'' wrote Lawrence Ray Smith, chairman of
the Boy Scouts of America Religious Relationships Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Buehrens, who was a Boy Scout, fired a letter back to Smith
accusing him of trying to tell Unitarians what they may teach
scouts about Unitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They simply can't tell us how to teach our religious
principles to our children,'' Buehrens said in an interview.
``Telling us we can't give out our awards to our boys is blatant
discrimination against children. That's not in the Boy Scouts'
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Buehrens said he hopes to meet with Boy Scout officials in the
fall in an effort to resolve the dispute. Nationally, more than 4.5
million boys are involved in scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly willing to sit down with the Boy Scouts, but I
also need to be very clear that they are in grave danger of having
much of American's mainstream religious community concerned about
the way in which they are acting,'' Buehrens said.

FOR THE POLICE, DRAGNET BECOMES THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN TEDESCO  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As Dragnet meets the Internet, police work in
cities across the country is taking a high-tech step beyond ``just
the facts, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the St. Paul Police Department posts names and
pictures of people charged with prostitution, along with the men
accused of picking them up.
</P>
<P>
   In the college town of Pullman, Wash., the police posted
people's pictures on the Internet after a student riot near
Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   From on-line wanted posters to Internet maps of neighborhood
crime spots, police forces are tapping new ways to reach the public
using the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, police departments have been very closed with
their information,'' said Clara Zainie, who maintains the San
Antonio Police Department's Web page. ``One of the tenets of
community policing is to try to share with the public as much
information as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 400 Internet Web sites for municipal police
departments in the United States, and 26 sites for state police
agencies. Although the sites in some communities offer little more
than a list of phone numbers and, maybe, a picture of a squad car,
other sites are more arresting.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio police Web page provides neighborhood crime
maps, a database of impounded vehicles, a real-time listing of
traffic accidents in the city, crime trends and more. The
information can help a commuter avoid traffic snarls or show
resident Web surfers how many burglaries have hit their
neighborhoods in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The crime maps have received up to 100 hits a day, Zainie said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood groups find the maps useful to spot trouble areas _
or to dispel the perception that an area is crime ridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people think there's a lot more crime in their
neighborhood than there actually is,'' Zainie said. ``When one
person gets burglarized in two weeks, it's unfortunate,'' she said.
``But, not belittling that, it's hardly a crime wave. People
understand that when they actually see it on a map.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Paul Web site's gallery of people charged with
prostitution has drawn hundreds of comments from 20 countries, most
in favor of the page, said Sylvia Burgos, the police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people call us and ask if they're going to be on it.
We've had lawyers call and question the legality of it. It's all
legal,'' Burgos said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the launching of the prostitution page in October, the
site recorded about 8,000 hits. Since October, it has received more
than 100,000 hits, Burgos said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, it was too early to say if the page has helped
curb prostitution in the city. The St. Paul Police Department
recently added to its Web site pictures, names and information
about sex offenders living in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio police have no plans in place to post similar
information on the Web. They do plan to add more crime data, crime
analysis and an area where users can print forms, such as
applications for burglar alarms, to save a trip to the police
station.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of Washington,
maintain a Web site with crime databases and crime-prevention
information.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville police Internet site includes crime-prevention
questionnaires with titles such as ``Are you going to be raped,
robbed, stabbed, shot or beaten?''
</P>
<P>
   Based on responses, the site computes a score. The higher the
score, the higher the risk of being a likely victim of a crime.
Those determined to be high risk are told: ``You are in a dangerous
category and better change your habits lest you be tomorrow's
headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The police aren't the only ones distributing law enforcement
information on the Internet. Some organizations use the Web to
police the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Complaint Center in Tallahassee, Fla., makes
available video recordings of apparent police misconduct from
different cities. The American Civil Liberties Union has a site
focused on police reform. Visitors can print a pocket card with
guidelines on how to handle encounters with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Speed Trap Registry reports rumored speed traps from across
the country.

FINDING THE GOOD IN GREENHEAD FLIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Go ahead and swat, but the dreaded greenhead fly driving its
saw-like pincers into your thigh as you lie on the beach may save
your life some day.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University researchers are looking for an elusive
protein in fly saliva that thins the blood of victims, allowing
greenheads to feed amply off the crimson flow.
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge could lead to drugs to help people fight strokes,
heart attacks, and other cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving them a taste of their own medicine,'' said lead
researcher Kounga Kounga, a Cameroon-born biochemist for the
Cutaneous Biology Research Center at Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``We're trying to get something out of them, to reverse
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, during the short greenhead season the researchers
must capture enough flies to provide a stockpile of the tiny
salivary glands that produce the protein, chrysoptin. The flies are
caught along the marshes of the Essex County greenbelt near
Ipswich, Mass., where traps have been set with a proven greenhead
chemical lure, octenal.
</P>
<P>
   Flies rise into slits on the bottom of the traps, black boxes on
four legs, meant to look like cows to the undiscerning flies.
</P>
<P>
   One hot and muggy morning this week, Kounga, 36, and Harvard
intern Fabio Mariano, 20, approached the traps dressed in
protective outer clothes, including hoods and gloves, that left
only their faces exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano armed himself with a portable vacuum cleaner while
Kounga picked up a wire mesh cage and held it like a shield as the
two came to the first trap. Kounga slapped the side of the box, and
a steady hum became an angry buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' he said. ``This one is full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hungry,'' Mariano added, his voice rising and
tightening.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing the latch, Kounga lifted the wire-screen lid
about nine inches. The swarm was sucked into the whirring mouth of
the vacuum, which Mariano moved deftly from left to right.
</P>
<P>
   Each man waved flies away from his face with his free hand.
Then, with only straggling greenheads remaining, Kounga dropped the
trap lid. The men quickly moved away from the box, arms and legs
flapping in a frenzied dance to repel any remaining flies.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: about 250 angry, buzzing, hungry, greenheaded,
brown-bellied flies trapped in a clear plastic tube inside the
vacuum nozzle. They were then shifted from the tube into the wire
cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good catch,'' Kounga said, as they went on to collect
some 1,000 flies that day. He and Mariano are urgently capturing
flies three or four times a week during the three-week prime
greenhead season, beginning in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Other animals also have anticlotting factors in their saliva.
Venom from vipers, for example, is used in some anticoagulation
drugs. Mosquitoes also ``spit'' anticlotting compounds in wounds to
keep the blood flowing. The scientists hope that by analyzing how
such compounds in greenhead flies differ from existing
anticoagulants, they can add another weapon to the arsenal of drugs
to treat strokes and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the MGH lab, the flies were immobilized by
refrigeration, pinned onto wax in a glass dish, and flooded with a
clear preservative.
</P>
<P>
   Through the microscope, a fly appeared as big as a hand. Sharp
tweezers tore the front legs from the body, then removed the
yellowish abdomen and most of the organs.
</P>
<P>
   Two translucent tendrils _ the salivary glands _ floated in
clear solution. A deft move of the tweezers pinched and pulled them
down and away, a counter clicked twice, and the precious material
smaller than a pinhead was dropped into little vials filled with a
liquid pink preservative.
</P>
<P>
   Glands must be harvested within 24 hours of the flies' death,
Mariano said, or they become useless.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Kounga and his staff is to purify the
chrysoptin and decipher its amino acid sequence. Then they'll map
out its DNA code and, perhaps, its three-dimensional structure.
</P>
<P>
   With the DNA key, they hope to make the protein in the lab and
test it on blood samples, first from rabbits and then humans. If
successful, new drugs could be manufactured that thin blood to
treat cardiovascular disease and prevent clotting in those at risk
for stroke. The market potential is $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each drop is like gold,'' Kounga said. ``For us, it would be a
catastrophe not to have flies.''

BACHELOR HOPES YARD SIGN WILL FINALLY END SEARCH FOR MISS RIGHT

 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOW, Wash. _ Everything's ready.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny shack has been thoroughly swamped out and remodeled,
with new mocha-brown carpet and a frost-free fridge. There are
wildflowers around the new deck, freshly planted fruit trees in the
backyard and a sign outside advertising Tom Rodal's heartfelt
desire:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wife wanted,'' it reads. ``360-766-6841.''
</P>
<P>
   The eager bachelor has even built a swing for two, hung from a
grand old maple on his half-acre of waterview property along scenic
Chuckanut Drive, north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   All that's missing is Mrs. Right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's room for two here, see?'' says Rodal, 45, patting the
empty seat next to him on the swing. ``We will be able to swing
here together and look out over the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising for a wife with a front-yard sign may seem an act of
desperation. But the boyish-looking bachelor _ an avid hang glider
and churchgoer who has never married and has no children _ sees it
as an act of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real effort,'' he says, ``an honest attempt to find
a wife, a soul companion, someone I can share all the goodness of
life with.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodal first put a ``wife wanted'' sign in his yard about two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Someone quickly stole it.
</P>
<P>
   The first version had one heart drawn on it. The replacement has
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be married. I've always wanted to love
and be loved,'' says Rodal, who has a goofy, Howdy Doody grin that
breaks into deep dimples beneath earnest blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth becomes a serious little ``o,'' however, as he
contemplates the woman of his dreams: ``She'll have a lovely face,
a look of contentment on her face. She'll be a precious delight,
someone who holds my attention with her kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that precious delight has yet to show.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a few drive-bys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three ladies in a car knocked on the door when I wasn't home,
then called from their car phone and left a message,'' Rodal says.
``One gal said she might possibly be interested in being my future
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they never called back.''
</P>
<P>
   An 87-year-old who heard about Rodal's roadside attraction
called from her rest home, wanting to set him up with her young
companion.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-year-old called looking for love. ``She asked if I thought
she was a little old. I told her she's not too old for fun and
friendship!''
</P>
<P>
   A number of people called to tell him they thought him
``brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodal prefers the term ``assertive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the phone rings, I just go, `Oh, gosh! Oh, wow! The
phone's ringing again!''' says Rodal, whose animated hands fly up
in excitement as he talks inside his tidy 350-square-foot Hobbit
house.
</P>
<P>
   Rodal spent a year fixing up the little two-room home, situated
directly across the street from the Chuckanut Manor restaurant. He
remodeled the kitchen _ ``Look at these cupboards! Brand new!'' _
laid the carpet, hung flower baskets, put up scenic paintings, all
in preparation for marital bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make it beautiful enough so that she'll be
attracted,'' he says. ``I hope she appreciates it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodal's last serious relationship was 20 years ago in college.
He has dated occasionally since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met some wonderful women, but the attraction wasn't
always mutual,'' said the fit, 5-foot-10 bachelor, who has tried
singles want ads with little success, advertising himself as a
``mature Christian hang glider,'' and including his blood pressure
(112 over 66) and pulse (64).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the humorous part of the ad,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Even hanging out in laundromats didn't do the trick. ``I always
talk to everyone in a laundromat,'' says the bubbly Rodal. ``If
there's 10 people, I'll talk to 10 people!''
</P>
<P>
   Friends aren't surprised by Rodal's public bid for love. ``When
it comes to doing things out of the ordinary, he doesn't even think
twice about it,'' says Karl Anderson, who owns an aircraft-repair
business in Bow and describes Rodal as the kind of guy who'd drop
whatever he's doing to help out a friend or neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Rodal, who grew up in Anacortes and earned an associate's degree
in natural science in college, has an eclectic resume. After
college, he worked on cruise ships in Hawaii as a deckhand and
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked for the National Park Service repairing bridges,
buildings and roads. He now runs his own window-cleaning business _
Terrific Tom's Window Cleaning _ and is an aspiring actor. His
resume lists bit parts in TV shows such as ``Quantum Leap'' and
``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   One local casting agent described Rodal, who parts his thick,
blondish-brown hair in the middle, as ``An Alfalfa, grown up.''

<P>
   He collects antique marbles and designs and performs with tops,
shapely creations in fine wood that spin like little whirling
dervishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd spin my top for the right gal,'' says Rodal, breaking into
an uh-huhn-uh-huhn-uh-huhn laugh as he shows off his collection.
</P>
<P>
   How he'll recognize that ``right gal,'' he's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   He is certain she's out there. In fact, he can visualize his
precious delight in a white gown on the wooded hillside above his
house saying those two magic words: ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the ``Wife Wanted'' sign stays in the front yard,
although Rodal now brings it in every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to give up. Never!'' says the
groom-in-waiting. ``I'll be persistent _ and I will succeed.''

THEY HUFF AND PUFF IN FIGHT OVER MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In the back room of an otherwise bland
downtown building here, a dozen or so men and women lined up the
other day to buy baked goods laced with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The selection included ``Rice Crispy treats'' and chocolate chip
cookies. The sweets came in peanut butter flavor, too.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to smoke their supply, an even wider
assortment was available in plastic bags with labels like ``Indoor
Special'' and ``Fruit Loops.'' Cannabis in pill form was also on
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions were perfectly legal, according to the people
who run the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative and the people
with cancer, AIDS, and chronic pain who shop there. They say
Californians gave them that right in November 1996 when they voted
to become the only state in the nation to allow medical patients to
use marijuana with a doctor's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But both buyers and sellers are edgy these days, worried that
the federal or state government will keep patients from the one
drug that they say prevents muscle spasms, eases their agony, and
helps them keep down food _ and does so without negative side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   In test cases that are being monitored by marijuana advocates
from Maine to Alaska, the Oakland cooperative and a handful of
others are operating in violation of a federal court injunction.
Their defiance can be detected in the air: Although smoking is
forbidden in the back room known as the Bud Bar, the sticky-sweet
smell of marijuana was so strong it clung to clothing and hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my medicine and it allowed me to kick every other
pharmaceutical unless I'm in serious, serious pain,'' said Ken
Estes, 40, who was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident 22 years ago.
He now grows marijuana for the Oakland cooperative and teaches
customers how to cultivate it in their closets. ``I've sat in my
wheelchair behind bars because of it. Well, they can put me in jail
again. I'm not going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the California drug war could set a precedent,
and advocates fear a decision against them would discourage other
states from pursuing similar policies. The issue is on Oregon's
November ballot, and is likely to be voted on in Colorado and
Washington state. Signature drives in Maine, Alaska, and Nevada
have yet to succeed, but the effort to legalize medical marijuana
there continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government opposition to medical marijuana, especially at the
federal level, is voracious,'' said Dave Fratello, a spokesman for
the Santa Monica-based Americans for Medical Rights, which pushed
the voter referendum formally known as Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government says the sale or distribution of
marijuana is illegal under any circumstance. The Justice Department
wants US District Judge Charles Breyer to allow US marshals to
padlock six northern California clubs, which were caught selling
marijuana to patients without the requisite doctor's approval, and
hold them in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The state also opposes the clubs, which serve thousands of
people, saying that Proposition 215 permits only patients or their
primary caregivers to possess or cultivate marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   So far, state Attorney General Dan Lungren has succeeded in
putting the largest club _ the Cannabis Healing Center in San
Francisco, with about 8,000 members _ out of business, at least
temporarily. Police in other cities have closed clubs too, after
accusing them of selling marijuana to nonpatients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we're against,'' said John Carrillo, an
officer with the San Jose Police Department, which shuttered a club
and arrested its operator. ``We're just making sure everyone is in
compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the fear of arrest, however, is forcing clubs underground
as in the days before Proposition 215, making an accurate count of
their number difficult. Advocates estimate, however, that the
number of larger cannabis clubs has plummeted in the past year,
from a peak of 28 to fewer than a dozen. Stephen Shefler, a first
assistant US attorney in San Francisco, said his agency is
considering what action, if any, to take against the clubs not
named in the federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally we opposed Prop. 215; now we're calling for a
rational approach,'' said Matt Ross, Lungren's spokesman. ``A
doctor can recommend it, a patient can use and grow it based on
that recommendation, and should the patient not be able to do so, a
primary caregiver can provide it _ the key word being primary
caregiver.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubs counter that, by being part of cooperatives, members
are pooling resources to acquire marijuana as inexpensively and
efficiently as possible. Jeff W. Jones, the Oakland cooperative's
executive director, said a quarter-ounce of marijuana can cost
patients $40 to $110, depending on quality. That cost includes just
enough to cover the cooperative's overhead and the cost of the
plants. That's slightly below street value for 10 joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion is way ahead of the politicians,'' Jones said.
``It started as a movement with the people and now it's accepted by
some local governments. The next step is the state and then we'll
get the feds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, club operators say they want their day in
court. Saying that voters already approved medical marijuana once,
they believe a jury is certain to see the need for their
distribution networks. But the federal case will be heard only by
Breyer, who has indicated in previous rulings that he is likely to
side with the government.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, Senator John Vasconcellos, whose May summit
on medical marijuana brought together advocates and opponents, is
pushing a bill that would authorize local governments to create
their own medical marijuana distribution systems. That bill
recently failed in committee but may come up again. Lungren and
other elected officials have endorsed a project at the University
of California to research the efficacy of medical marijuana, whose
palliative effects are promoted by many patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Even the federal government supplies marijuana to some patients
under the so-called Compassionate Investigative New Drug program.
But the Bush administration closed that program to newcomers in
1992 _ advocates say it was because too many AIDS patients were
applying _ and today it serves only eight people, most of whom have
glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with AIDS and cancer need it now; we can't wait until
the research is concluded to fix this awful distribution system
that has grown up on an ad hoc basis,'' said Rand Martin,
Vasconcellos' chief of staff. ``The irony is that while President
Clinton and his people are pushing to close our clubs down, the
movement is spreading nationally. People want this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some cannabis club operators say that their operations
are no panacea. They want medical marijuana to be reclassified as a
prescription drug that can be grown legally and sold in pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   As Scott Imler, who heads the as yet untargeted Los Angeles
Cannabis Resource Center in West Hollywood, put it: ``The minute
the clubs aren't necessary anymore, I'll be the first one to close.
Who needs this stress?... I worry every day that we'll be shut
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The same threat hangs over the Oakland cooperative, open since
July 1996 and serving 1,350 patients, ages 18 to 85. Now a guard
checks membership cards, and doctors' recommendations must be
updated yearly. To be extra cautious, the club will not provide
referrals to doctors known to support marijuana use; members must
find their own physicians. The precautions, Jones says, helped the
club spot an undercover officer who was attempting to buy drugs _
an unmasking captured on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The Bud Bar where marijuana is stored and cuttings are sold is
off-limits to minors and monitored by another guard. On a recent
day, in the course of an hour a dozen or more patients came and
went, many shockingly thin, none giddy from a drug high. Marijuana,
they said, offers relief rather than euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs used to jump all over the place,'' said Yvonne
Westbrook, 45, who has multiple sclerosis. ``The doctor prescribed
valium, but I couldn't function. With a few puffs of marijuana, I'm
just fine. My doctor understands this.''
</P>
<P>
   The city council in Oakland, where Jerry Brown is the
mayor-elect, has indicated it understands, too. Recently it voted
to allow patients to store 1.5 pounds of marijuana _ a three-month
supply far larger than the state allows. The new policy also
instructs Oakland officers to treat medical-marijuana growers as a
low priority for enforcement and gives individuals two days to
provide proof that their marijuana is for medical use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to conserve cop time and, at the same time, we don't
want to harass cancer and AIDS patients,'' said Mike Nisperos,
public safety liaison for the Oakland city manager. ``If this makes
you stop retching, if it makes you feel less sick, we're saying go
ahead. You're not hurting anybody.''

A CHINESE `MOMMIE DEAREST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
INGRATITUDE 
By Ying Chen (translated, from the FrenchCQ, by Carol Volk) 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 154 pp., $20 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine having a mother so critical of you that you choose
suicide to shut her up _ and punish her.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tragic idea, and it should induce tears. But the story
line of the novel ``Ingratitude,'' by Canadian author Ying Chen,
doesn't live up to its promise. In the end, the reader comes away
unmoved by the litany of complaints of the main character, Dixi
Yan-Zi, and untouched by her death. Ironically, the mother _
instead of being the villain _ turns out to be a lot like other
mothers around the world: very strict and controlling. It's Yan-Zi
who ends up looking foolish and immature.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which takes place in modern-day China, starts out
compellingly. Yan-Zi begins her tale from beyond the grave, in the
days just after her death. As her spirit hovers over her grieving
relatives, she bitterly recalls the stormy arguments she had with
her iron-willed mother over the years and the distant relationship
she had with her father, an academic who virtually ignored her her
entire life.
</P>
<P>
   Mother _ who remembers everything _ forgot Yan-Zi's birthday
again, Yan-Zi recalls. Mother _ who will share a laugh with a
neighbor _ would never laugh with her. Mother _ who didn't marry
for love _ wouldn't allow her the privilege either. And Father? He
could never be disturbed. He was always working, Yan-Zi laments.
</P>
<P>
   The character's sufferings mount over the course of her life,
and so does her frustration at never being able to make her mother
proud of her. Indeed, even after Yan-Zi learns to sew, consistently
does housework, steers clear of men, and dutifully stays home, her
mother calls her efforts hypocritical because Yan-Zi really doesn't
want to do those things.
</P>
<P>
   Yan-Zi begins to envy orphans who are free of family. She
convinces herself that the only way to silence such a know-it-all
is to shatter Mother's credibility. So she plans her own death by
sleeping pills, hoping it will bring shame on her tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   The book misses the mark for a number of reasons. For one, Chen
doesn't give enough cultural and historical context for Yan-Zi's
life in Chinese society. It's clear she has a tough family life;
it's not clear why she can't find love and friendship outside her
home.
</P>
<P>
   If her parents are aloof, why not turn to former schoolmates,
co-workers, or other relatives? Indeed, Yan-Zi mentions that she
gets along well with her grandmother. So why isn't that
relationship fully explored? While Yan-Zi does attend a play once
with friends, her social life in general seems severely limited. It
isn't clear if Yan-Zi is just unsocial or if her environment
requires her solitary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Yan-Zi's nonstop complaining makes her character seem
one-dimensional. She is obsessed with her mother to a degree that
seems unbelievable in a 25-year-old woman. Of course, it's possible
that parental approval is more important to a Chinese woman in
Yan-Zi's situation _ but if so, Chen should not have left the
context unspoken, undramatized.
</P>
<P>
   Yan-Zi's choice of suicide is also confusing because she is on
the verge of marriage. Her fiance, Chun, is really her mother's
choice, but he still represents a means of escape _ a way of moving
out of her mother's home and away from that clucking tongue. And
Chun does care for Yan-Zi, as Chen makes clear in depicting his
role in her death.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Yan-Zi seems weak, a tiresome, immature complainer
and _ as the book's title suggests _ ungrateful. A more fully
developed central character might leave us wondering about her
choice of escape and understanding her pain. Instead, readers are
left only with her ingratitude for the life she was given.

FOOD TO EAT, AND FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you dine with Benjamin Franklin, the first thing you
realize is that food in the 18th century wasn't all that bad. The
second thing you realize is that you never know what Franklin is
going to say!
</P>
<P>
   The event, a new one, is called ``English Onion Soup and Rich
Seed Cake: Dinner and Performance with Benjamin Franklin.'' It's
held Friday nights through Aug. 28 at Boston's Old South Meeting
House, the site where Franklin was baptized in 1706.
</P>
<P>
   The evening begins with Franklin, portrayed by Emmy-winning
actor Bill Meikle, greeting guests as they arrive for an authentic
18th-century dinner, researched and presented by chef Donald R.
Daly of Salem. The three courses are served buffet style. First
comes a creamed onion soup with a hint of sherry. That's followed
by chicken pilau _ chicken in rice with raisins, onions, almonds,
and spices (cinnamon among them), accompanied by a medley of
broccoli and cauliflower in a vinaigrette, with assorted breads and
butter and lemonade. Dessert is Mrs. Raffald's Rich Seed Cake, a
whole-wheat flour cake with caraway seeds, giving it lots of crunch
if not a lot of moisture. Don't expect to be dining with Paul
Revere's silverware, however: For practical purposes, plastic
utensils and plates are used.
</P>
<P>
   That's the meal, and a pleasant one it is. But the ``main
course'' is Meikle's 90-minute performance as Benjamin Franklin in
the year 1789, when he is 83 and tends to ``dither'' a bit in his
speech. No two performances are alike, because you the people
decide what Franklin talks about. He fields questions like this
from the audience:
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Dr. Franklin, did you have a _ heh, heh _ good time when
you served at the French court?''
</P>
<P>
   A. ``I was 70! For me, a good time was breathing in and out!''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of questions and answers provides a lively portrait
of the great man that may be somewhat different from what you read
in your seventh-grade history book. At this year's premiere
performance, Franklin, dressed in his finery and accompanied by his
cane and a glass of port, spoke of his alienation from his son, a
Loyalist. He lamented that women in early America were legal
nonentities who would have had more rights if they had been
captured by Indians. He told the audience that his favorite of his
100-plus inventions is the glass harmonica _ played with the hands,
not the mouth _ which makes music that ``sounds as if glass angels
are singing.'' And he left no doubt about what he thinks of people
who are ``holier than thou ... and thou ... and thou.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the performance, Franklin/Meikle says, ``If you
have enjoyed yourselves, tell a friend. If you have not enjoyed
yourselves, tell an enemy.'' Dr. Franklin, I'm telling my friends.
</P>
<P>
   (Dinners are Fridays at 6, followed by performances at 7. The
all-inclusive price is $35, or $30 for meetinghouse members. The
price for the performance alone is $20. Psssst: Those who come for
dinner get reserved seats up front for the performance. For more
information or reservations, call 617-482-6439.)

25 YEARS OF DISCOUNTED TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TKTS, the discount theater ticket booth in the heart of Times
Square in New York City, marked its 25th anniversary June 27. Since
its opening, TKTS has distributed nearly 35 million tickets to
Broadway, off Broadway, music, and dance events in the Big Apple.
The booth, operated by the nonprofit Theatre Development Fund, has
been the model for similar booths in Boston, Toronto, London,
Washington, Chicago, Denver, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, San
Francisco, and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are sold at 50 or 25 percent off for that day's
performance only (the production determines the discount). There
are no advance sales, no credit cards are honored, it's cash only,
and those in line take their chances on the show and seat locations
when they reach the window. The booth at Broadway and 47th Street
is open daily all year. A second booth is open in Lower Manhattan
at 2 World Trade Center. There is a $2.50 per ticket service
charge, which is used in part to operate the booth and to benefit
the theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the booth is obvious; many got their first
introduction to live theater through the savings the booth offers.
The Theatre Development Fund, the largest not-for-profit service
organization for the performing arts in the country, however, does
not regard TKTS booths as the only answer to the marketing problems
of theaters. The group says that while no theater producer or owner
likes to see the curtain rise on empty seats in the house _ the
condition TKTS is designed to remedy _ neither do they like having
their tickets sold at half price.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square booth is open Monday through Saturday from 3
p.m. to 8 p.m. for evening performances and Wednesday and Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for matinees; and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 7
p.m. for all performances. The lines are longest from 3 p.m. to 4
p.m. for evenings, and from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. for matinees. There
is usually a short wait, or none at all, around 6 p.m. or between
noon and 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Manhattan booth has advantages over the Times Square
booth. This booth is both indoors in air-conditioned comfort and
its lines are said to be much shorter. Also, you can pick up
tickets for evening performances much earlier because the booth is
open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday
from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Manhattan booth is closed on Sundays. Two additional
advantages are that matinee tickets can be purchased a day in
advance at the World Trade Center location, and, should you need
them, full-price tickets are also available.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call 212-768-1818.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities offering discount theater booths include Los
Angeles, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Austin,
Seattle, Edmonton, and Paris. Boston's BosTix has three locations:
Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Copley Saquare, and Harvard Square. For
information, call 617-482-BTIX.

   The famed Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, N.H., a
summer destination for nearly a century, will become a winter
destination as well beginning Nov. 29, 1999. The National Historic
Landmark will be fully winterized and will offer a long list of
amenities to make it a grand hotel in all seasons. The hotel will
be the center of a 2,600-acre recreation complex that includes
Bretton Woods ski area for both cross-country and Nordic skiing,
the Mount Washington Cog Railway, the Bretton Arms Country Inn, the
Bretton Woods Motor Inn, Fabyans Station Restaurant, and the
Bretton Woods Sports Club. Among planned winter activities are
night skiing and ice skating on an illuminated rink just below the
hotel's 900-foot veranda. For more information, call 800-258-0330.

devastating earthquake on Sept. 26, 1997, Ghigo Roili completed
photographing the glorious frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue that have
adorned the upper basilica of the Basilica of St. Francis of
Assisi. Now those photographs, along with ones taken immediately
after the earthquake, are captured in ``The Basilica of St. Francis
of Assisi: Glory and Destruction'' (Abrams, $24.95). A description
of the frescoes is also included. Bonnie Burnham, president of the
World Monuments Fund, says she believes the book ``will focus
much-needed attention on the magnitude of the loss as well as the
need for international assistance.''

SHORT -- AND SWEET _ SAILINGS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best ways to sample cruising is to take a short
cruise. And there are plenty of cruises from two to five days long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short cruises are the perfect quick getaway,'' says James G.
Godsman, president of the Cruise Lines International Association,
which represents most cruise companies. ``A short cruise offers a
wealth of activities and opportunities to relax, they're easy to
plan and inexpensive, and they're a great way to experience a new
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than a third of the 5 million North Americans
who cruised were on a short itinerary. This year, there are nearly
1,300 itineraries of two to five days to choose from, with
destinations that range from the Caribbean and Mexico to the
Mediterranean, Bermuda, New England, and the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   The newest three- or four-day cruise will be aboard the new
Disney Magic, which begins sailings July 30 from Port Canaveral.
The cruise includes a three- or four-day stay at Disney World, and
a cruise-only option is also available.
</P>
<P>
   Among other offerings is Commodore Cruise Line's sailing of two-
to five-night cruises from New Orleans on the Enchanted Capri.
Cunard will offer a five-day Labor Day getaway to Bermuda on its
Queen Elizabeth 2. American Hawaii Cruises has three- and
four-night cruises visiting the Hawaiian islands. Regal Cruises has
one-, two- and three-night party cruises as well as five-night
tours of New England and Canada from New York. Norwegian Cruise
Line has a variety of three- and four-day cruises from Miami to the
Bahamas, Mexico, and Key West, Fla. Even the luxurious Seabourn
Cruise Line will have two three-day itineraries this fall: One is a
New York sampler sailing out of New York City, and the other is a
Fall Florida Sampler sailing from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Another
luxury line, Silversea Cruises, will offer a three-day California
getaway in December from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Lines is featuring four- and five-day western
Caribbean cruises from Tampa, with calls in Key West, Cozumel, and
Grand Cayman, depending upon the cruise. The cruises can be
combined with two- and three-day tours of Tampa and Orlando
attractions. Carnival also offers short cruises from Miami, Port
Canaveral, and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Three-day cruises can begin at around $500 a person, including
air fare.

Largest sailing vessel
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Star Clippers, which has been operating two genuine sailing
vessels, has announced plans to build the world's largest sailing
vessel, a five-masted, full rigger ship inspired by the Preussen,
which was the largest sailing vessel anywhere from 1902 to 1910.
</P>
<P>
   The new Royal Clipper, which will sail the Grenadines and the
lower Windwards in the Caribbean beginning in late 1999, will have
56,000 square feet of sail, reaching as much as 197 feet above the
water line. At 439 feet, its length, the same as Preussen, will be
longer than any true sailing vessel in the world, according to the
authoritative Lloyd's List. The vessel will offer 90 outside cabins
with 148 square feet of space, all with queen-sized beds
convertible to singles. There will also be two owner's suites of
320 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The deck of the Royal Clipper will be spacious enough to handle
three pools and give every passenger 93 square feet of deck space.
A unique feature will be the Captain Nemo Club, a roomy lookout
lounge at the very bottom of the ship. Thick glass portholes will
overlook nearby fish and the sea bottom, with the ship's hull and
adjacent water floodlit at night when the ship is anchored.
</P>
<P>
   While Star Clippers is dedicated to preserving the ways of old
at sea, all its vessels have modern amenities.

<P>
   A great deal is being offered on a cruise that re-creates some
of the voyage of Leif Ericson (but with a lot more comfort). The
Black Watch will sail from Dover, England, Sept. 1, on a 32-day
voyage that combines the fairy-tale Faroe Islands, volcanic
Iceland, mythical Greenland, Canada, Bermuda, and the Bahamas. In
the EuroCruises brochure, the price of the cruise is listed at
$6,904 a person, but the same cabin that price applied to is now
offered at $2,872 a person. In addition, passengers can select a
17-night Dover-to-Montreal segment from $1,575 a person or a
14-night Montreal-Nassau cruise from $1,297 a person, which comes
to $87 a day. For information, call EuroCruises, the largest
marketer of European cruises in North America, in New York at
800-661-1119 for a brochure, or 800-688-3876 for reservations.

   Holland America's Statendam will call San Diego home during its
1999 Hawaii cruise season. The Statendam will offer seven 16-day
Circle Hawaii cruises and one 16-day Hawaii Holiday Cruise
celebration of the turn of the century. Five of the cruises will
begin and end in San Diego, another will start in Vancouver and end

one-on-one instruction from teaching professionals. The program,
which guests can sign up for once on board, is available on all 12
Carnival ships. Shipboard lessons are available in 30- or 60-minute
increments and take place in a netted driving range. Included in
the port-of-call excursion packages are greens fees, instruction,
car rental, or caddie and transportation to and from shoreside
courses. Equipment rental is also available. Prices begin at $40
for shipboard lessons and $100 for shoreside excursions.

   The Delta Queen Steamboat Co. has increased its early-booking
bonus on 1999 cruises to include free round-trip air fare on
cruises of seven nights or more, a discounted fare for shorter
cruises, and an additional 5 percent discount for those paying for
the cruise within 48 hours of booking. The savings are on cruises
booked six months in advance. For information, call 800-543-1949.

<P>
   Have you ever wondered how the granite used for construction in
New York City was transported from the quarries in Maine? How
molasses made it from the West Indies to Boston? Well, these and
other history lessons are just a part of the experience of sailing
on a windjammer.
</P>
<P>
   The North End Shipyard Schooners in Rockland, Maine, have
captains schooled in the history of the Maine islands and
schooners. And the fleet includes two national historic landmarks,

SHAW, CULLORS IN THE RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Gone are Curtis Martin and Dave Meggett. Gone
with them are a dozen years of experience, a couple of hundred
National Football League games, nearly 7,000 yards gained on the
ground, and almost 4,000 through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Cullors and Sedrick Shaw, each with a single
limited-playing-time Patriot season behind him, are the two
veterans who will try to join rookies Robert Edwards and perhaps
Harold Shaw to fill the void at tailback. They have a total of 61
carries and 227 NFL yards _ 51 carries and 205 yards by Cullors _
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll acknowledged Monday that it would have been
nice to get Sedrick Shaw more than one game of work _ 10 carries
for 22 yards in the playoffs against Pittsburgh _ last year.
Cullors, Carroll noted the day before, could make a nice third-down
back.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have seen enough to know that Sedrick Shaw and
Cullors can both run with the ball and make people miss.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's a matter of taking a little time to find out who is
going to get the playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell,'' Carroll said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Might take a week. Might take a month. Might even end up being a
tailback-by-committee approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ideally, you'd like to have one guy jump to the front,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no big rush to pick the big rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about it because we have guys who have not
carried a hundred or two hundred times, where you know what they
can do over the course of a season,'' Carroll said. ``But I feel
confident we'll be real able to have competition in that area.
We're fortunate to have all the youth and fresh legs, and I think
in time that will be a very strong position. We just don't know who
the guy is yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw and Cullors both look forward to getting their
chances in the mix with Edwards and assorted others.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, taken first in the third round of the NFL draft a year ago
as the initial compensation pick from the Jets for the signing of
Bill Parcells, appeared in only one regular-season game and then
two playoff games a year ago. All his carries came in the playoff
game against Pittsburgh, when he split time with Cullors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is last year, and nothing about last year can be
changed,'' Shaw said between sessions Monday. ``The only thing that
can be changed is this year, and this year hasn't completely gotten
started yet. This is just one practice. I look forward to going out
there each day and trying to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   When Monday's first session ended and most of the players in
camp headed to the locker room, Shaw, Cullors, and Edwards stayed
on the field. Shaw and Edwards went the length of the field a
couple of times with running backs coach Kirby Wilson, covering 5
yards with a football, dropping to the ground, and getting up for
the next 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everything is pretty routine,'' Shaw said.
``Everyone is out here trying to get a rhythm, get a feel for one
another, and get the rust off.''
</P>
<P>
   All the running backs stayed late after the afternoon session,
too, working on pass-catching drills. And then Edwards and Cullors
did the drill with Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors was signed in the fall of 1996 after being released by
the Baltimore Ravens, and he spent that season on the practice
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he led the special teams in tackles with 17 and
returned a kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown in Buffalo. In his only
start, he was the team's leading rusher with 22 carries for 86
yards in the first-round playoff win against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   That, he hopes, is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully not,'' said Cullors when asked if he'd remember the
Miami game for a long time. ``Hopefully, this year I'll have a lot
of games I can remember. Hopefully, that was just a start. I don't
think it was any big deal. I'd love to average 80 or 100 yards on
12 carries if I can. I've got my goals, I set them kind of high.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors, listed at 6 feet and 195 pounds, loves the idea of
being the third-down guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I can take the beating of carrying 30 times a
game?'' he said.``I don't know. If it prolongs my career to be a
third-down back, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever helps the team, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I fit in pretty well,'' he said. ``I'll try to be the
third-down back and maybe a little more. I'd love to be getting the
ball 12-15 times a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shaw and Cullors figure they will miss the chance to learn
from veteran running backs Martin and Meggett, as well as fullbacks
Sam Gash and Keith Byars. They'll miss them in the locker room and
miss them for running back dinner and movie outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from all those guys when they were here,''
Shaw said. ``From Sam Gash to Dave Meggett to Keith Byars to Curtis
Martin. I learned from every one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it will be up to Shaw and Cullors and their running cohorts
to keep the team from missing its veteran running backs too much.

DEVILISHLY HIGH INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was one thing the Devil hated it was being roused away
from a good book. He was warming his feet on the hearth and happily
snickering over William Bennett's ``Book of Virtues'' when he heard
a rattling at the gates. Outside, he groaned at the sight of three
well-dressed businessmen shivering in the cold nasty night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you're selling I don't want any,'' the Devil snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to come in,'' said the first businessman, a tall
persuasive fellow. ``We're soul mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't look like my type,'' the Devil replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get to know us,'' said the second businessman, a short
enthusiastic charmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you kill anyone?'' the Devil inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to,'' said the third businessman, a fat boyish
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kidnapping? Rape? Robbery? Assault?'' the Devil rattled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we did was perfectly legal,'' said the enthusiastic
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't waste my time,'' the Devil said, turning away, his tail
superciliously flicking the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' the boyish one pleaded. ``We'll do you proud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got five minutes,'' the Devil relented. ``Demonize
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the lending business,'' said the persuasive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean you helped people get loans?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our way,'' the persuasive one answered. ``I was what was
known as a subprime lender. We arranged loans...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah,'' the Devil interrupted. He knew all about it.
``You go after the poor, the elderly, the sick _ those who can't
get loans anywhere else. These losers have hardly any income but
they own their own home _ and that's what you like. So you tie the
loan to their house, and when the suckers can't come up with the
cash _ Whamo! _ the house is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you were sharp,'' said the persuasive one.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil turned to the enthusiastic businessman. ``Your turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something along the same lines _ only with cars,'' he
said. ``I gave loans to hard-up slobs and took the titles to their
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was your interest rate?'' the Devil wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Georgia, and we could go as high as 300 percent a
year. Pretty tough to meet those payments, so I got myself some
nice cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you, fatso?'' the Devil said to the boyish one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran a rent-to-own business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor folk come in for say, a microwave oven,'' the Devil said,
showing off again. ``Walk out with the thing and pay for it in 12
monthly installments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great for you,'' the Devil added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' the boyish one said. ``Say the microwave normally sold
for $140. By the time the ninnies finished paying me, they'd
coughed up almost $360. I squeezed them for about two and a half
times the going price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So all of you preyed on the poor and desperate,'' the Devil
said. ``You crushed those who were already weak. You made their
financial lives, shall we say, a living hell at your own delicious
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The three businessmen smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil narrowed his horns in concentration. ``Well, boys, he
said at last. ``It ain't murder and it ain't rape _ but it comes
pretty darn close. Come on in and get warm. I'll throw another log
on the fire.''

BEST BUY PLANS EIGHT STORES IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lechmere couldn't make it selling consumer electronics in New
England. Nobody Beats the Wiz got beaten and had to leave town. So
did Fretter and Highland Superstores.
</P>
<P>
   But Best Buy Co., a Minnesota-based chain that has miraculously
revived from a near-death experience two years ago, believes it can
succeed selling TVs, stereo equipment, and household appliances
where other retailers failed.
</P>
<P>
   In looking to challenge Circuit City in this market _ the two
are head-to-head rivals in many parts of the United States _ Best
Buy plans to open eight stores in New England this fall, including
Braintree, Cambridge, Danvers, and Framingham locations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavy casualty list for consumer electronics
retailers, Wall Street seems keen on survivors Best Buy and Circuit
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s and early '90s, a lot of folks went out of
business,'' said Donald I. Trott, an analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, chains including Highland Superstores,
Fretter, Nobody Beats the Wiz, and Lechmere competed in
Massachusetts, creating a glut of stores. Their departures have
left a void that Best Buy sees as an opportunity. Five of its eight
planned locations are sites of these former competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury H. Anderson, Best Buy's president, thinks there's
another reason why his 289-store chain stands out _ Best Buy's
soft-sell approach.
</P>
<P>
   At most electronics chains, staffers work on commission.
</P>
<P>
   The more they sell the more they earn, and the result is often a
high-pressure atmosphere that some consumers, particularly women,
find uncomfortable, Best Buy  &UR;  &LR; said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Best Buy made the radical move of taking its sales
force off commissions and paying either salaries or hourly wages.
Anderson credits the change for fueling the company's explosive
growth. In 1989, sales were just over $500 million. For its most
recent fiscal year, ended in February, sales were $8.4 billion,
about $400 million more than those of Virginia-based Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   The Best Buy formula ``puts &UR;  &LR; the customer in control,'' said
Anderson, and big well-lit stores with high ceilings and plenty of
interactive product displays have found favor with young families,
one of the chain's most important customer groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their self-service, no-hassle store environment has been
incredibly well received by the customer,'' said Beth A. Richard,
an analyst with Everen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-sell approach may have led to explosive growth, but
explosive growth nearly did Best Buy in as new store openings
outstripped the chain's capacity to manage its inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid expansion hurt them,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Best Buy placed a disastrous bet on personal
computers in 1996. Its stores were crammed with PCs at a time when
many consumers were delaying purchases until models with an
upgraded version of the Pentium chip became available.
</P>
<P>
   Left with lots of unsold inventory, Best Buy was forced to slash
prices and ask its vendors for more time to pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to rescue the company, founder and chief executive
Richard M. Schulze brought in Andersen Consulting LLP to help
straighten out the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Together they slowed annual store openings from about 40 to 15
and trimmed inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of stocking 65,000 music CDs, Best Buy now stocks only
40,000, freeing up space for items with higher profit margins &UR;  &LR; such
as digital video disks and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy took a similar approach to VCRs, TVs, and PCs,
narrowing selection to the most profitable models.
</P>
<P>
   If stock price is any guide, Best Buy's turnaround has been
impressive. When adjusted for stock splits, shares that 18 months
ago sold for about 5 are worth nearly 50 today.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares fell 1 5/8 Monday to
close at 49 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   And earnings soared to $94.5 million last year, compared with
$1.7 million for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on the most profitable products and product
categories, ``Best Buy has done all the right things to survive and
thrive in a difficult consumer electronics retail environment,''
said Lehman Brothers junior analyst David Schick.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, the consumer electronics industry has
depended on the hot product. In the 1980s, it was the VCR and the
CD player. In the early 1990s, it was the personal computer and the
satellite TV dish.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, there seems to be no really hot seller, as prices
for everything from 13-inch TVs to many PCs are dipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital video disk players are doing OK,'' said Chuck
Schneider, a partner at Value Added Marketing, a local
representative for consumer electronics manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now, business is soft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business could pick up dramatically as television stations begin
to change over to digital signals, a move that over the next decade
could require consumers to buy either new TV sets or converter
boxes for their old ones.
</P>
<P>
   With its new stores in Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire,
Best Buy seems poised to exploit these new changes in technology,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on track, the chain is accelerating the pace of new store
openings. Soon, New York, Northern California, and the Pacific
Northwest will be about the only places in the country without the
chain's presence.
</P>
<P>
   When its stores open in New England, Best Buy will have nearly
300 stores and revenues that are more than 10 times greater than
what Lechmere ever had. That sheer size may help Best Buy survive
and flourish where others have failed.
</P>
<P>
   In many categories of retail, local markets are coming to be
dominated by two or three major players, analyst Trott noted.
</P>
<P>
   In books, it's Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders. In home repair, it's
Home Depot and Lowe's, a North Carolina chain that has yet to
arrive in Massachusetts. And in consumer electronics, the two big
players may be Best Buy and Circuit City, Trott said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Richard, ``the competition has been thinned out.''

DINO DOINGS DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARK QUARRY, Queensland, Australia _ It was the kind of stampede
that would have baffled even John Wayne. But since it happened 100
million years before his time, give or take a million or two, the
matter is academic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, standing here, you can imagine the Duke trying, doing his
best, to lasso a dinosaur and turn the herd in his inimitable
style, presumably a master in any eon of any beast on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the rumble, the hoofbeats of the ``Great
Dinosaur Stampede,'' in this hot, desolate scrubland where it
happened well before man turned up on the planet. The evidence lies
before you: ``Dino twacks!'' in the immortal vernacular of Bugs
Bunny's pursuer, Elmer Fudd, that befuddled authority on ``wabbit
twacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing them warily, Elmer undoubtedly would cry, ``Dastardly
dino twacks!'' And make twacks himself, lest the awesome creatures
return from the Mid-Cretaceous Period (following the Jurassic of
Spielbergian film fame).
</P>
<P>
   At the foot of Mount Campbell, nothing more than a good-sized
crimson-toned hill, are the footprints of a prehistoric
confrontation and helter-skelter flight. A preserved treasure, they
are protected only by a lonely 20- by 30-yard shed, tin-roofed and
open on all sides, that passes as a museum at the isolated
indentation called Lark Quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' says Paul Neilsen, one of the great guides of the
Outback, ``is what remains of a scary day way, way, way back when.
``Scary for the mob of coelurosars that showed up for a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruddy and compact with neatly trimmed mustache, Neilsen, a
self-sufficient down under-style Marlboro Man whom Wayne would
admire, has worked with herds himself. He adjusts a felt
cattleman's hat, pauses to light a cigarette, then describes the
scene as archeologists have figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to imagine in this bloody dry territory today _ we're in
the midst of a seven-year drought _ but this was a billabong, a
muddy pond in moist, forested country. Maybe a lake. Anyway these
thirsty coelurosars are out on a sandbar when this huge and
ever-hungry carnosaur happens by, and looks dinner in the eye. A
lot of dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly a poultry dinner, although the coelurosars are
lizards that look like fowls, bird-footed like emus, but with
forepaws. Not small. Over three feet tall. But the carnosaur feels
like a fox in the henhouse. Towering more than seven feet, with a
five-foot stride that moves it along at fivem.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at its prints.'' Nearly twofeet in length, they seem huge
maple leaves, fit for even more than Shaquille O'Neal's sneakers,
or any other in the NBA. Size M for mammoth and murder.
</P>
<P>
   It was the malice in the carnosaur's eyes that started the
stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently the terrified smaller animals felt their best
chance,'' says Neilsen, ``was not to flee conventionally. But to go
right at the monster, confuse it by racing past before it could get
its bearings, and turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The splatter of lesser prints are pointed toward, and are on
either side of, the few ominous larger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Neilsen smiles. ``End of story as far as can be determined.
These are the only prints that have been excavated from layers of
mud, sediment, and rock that came later. The first indication of
what lay below was uncovered a few years ago by Glen Seymour, Peter
Knowles, and Ron McKenzie, prospectors digging around for opals.''
</P>
<P>
   They found something else. Priceless, though unmarketable,
unwearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many of the stampeders got away, evaded the
big daddy dino's dinner table. Maybe future excavations will
complete the story. If there are any. Getting money for things like
that out here is difficult. You can see how inadequate, impermanent
this shed is.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Toyota Land Cruiser, the frame-shaking, rump-bumping
ride continues.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hiding anything out here from Paul, wildlife or
topography. His friendship with the territory's ranchers allows him
to enter the vast properties and share seemingly lost valleys,
gorges, and summits with his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Merton Gorge, as seen from a promontory I call ``Neilsen Point''
_ one of a series of mini-buttes _ is a mile-and-a-half wide, and
wriggles 40 miles. Sandstone walls, splashed in pinks and yellows,
join a floor whose patterns of blue and green spinifex grass have a
landscaped appearance. Burned-out patches from bush fires clear the
way for natural renewal. Thanks, Paul says, to the great arsonist
god: ``A benefactor the aborigines call Inuri.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind sounds like an express train traversing Williams
Valley, another breathtaking vista. A 600-square-mile eyeful, 25
miles across, embracing crags, ridges, domes, and hillsides that
are rocky swirls of color _ yellow, mustard, mint, rose, white,
copper. Mount Williams and Mount Booka Dwooka stick their snouts
above all else.
</P>
<P>
   He shows us high-rise housing developments for ants and
termites: rusty four- and five-foot pylons built by the industrious
occupants. And a flat for bats, a narrow, bottomless crevasse that
they never leave. ``Some naturalists say they may be prehistoric
types.''
</P>
<P>
   At Jessamyn Creek, a pair of tall brolgas _ redheaded gray
cranes _ are engaged in a slow, stately, wing-flapping mating
dance. ``Not a bad idea,'' Paul says, winking at my friend Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too hot for mating or dancing,'' she says. ``A swim would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No worries.'' He just happens to know some good old swimming
holes called Honeycomb Wells: dimples in an outcropping filled with
jade-hued water, and shaded by cantheum trees, convenient clothes
racks. ``Take your pick of pools.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains that aborigines use cantheum branches for fishing
purposes. ``You put the branches in the water and they absorb the
oxygen, so the fish have to come to the surface. Easy picking.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's base is his Tattersall Hotel in Winton, a proud
community of 200 on the Matilda Highway, proclaiming itself as the
home of the sparkling new million-dollar Waltzing Matilda Centre.
Probably the only museum in the world dedicated to a song _
Australia's theme, ``Waltzing Matilda,'' written in the
neighborhood by poet Banjo Patterson in 1895 _ it is a worthy
attraction brimming with fascinating audios and visuals.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors along the principal thoroughfare is Searle's, the
52-year-old general store offering ``everything _ and we'll get it
for you if we don't have it,'' according to the boss, Bernie
Searle. ``We rent wedding gowns,'' he says, smiling at Aurelio.
``Used to be good business. But it seems that most couples don't
get married anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Paul's hotel is a local sanctuary (i.e., pub)
where soothing 4X Beer is a foaming hedge against the heat. Genuine
cowboys, drinking and contemplating a sign behind the bar _
``Hangovers Sold and Serviced'' _ loyally wear caps of their
favorite rugby team, the North Queensland Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mark, says they ride herd with motorbikes and
helicopters nowadays, ``But horses are coming back a little because
cows have learned to hide from the choppers and bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's sorry to have missed the dinosaurs and would have
loved to chase them on a motorbike. Maybe after a few more 4Xs.

DAY'S RIDE A FAVORITE ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was hardly spectacular, but 1997 Horse of the Year Favorite
Trick got the job done in the $100,000 Long Branch Stakes at
Monmouth Sunday, winning by a head.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick had not started since running eighth in the
Kentucky Derby, a race that his trainer, Bill Mott, said was an
``ordeal'' for him. Sent off at 1-5 ($2.40 to win), Favorite Trick
encountered unexpected opposition from Tomorrows Cat, an allowance
horse, who duelled with the choice all the way to the wire in the
mile and 1/16th event run in 1:43. Still, a win is a win, and Mott
and Favorite Trick's rider, Pat Day, took it for what it was worth,
especially since Favorite Trick had lost his last two (third in the
Arkansas Derby prior to his poor showing in the Run for the Roses)
after winning the first nine races of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a workmanlike win,'' said Mott. ``He didn't kick away
at the end but the horse knew he had them at all times. He did what
he had to do. That's his temperment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat on him until about the eighth pole,'' said Day,
noted for his patient rides. ``Coming off the corner, I thought
he'd be able to give me a little more. Perhaps, as he gets older,
he'll do what he has to rather than show the flmaboyance he did as
a 2-year-old (when he went 8 for 8). I was never really concerned
the whole race.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Long Branch, Mott indicated that if Favorite Trick
ran well, he would probably take on the heavy hitters in the $1
million Haskell Aug. 9. Whether his performance Sunday earned him a
ticket to Monmouth's richest race remains to be seen as Mott
mentioned the Jim Dandy, also Aug. 9, at Saratoga and the King's
Bishop, a sprint on the undercard of the Aug. 29 Travers Stakes, as
other possibilities for Favorite Trick's next start.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A star at Hollywood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Long Branch was just one of several key races on what was a
busy Sunday for the 3-year-old division.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Park, Old Trieste, a son of A.P. Indy who possess
blinding speed, dominated the $500,000 Swaps Stakes, scoring by 12
lengths at odds of 6-5 ($4.60 to win).
</P>
<P>
   Old Trieste set the pace in the Kentucky Derby before fading to
10th, but there was no falling back in the Swaps, as he blazed
through fractions :23 1/5, :46, 1:09 2/5, and 1:34 1/5 under Chris
McCarron, before stopping the teletimer at 1:47 for 1 1/8 miles.
Old Trieste, who has won four of his nine career starts, came into
the Swaps off an win in the Affirmed Handicap June 21 and he looks
as if he can be a key player in the sophomore ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This colt really has a ton of ability,'' said McCarron. ``I
really liked him last summer when I got on him as a 2-year-old, and
he's just going to get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   At Thistledown, Classic Cat, who was third in the Preakness and
eighth in the Belmont, captured the $300,000 Ohio Derby under Shane
Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Away at 2-1 ($6.20 to win), Classic Cat, whose biggest previous
win had come in the Lexington at Keeneland in April, outfinished
One Bold Stroke to win by a nose in the time of 1:49 1/5 for 1 1/8
miles. ``My colt has had a plethora of foot problems but,
obviously, he didn't have them today,'' said trainer David Cross.
``I don't think he's a Victory Gallop or a Real Quiet, but he is a
nice horse capable of winning a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In other 3-year-old races of note, Parade Ground, sixth in the
Derby and fourth in the Belmont, took Belmont's version of the
Lexington Stakes, running 10 furlongs on the turf in 2 minutes 4/5
with Mike Smith aboard; while Arches Bay annexed the Prince of
Wales at Fort Erie. Arches Bay, who previously won the Queen's
Plate, can win Canada's Triple Crown if he can seize the Breeders'
Chamionship at Woodbine next month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pick me a winner
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An all-time record of $3,869,771 was wagered on Hollywood Park's
guaranteed $1.5 million Pick 6 Saturday, breaking the mark of
$3,342,371 set June 14 when Hollywood offered a guaranteed $1
million Pick 6. Saturday's Pick 6 pool helped boost the overall
handle at Hollywood to $18,994,274, a track record except for
Breeders' Cup and Triple Crown race days. If you're wondering how
the guaranteed Pick 6, which produced 28 winning tickets worth
$77,221.20 each, affected buinsess, the handle was up 74 percent
from the corresponding date in 1997 ... Event of the Year, an
undefeated son of Seattle Slew and the one who would have been
favored in the Kentucky Derby had he not suffered a knee injury,
will now be trained by Richard Mandella. Event of the Year suffered
a slab fracture after winning the Jim Beam March 29 and has been
recovering since corrective surgery was performed. He was formerly
trained by Jerry Hollendorfer. Event of the Year will join
Mandella's powerful barn for the upcoming Del Mar meeting, but no
date has been set for a possible return ... On Saturday, Skip Away
worked out for the first time since winning the Hollywood Gold Cup
June 28, going a 1/2-mile in :47 under regular rider Jerry Bailey
at Belmont. ``He was so tired after California that we wanted to
rest him a little,'' said trainer Sonny Hine. ``Now, we'll go to
Saratoga and get ready for the Iselin (at Monmouth Aug. 30).''
Saratoga officials are hoping that Skip Away will work out between
races for The Spa crowd on either Aug. 15 or 16.

ICY FIELDS, WARM MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA ICEFIELDS, Alberta _ Some vacations delight you, amaze
you, or dazzle your senses. Others allow you to learn, to
participate, or even to grow. And then there are those that enrich
your life and fill your soul.
</P>
<P>
   The journey I made with my wife and two children from Calgary to
Edmonton _ via the Rocky Mountain towns of Banff and Jasper, which
lie at the two ends of the perfectly named Icefields Highway _ was
one of those rare trips that accomplished it all.
</P>
<P>
   That was partly because of the stunning sights we took in,
particularly the majestic Canadian Rockies and the magical ice
fields tucked within them. The ice fields, consisting of a huge
sheet of permafrost that's 1,200 feet deep at some points, flow
into the towering, centuries-old Athabasca Glacier, itself an
imposing and awesome vision.
</P>
<P>
   More on these marvels of nature later, though. Because there was
also another reason, beyond the physical splendor that (gently)
assaulted us at every turn, that made this vacation stand out:
During its course, we met relatives who, until recently, we had
thought did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Any visit with your kin has a particular dynamic of its own, of
course, and meeting new people invariably enhances a vacation if
you turn out to like them. The experience of finding a new family
of Pertmans contained a unique element, however, since I grew up
believing that the only people with my last name to have survived
the Holocaust were my parents and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, everywhere my older brother has traveled during his
adult years, he has opened the local phone book to look for
Pertmans; I have frequently done the same. My other siblings, a
sister and another brother, simply assumed that they had received
an accurate recounting of history from my parents _ who apparently
didn't know of their error _ and that any search efforts inevitably
would prove futile.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, while fiddling with a friend's new home
computer, she suggested we do a ``people find.'' That's a service
in which you simply type in a name, and the software amazingly
conducts a search through phone books, business directories, and
other sources everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I typed in Pertman and, a short while later, a name came up in
Canada. After the shock wore off, I dialed his number. A few
minutes of chatting with David Pertman, in Calgary, revealed that
he knew my father's brother back in their neighboring hometowns in
Poland; after a few more calls in the following weeks, we figured
out that David was my father's second cousin.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that David had two sons in Edmonton, one of whom
had two children and the other of whom had three. In subsequent
conversations, I discovered David had a batch of nephews and nieces
in Israel as well, most of them Pertmans. Extraordinarily, in a
second's time, I was catapulted from the isolated sense of being
part of an endangered species to the overwhelming realization that
I belonged to a thriving clan.
</P>
<P>
   So my wife, Judy, and I planned a trip to Western Canada to
coincide with a decidedly family-oriented occasion, the bar mitzvah
of one of David's grandsons. Given the spectacular locales we
intended to visit, it promised to be a multitiered adventure. And
so it was.
</P>
<P>
   We flew into Calgary, the capital of the province of Alberta and
a charming city best known for its annual Stampede. It's an
elaborate, prestigious rodeo/spectacle that began in 1912 to
celebrate and cash in on Calgary's cowboy-rancher heritage, and
which draws a million observers and participants annually from all
over the world today.
</P>
<P>
   So much of what's written about Calgary centers on the Stampede,
which takes place each July, that one might be tempted to think
that there's little else of interest in the city. But one would be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finding good music (we happened to arrive in time
for a jazz festival) and excellent restaurants), we also enjoyed
Calgary's extensive gardens, watched a bit of cricket in Riley
Park, rode up the elevator of the downtown space needle to take in
the view from the observation deck, and enthralled our 4-year-old
(OK, and ourselves, too) with an afternoon trek around the Calgary
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was certainly Zack's highlight, partly because he got to
feed his first elephant, but mostly because it contains an
impressive and expansive section that re-creates our planet when it
was inhabited by dinosaurs. And they're full size.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Canadian cities, Calgary also offers a wide selection
of indoor activities like climbing structures and play spaces.
That's because so much of the year is bone-chilling cold that
spending time outdoors can be difficult, unless, of course, you
partake of the first-rate skiing, of which there's quite a lot
within a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was during our second day in Calgary, after we left the zoo
and before we ventured through Calaway Park _ an Old West theme
park with rides _ that we drove to the home of David and Ida
Pertman.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a lovely residential portion of the city, and they
greeted us warmly. He was the reticent one, as is my father; she,
like my mother, was the talker and recollector. They are not only
of a generation but of a type; hey, I thought, they could even be
related.
</P>
<P>
   We ate fresh fruit together at their kitchen table, discussed
mutual roots, and learned details about their postwar odyssey from
Poland to Israel to Canada, in a route and timetable almost
identical to the one that took my parents and their children to
Baltimore in December 1958. Yet, somehow, the two Pertman families
had never crossed paths.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon together ended with hugs and promises to see each
other later in the week in Edmonton, where David's two sons live
and where one of their sons was to celebrate his bar mitzvah. I was
eager to meet the rest of my relatives, but I wanted to keep to our
schedule of driving with Judy, Zack, and Emmy the long way, through
the mountains and with lots of stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Patience certainly has its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, the main highway transforms into a spectacularly
scenic roadway as it approaches the entrance to the massive western
national park system. Soaring mountains rise from every direction,
some still capped with snow in the heat of June, others topped with
natural formations that look like ethereal carvings of castles,
animals, and undefinable shapes that would otherwise appear only in
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Banff, our first stop within the park, is a community surrounded
by as much controversy as beauty. The Canadian federal government
wants to tightly restrict growth there, while most residents and
business-people favor some controlled expansion to accommodate the
intensifying avalanche of tourists who roll into town from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the argument, Banff already has evolved during the
last 20 years from a relatively quiet mountain retreat frequented
mainly by vacationing Canadians into an Aspen-like destination for
all who can afford to come, complete with rows of fine shops and
restaurants.

   TAKE-BOS  
 COLUMBIA ICEFIELDS, Alberta: ... and restaurants.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That said, it's a wonderful place to be, and growth so far has
been closely regulated. No building stands over two stories high,
and most hotels, restaurants, and stores remain on the small side,
aren't branches of international chains, and retain a local charm
and character.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and the whole place is in an exquisite setting that
will take your breath away.
</P>
<P>
   During the lengthy winter season, it's a haven for skiers. The
rest of the year, it's a glorious area in which to hike, walk, ride
horses, take in an outdoor concert or play, hop onto a ski gondola
to the top of a mountain for a view that flows from your eyes to
your spirit, stop in for a decadent, luscious afternoon tea at the
sprawling, castlelike Banff Springs Hotel, or take some photos of a
herd of wild horned sheep as they stroll a few feet from your car
on a winding mountain road.
</P>
<P>
   Even with two small children in tow, there was plenty of
accessible outdoor activity in Banff, so it would have been easy to
stroll and roll (Emmy's baby carriage, that is) for several more
days there. We wanted to get to Edmonton in time for the family
event, though, so we moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop, less than an hour's drive up the Icefields
Highway, was Lake Louise. Lakes abound in the region, each more
serene and picturesque than the last; some abut the numerous
campgrounds within the vast national park.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lake Louise, though, that has developed into a tourist
mecca, and for good reason. Its inviting blue-green water seems to
shift color with your every movement, and its tranquillity is
disturbed only by soft waves induced by the oars of rented canoes.
Hikers weave their way through the trees that blanket the
surrounding mountains, while an occasional rock climber makes his
way up the imposing Mount Victoria at the lake's end.
</P>
<P>
   What a scene. You could spend a whole vacation basking in the
beauty of Lake Louise and partaking of its outdoor pleasures (and,
unless you want to commute from Banff or a campground, you would
probably stay at Chateau Lake Louise, a grand hotel that
monopolizes one edge of the water).
</P>
<P>
   But again, we were on a tight schedule, so we spent only a few
hours and then piled back into our Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   (It's worth noting that we arranged to pick up the rental car at
the airport in Calgary and to drop it off in Edmonton, where we
would catch our plane home. Most airlines charge no more for such
``open-jaw'' tickets that allow you to arrive in one place and
leave from another, and some auto-rental agencies don't impose fees
for dropping off their cars in another city.)
</P>
<P>
   If we had it to do over again, the next phase of our trip would
last a full day instead of a few hours. The Icefields Highway,
often impassable in winter because of human-height snow, is a
nonstop picture-postcard when the weather's good. Which means that
the mountains, the lakes, the valleys, the orchids, the sheep and
deer and moose at the side of the road (and walking into the road)
all beckon you to stop and take a photo, or just stop and take a
long breath.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped several times, but would have allotted far more time
for a leisurely drive had we known what awaited us beforehand. No
loud complaints, however; a taste of paradise turns out to be more
fulfilling than teasing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of paradise: The advertisements for the Columbia
Icefields show a huge bus with oversized tires moving tourists onto
the ice that runs into the glacier, along with the slogan, ``How To
See Heaven Frozen Over.''
</P>
<P>
   The copywriters can be accused of only slight hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Just staring at this natural marvel _ and you do find yourself
staring _ is almost satisfying enough. But the real jolt comes from
paying your $20, riding onto the icefield on one of those huge
buses, and then walking around for a half-hour in a pristine
setting that probably looks about the same as it did during the
last ice age.
</P>
<P>
   The tours operate from May through mid-October from a roadside
facility opposite the ice fields, which are one of the world's
largest nonpolar ice masses and which draw their water at the
intersection of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Antarctic oceans. Hiking
is permitted throughout the area, but serious accidents have been
reported, so those who want to venture far or high are advised to
do so only with guides.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 120 miles from Banff to this idyllic spot, and
another 60 miles or so to our next destination. The small town of
Jasper, at the other end of the highway, looks much as Banff
probably did two decades ago; that is, it's less developed, less
slick, and offers fewer amenities.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Jasper a very appealing place to lounge.
Except that there's too much to do, like hiking some more, taking
another gondola to another magnificent peak for another awesome
vista, and strolling around one of the local lakes. We even found a
lake that has a small, pretty beach on one of its shores and has
been landscaped for wheelchair access, which means we could walk
its entire perimeter with a baby carriage.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous body of water around Jasper is Lake Maligne,
about a half-hour's ride from town and well worth the detour. Boat
trips are available at all the hotels and at the lake itself, and
they invariably advertise that they stop at ``Spirit Island.'' It
turns out that ``Spirit Island'' is a dot of land just yards from
shore, but it's alluring and evocative and aptly named: The story
goes that a photographer long ago described the tiny island as the
soul of the Canadian Rockies and said it moved his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Our reluctance to leave Jasper and its environs was subsumed by
my desire to get to Edmonton, so we headed out after just a couple
of days. Our driving tour of Alberta was nearing an end, but the
prospect of meeting new Pertmans negated any sense of
disappointment about leaving nirvana behind.
</P>
<P>
   Since scores of other bar mitzvah guests also had descended on
their homes from out of town, David's two son's (my third cousins)
Asher and Wayne were distracted and apologized for not giving us
more time. But their interest in meeting us, getting to know us,
and learning about our extended family was evident, and they proved
to be generous and warm hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, their children _ who weren't encumbered by
entertaining duties _ turned out to be wonderful people who were
friendly, curious, and enthusiastic about their new cousins.
Asher's sons, 13-year-old Jeremy and his 11-year-old brother,
Tyler, had a ball with Zack, who is 4; and Wayne's three
college-age children, Shea, Justin, and Quinn, not only glommed
onto our kids but also took us around the city and into their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to explain why it matters so much to discover new
relatives, especially ones who live so far away that regular
contact will be difficult. When you grow up with very little
family, somehow, its value and meaning become magnified. When you
have believed all your life that your bloodline was nearly severed
in war, the sentiment grows exponentially. And the fantasy of
long-lost relatives evolves into something so elusive that its
attainment takes on an importance unconnected to reason.
</P>
<P>
   So Edmonton, a lovely city with lots to do and see, for me has
primarily become the home of most of the ``other Pertmans.'' One
day, with a bit of luck, perhaps I'll feel the same way about an
Israeli city or two.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens here on in, I know this much already: I
invested a fair amount of time, effort, money, and emotional
capital to travel around the province of Alberta, Canada, with my
family. And I returned a richer man.

SUMMER SENDS GERALDINE FERRARO A WAKE-UP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ These are the dog days of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are closed. People are off on long-awaited vacations.
Entire industries lie dormant in the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   It's axiomatic, for example, that no book editor ever bought a
manuscript between Memorial Day and Labor Day. That's why most
other states hold their primary elections in the spring, before
public attention to politics wanes on languid, sun-splashed summer
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Not in New York, though. Here, in the home of the most
exclusionary election code in America, primary elections are held
in September, when voters are concerned mostly with their fading
tans. They're not yet focused on the troublesome business of
electing people to govern them.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, the September primary was the product of good
government impulses. The idea allegedly was to shorten the campaign
season for the general election in November. As a practical matter,
though, professional politicians have understood for three-quarters
of a century that most people ignore politics until after the World
Series. Therefore, a September primary discourages turnout and
lengthens the odds that party professionals can hand-select their
candidates for November before a politically anorexic public is
ready to digest news about the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is Geraldine Ferraro's problem. She came
into this primary election for the Democratic Party's nomination
for U.S. senator a huge favorite, largely on the strength of her
high name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman to run for vice president. Who doesn't remember
her?
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, New York City Public Advocate Mark Green and Rep.
Charles E. Schumer are known mainly in the five boroughs. Green did
run for U.S. senator more than a decade ago, but his losing
presence on a statewide ballot was less memorable than Ferraro's
losing presence on a national ballot a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   So most New York Democrats knew who she was, and a good many
Democrats _ mainly upstaters _ didn't know who they were. A decided
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But name recognition is only half the battle _ the most
expensive half, to be sure, but only half nonetheless. And with
more than $7 million in his piggy bank, Schumer can buy that with
TV advertising. He's already doing that, in fact. By the time Sept.
15 rolls around, Schumer will be as familiar to Democrats in the
state as the Budweiser frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's problem is finding a way to offer only faintly
interested Democratic voters something more than a familiar name
and a lead in the polls. Thus far, she hasn't managed that.
</P>
<P>
   What's the rationale for her candidacy, her opponents demand?
It's a question that ignores that her rationale is identical to
theirs _ namely, that she wants desperately to knock off incumbent
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, just as Schumer and Green do.
</P>
<P>
   But the question itself is beginning to give Ferraro's opponents
what she already had coming into this thing _ name recognition.
And, given her opening advantage, it's a question to which she
needs to supply an answer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent public poll on the issue, Ferraro's
lead over Schumer has narrowed from 23 points to only 10 _ in just
the past month. Green is now within 15 points of her, and primary
day is seven long weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she apparently won't be able to raise the advertising
money that Schumer already has in his pocket. Ferraro fund-raising
has been less than impressive.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Geraldine Ferraro ran and lost on a national ticket. But,
like Chuck Schumer, she has never been elected in anything larger
than a congressional district. And during this year's dog days her
opponents are nipping ever closer to her heels.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up call, Ms. Ferraro.

CAPITAL OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two cities obsessed with sex and politics,
Washington and San Francisco couldn't be more different. Just ask a
San Franciscan who moved to Washington to lobby for gay and lesbian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, Washington is a Southern town loaded
with transient politicians. San Francisco is a cosmopolitan village
burdened with permanent politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has a mass transit system that works well as long as
you don't want to go to Georgetown. San Francisco has Muni, which
works as long as you don't want to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians eat lunch in smoke-filled steakhouses
like the Palm. San Francisco's politician _ there's only one _ eats
at a smoke-free French bistro, Le Central. He gets all the red meat
he wants eating flunkies alive.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha male Washington pols hide their girlfriends. The alpha
male San Francisco pol has his picture taken with a different
beautiful woman every night. None turns into an ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is hot and muggy. When it's hot in San Francisco,
it's a dry heat. It's the difference between hell and a living
hell.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hell, a lot of people in Washington think gays are
going straight there.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is its own little world,'' said Rebecca Isaacs,
political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``What you call controversies in San Francisco are laughable. It's
so mean here.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, politics is mean in San Francisco, but it's strictly
personal, between people who claim to believe in the same things.
It doesn't have that feeling of religious war which has swept
Washington lately.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are trying to get their right-wing voters to the
polls in the November elections by attacking gays, in concert with
a series of national ads saying gays can become straight by finding
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy probably will blow up. Surveys show that most
Americans support equality for gays in employment and spousal
benefits for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong libertarian, live-and-let-live streak in this
country that isn't always evident in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When I met Isaacs at her office in a Washington residential
neighborhood, she had just come from a debate on Fox News with
Peter LaBarbera, who publishes an anti-gay newsletter called the
Lambda Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me a paranoid conspiracy theorist. He called me a
Marxist-Leninist,'' said Isaacs, who kept shaking her head at the
charges. Later she said, ``It was so ludicrous, it wasn't
upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that does upset her: ``The debate starts from such a
right-wing position here you wouldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe debates start to the left in San Francisco, but no one
says you have to be saved from heterosexuality. No one says you can
find salvation as a Democrat by accepting Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right wing is desperately trying to restigmatize gays _
there really is no other group you can attack with impunity,''
Isaacs said. She was outraged that the right wing was trying to
cast itself as victims of gays, who allegedly trample the religious
and free-speech rights of straights.
</P>
<P>
   Straight-bashing _ America's biggest hate crime. Hey, not even
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs says she tries not to turn this into a war against
fundamentalists, and doesn't use that term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I either stick with `right wing,' `religious right' or
`extremist right.' I stay away from criticizing religion. Religion
is a good thing. This is all politics.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she came up with a line recently: ``We're rededicating
ourselves to the proposition that we're all created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   It has a nice, emancipatory sound. That line probably would work
outside of San Francisco, maybe even Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to one of the great things about San
Francisco, as Isaacs sees it: ``I think it was the kind of strength
I got in San Francisco, the kind of self-confidence I got in being
who I am, that allows me to do the work I do in Washington, to be
who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're not going to become an ex-gay?'' asked her
co-worker, Tracey Conaty.
</P>
<P>
   No way. Isaacs said she and her partner are rearing a
3-year-old. ``I have a child who has a wonderful life, two fabulous
mommies, and I don't want anything to hurt that.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that has always struck me about fanatical members of
the religious right is that they seem unduly interested in sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obsessed with sex,'' Isaacs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk more about sex than we do,'' said Conaty, joking on
behalf of the allegedly sex-crazed gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Washington right-wingers probably think more about sex than even
Bill Clinton, or all of San Francisco combined. After all, in San
Francisco, we're more obsessed with food.
</P>
<P>
   It's healthier than worrying about what strangers do in bed.
</P>

WEATHER, WEATHER EVERYWHERE

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The weather is getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean El Nino, the heat wave in Texas or even global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   I mean our obsession with ``the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Because we have satellites, balloons and state-of-the-art gauges
for wind and rain, because we can see systems and fronts coming at
us from thousands of miles away, because meteorologists are now as
common as clouds, you would think we invented weather.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, we behave as though all this information means we should
have control when Mother Nature starts kicking butt.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a lot of weather information now acts like a bad
prescription drug _ the kind that ends up aggravating the very
condition it's supposed to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Why do people want to know what the weather might be? So we can
be prepared. With umbrellas and new windshield wiper blades. With
lightweight clothing and salt tablets. With fresh drinking water in
our basement if we live in tornado country. With a high place to
store our keepsakes if we live on a flood plain. With plywood for
our windows if hurricanes or typhoons come our way.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation is supposed to make us feel more secure. But tune
into any weather forecast. Television, commercial radio, citizens
band, network, cable or local. They're all some variation on
Chicken Little.
</P>
<P>
   The sky is falling _ or it could _ so stay tuned to us forever
lest you be caught unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as a fairly typical July heat wave began to inundate
the San Francisco Bay area, the No. 1 news story on local TV
stations was the weather. No one had died of it and it was nowhere
near the severity of the awful (but not unprecedented) heat wave in
Texas. But that was no reason to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger!'' and ``Be prepared!'' was everyone's message. One
station featured a paramedic ticking off the signs of and ways to
avoid heat stroke. (``If you pass out, you definitely should call
us.'')
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens these days, the top of the news offered a
brief appearance by each meteorologist. Whenever the slightest
variation in weather occurs, meteorologists are used like scantily
clad girls who stand in front of strip joints _ just a little
teaser to hook customers into investing in the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when I was visiting in the Midwest, a storm front
came in one evening. No matter which TV station my parents were
watching, warnings scrolled across the bottom of the screen or
flashed in little squares at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thunderstorm Watch!'' ``Thunderstorm Warning!'' ``Tornado
Watch!''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 60 channels, it was difficult to tell which
county or region was under threat for what.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait for someone to show a map,'' my mother said.
``We go through this all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus my parents bought a radio that has its own weather warning
band. Just as we were sitting down to dinner, it emitted a hideous
``weeeaahhhh'' which prompted my dad to fetch it from the bedroom
and put it on the kitchen table. (Bon appetit.)
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly a voice broke through to warn of high winds and
thunderstorms. No kidding. One look outside at the whipping trees
and roiling gray sky told me that.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm came, no amount of preparation could change the
fact that it was scary. Next morning, there were power lines down
all over town. Scores of maples and sycamores were pulled right out
of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no tornado _ the meteorologists' predictions were
correct _ but winds gusting up to 80 mph made that a technical
detail for many folks. Not to mention the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Three people I know did get hurt; they received mild burns when
lightning struck their outdoor yard lights and traveled through the
line into their den.
</P>
<P>
   Find me the satellite that could have warned them about that.

EX-BEACH BOY STILL CREATES POETRY AT THE PIANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It was a poetic moment.
</P>
<P>
   While representatives of the MTV Networks were presenting their
goods to television critics, outside the packed room there was the
faint, lovely sounds of a piano.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist was Brian Wilson, the former Beach Boy who along the
way may have lost his band, two brothers and some of the sweetness
of his voice, but not his musical genius.
</P>
<P>
   Most people didn't hear him, focusing instead on MTV's
presentation of ``TV Land'' _ a channel that will market nostalgia
to baby-boomers. But when he walked in, there was a reverent hush.
It's natural. His music has spanned generations, and in his current
fragile condition, he inspires compassion.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when people fawn over youngsters like Bob Dylan's son,
real genius is often overlooked. Fortunately, Wilson is getting his
due. He's been the focus of several television biographies,
including Don Was' ``I Just Wasn't Meant for These Times.'' A
feature film is being made about his life. The Bare Naked Ladies
group has a song with the refrain, ``Laying in bed/Just like Brian
Wilson did,'' and now VH1 is adding to the list with ``Endless
Harmony: The Beach Boys and Their Music,'' a documentary scheduled
to air Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Their music, of course, was Wilson's music. The others could
sing and play their instruments, but Wilson was the core and his
invention in the studio created the layered sound-and-harmonies
that defined the band's sound.
</P>
<P>
   Any Beach Boys story starts and ends with Wilson. And it's been
a long, strange trip. His primary battles have been with an
overbearing father, drug addiction and mental breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1977 to 1979, I had an emotional breakdown and I didn't
think I was ever going to get out of it,'' he says. ``I was pretty
low down. Pretty low.''
</P>
<P>
   These days he walks slowly and projects a childlike innocence.
And when he speaks, his words lack all irony. When asked when he
first realized his music was being taken seriously, he responds:
``I think it started with `Pet Sounds,' when I was considered a
genius by Phil Spector.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, of course. ``Pet Sounds'' is a landmark album and
Spector, who influenced Wilson and served as inspiration, really
did believe that. But Wilson didn't say those words with arrogance.
It's as if he doesn't have that kind of emotional shading anymore.
He just says what he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is healthy, Wilson says: ``Oh, yeah. I could run
right down there, run right back here real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody laughed. But he didn't say it as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has a new album out now called ``Imagination,'' his
second solo album since his self-titled effort a decade earlier. He
was asked whether the project put him on an emotional roller
coaster. ``Oh, boy. Well, this roller coaster's been going one way
since the early '60s, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, everyone laughed. But, again, Wilson didn't say it as a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a man who says that his life was changed in 1964 because
the Christmas carol ``Joy to the World'' _ in his words _ ``bent me
out of shape a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, my whole life was given over to God as soon as I
heard that,'' he said. ``So in a way I can't be blamed for being a
little more sensitive than usual, because I gave half my life to
God and the other half to try to be a human being, so it's been
tough for me in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of anybody else's mouth, that might have sounded sarcastic,
or funny or self-mocking. But Brian Wilson meant every word of it.
And it was incredibly sad.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to realize then that though his handlers and even
Wilson himself say he's strong and fine, he's not really. He's
still emotionally wobbly. He thinks and speaks and interacts just a
little differently. But he's still here, he's still making music.
And when he puts his hands on the piano, there's always the
possibility that through his sensitivity and sweetness, he's still
got a pipeline into the brilliance that was ``Pet Sounds.''

LATE HONORS FOR AN ADMIRAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Admiral William Brown was an Irish emigrant and
one-time Boston resident who founded the Argentinian navy in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires, he has streets, buildings, squares and parks
named after him.
</P>
<P>
   And he's a source of pride in his hometown of Foxford, Ireland,
where his fans hope to build a naval museum (albeit 17 miles
inland) to their native son.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston, Bill Brown doesn't even register on the scale of
famous people who slept here. A few days ago, City Hall officials
said they were not familiar with Brown. But Monday after brushing
up on his history, Mayor Thomas M. Menino decided to accept a
bronze bust of the long-departed admiral with a hearty thanks and a
nagging uncertainty about what he would do with the patinized puss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Monday night, the mayor was scheduled to take stewardship of
the bust aboard the Argentine tall ship ARA Libertad, slated to
join in a salute to the USS Constitution later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The intended ceremony came as a victory for Marian Trench, 27,
of Ireland, a manager of the Foxford Admiral Brown Society that is
trying to spread the word about the Irish-American-Argentinian
naval hero.
</P>
<P>
   Trench and the bronze of the admiral came to Boston Sunday in
the wake _ literally _ of the Libertad. She hopes to educate public
and private minds here about a Bostonian, albeit only briefly a
Bostonian, who went on to a brilliant naval career south of the
equator.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertad is one of nine tall ships and nine modern warships
from seven countries that will pay tribute Thursday to the USS
Constitution, which later this week will be celebrating the 200th
anniversary of its first sail.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, celebration eve, Libertad will sponsor an
``Irish Night'' of song and dance to raise money for the Foxford
Admiral Brown Society and the museum that the small town in County
Mayo, Ireland, hopes to build someday.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Javier Armando Valladares, second-in-command of the
Libertad, holds high regard for Brown, whose portrait hangs
prominently between two portholes in the vessel's stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very big in Argentina, very famous. I think much more so
than here in Boston,'' Valladares said. No doubt this is partly
because Brown was only 9 years old when he lived here, making no
historical impression _ or any impression at all _ during his stay.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1777, Brown emigrated with his father to Boston in 1786.
This is pretty much all that's known about the Boston angle,
according to the Foxford Admiral Brown Society. The lad next popped
up on the record as a cabin boy in the American merchant marine in
1797 when he was kidnapped by the British to fight the French at
sea. A few captures and escapes later, Brown ventured to what is
now Buenos Aires to set up a trading business in the Spanish
colony.
</P>
<P>
   When rebellion against Spain broke out in 1810, Brown deftly
boarded a Spanish warship and commandeered it to win the first
skirmish of a revolution that eventually won independence for
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   His expertise as a naval commander was knowing when to fight and
when to withdraw and wait for a better opportunity. In a later
conflict, Brown, with 11 vessels, vanquished a Brazilian fleet of
31 ships.
</P>
<P>
   He is the stuff of legend in Argentina, as is his daughter
Elisa, who committed suicide by walking into the sea when her
husband, a naval captain, died in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he is not sure as yet what to do with the bust,
which easily would fit into an orange crate. Boston already has one
public tribute to an Argentinian, a statue of one Domingo Faustino
Sarmiento, a 19th century politician, bequeathed to the
Commonwealth Avenue Mall as a thank-you from Argentina for creating
the excellent American school system (150 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brown was not a quick sell to the mayor or other City Hall
officials, in part because he has the name recognition of a Doe or
Jones. Another reason is that the bust is heavy _ about one-third
Trench's weight; she got tired of carrying him on the subway.
Raising world awareness for the admiral is no junket, she pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hefty. But he is going to look very nice in some pocket
of the city someday,'' Trench explained Monday, gently brushing
wisps of styrofoam packing material from the admiral's visage.

AS PRODUCTION OUTSTRIPS DEMAND, OIL PRICES KEEP FALLING

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AHMADI, Kuwait _ The last time oil prices were lower than now,
Grand Funk Railroad was on top of the music charts, bell bottoms
were in, and Watergate was engulfing Richard Nixon's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The reason prices are at 1973 levels, industry specialists say,
can be summed up in one word: overproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Persian Gulf, which holds more than 40 percent of
the world's known oil reserves, companies have been overproducing
crude for months, pushing prices lower and lower.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the price for benchmark Arab light crude dipped
to under $11 a barrel. That represents a more than 40 percent drop
in six months and a dramatically more precipitous drop when
compared with the high of $41 a barrel just before the 1991 Gulf
War. With prices adjusted for inflation, experts say, the price of
crude is lower than any &UR;  &LR; time since the summer of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting price of crude has been followed by tumbling
gasoline prices. At most US self-service pumps this week regular
unleaded gasoline was about $1 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to the good old days on gas prices,'' says
Hani Iskinder, Chevron's manager for the Persian Gulf. ``It may be
bad for oil companies, but it's great for American consumers. And
it has a positive effect on the American economy, helping to keep
the 1990s boom going.''
</P>
<P>
   Two main factors are at work here, industry experts say: a drop
in demand caused by economic crises in the former ``tiger''
economies of Asia, and a sharp increase in supply caused by OPEC
overproduction and the oil-for-food agreement between Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the price drop lie in the blistering desert
terrain of oilfields such as Kuwait's Burgan Sands, in Ahmadi, 24
miles south of Kuwait City. On a recent afternoon here, with
temperatures over 115 degrees, a maze of pipes flowing with crude
stretched for miles across the desert. Orchards of 10-foot-high
pumping stations known in the industry as ``Christmas trees''
sprouted from the sand for as far as the eye could see. On the
distant horizon refineries spit orange flames into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   This furiously pumping field, and others like it in Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, are producing more
oil than ever, and they're doing it more efficiently. Using
high-tech exploration and improved drilling and extraction
techniques, companies are drawing more barrels a day than ever out
of vast reserves that lie like sunken black pools of treasure
beneath the desert landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And with the recession in Asia creating less demand for all this
oil, experts say, most OPEC countries are cheating on quotas that
are spelled out in the complex agreements that hold together the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The 11 member
countries produce the oil beyond their quotas to make up for the
cheaper price. It is a spiral that forces prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The Burgan Sands of Kuwait, which produce more than half of
Kuwait's 2.2 million barrels a day, form the world's second-largest
oil field, invaded by neighboring Iraq in August 1990. After the
Gulf War, as Iraqi troops retreated in February 1991, they set
these oil fields ablaze. The rusted and burned-out remains of Iraqi
tanks and troop carriers can still be seen along the roadside.
Kuwait, along with international teams of firefighters, had to
fight for months to put out the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the war has had profound consequences for the
world oil market, some of them leaving Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein with the last laugh as he squeezes his neighbors' oil
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem that falling crude prices would hurt
Hussein's Iraq as much as other producers, there is another side to
the UN oil-for-food deal, experts say. After Hussein backed down
from his saber-rattling earlier this year, UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan granted a huge increase in the revenue ceiling for Iraqi
exports to $5.2 billion from $2 billion every six months. That
dumps some 2 million barrels a day on the world market without
regard to price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the UN foolishly based the ceiling on revenue instead
of volume, the program is a market wrecker,'' stated the June 22
lead editorial in the respected industry publication Oil and Gas
Journal. ``The lower prices go, the more Iraq produces in pursuit
of the revenue cap, feeding a surplus and weakening prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting what he wants. His neighbors are frantically
slashing production in defense of crude values. Their revenues are
plummeting. Their populations are getting restive. No one should
doubt that Hussein is cunning enough to have pulled this off,'' the
editorial stated.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the answers also lie beyond the Persian Gulf. The
industry has changed profoundly since the days in the 1970s and
'80s when OPEC could wield its might and create oil shocks that
seemed to portend ever higher prices. Today, oil is coming into the
market from every corner of the globe, including Venezuela, Mexico,
the North Sea, and Indonesia. And more exploration is going on
around the Caspian Sea and offshore West Africa. This
diversification weakens OPEC's ability to send prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of OPEC may well be over,'' says Chuck VanAllen, vice
president of Saudi Arabian Texaco Inc. ``We are looking at the new
world order in the global oil markets where the Saudis, the
Venezuelans, and (non-OPEC member) Mexico will be the major
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have even suggested that a clandestine movement is
afoot to create a group of producers to guide world prices led by
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi. Remarks made by Naimi in a
June 26 Wall Street Journal article fueled such speculation. The
interview also provided a candid admission by Naimi that OPEC does
not have great credibility in its recent promise to cut up to 2.5
million barrels a day from the world production of 73 million
barrels a day. Critics say OPEC's promises are too little too late,
and that reserves have grown so large that even if OPEC did live up
to its promise, the cuts would have no impact for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the price collapse has cost OPEC's members
an estimated $45 billion in lost revenue, roughly one-third of
their total income, with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Eliyahu Kanovsky, one of the world's leading experts on oil,
predicted the collapse of oil prices in a series of research papers
for The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s and '80s there were ``lots of doomsday
predictions that the oil cartels would take over the world, but
I've always been skeptical,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices of oil dropped equally low in 1986, he says,
they recovered within weeks, whereas this slump has seen a steady
and rapid decline for six months. And OPEC's promises to cut
production have done little to improve the market. This is proof,
he says, that we are down to the underlying or ``fundamental
price'' of oil.
</P>
<P>
   But Ann-Louise Hittle, chief researcher on world oil for the
consultancy group Cambridge Energy Research Associates of
Massachusetts, cautions: ``If you wait long enough every forecast
in oil comes around. It is a very volatile commodity. But it is
certainly true that we have an overabundance of supply and a
dramatic drop in world demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hittle points out that ``largely due to the Asian economic
crisis,'' the growth in demand for oil dropped 50 percent in 1998,
down to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kanovsky maintains that falling oil prices will increase
instability in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. ``But it
will also have a ripple effect in more diversified economies like
Egypt, which relies on oil for about 40 percent of exports, and
Syria, which relies on it for about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous drop. Some countries can cope with it, some
cannot. Saudi Arabia, for example, is going to have problems,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 25 years, the Gulf states have resolved domestic
problems _ such as the lack of democracy and the violation of human
rights _ by throwing petro dollars at its citizens in the form of
free health care, housing, and the promise of jobs. The price
crisis, which is projected to produce a $10 billion budget defecit
for the government of Saudi Arabia, could make it impossible for
these countries to sustain this kind of approach and create
political and social turmoil in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the region's problems are intensified by the oil
crisis,'' says Shafeek Ghabra, a political science professor at
Kuwait University. ``The challenge will be to keep moving forward
with democracy, fufilling promises to a surging population of youth
and addressing the needs of the disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat says fallen oil prices will continue for the
foreseeable future, but that the Gulf states should see this as an
impetus to diversify their economies and continue to open them to
the free market.
</P>
<P>
   One Kuwaiti government official said: ``It is a crisis. The
situation is very bad for us. ... We are working toward a
diversification of our economy. We know we need to do that.''

A NEW NETWORK EMERGES, FOR GOD AND COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If you are going to launch the nation's
seventh major broadcast network in an era when viewership is in
rapid decline and cable is rising, you had better have God on your
side.
</P>
<P>
   How fortunate for Pax Net that its founder, Lowell ``Bud''
Paxson, believes he does. The wealthy television executive ``feels
that he has this calling from God,'' according to Jeff Sagansky,
the network's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Pax Net _ or Pax TV or Pax, they can't seem to decide _ will
launch Aug. 31 with a collection of Paxson Communication television
stations and some cable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Paxson Communications is a powerhouse. The
stations themselves may be tiny, but it's the largest group of
television stations in the country and, after some pending
purchases and upgrades, will bring the Pax Net empire to 86
stations with a potential 72 million viewers, covering all of the
top 20 and 43 of the top 50 markets. That's a far better start than
most powerful cable channels and positions Pax Net as the seventh
network, behind the Big Four (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox) and The WB and
UPN.
</P>
<P>
   Pax Net's niche is families. Forget for a moment that the others
love families, too. Pax Net has that time-worn but effective
approach known as fear-mongering on its side. It has taken out
advertisements in the TV industry trade magazines that shout such
things as, ``Why does America need another television network?
Because there are some things these eyes shouldn't see,'' above a
picture of a child's face.
</P>
<P>
   Another: ``Parental Discretion Unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   And the slogan of the network makes clear its mission:
``Introducing a new kind of free TV. Free of explicit sex. Free of
senseless violence. Free of foul language.''
</P>
<P>
   All fine and good, but Pax Net is also free of quality. Unless
you want your kid reared on ``The Love Boat'' or ``Barnaby Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now Sagansky is pushing ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Dr.
Quinn, Medicine Woman'' _ the two major acquisitions by Pax Net _
as its defining shows. Sagansky helped develop both of those as
entertainment president at CBS. He also was in charge of series
programming at NBC for a while and has worked at TriStar Pictures
and Sony Pictures Entertainment. He has a resume that can compete
with anyone in Hollywood and gives instant legitimacy to Pax Net.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky is perfect for the job. He has that holier-than-thou
zeal that permeates the network. Of course, both he and his
attitude only make for a big target at the aggressively hyped Pax
Net.
</P>
<P>
   He claims the landscape is littered with ``trash TV'' and that
no one in Hollywood is responding to families because it's not cool
or won't make money. ``You hear that these edgy, hip shows with
attitude are the wave of the future. And that there's no family
viewing left anymore because everybody's got multiple sets in their
households and everyone goes off to their own set to view what they
want. But I really think that is a load of garbage and is, in fact,
creating the environment for a service like Pax TV to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What he's conveniently skipping, of course, is that he developed
his fair share of ``trash TV'' as a programmer. Like ``The
A-Team,'' ``Miami Vice'' and ``The Nanny,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionist history aside, Sagansky and Pax Net found themselves
in hotter water because one of their ads, while lashing out at
everyone else in TV, said, ``Some so-called creative people seem to
be using what was once the family viewing hour to peddle every kind
of alternative language and lifestyle to our kids. And anyone who
doesn't share their sometimes bizarre and depressing views of
family values gets vilified for being intolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, let the vilification begin since ``alternative lifestyle''
is not-so-subtle code for gay. And even though Sagansky and Steve
Sohmer, head of marketing and promotion for the network, apologized
profusely, not many people bought it. Sohmer, who wrote the ads,
has a doctorate from Oxford and presided over the marketing efforts
of CBS in the '70s and NBC in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   To come out and say he didn't know what he was doing is
disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this: Bud Paxson (who also co-founded the Home Shopping
Network) is on a mission from God. And he has hired Sagansky and
Sohmer to get this thing off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   These people know what they're doing. All this do-gooder family
programming like ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Highway to Heaven''
has an underlying theme that's not hard to figure out. Pax Net also
is producing a kids' block hosted by live-action ``angels'' with
wings, a program called ``It's a Miracle'' about ``God's calling
card,'' according to Sagansky, and a kind of Up With People nightly
news called ``Great Day America.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to begrudge anyone from starting a covert religious
TV network. If there's room for the relentlessly bleak ``Oz'' on
HBO, there's room for anything Pax Net can offer. If Pax Net wants
family-friendly viewing like ``Bonanza,'' ``Medical Center,''
``Family,'' ``Father Dowling Mystery Series'' and ``The Hogan
Family,'' then go for it.
</P>
<P>
   But before the network can crawl off its moral soapbox, somebody
needs to shout up to them that outside of ``I'll Fly Away,'' Pax
Net is programming nothing but a slew of awful, formulaic shows.
</P>
<P>
   Pax Net believes five nights of ``Touched by an Angel'' and
``Dr. Quinn'' are going to save the children of this country from
mind-numbing fare and turn back the network tide of programming
that is ``attacking notions of decency and belittling the idea of
virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a preposterous claim. If you want to spend $25 million on
an advertising campaign that is meant to shock and scare parents,
you ought to be able to back it up with quality, not just lousy
reruns of ``Bonanza'' and ``The Love Boat.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that today
the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and creating a
kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and mistreating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that today
the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and creating a
kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and mistreating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

Roberson of Nacogdoches, Texas, cannot escape being at the center

estate taxes and penalties on a $4.48 million settlement of a law
suit brought over the boy being exposed to toxic chemicals in the
uterus. Carl died Nov. 23, 1993. The boy's estate filed a petition

 LONG BEFORE MARK McGWIRE, THERE WAS JOE BAUMAN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Let Mark McGwire chase Roger Maris' record of 61
home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez can continue to rack up RBI and blow away Hack
Wilson's 68-year-old record of 190.
</P>
<P>
   Let them become immortal. They could be legends, but they will
never be Joe Bauman.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Joe Bauman?
</P>
<P>
   Bauman put together a season that may never be equaled, and
certainly not in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman never played in the majors. In nine minor-league seasons
over 16 years, with service in the Navy and some years off in
between, the closest he ever got to the bigs was the one game he
played in 1948 for the Boston Braves' top farm club in Milwaukee.
He left pro baseball after that season to run a gas station, only
to come back in 1952 with Artesia (N.M.) of the long-forgotten
Longhorn League.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .375 with 50 home runs and 157 runs batted in his
comeback season, and was just as impressive in 1953, with 53
homers, 141 RBI and a .371 average. By then Bauman was 32, and the
big time was past his grasp. But the man was just warming up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, playing for the Class C Roswell (N.M.) Rockets of the
Longhorn League, Bauman put on a one-man offensive show that almost
certainly will never be matched. He batted an even .400. He scored
188 runs (eight shy of Billy Hamilton's major league record), an
average of 1.36 runs for each of his team's 138 games. He had 199
hits. He walked 150 times. He tallied 456 total bases (one less
than Babe Ruth's major league record). His .916 slugging percentage
was 69 points higher than any major leaguer ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Then the numbers really start to get impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman drove in 224 runs. For Gonzalez or anyone else to match
his per-game total, he would have to drive in 263 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Bauman again eclipsed 50 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Then 60.
</P>
<P>
   Then 70.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the year with 72 homers, better than one every other
game, and better than anyone before or since in professional
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The native Oklahoman had a simple explanation for an
extraordinary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of started out hot,'' he said, ``and stayed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run total beat pro baseball's previous single-season
record of 69, set in 1933 by Joe Hauser of Minneapolis and tied in
1948 by Bob Crues of Amarillo. Hauser set his record four years
after his last game in the majors; Crues never made it to the bigs.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman, who retired in Roswell, said McGwire of the St. Louis
Cardinals, Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners and Sammy Sosa
of the Chicago Cubs all are legitimate threats to eclipse Maris in
this expansion year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a good chance,'' Bauman said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   For McGwire, Griffey, Sosa or Gonzalez to break the record will
require the same consistency and resiliency under pressure that
Bauman demonstrated in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never failed to have a slump, but that particular year I
never had a slump,'' the 6-foot-5, 235-pound first baseman said
years later. ``Oh, I had nights I had the collar, but not that
many.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman said he was well into his historic season before he
realized the magnitude of his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to 60, that was a big number,'' he said. ``We
always knew that Hauser had the record of 69. That always seemed
way the hell on the horizon. That's just astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Sept. 1, Bauman had 64 home runs in 131 games. But with only
seven games to go, the record appeared to be out of reach. Only 524
spectators turned out at Park Field to see hometown Roswell beat
Sweetwater that night. Only 524 spectators saw Bauman hit four
homers and a double and drive in 10 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The unthinkable became possible, and even the national media
became interested in his exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got four in one ballgame, then it became a reality,''
Bauman said. ``Then you start thinking about it. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The last day of the season was a Sunday doubleheader in Artesia.
Bauman hit his 70th home run in his first at-bat of the day off
Jose Galardo, and added two more in the night cap. Bauman's record
of 72 has stood longer than Babe Ruth's 60, or Roger Maris' 61. In
1956, Dick ``Dr. Strangeglove'' Stuart hit 66, but that is the only
time Bauman's mark has been seriously threatened. Outside of Maris,
no one has hit more than 60 home runs in a season since 1956, the
year Bauman retired.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman's numbers beg the question: Would he have traded his one
season of fame for one year in the bigs? No way, he answers. Ten,
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, it's not such a big deal,'' he
said. ``You get as much a kick out of hitting a home run in Roswell
or Elk City as you do in Yankee Stadium.''

CHURCHGOERS, CLERGY BATTLE DISILLUSIONMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an ordained minister seated in the den of my home,
saying to my husband and me that he has become disillusioned with
the church.
</P>
<P>
   He is seated in perhaps the most comfortable chair in my home,
under a swirling ceiling fan with a cool drink, so I know he cannot
be mad from the heat. I perceive he is intelligent, and so he must
have given this a lot of thought, must mean what he is saying.
</P>
<P>
   As he speaks, I retreat inside myself. Not only do I understand
this feeling, I know it like an obdurate neighbor, have worn it
like an oversized coat. I think about the recent indictment of the
Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA,
one of the nation's largest black church groups; and the charges
levied against his wife, Deborah, last July when she was accused of
torching the $700,000 home Lyons co-owned with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded guilty to first-degree arson and was sentenced to
five years' probation. He has denied wrongdoing or having an
affair, and refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a first-person piece I read just months ago by Marcia
Dyson, wife of the Rev. Michael Eric Dyson, a prominent professor,
author and media commentator. ``Why preachers prey,'' the headline
read. ``A minister's wife speaks candidly about the currents of sex
and power that flow between the men in the pulpit and the women in
the pews and the dangerous liaisons they can spark.''
</P>
<P>
   What she doesn't talk about, though, is the enormous power men
in pulpits hold over even the few men in the pews, who, not unlike
church women, often see ministers as God.
</P>
<P>
   I so much as heard a minister say once that that is, in fact,
how congregants should see him. I was astounded by the ``amens'' in
the house.
</P>
<P>
   When I am able to reclaim myself and can hear the voices in my
den again, the talk has turned to politics in the church and the
games pastors and lay people play. These, of course, are the same
issues that those with no intention of supporting the institution
quickly point to to justify their disdain for Christianity and
anything associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard this talk before and, troubled by the truth of it
all, am reminded of this from the book of Jeremiah: ``Woe be unto
the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, saith
the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   I am drawn back to when I arrived home earlier in the day. I had
left Jimmy and the girls behind at church; peace greeted me at the
door.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, I linger there, trying peace on like this silk thing
I've pulled from a store rack; replacing it when it is too large
with something smaller. It will not fit. I cannot escape the
conundrum in my head.
</P>
<P>
   National Baptist Convention. Southern Baptist Convention (its
white counterpart), the thousands of churches each represents,
trade places in my mind. The NBC's president is facing federal
charges that he cheated corporations out of millions of dollars to
buy cars, jewelry and other luxuries. The SBC is boycotting Disney
for ``promoting immoral ideologies.'' The Catholic Church is
plagued with allegations of child molestation.
</P>
<P>
   In this I see stark similarities to the first-century church at
Corinth, gifted and growing but plagued with problems _ moral,
doctrinal and corporate _ so severe that its testimony was being
undermined.
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder if it'll ever stop.

CAR-BUYING SECRETS: HOW CUSTOMER CAN SAVE A BUNDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT clients)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG ANDERSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - How would you like to be a car salesman's worst
nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   One former auto seller has revealed secrets that will save you a
bundle and have car sharks cursing your name for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make their money off the things you don't know,'' said
Stick Bogart, a former used car salesman turned buyer's consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart recently left the world of high-pressure sales to start
his own business, Auto Buyers Advocate, biting the hand that once
fed him.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first thing to know as a car buyer is your No. 1
goal: To make sure the person who sells you your car only makes
``mini.''
</P>
<P>
   Mini refers to the minimum amount of commission a salesperson
can make.
</P>
<P>
   Car sellers receive a percentage of the profit the dealership
makes from each sale they close.
</P>
<P>
   If the dealership breaks even or loses money, the salesperson
makes mini _ usually $75 or $100.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart said he made mini many times. Other times he earned more
than $3,000 from a sale, and he has the invoices to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure you don't single-handedly pay for your salesperson's
next vacation, do a little preliminary research. Find out the
``Kelley Blue Book'' value of the car you want to buy, as well as
the value of any trade-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bregant, a salesman at Honda Car Co. in Mesa, said ``Blue
Book'' values often do not reflect the car's true value, because a
vehicle is worth only what someone is willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said car buyers are more likely to strike a good
bargain if they are armed with as much information as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You won't know if you're getting a good deal unless you know
what the car is worth, Bregant said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has a Web site (www.kbb.com) that offers car value
estimates. For instance, by clicking on ``new car prices,'' you can
find the dealer invoice price and standard options for any new
vehicle, as well as the suggested retail price.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have online access, ``Kelley Blue Books'' can be
purchased at major bookstores for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Most libraries have a copy in the reference section, although it
usually cannot be checked out.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to buy a new car, another easy bit of preparation
involves making a few toll-free telephone calls. Call toll-free
information (800-555-1212) and get the 800 customer service number
for the manufacturer of the car you want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   When you make contact with the manufacturer's representative,
ask if there are any manufacturer rebates offered on the vehicle
you plan to buy.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a rebate, make sure you mention it to the
salesperson.
</P>
<P>
   The next step to car-buying success requires some acting and a
couple of hours of well-spent time, Bogart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the lot, don't get excited about the car you
want,'' he said. ``Don't even look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bogart says you should ask to test drive a car you
don't care about. Then test drive another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wear them out,'' Bogart said. ``Waste their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, point to the car you really want and say, ``I don't see
anything I like, except maybe that red one over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention a few things about the car that do not perfectly suit
your tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart said most salespeople will be so anxious to move on to
another customer that they will gladly accept ``mini'' just to get
you out of their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the paperwork, which can make or break any good car
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Borrowed Car Agreement, or BCA, is one form that can save
you a bundle, if you know how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   After you've hashed out a deal on the car you want, and before
you've signed anything, ask if you can take the car out for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to show it to your wife first. Say you want to show
it to your best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, if your credit is good the salesman will let you
fill out a BCA and take the car for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Take your BCA and drive that car straight to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will do whatever it takes to beat that deal,'' Bogart
said of the competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Another document that can do your bidding is the Point of Sale
Repair Order, also known as a ``We Owe'' form.
</P>
<P>
   ``That piece of paper can save a customer a lot of money if they
pay attention,'' Bogart said.
</P>
<P>
   After you've talked price and financing on a used car, start
talking add-ons and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Is the car missing anything? Is anything broken or damaged? Make
sure it gets written down on the We Owe form.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's signed, get a copy. The dealer must complete all
listed additions and repairs as a condition of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Be very careful when it comes to financing. You may get a great
price on the car, but if you have good credit and your interest
rate is 29.9 percent, the deal is still a lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart said customers often don't know what interest rate
they've agreed to until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   If the salesman steers you toward talking monthly payments,
steer the conversation back to interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best rate available depends on your credit history. Most
major Arizona banks offer new car loans with 8.5 to 11.5 percent
interest. Used car loans range from 8.8 to 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Be certain that you understand and approve the annual percentage
rate of your loan before signing anything.
</P>
<P>
   And don't sign any paperwork until after you've read and
understand what it says. Never sign blank forms.
</P>
<P>
   If you finance through the dealership and someone calls you back
a few days later asking you to come back and sign additional
paperwork, be on guard.
</P>
<P>
   There's a chance the lender did not approve the interest rate
you agreed on. This is the dealer's problem, not yours.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart said leasing is great for certain people because of its
low payments and high flexibility. Still, many would rather buy
because they want to own their car. If you've declined the option
to lease your new car, be wary of a low-priced financing plan
called ``residual-based financing.'' Bogart said this plan is
essentially a lease in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   With RBF, a buyer makes smaller payments for 60 months, then
either pays off the balance of the car's adjusted value in one lump
payment or gives the car back to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residual-based financing is leasing,'' said Ross Malloy, new
car manager at Bell Ford in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you are squeamish about haggling with the sales
staff, bring along someone to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart will accompany car buyers for a fee _ $150 to $300 _ but
any friend or uncle who loves to argue will do.
</P>
<P>
   Bregant said he doesn't mind dealing with ``second basemen,'' as
they are called, as long as they are legitimately trying to help
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are just there to impede the process, that's not
acceptable,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Common terms: Some frequently used car sales terms:
</P>
<P>
   Grinding _ Arguing over the price of every detail. Learn to
grind ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Roach _ A person with bad credit. Roaches need to be especially
careful to shop around for the best possible financing.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Cost _ The maximum a dealer can charge you for a particular
car. You should never pay the cap cost.
</P>
<P>
   Up _ A chance to pitch sales to a new customer. Your salesman
wants to hurry and sell you a car so he can get another up.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping _ Changing a customer's mind. Don't let the dealership
flip you to anything you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Lot Dropping _ Letting a customer go without trying to negotiate
a sale. If you are a roach who grinds excessively and the salesman
can't flip you to a lease, he may lot drop you in favor of another
up. &QL;

LASER SURGERY MAY SHED NEED FOR EYEGLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mary Weidman was diving off the island of St.
Lucia in January when she lost a contact lens. The mishap kept her
out of the water and convinced her that contacts no longer fit her
active lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment her doctor diagnosed her nearsightedness in
eighth grade, she was too vain to wear glasses. ``They stayed in my
purse until I got contacts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Weidman isn't using contacts or glasses. In February,
citing the diving incident as a turning point, the 25-year-old
registered nurse opted for corrective laser surgery on her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Her vision is now close to perfect. ``Now it's 20-20 on the
right and 20-25 on the left,'' said Weidman, who lives in
Brunswick, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of better vision, without the hassle of cumbersome
eye wear, is luring thousands to have their eyes sliced and
reshaped by a special laser, at an average cost of $2,500 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 60 million Americans suffer from myopia or
nearsightedness, a condition that makes it difficult to see objects
in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Until October 1995, when the Food and Drug Administration
approved the new excimer laser for use in eye surgery, the options
were corrective glasses, contacts or a relatively primitive
procedure known as RK, or radial keratotomy. In that surgery, the
doctor flattens out the cornea by making incisions with a scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, depending on your ophthalmologist and condition, you may
hear a sales pitch for one of two laser procedures known as PRK and
LASIK. Both use a laser beam to deliver bursts of ultraviolet light
to reshape the cornea. Because the eyes are anesthetized with
special drops, there is no pain.
</P>
<P>
   The results are faster healing and, generally, fewer
complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is a lot better,'' said Dr. Allen W. Zieker,
of Troy Eye Associates and Albany Cataract &AMP; Laser Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, laser eye surgery is a major advance in vision
technology. In the early 1980s, RK meant up to 32 incisions in the
eye with a tool akin to a broken razor blade. Today, people have a
host of new, less invasive options for dealing with everything from
myopia to cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   While two lasers have been approved by the FDA to treat
nearsightedness, the jury is still out on its effectiveness at
treating farsightedness and farsightedness with astigmatism.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the 30 million to 50 million Americans
suffering from those conditions also could benefit. Clinical trials
to test the procedure are under way and FDA approval is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a huge market,'' said George Koo, an analyst who
tracks the laser eye surgery industry with Burnham Securities, a
New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some 350,000 surgeries are expected by the end of this year, up
from 200,000 in 1997, and more than three times the number in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said much of the initial fear about the surgery is wearing
off and people are more open to the idea. ``It took a couple of
years to educate the consumers,'' Koo said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry statistics show that people are willing to pay for this
new technology in exchange for clearer vision and convenience. Koo
says the price isn't expected to come down soon, in part because
the excimer laser is so costly. It can sell for as much as
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Good results aren't guaranteed. The surgery isn't recommended
for people younger than 18 or whose vision is still changing,
something that can occur well into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Though most patients do not need glasses after the surgery, some
still require them. The surgery also doesn't prevent sight loss due
to aging, so some patients will eventually need reading glasses or
require cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Other complications include eye haze, glare and overcorrection.
One patient had to have an eye redone after a wrinkle formed on
part of her corneal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone weighing the benefits and risks, the decision of
whether to have laser surgery often comes down to dollars and
cents. Considered cosmetic surgery, corrective eye surgery isn't
covered by most insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patients should also know that the FDA has approved lasers to
perform only PRK, a procedure where the doctor scrapes off the top
layer of corneal tissue and then uses a computer-guided laser to
reshape the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the healing, the surgeon covers the wound with a contact
lens that is later removed. There is no bandage. With PRK, it takes
at least three days for the eye membranes to heal and up to several
months for vision to fully improve.
</P>
<P>
   With LASIK, often called ``flap-and-zap'' surgery, the procedure
involves cutting a flap in the cornea, using a surgical instrument
known as a microkeratome and folding it away from the eye so the
laser can zap tiny amounts of tissue. The flap is then folded back
into place, giving the patient a newly shaped cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Because cutting is less invasive than scraping, the eye membrane
heals almost immediately and vision is improved in a matter of
hours, not months.
</P>
<P>
   In both procedures, you should allow up to two hours for the
entire process. Though you remain awake during the surgery, you
will need someone else to drive you home.
</P>
<P>
   Your doctor should inform you that LASIK, the more complicated
procedure, is still awaiting FDA approval and the surgery is
technically considered an ``off-label'' use of the laser and
microkeratome. Since the FDA only regulates drugs and technology,
and not medical practice, the only requirement is that doctors
inform patients of that fact before they agree to the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If you're considering either PRK or LASIK, experts say you
should be careful about who you elect to do the surgery. Because
many insurance companies no longer cover surgery for cataracts,
health experts say there's a financial incentive for doctors to get
into the booming business of laser eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is key,'' Koo said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sandra Belmont, a New York City ophthalmologist and
spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmologists, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   She advises people to look for doctors who have completed a
training program offered by the two manufacturers that make the
FDA-approved lasers, Visx and Summit. And she recommends looking
for a doctor who performs a minimum of 10 procedures a week with
one of the approved lasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are doctors that are starting to get into this who don't
have a lot of experience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says some patients have been permanently injured,
including cases that required corneal implants.

RICK SCHRODER INTO THE `BLUE' YONDER 
</HEADLINE>
 BLUE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The guard has changed at ``NYPD Blue''
before, but the change this fall will also call for a restructuring
of the Phoenix area's entertainment-celebrity hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Stand back Stevie Nicks, Glen Campbell and Alice Cooper. Make
room for Rick Schroder, part-time Scottsdale, Ariz., resident who,
as Jimmy Smits' replacement as Dennis Franz's partner on one of
TV's all-time great cop shows, is sure to be one of the new TV
season's biggest stories.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Smits-to-Schroder transition succeeds as well as
Smits' assumption of David Caruso's slot during the series' second
season _ and first-impression assumptions among many of the
nation's TV critics are that it could _ Schroder's life as a
where-is-he-now TV star will change forever.
</P>
<P>
   He, his wife, Andrea, and their three children now split their
time between a working cattle ranch near Grand Junction, Colo.,
where he has lived since 1990, and their winter home in north
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, who last week met members of the Television Critics
Association here at the group's summer TV publicity tour, said he
took a second home in the Valley about a year ago because both he
and his wife have family here, and because of its comparative
proximity to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to my ranch in Colorado, and it's close to LA,
where my work is,'' he said. ``It's right in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   His family probably will stay in Scottsdale while he commutes to
the ``NYPD Blue'' set in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see how it all plays out,'' he said. ``I'm not
sure yet. It's all so new.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, star of the 1979 film ``The Champ'' and NBC's 1982-86
kid-com ``Silver Spoons,'' decided to return to series television
about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my team of people and I said, `Can you guys help
me find a one-hour drama?' '' said Schroder, 28, adding that he had
turned down several opportunities to act in new-series pilots over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Preferably a cop show and preferably one that's
already a hit.' I swear to you, it's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three months ago, I heard that they might be adding a
new character to the show, and I called up my people and said, `You
guys, you've got to throw my hat in the ring. You've got to get me
in there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder admitted that he's not a die-hard fan of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is not that way,'' he said. ``I don't have the
discipline to sit down every day at a certain time to watch TV. I'm
running a ranch. I'm raising three kids. When I do watch TV, it's
usually A&AMP;E or Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was well aware of the quality of the show. I mean, everybody
has heard about the writing and the acting. It's arguably the best
show on television, and I knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he auditioned, first for series co-creator and superproducer
Steven Bochco, then with Franz in a scene written for them by David
Milch, the series' other co-creator and its creative spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate impression was an honesty,'' said Franz, who with
Bochco and Milch also met the TV critics. ``There was this
stripped, honest character there, and that's what I saw. I didn't
see anybody pretending. I didn't see anybody acting. I felt him
talking to me, I felt him listening when I talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also sensed a certain nice vulnerability about him that I
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask any ``NYPD Blue'' fan: The chemistry between Franz's Andy
Sipowicz and his partner is all-important. Although the stars and
producers were reluctant to reveal details about Schroder's
character _ he doesn't even have a name yet _ his arrival unleashes
several intriguing dramatic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He's definitely young (much younger than either of Sipowicz's
partners have been before), ambitious (how else would a 28-year-old
advance so quickly to detective?) and perhaps a little cocky.
</P>
<P>
   There are also sure to be echoes of Sipowicz's son, a fledgling
cop who was killed in one of the series' most riveting plot lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had in the back of our minds that we would like
to add a younger character to the show, and this becomes the
opportunity to do that,'' Bochco said.
</P>
<P>
   Franz, a three-time Emmy winner for this role, said the
transition from Caruso to Smits ``was immediately wonderful. I
mean, with Jimmy, it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   A new partnership with a cocky comparative youngster could
provide ``a number of opportunities,'' Franz said. ``Not just to
kick him in the butt, but also take him under wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Milch: ``Rick's character is not in any way someone who
needs to be dusted off and pushed in. Sipowicz may think so. What
we want to do is explore the refractions of that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons between Smits and Schroder are as inevitable as the
words ``perp'' or ``skell'' appearing in a Milch script. For a key
segment of the series' audience, the big question will be whether
Schroder can approximate Smits' smoldering sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Jimmy is tall, dark and handsome, and I'm short,
blond and skinny,'' Schroder said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked, so Schroder answered: He does have a contract
clause ensuring he'll do scenes involving partial nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says I've got a great one,'' he added, referring to a
portion of the male anatomy ``NYPD Blue'' is notorious for
showcasing.
</P>
<P>
   Smits' departure from ``NYPD Blue'' is amicable, and he has
already signed to develop a new show or shows for ABC. The
transition between the two actors isn't yet completely scripted,
Milch said. Smits is committed to six episodes, and Schroder may
appear before Bobby Simone leaves, however that may be. Kim
Delaney, who plays Smits' love interest, will stay with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The episodes in which Simone's character will appear at the
beginning of the season are, I think, the most challenging and
interesting and compelling storytelling we've ever done,'' said
Milch, who with Bochco won't be splitting creative time this season
as they did last, on the failed CBS drama ``Brooklyn South.''
``And, as eagerly as we anticipate Rick's arrival, we feel that
much regret about Jimmy's departure and a corresponding obligation
to see that his character is treated with all the respect and
complexity it deserves. This is a show which is not beginning in
its sixth episode this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, a native of Staten Island, N.Y., was cast in his first
TV commercial at the age of 3 months. By age 7, he had done almost
60 national commercials. Third grade was the last year of formal
education for Schroder, who studied instead with studio tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Although his bio lists multiple made-for-TV movie credits (plus
parts in a few theatrical features, including ``Crimson Tide''),
the highlight of his post-``Silver Spoons'' career was a role on
the 1988 miniseries ``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   At an agent's suggestion, he dropped the ``y'' from his first
name at age 18, although his wife and mother still call him that.
He said it's not really an issue to him whether anyone else calls
him that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder appears to have survived the kind of early success that
tends to ruin childhood celebrities. If his career hasn't remained
front-burner for the past decade or so, he has managed to avoid the
call-sheet-to-rap-sheet career progression that traps so many of
his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a life outside this,'' he said. ``I have a wife and
three kids and I have a ranch in Colorado. And I've got many other
hobbies and interests besides this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I succeeded, but I have a pretty tenacious
attitude, a never-give-up attitude, and that's something, I guess,
that works to my advantage sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many times when I was frustrated and disappointed
because I didn't get something I thought I deserved. But I always
got back up and kept trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's been a struggle. But all good things are a
struggle, I think. When you come through the other side, you look
back and the truth of the matter is, I wouldn't be sitting here
today with Steven Bochco, David Milch and Dennis Franz if I hadn't
had those struggles. That's what made me who I am today.'' &QL;

BISBEE TAPS A GEM: SMITH SONIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SAME LOWE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISBEE, Ariz. - The stones are coming back to Bisbee.
</P>
<P>
   The news release that announced the monumental event was brief
and to the point. It began:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bisbee Mining and Historical Museum has just formalized an
agreement with the Smithsonian Institution that designates the
southern Arizona attraction as the nation's first small, rural
museum to participate in the Smithsonian's new Affiliation
Program.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's hardly the kind of thing that'll throw
museum fans into a ticket-buying frenzy. But like most everything
else in this old mining town, there's more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the affiliation with the prestigious Smithsonian is
only one of seven granted in the entire nation. There were as many
as 25,000 eligible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it will bring Smithsonian expertise into the community,
and it will highlight the little-publicized fact that Bisbee is one
of only three mining districts in the world to produce more than
300 types of mineral specimens.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors are making Carrie Gustavson one happy museum
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be working with the Smithsonian, building a new exhibit
together,'' she said with unconcealed delight while conducting a
tour of her facility. ``The affiliation is a natural step for our
museum, and it gives our community unprecedented access to a wealth
of expertise in planning our new Mineral Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit will be on the second floor of the museum, a brick
structure that once housed the offices of the Copper Queen
Consolidated Mining Co. When completed, it will showcase the wide
variety of minerals extracted from the ground around Bisbee, as
well as recognize the miners who dug them up.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rocks and stones have already been put on display.
Shimmering blue azurite. Brilliant green malachite. Sparkling white
calcites. And, of course, a multitude of copper specimens,
including one in which the copper granules formed around an old
hammer head.
</P>
<P>
   The samples come from a variety of places _ private collections,
other museums, individuals. ``You know how the Native Americans are
reclaiming their artifacts from museums around the country?''
Gustavson asked. ``Well, we're repatriating Bisbee's minerals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the specimens will come from the Smithsonian itself.
There's a huge Bisbee exhibit in the institution's new Janet
Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals in Washington,
D.C., and a portion of that collection will be delivered to Bisbee
on a long-term loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put the minerals in their mining context by weaving
mining and minerals together,'' Gustavson said. ``By the time we're
ready to open the exhibit, we hope to bring back about 200
different mineral specimens.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is the Smithsonian's tiniest partner in the
affiliation program, launched in 1996. The facility was established
in 1971 to tell the story of Bisbee and the surrounding area as a
premier mining center that produced substantial amounts of gold,
copper and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things like this have a price tag. Gustavson figures
the project will cost more than $500,000 and none of it will come
from the Smithsonian. But she is undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already discussed it with local businessmen,'' she
said, ``because we don't have the big corporate checkbooks to
tap.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, her staff does not know how to stage a major exhibit, but
the affiliation with the Smithsonian will fill that void.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all being developed now,'' she said cheerfully. ``Our
consultants are working with the exhibit designers so we can
produce a portfolio to show what it'll look like. Then we can cost
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising will begin right after that. If it's
successful, Gustavson expects the new exhibit to be open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't even consider the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the little engine that could,'' she said
matter-of-factly. ``It'll get done.'' &QL;

   AMUSE-BOUCHE (New York) _ The pre-dinner treat known as an amuse
bouche, or amuse gueule, used to be a throwaway, a little something
put before the diner, compliments of the chef, to make a good
impression. Recently however, like a bit player with big ideas, it
has begun to hog the stage. All over New York, top chefs are
turning the spotlight on their pre-dinner treats, adding layer upon
layer of complexity to their tiny offerings, refining and
miniaturizing until they achieve one-bite tours de force. By

   AMUSE-BUCHE-DESTINEE (New York) _ While you browse the menu at
Destinee in Manhattan, your napkin is lifted and handed to you and
a small white plate is set down on your place setting. If you are
lucky, it will hold a precisely cut cylinder of smoked salmon,
filled with fresh shredded crab and dabbed with caviar, a
glistening stain of pesto oil spooned around it. In the microworld
of amuse bouche, it is a generous three bites: cool, salty and
creamy but as candid and clean tasting as it looks. Especially
between a few sips of Champagne. It may be the perfect first
course. By Amanda Hesser.

cookie dough spread into thick, even cookies and lifted
effortlessly from the sheet. A pan enveloping a cherry almond cake
slipped off like a swim cap. For anyone who has ever lost half a
cake when unmolding it, it was astonishing. The trick was in the
bakeware: the pans and sheets are all made of a floppy material
that looks and feels like rubber but is actually a glass weave
coated with silicone. It can withstand temperatures as high as 500
degrees. It requires no greasing. And it is reusable. But its
greatest edge is that nothing sticks to it. And I mean nothing. By

WORKERS IGNORE STIGMA OF `DIRTY' JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT clients)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And, surprisingly, those who toil at jobs such as garbage
collector, prison guard and telemarketer find it relatively
rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Management Professor Blake Ashforth of Arizona State University
in Tempe, Ariz., thought he would find a subculture of depressed,
angry people when he began studying what he calls ``dirty'' jobs
and the people who do them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to figure out how people make sense of these
jobs and initially thought they would have a very hard time
coping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found people who had discovered ways to make their
work meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turn the stigma on its head and manage to maintain a
relatively high level of occupational esteem,'' Ashforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Take Roosevelt Mitchell. He's been picking up garbage in the
Phoenix area for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty nice job,'' he said. ``I'm by myself and there's
no one on my back hassling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers recast their jobs in a different light that makes
the work more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a dirty job, James Mahn sees his work cleaning grease
traps as making him a businessman. ``I'm pretty much on my own out
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His boss, A-American Septic and Grease Trap Service owner Tim
Ransom, finds cleaning septic tanks peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're usually in a beautiful setting _ in someone's really
nice back yard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ransom and Mahn say customers genuinely appreciate their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody's stopped up, they're pretty happy to see you,''
Ransom said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashforth defines dirty work as jobs that are considered tainted
by the tasks they involve and are generally looked down upon by
society. He is unable to say what percentage of the workforce such
jobs occupy, but believes they represent a ``large minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashforth groups the jobs into three general categories:
</P>
<P>
   _Physically tainted jobs that involve working with objects such
as garbage or dead people. They include garbage collectors and
embalmers. Dentists, who spend the day working inside people's
mouths, also fall into this group.
</P>
<P>
   _Socially tainted jobs that entail working in servile positions
or with people who are themselves tainted. Shoe shiners, maids and
prison guards fall into this category.
</P>
<P>
   _Morally tainted jobs that involve doing something that is
morally questionable, of dubious virtue or involves suspect
tactics. Strippers, pawn brokers and psychics fall into this group,
as do bill collectors, tabloid reporters, used car salespeople and
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many different jobs carry some kind of a
stigma,'' Ashforth said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said stigma is in the eye of the beholder and is
transferred by society onto the people who do the work.
</P>
<P>
   While Ashforth's study doesn't deal with what ``dirty'' workers
earn, many of them are fairly well paid and use that as additional
justification for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a garbage man who drives a BMW,'' said Mark Chase, a
driver with Waste Management in Phoenix. ``I was in sales for six
years and wore a tie every day. Now this is my office,'' he said,
pointing to his garbage truck. ``And I make a lot more money.''
Chase estimates he makes about $50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, who has been working as a topless dancer in Phoenix for
about a year, also likes the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on top of my bills for the first time,'' she said. ``And
the flexible hours let me spend a lot of time with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena says her family doesn't approve of her work, but said she
enjoys it and plans to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Besides giving a different meaning to their work, some workers
use neutralization. Workers at morally tainted jobs, for example,
might look for ways to neutralize the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers also use a technique Ashforth calls
``recalibrating'' to rationalize and give meaning to their jobs. In
recalibrating, workers emphasize what redeeming qualities they can
find in their jobs to give the work a sense of importance that is
denied by society.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital cleaners, for example, might tell themselves that the
hospital could not function without their efforts. A stall cleaner
at a race track might labor under the same notion.
</P>
<P>
   Often the denial is shared by other workers who foster and
nurture the belief. In some cases, management participates in the
myth to recruit and motivate workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashforth said that part of the curriculum at undertaking and
dental schools involves overcoming the stigma attached to the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective dentists learn they are providing people with vital
medical services and would-be funeral directors are told they are
an integral part of helping people through the grief caused by the
death of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telemarketing companies would be miles ahead if they could
find ways to make the work more meaningful for their employees,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management Inc. promotes the notion that employees are
providing an important service to the community ``instead of
picking up trash,'' said Jim Sargeant, operations manager at Waste
Management in Phoenix. ``They're always asking about complaints and
looking for ways to deliver better service.''
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management also helps foster the image that it takes a
special kind of person to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are guys who like to work hard and get their hands
dirty,'' Sargeant said. ``They say: `You give me the job and I'll
take care of it.' They feel they are the only guys who can get this
job done. They're true professionals at what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashforth said that eventually, many workers get used to the
``dirty'' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospital orderlies might grow faint the first time they change
a bed pan,'' Ashforth said. ``But after a while, they'll change it
and go to lunch without flinching.''
</P>
<P>
   Other workers are unable to maintain the denial and quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people run out of ways to justify the work, they usually
quit,'' Ashforth said. ``It's hard to do a job over the long run
that you don't believe in.'' &QL;

   SCIENTISTS-VISAS (Undated) _ A prominent Indian scientist who
had planned to participate in a scientific conference in Virginia
this week has been denied a United States visa, prompting charges
by American physicists that Washington is imposing political
restraints on the free exchange of scientific information. The
scientist at the center of the controversy is Dr. Rajagopal
Chidambaram, the director of India's Atomic Energy Commission, who
is also the vice chairman of the International Union of
Crystallographers. Physicists contend that a dangerous precedent
may have been set. Even during the Cold War Soviet scientists were
admitted to conferences in the United States. The State Department,
which is holding up Indian and Pakistani scientists' visas as
reprisals for the May bomb tests, says the present case is
different from the cold war. Canada and the Britain are also
freezing Indian and Pakistani visa applications. By Malcolm Browne.

SALMON FISHERMEN, FACING TOUGH TIMES, WILL TRY DIRECT SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the old days, fishermen returning from the
sea hawked fresh catches right from the docks to people heading
home to cook dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In a desperate move to get a decent price for their prized
salmon, fishermen are returning to that old, almost-forgotten
tradition. They plan to sell wild chinook from their boats Saturday
and Sunday at Fishermen's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible year for us. We decided to go straight to the
public,'' said fisherman Larry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, fishermen sell their catch to processors or
wholesalers. But this year the bottom has dropped out of the wild
salmon market, fishermen say, blaming weather oddities, a shortened
season and competition from salmon that is farmed or imported.
</P>
<P>
   By selling at Fisherman's Wharf, Collins and other fishermen
hope to fetch $3.50 per pound, compared to the $1.02-per-pound
price paid by the wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Cadillac of all salmon,'' Collins said of the
chinook. ``We catch these fish one at a time on a single barbless
hook. We bleed 'em. We clean 'em, and they instantly go on ice.
It's one of the most nutritious foods in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The direct-sales strategy started in Southern California and has
been moving up the coast, said Bob Miller, president of the Crab
Boat Owners Association of San Francisco, which has about 30
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Miller, who fishes on the 40-foot
Orca. ``It's long overdue. The fishermen are just tired of the low
price. They can't buy the bait, fuel and pay a crew. Some of the
fish buyers have made a killing on the backs of the fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wholesalers appeared to be surprised at the plan to
sidestep them, but others said the direct sales would not hurt
their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come in with a lot of fish, I don't know what's going
to happen. They'll be sitting at the dock for quite a while. It's a
perishable product,'' said Joe Caito, a fourth-generation Sicilian
fisherman who is president of Caito Fisheries at Pier 45 and Fort
Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   But if the supply is small, said Michelle Du, in charge of fresh
fish sales at H&AMP;N Fish at Pier 45, ``the fishermen can make more
money selling directly to the consumer, and that small amount won't
make a difference to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife biologists and fishermen agree on the reasons for the
dearth of salmon. The El Nino weather phenomenon caused ocean
temperatures off the state's Central Coast to rise this year,
depleting the populations of squid, anchovy, krill and sardine, all
necessary for plump salmon.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the fishermen's troubles, the Pacific Coast Fisheries
Management Council, a government-industry group, closed the
commercial salmon season for three weeks in June from Monterey Bay
north to Point Reyes to protect the Sacramento and other salmon
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Imported salmon and fish raised on farms has cut into prices,
further hurting fishermen.

cake when unmolding it, it was astonishing. The trick was in the
bakeware: the pans and sheets are all made of a floppy material
that looks and feels like rubber but is actually a glass weave
coated with silicone. It can withstand temperatures as high as 500
degrees. It requires no greasing. And it is reusable. But its
greatest edge is that nothing sticks to it. And I mean nothing. By

   ``Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea '' &QL; 
Gary Kinder (Atlantic, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1857, a steamer called the Central America sank in a storm
off the coast of South Carolina, taking 423 people to their deaths.
Many of those passengers were returning to the Eastern states after
making their fortunes in the California gold rush, and their
newfound wealth sank in 8,000 feet of water. A hundred years later,
a group of engineers and scientists set out to find the wreckage of
the ship. Led by an eccentric visionary named Tommy Thompson and
financed unconventionally by a group of Ohio businessmen, they used
robotic technology to explore the ocean floor at unprecedented
depths. In 1989, they struck pay dirt and brought up nearly $1
billion in gold bars and coins from the grave of the ravaged
steamer. Kinder alternates the story of the ship's last days (in
chapters as harrowing as the weather passages in Sebastian Junger's
``The Perfect Stor''m) with that of the inspired men who raised the
money, developed the know-how and devoted themselves to doing what
no one else had been able to do. This is a wonderful book, full of
solid research and irresistible adventure. Be careful when you pick
it up, because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Annals of the Former World'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
John McPhee (FSG, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. We dare you to read it all. Of course we jest (or, in
the eyes of McPhee's fans, we blaspheme), because we are fans
ourselves, and in that spirit we direct your attention to this
collection of McPhee's books on geology, the whole kit and
caboodle: ``Basin and Range,'' ``In Suspect Terrain,'' ``Rising
From the Plains,'' ``Assembling California'' and a new essay and
final link in his cross-country chain, ``Crossing the Craton.'' The
new section is slight because it deals with mid-America, which is
not a geologist's dream. It's a section of the country, says
McPhee, where ``if the rocks were scarce, the tectonics were
scarcer,'' but he felt too guilty to leave it out. He introduces it
all with a ``narrative table of contents,'' which is fun to read
and in which he addresses the question he has heard since he began
his foray into geology 20 years ago: Why is he, a humanities man at
heart, driven to write about rocks? His answer lies in a single
paragraph of ``Basin and Range,'' in which he notes that geology is
a descriptive science, ``a fountain of metaphor _ of isostatic
adjustments and degraded channels, of angular unconformities and
shifting divides, of rootless mountains and bitter lakes.''
Geologists, he says, ``could name things in a manner that sent
shivers through the bones.'' Happy reading. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Letters to the Editor'' &QL; 
(Touchstone, $14) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WANTED, for a sober family, a man of light weight, who fears
the
</P>
<P>
   Lord, and can drive a pair of horses. He must occasionally wait
at
</P>
<P>
   table, join in household prayer, look after the horses, and read
a
</P>
<P>
   chapter in the Bible. He must, God willing, rise at 7 in the
morning,
</P>
<P>
   obey his master and mistress in all commands. If he can dress
his
</P>
<P>
   hair, sing psalms, play at cribbage, the more agreeable.''
There's much that is agreeable about this collection of letters
written to newspapers in and around Bloomsburg, Pa., over the past
200 years. The sample above, written in 1793, is little more than a
want ad, but others are more conventional (and then again some are
not _ one anonymous animal-lover wrote a letter in the voice of a
neighborhood dog, soliciting better treatment from its master).
They were edited by members of a theater ensemble who live in
Bloomsburg. One, Gerard Stropnicky, observes that these letters
read ``like extended conversations over a backyard fence, on just
about any aspect of daily life, from sports and romantic gossip to
politics, education and faith.'' They say much about small towns
and even more about human nature, especially the urge to raise
one's voice and speak one's mind, and to know that someone is
listening. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the Picture'' &QL; 
John G. Morris (Random House, $30) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Henry R. Luce, who had the courage of his convictions,
today's editors watch to see what sells, just as today's
politicians adapt their policies to the polls. The line between
journalism and entertainment is blurred.'' We know it, but it's sad
when the assessment comes from such a photojournalist as Morris,
who as photographer and picture editor worked with the likes of
Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and the troubled but brilliant
W. Eugene Smith. This memoir is full of anecdotes behind some of
the most famous photographs ever made, and the stories of the men
and women who took them. Also new is ``Magnum: Fifty Years at the
Front Line of History,'' by Russell Miller (Grove, $27), the story
of the legendary photo agency for which John Morris worked during
the 1950s. &QL;

Garry Wills writes, glowingly, about Oliver Stone. Alice Walker

A QUEST TO FIX UNFAIR NEGLECT OF STEPHEN BENET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Durability of this column activity persuades some readers that
I've ``read everything,'' or have familiarity with most things
worth reading. So I'm urged betimes to write something about this
book or that author; and often I can't.
</P>
<P>
   May Sarton, for example. I know her reputation and have slight
acquaintance with her work, but not enough to feel comfortable and
honest as a commentator. James Dickey, for another. What I've read
of his isn't warmed by memory, and I wouldn't be competent.
Requests to write about Djuna Barnes, Gerald Warner Brace and
Robert Graves also must be rejected for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose Bierce? Well, I committed an essay on him, some time
back. Ditto Somerset Maugham, but he'll serve another entry after
I've read some more Maugham, always a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But when a friend states his belief that Stephen Vincent Benet
is a wrongly neglected author, I'm engaged. Neglected or otherwise,
he's worthy of attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pin down this youngest of the quite literate
Benets, who was a poet, a novelist, a short-story writer, a
historian, an essayist, a critic. That he was never any one of
those things primarily may explain in part his recent fall into
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-1943), distinguished man of letters,
was a published poet before his graduation from Yale at age 20. Ten
years later came ``John Brown's Body,'' a long narrative poem that
brought him the first of two Pulitzer Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The second Pulitzer was for ``Western Star'' (1942), a novel in
verse, which he projected as the first increment in an epic
treatment of America's pioneering westward movement. The ambitious
design was not realized as Benet died at the peak of his celebrity,
before reaching age 45.
</P>
<P>
   He had come of age in an atmosphere of intellectual vitality.
His much older brother, William Rose Benet, was an early-praised
romantic poet, also a Pulitzer winner for a verse novel (''The Dust
Which Is God'') and was the original editor of the landmark
reference work The Reader's Encyclopedia (known in later editions
as Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia).
</P>
<P>
   Between them came Laura Benet, herself a writer and family
biographer, who was to her brothers as Alice James was to William
and Henry. Intramural rivalry sparked the solid accomplishments of
the Benet trio.
</P>
<P>
   History was the consuming passion of Stephen Benet's lifetime.
Early acquaintance with Edward Gibbon fired his interest in ancient
Rome, but eventually his preoccupation was with the United States
in its formative years, expressed eloquently in both poetry and
prose.
</P>
<P>
   Benet may be most easily identified with ``The Devil and Daniel
Webster,'' which began as a short story (1937), then was the
libretto _ Benet's own _ for a celebrated folk opera with music by
Douglas Moore (1939), and came full circle as ``All That Money Can
Buy'' (1941), an admired film with a great performance by Walter
Huston as Mr. Scratch, the devil personified.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be noted that Stephen Benet's rapturous review of
the just-published ``Gone With the Wind'' set in motion the
singular commercial phenomenon of Margaret Mitchell's story of the
Old South. Benet's substantial body of criticism holds up well _ as
indeed do most, maybe all, of his ballads, tales and sketches
solidly grounded in history.
</P>
<P>
   But after 70 years, ``John Brown's Body'' glows as Stephen
Vincent Benet's timeless masterpiece. This saga of the American
Civil War is a verse narrative of stunning complexity, holding the
reader in thrall with tableaux of slave ships, of Brown's raid on
Harper's Ferry, of grim battle action, and of vivid portraiture of
persons real (Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee,
Ulysses Grant, et. al.) and imagined (particularly Jack Elyat of
the Union army).
</P>
<P>
   It's sobering great history and great poetry by the
unforgettable Stephen Vincent Benet.

THIS TIME, EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE HOT UNDER THE COLLAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something strange going on.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, on the rare occasions that I have written columns
complaining about the unbearable heat of Texas summers, I have been
severely chastised and even ridiculed. If I can't stand the hot
weather here in God's country, I've been told, I should just pack
up and go back to wherever I came from.
</P>
<P>
   That would be (in backward chronological order) Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Does it get hot in those places? Sure it does, especially in
southwestern Illinois. I grew up in East St. Louis and Belleville,
right across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, where
outfielders for the Cardinals baseball team used to wear specially
equipped shoes to protect their feet from the sizzling artificial
turf in Busch Stadium. A photographer at the Belleville newspaper
would always shoot at least one picture per summer of an egg frying
on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   I know what hot is about.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those 95-degree, 95-percent-humidity days I
experienced in the Midwest ever prepared me for Texas summers. It
gets hotter sooner. It stays hotter longer. It doesn't cool off at
night. The heat becomes the central issue of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: Tell you something you don't
already know.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I would, but I can't. A transplanted Midwesterner is
simply not qualified to expound on the weather in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe I could point out something that you hadn't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   When I have complained about the heat in the past, I've always
felt like one of those lonely voices crying out in the ... uh ...
desert. This year, though, I feel like I can't get a complaint in
edgewise.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely everybody is complaining about the heat this summer _
even the TV meteorologists who demonically deliver those
body-and-soul-scorching five-day forecasts that seem to guarantee
100-plus-degree days for the remainder of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember what the temperature was the last time I
complained in print about a Texas heat wave. I'm guessing that it
was over 95 but certainly under the eye-popping, brain-searing 110
that we achieved here recently. Let's say it was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Readers scoffed at my admitted inability to deal with 98-degree
heat. Native Texans wanted to know what kind of pathetic Yankee
wimp thinks 98 is hot. A friend advised me to buy some Blue Bell
ice cream, pull up a lawn chair and quit whining about how hot it
was.
</P>
<P>
   They really let me have it.
</P>
<P>
   But now some of the very same people who derided me in the past
for insisting that it was just plain too hot are screaming in agony
about the relentless onslaught of 100-degree days. Complaints about
the heat are all over the media. Say ``hello'' to someone on the
street and he or she will reply: ``Hot enough for you?''
</P>
<P>
   So don't you think it's strange that nobody except me complains
about the heat when the temperature is 98 but everybody and his dog
complains when it's 100?
</P>
<P>
   Why does a difference of two degrees make it socially acceptable
to whine about the heat? Does a person really feel all that much
hotter when the temperature jumps from the high 90s to the low
100s?
</P>
<P>
   Or is 100 some sort of psychological plateau? Is 100 degrees the
cutoff point at which all those people who normally delude
themselves into believing that they don't mind the heat suddenly
find the heat unendurable?
</P>
<P>
   I'm speculating, of course. I pretty much slept through
Meteorology 101 and 102, and I never even signed up for Basic
Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   But there must be an explanation for all the moaning and
groaning about the heat that I've been hearing this summer. It
doesn't seem a heck of a lot hotter to me than most of my previous
11 summers in Texas _ but they were all too hot for my taste.
</P>
<P>
   I must confess that I find it rather satisfying, in a sweaty
sort of way, that folks who once sneered at my complaints are now
complaining to beat the band.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I'm getting a little tired of hearing people
whine about how hot it is.

LEEK AND POTATO: A TENDER CRUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fifth of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the former
chef at Greens in San Francisco and the author of ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark Bittman.)  
 (HLW)  
 By DEBORAH MADISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leeks and potatoes are a natural, classic and
delicious combination. So maybe it isn't too surprising that when I
was trying to figure out an alternative for a traditional wheat
crust for a leek pie, I thought of making one from thinly sliced
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the idea of buttery, slightly crisp potatoes cradling
soft, delicate leeks. But I didn't love the preparation: I had to
cook individual slices of potatoes carefully to make them soft
enough to form a crust, and then painstakingly layer them along the
edge of a large springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I discovered an easier way: Quickly baking the
potatoes with a little butter gives them the right consistency, and
lining little ramekins is a bit easier than lining a larger form.
The individual pies are quite charming, especially if they are
inverted onto their serving plates, much like a pastry or timbale.
</P>
<P>
   The filling, unlike the heavy, custardy centers of most quiches,
is made mostly from leeks, and only lightly bound with cream and
eggs. Because leeks contain a natural gelatinlike substance, the
filling holds together beautifully, whether served hot, warm or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The other major flavor in this filling is cheese, and here you
have many choices. Strong cheeses, like Taleggio or Gorgonzola,
work beautifully, but so do milder, distinctively flavored goat
cheeses. A combination is nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have ramekins, you can make one large pie in a
nine-inch springform pan. But it will be difficult to serve; the
crisp potatoes tend to shatter when you cut through them. This
recipe will produce six small servings, suitable for appetizers, or
four larger ones around which you can build a main course. I like
to serve this with braised red kale, chard, spinach or whatever
green is in season.

   2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   { cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 large baking potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces grated or crumbled cheese, like taleggio, gorgonzola or
goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place 2 large skillets over medium-high heat and add 1
tablespoon of butter to each pan. When butter has melted, add half
the leeks to each pan. Cook, stirring, until leeks just begin to
brown, about 10 minutes. Add \ cup water to each pan and stir well,
until leeks have softened, about another 10 minutes. Remove from
heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine contents of both
skillets in a large saucepan and add thyme. Saute over medium-low
heat until leeks are very tender, about 10 minutes. Add wine and
saute until it is almost completely evaporated. Remove pan from
heat, and add cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside, and
cool.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a mandoline or a sharp knife to make the thinnest
slices possible, slice one potato lengthwise, and the other
crosswise. Brush a baking sheet (or two, if necessary) with butter,
and lay the potato slices on it in a single layer. Bake potatoes
until they just begin to brown, no longer, and remove from oven.
</P>
<P>
   4. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees. Using a wooden spoon,
beat eggs and cheese into the leek mixture. Butter six 1-cup
ramekins. Line them with a single layer of potato slices, allowing
them to overlap slightly; use round slices for the bottom, and oval
slices for the sides. Divide leek mixture among the ramekins. Bake
just until the filling sets, about 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool 5
minutes; run a sharp knife around the edge; invert onto individual
plates and serve.

LEEK AND POTATO: A TENDER CRUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fifth of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the former
chef at Greens in San Francisco and the author of ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark Bittman.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leeks and potatoes are a natural, classic and
delicious combination. So maybe it isn't too surprising that when I
was trying to figure out an alternative for a traditional wheat
crust for a leek pie, I thought of making one from thinly sliced
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the idea of buttery, slightly crisp potatoes cradling
soft, delicate leeks. But I didn't love the preparation: I had to
cook individual slices of potatoes carefully to make them soft
enough to form a crust, and then painstakingly layer them along the
edge of a large springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I discovered an easier way: Quickly baking the
potatoes with a little butter gives them the right consistency, and
lining little ramekins is a bit easier than lining a larger form.
The individual pies are quite charming, especially if they are
inverted onto their serving plates, much like a pastry or timbale.
</P>
<P>
   The filling, unlike the heavy, custardy centers of most quiches,
is made mostly from leeks, and only lightly bound with cream and
eggs. Because leeks contain a natural gelatinlike substance, the
filling holds together beautifully, whether served hot, warm or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The other major flavor in this filling is cheese, and here you
have many choices. Strong cheeses, like Taleggio or Gorgonzola,
work beautifully, but so do milder, distinctively flavored goat
cheeses. A combination is nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have ramekins, you can make one large pie in a
nine-inch springform pan. But it will be difficult to serve; the
crisp potatoes tend to shatter when you cut through them. This
recipe will produce six small servings, suitable for appetizers, or
four larger ones around which you can build a main course. I like
to serve this with braised red kale, chard, spinach or whatever
green is in season.
</P>
<P>
   LEEK TART WITH CRISP POTATO CRUST
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, plus more for the baking sheet and
ramekins
</P>
<P>
   8 cups thinly sliced leeks (about 10 medium leeks), white and
light green parts only
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   { cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 large baking potatoes, peeled

TOP CHEFS ARE TURNING OUT TINY PREDINNER TREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All systems were go. The dab of duck tartare was
resting attractively on the world's smallest taro chip, surrounded
by a bright-green splash of pureed scallion and accented by a
discreet racing stripe of pineapple ketchup off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   Now came crunch time. Normand Laprise, the executive chef at
Cena, hunched over the plate and lowered into position a blazing
yellow marigold blossom, no larger than a dime.
</P>
<P>
   The duck disappeared in its shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the flower works,'' Laprise said, taking half a
step back to eyeball the situation.
</P>
<P>
   With a deft pincer movement, he extracted a single petal, no
larger than a match head, and placed it beside the duck tartare.
Perfect. Another amuse bouche, Laprise-style, rolled off the
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   The predinner treat known as an amuse bouche, or amuse gueule,
used to be a throwaway, a complimentary ``palate pleaser,'' to
translate the term, which was put before the diner to make a good
impression. Recently, however, like a bit player with big ideas, it
has begun to hog the stage.
</P>
<P>
   All over New York, top chefs are turning the spotlight on their
predinner treats, adding layer upon layer of complexity to their
tiny offerings, refining and miniaturizing until they achieve
one-bite tours de force _ little works of art that in a few cases
are approaching the vanishing point.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs are giving them a permanent place on the menu. At
Union Pacific, where diners can already order plates of three to
six amuses, Rocco DiSpirito, the executive chef, just introduced a
Lilliputian feast he calls 21 Little Tastes _ seven flights of
three thematically linked amuses, priced at $135.
</P>
<P>
   There are even pastry chefs who have begun sending out sweet
little nothings to tables being cleared for the dessert course.
It's the sweet before the main sweet, not to be confused with the
petit fours that come after the dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The new-wave amuses are anything but afterthoughts, although
they often make use of bits and pieces left over from the entrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a party hors d'oeuvre.'' DiSpirito said. ``There
are a lot of flavor levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. When DiSpirito puts together an amuse bouche, simplicity is
not uppermost on his mind. One of his more modest creations begins
with a miniature strawberry known as a Tristar, which he cuts into
three pieces, outfits with a split fava bean and tops with bits of
chopped strawberry, strawberry vinegar, strawberry syrup, aged
balsamic vinegar, apricot-kernel oil and bits of apricot kernel.
</P>
<P>
   The amuse bouche he calls the ``mini rabbit'' has 20 flavor
components.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whiff of the mad scientist about DiSpirito that is
lacking in Laprise, a Quebecer who implies that he simply throws
his amuse bouche together from little scraps of this or that,
depending on what he finds in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's a way to play with the maximum of flavor in the
smallest possible format,'' he said. Searching for the English word
to describe his predinner offerings, he falters, then comes up with
``clin d'oeil'' _ a wink.
</P>
<P>
   That's how fast they go by. Laprise likes to work small, about
the size of a quarter. He mixes together morsels of lobster-claw
meat with sliced shallots marinated in grapeseed oil and a touch of
cinammon, corn and fresh chervil, then presses the ingredients into
a plastic napkin-ring holder to form an inch-high cylinder that he
tops with avocado.
</P>
<P>
   He lays a dainty fingerling potato chip on top, installs a
lobster antenna for effect and then squirts a few Zorro Z's of
reduced red bell pepper juice on a preposterously large plate. You
don't know whether to pin the thing on your lapel or eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has signed on to the program. At Patroon, Geoffrey
Zakarian serves two-bite amuses with simple, straighforward
flavors. Last week, for example, he sent out spinach in a
Gruyere-flavor puff pastry and tuna tartare with fresh beets and
cherries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like three or four ingredients, period, and I don't like
them too small,'' he said. ``When it's one tiny bit of food on one
tine of a fork _ it's gone and you say, `What was that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The preappetizer appetizer is an arriviste, dating back no
further than the advent of nouvelle cuisine in the early 1970s. The
term itself first popped up in ``Les Grandes Vacances'' (``The Long
Holiday''), a 1946 novel by Francis Ambriere, where ``amuse
gueule'' (pronounced ah-MOOZ gool) was used to mean a miniature
snack that cheated hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``gueule'' has a mildly slangy, coarse sound in French,
amuse gueule quickly generated a nicer-sounding synonym, amuse
bouche (ah-MOOZ boosh). The difference is approximately the same as
that between ``toilet paper'' and ``toilet tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a brasserie or bistro, you would use `amuse gueule,' and at
a nice restaurant you would use `amuse bouche,' '' said Xavier Le
Roux, a lecturing instructor at the Culinary Institute of America
and the chef at its Escoffier Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amuse was a way to tease the appetite and to get people
into the ambiance,'' he added. ``Also, nouvelle portions were much
smaller than normal, so it was an extra bite.'' In nouvelle's
overheated, highly competitive environment, the amuse was also one
more way to make an impression and to top the competition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We never served an amuse bouche at Le Pavillon,'' said Jacques
Pepin. The restaurant turned out canapes and miniature hors
d'oeuvres by the hundreds for cocktail parties and receptions, but
at dinner _ nothing. To this day, the culinary schools offer no
instruction on the theory and practice of the amuse, restricting
themselves to classes on canapes and hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   The amuse-bouche concept made its way across the Atlantic fairly
quickly, although restaurants tended to limit their amuses to one
signature dish that could be prepared well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1970s and 80s, diners at the Quilted Giraffe were
presented with a smoked salmon and foie gras ``cake'' in seven
layers, with the foie gras whipped into a kind of frosting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always this issue, could the amuse bouche be warm
and cooked to order, or did it have to be cold?'' said Barry Wine,
who was the restaurant's chef and owner.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, these were early days, an eon removed from 21 Little
Tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Why the fuss and bother over a bit of food that disappears in
one quick bite? The answer is a mixture of art and commerce. Chefs
love the amuse bouche because it gives them the chance to execute a
quick, virtuosic turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only fully creative outlet you have, the only
completely free thing you can do,'' DiSpirito said. ``It also lets
me expand the menu without actually expanding the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other advantages. An amuse bouche can be a trial
balloon. If customers respond with wild enthusiasm, yesterday's
amuse can become tomorrow's appetizer. The amuse also allows chefs
to use fresh ingredients that turn up at local markets in small
quantities. It buys time for a kitchen rushing to fill the
appetizer orders.
</P>
<P>
   For restaurant owners, the amuse bouche works as a
customer-pleaser, and it sets up a wine purchase beautifully. It
also implies a certain level of quality and service, which is why
the amuse is showing up even at modest-price restaurants like
Aquagrill, where customers get a small dollop of salmon tartare on
a potato gaufrette with their aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a restaurant like mine, which has two stars, you feel like
you're getting a three-star experience,'' said Jeremy Marshall,
Aquagrill's chef and owner.
</P>
<P>
   Pastry chefs have seen the busy fingers at work and drawn their
own conclusions. Claudia Fleming, the pastry chef at Gramercy
Tavern, began sending out tiny fruit tarts and dinky creme brulees
after watching Tom Collichio, the executive chef, work on his amuse
bouches. With time, she has developed more ambitious amuses like
tiny apricot tart tatins with black-pepper ice cream or warm
blackberry compotes with sweet-corn ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are slightly obscure things that I could not sell on the
menu,'' she said. ``It's just a couple of bites, a titillation. I
don't want to say I've gotten carried away, but I have gotten very
passionate about them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Fleming, like many other pastry chefs
around town, has reduced the size of her petit fours and chocolates
so drastically that they are barely visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the downsizing is a practical matter. Diners who have
been plied with preappetizers and two rounds of dessert are not
necessarily in a receptive mood when a heaping plate of mignardises
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion is calling the tune as well. ``It's not economics,''
said Michael Schneider, the editor in chief of Chocolatier. ``Those
tidbits cost 25 cents, and there is no labor cost, because the
pastry chef makes them. How tiny can you make a truffle? I'm
beginning to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for a little perspective might want to visit Les
Sans-Culottes, a 24-year-old bistro on the Upper East Side that
knows nothing of paper-thin daikon radish slices, or what Wine
calls ``the uni-tart.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately on taking seats at Les Sans-Culottes, diners are
presented with La Table Campagnarde, a staggeringly caloric,
complimentary assemblage of sausages, chunky pate, hunks of bread,
pots of mustard, and crudites.
</P>
<P>
   It makes quite a statement. You want to amuse your mouth? Well
go ahead, amuse yourself until you burst. And you won't need a
jeweler's eyepiece to see the food.

YEP, WE'RE TUNING IN TO `SEX WITH CINDY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In comes Cindy Crawford, tall, gorgeous, sharply dressed in
pantsuit and high-heeled sandals, with an expression midway between
amusement and terror. The Cindy Experience begins with a pleased,
pleasant smile to a roomful of journalists, many of them men, many
of them hogging the first few tables, in the middle, front and
center.
</P>
<P>
   How obvious, how unprofessional, how disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' Cindy says softly, concentrating all her charms, it
seems, on one face, in the second row, to the left. Mine.
</P>
<P>
   Her blue eyes, her shoulder-length hair, the teeny waist, the
here-to-eternity legs, the mole, the smile, the voice.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever she's selling, I'm buying.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens to be sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone at this table not had a one-night stand?'' she
wants to know. No hands go up. She grins, she purrs: ``You notice
I'm not raising my hand, either.''
</P>
<P>
   This flirty Cindy beams from a giant screen, lifted from a clip
of ``Sex With Cindy Crawford,'' slated to air Sept. 22 on ABC. It's
a special, an hour of Cindy talking about sex, although her
revelation of a one-night stand is about as personal as she gets.
</P>
<P>
   As Cindy sits on a stage, her producer, Gay Rosenthal, is to her
left. ``The show is about sex,'' Cindy explains. ``It's like the
sexual State of the Union. It kind of kills two birds with one
stone. It talks about what we're talking about, but it also is a
bit provocative, and hopefully will get people curious enough to
tune in.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems Cindy roamed New York and New Jersey and Madison, Wis.,
talking to folks about their sex lives. How much they do it, how
much they think about it, how the media is driven by it, what teens
are saying about it, whether monogamy is a lost cause, what's
happening with the science of attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal promises ``a thought-provoking hour,'' but we all know
this ain't PBS. If that's what we ``really'' wanted, we'd wait for
``Sex With Bernard Shaw,'' live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   This is Cindy, this is network television, this is a special
that's so contradictory it ought to talk in first-person during the
segment on sex in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' says Cindy, who has yet to learn the art of lying
to TV critics, ``we want the ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why the show`iz about sex, why it's called ``Sex With
...,'' why it will be about as heavy as lint, why it's Cindy
Crawford fronting this report and not Connie Chung, with all due
respect to the veteran broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a journalist, and I'm not claiming to be,'' says
Cindy, whose number of magazine cover shots is closing in on 500.
Even as host of MTV's magazine show ``House of Style,'' she was
merely selling Cindy Crawford. ``So, I think, that can be both a
good and bad thing. I'm interested _ it was my journey as well, and
that's what the show was for me. I didn't come in knowing all the
answers. I came in with a lot of questions and a willingness to
talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex With Cindy Crawford'' is one of those odd birds nestled
between news and entertainment. ``The idea that an entertainment
program can't offer information in the same way (that news programs
do) is a strange thing,'' says Michael Davies, ABC's executive vice
president of alternative series and specials, who steps up to a
mike just as Cindy is being battered on the credibility issue by
female journalists obviously unfazed by The Cindy Experience.
</P>
<P>
   Chased to the point of becoming speechless, Cindy finally yelps,
``Save me!'' which makes even her questioners burst into laughter.
Seems Cindy woos even in distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Oprah Winfrey on a daily basis offers a service
to her viewers in this country, which is not being serviced
necessarily by news,'' Davies adds. ``This covers sex in its own
way. Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, ABC News have done wonderful
pieces on sex in the last year and last several years. And this is
an attempt to do something different and to get to a different
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   To get that audience, ABC is dipping into the vault. ``Sex'' is
the first in a series of appearances by Cindy that will, over the
next three years, cover news, sports and entertainment programming,
from fashion-related segments on ``Good Morning, America'' to
``Monday Night Football'' to a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The base deal is said to be worth more than $2 million, although
sitcom success would bump that up considerably. (Cindy says she has
a development deal, but ``I'm not exactly sure what that means.''
Cindy woos even when naive.)
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of having a long-term relationship excites her, and
me, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether I'll tune in to hear what she has to say
or simply tune in. That's The Cindy Experience for you. As she
turns to leave, she waves and purrs, ``Thanks for coming.'' We
stagger away, silent, breathless, satisfied after ``Sex With Cindy
Crawford.''

   Journalism is far from the perfect, objective science we might
like it to be. We easily forget that the facts and allegations of
the stories on our TV screens and in our newspapers are gathered by
people _ journalists, who as human beings, are fallible and
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists fail to tell the entire truth or to find it and
instead resort to dishonest and illegal tactics _ as in an uncommon
number of cases recently in the United States _ they get
reprimanded, they get fired, and bring embarrassment to the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   But good journalism can, at times, be more dangerous than bad
journalism. While lying about a source might cause an American
writer to lose the job, reporting the truth might cause a Latin
American journalist to lose his life.
</P>
<P>
   Eight already have in 1998 alone: two in Brazil, three in
Colombia, one in Mexico and two others in Peru _ a husband and
wife, who together produced a radio program, ``The People's
Voice,'' which advocated peasant's rights. The two were murdered
when 12 armed men entered their home. After the couple was buried,
relatives reported, a police officer visited them and suggested it
would be wise not to pursue an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Leal de Oliveira, the publisher and editor of a weekly in
Bahai, Brazil, was killed _ shot 14 times by men who followed him
in a white van as he drove home from work one day. He had exposed
the truth about corruption of local authorities. Likewise, Nelson
Carvajal, a radio reporter who had produced segments on poor
public-health services and alleged government corruption, was
killed _ shot 10 times outside the elementary school where he also
taught in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, the reward for good reporting, and for telling
the truth, is to get murdered by those who want to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism remains an extremely dangerous and difficult
profession, both for those who write the news and those we write
about. When journalists are reckless with facts and methods _ when
we break the rules of our unspoken code of ethics, not to mention
the country's written laws _ it is unfair to the people we are
writing about and extremely harmful to the credibility of our
profession.
</P>
<P>
   We can get so blinded by the excitement of breaking a story, or
of having a scoop, that we can ignore the truth or tailor it to fit
our needs. In the United States, where freedom of the press is
hailed as a founding virtue, isn't it inexplicable to mock that
gift? As journalists, anywhere in the world, we owe it to our
readers to give them the story based on the facts we have, not on
the ones we wish we had.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN had to retract a story about the U.S. military
using poison gas against American defectors in Laos in 1970. Two
producers were fired; meanwhile, Peter Arnett, the correspondent
who gave us the minute-by-minute account of the Persian Gulf War,
and who was hailed as the last reporter to leave Baghdad, is now
facing scrutiny for not having verified the allegations he
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's claim that he was merely ``the face'' delivering a
story on the air has brought protests from other correspondents
within the profession who don't want their reputations as serious
journalists to be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the way vital information is obtained? If the
truth is uncovered by devious means, do we applaud or pillory the
journalist? To what extent is this even more sensitive, given the
global nature of current reportage?
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a front-page apology, and has agreed
to pay more than $10 million to Chiquita Brands International,
after running a series of critical articles about the company's
business practices. Among the charges was the use of bribery in
Colombia and the spraying of dangerous pesticides in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Mike Gallagher, is accused of obtaining his
information by stealing more than 2,000 voice-mail recordings from
Chiquita. If Gallagher's allegations about Chiquita's business
practices are true, is it acceptable that he ``stole'' the voice
mail? Are breaking the law and lying in order to get information
going to be acceptable reporting tactics? Journalists are not
exempt from the law, experts say, and Gallagher, described by his
editors as a ``star,'' was nonetheless fired.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important U.S. publications had to fire rising stars.
The weekly political magazine, The New Republic, had to let go of
Stephen Glass, a 27-year-old staff writer, for fabricating
information in 27 of his 41 stories. The Boston Globe fired
Patricia Smith, a columnist whose work was so well-regarded that,
last year, she was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever reasons Arnett, Gallagher, Glass or Smith have for
submitting questionable work, it breeched the most important tenet
of journalism _ it didn't tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Glass got caught after he wrote a story, making up the name of
the company, complete with a full name, employees, profit chart and
a convention. When a high-tech reporter read about ``Jukt
Micronics,'' he wondered why he, who covered high-tech business for
an on-line magazine, had never heard of this firm _ it only exists
in Glass' story.
</P>
<P>
   For her column, Smith made up characters _ a woman dying of
cancer, a worker erecting barricades at the Boston Marathon and a
mother buying shoes for her young daughter. When her imaginary
sources spoke, they were so quotable, their words weaved so
perfectly into her stories, that the editors became suspicious.
Smith gave in to a temptation that as journalists we all know _
born of frustration at not having that perfect quote.
</P>
<P>
   What about Glass? Is he too lazy to do any real reporting or too
ambitious, interested only in promoting his byline and moving on to
higher-paying jobs? The New Republic is not known for high
remuneration. Or maybe he is a fiction writer in the trappings of a
reporter and he will now write a best-selling thriller about Jukt
Micronics that will be bought by Hollywood for millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes particularly poignant when we have, in other parts
of the world, journalists laying their lives on the line to tell
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The trials and tribulations of the four U.S. reporters who
manipulated the truth are a reminder that, as journalists, we have
difficult choices to make _ and that, at times, as human beings, we
make mistakes. The faces of the eight slain journalists are
reminders of the dangers and the bravery of telling it.

EASY DOES IT: 10 SIMPLE WAYS TO STAY FIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does everything that's good for us have to be so difficult?
</P>
<P>
   Exercising and eating right seem even more challenging at this
time of year, when the heat makes everyone feel sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the answer is to lower the bar. You can do your body some
good without turning into a marathon-running, power-bar-munching
health devotee. Here are 10 simple favors you can do for your body.
</P>
<P>
   1. Take the stairs. The elevator looks so inviting, but a
150-pound person can burn 1 calorie every five steps by climbing
stairs. Besides, you'll walk into the office flushed and a bit
breathless, so everyone will think you've had an interesting
morning.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grocery bag barbells. The next time you go grocery shopping,
say, ``I can get it myself'' to the bagger. Then tote that box of
Tide and lift that gallon of milk for some casual weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you work at a desk all day, take the time to walk away and
stretch every 20 or 30 minutes. This keeps your blood flowing
throughout the day and leaves you feeling not quite so tired, says
King Hoover, certified personal trainer at Fit for Life in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having day left at the end of (your) energy,
(you'll) have energy left at the end of the day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   4. Learn to read labels. Packaged foods are required to have
standard, easy-to-read labels that describe their ingredients,
including fat and sugar content. The labels also show what
percentage of daily nutrition requirements the foods contain, but
remember, those percentages are based on a 2,000-calorie daily
diet. Most women will gain weight on a 2,000-calorie diet, so
adjust percentages accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   5. Keep track of what you eat. Self-monitoring, or writing down
everything that passes your lips, creates an awareness of eating
patterns and helps you figure out where all those extra calories
come from. Two researchers reported in the journal Health
Psychology that women who meticulously recorded every item they ate
lost weight. Keep a notebook handy and remember to write down
everything.
</P>
<P>
   6. Use egg whites. You won't even notice the difference, but
there is an important one: ``The white is pure protein, and the
yolk is the fat and cholesterol,'' says Roger Villers, assistant
manager of Bally Total Fitness in Fort Worth. Two egg whites will
generally take the place of one whole egg. Other easy
substitutions: olive or canola oil for butter; low-fat or skim milk
for whole.
</P>
<P>
   7. Take a hike. Instead of circling the parking lot looking for
a space two feet from the door, go ahead and park your car in the
next ZIP code and walk. You'll probably get there just as fast. And
when you're walking anywhere, don't meander, pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   8. Cheap sunglasses. People who have had a great deal of sun
exposure are far more likely to develop cataracts as senior
citizens, and research also suggests that UV radiation may
contribute to macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness
in older Americans. A good pair of sunglasses doesn't have to be
expensive _ just make sure there's a sticker saying they block at
least 99 percent of ultraviolet rays. They help prevent wrinkling
around the eyes, too.
</P>
<P>
   9. Clean the house. Or work in the garden, or wash the car. An
hour spent vigorously washing the car is considered an hour of
light exercise, which, for a 150-pound person, burns 250 calories.
Burn an extra 250 calories a day for two weeks without increasing
what you eat and you should lose 1 pound.
</P>
<P>
   10. Have a glass of wine. After a hard day of lifting groceries
and washing the car, relax with a glass of chianti. In the past few
years a number of research studies, including work by Harvard heart
researcher Dr. Charles Hennekens, have suggested that antioxidants
in alcohol, particularly in red wine, have a beneficial effect on
heart disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After you spend a lot of time with a person, you begin to
understand them. Observing their actions and reactions to various
situations gives one a certain assurance. You acquire almost a
psychic ability to predict their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And there is some comfort in knowing that good, bad or ugly,
consistency reigns. If I do A, then I'm 99 percent sure that B will
happen. Of course, all this makes it easier to decide which voice
in your head to listen to. You do hear voices, too, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, something happens to make you question everything
you know. The world stops spinning and the sun rises in the west.
Everyone else has something to hold on to when gravity ceases to
be, but you go flying off into the horizon like a space shuttle
without a map. Know what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   Take the other day, for instance. We're preparing for an
early-morning outing and I yell to the kids, ``Turn off the
television and get dressed! We have to leave in 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I know that they will not turn off the television immediately.
They will pretend that they didn't hear me. I just want to plant
that seed in their little minds hoping it will grow into a thought
during a commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, I say, ``Turn that television off now! Get
dressed. It is 100 degrees outside. Do not put on your new fall
school clothes. Put on some old shorts and a T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   I hear them mumbling something kind about me as they turn off
the television reluctantly. Three minutes later, my youngest son is
downstairs dressed and ready to go. Indeed he's wearing some old
shorts and a faded T-shirt as instructed. They appear to be clean.
However, something is amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, did you brush your teeth and hair?''
</P>
<P>
   I ask this knowing the answer already.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says innocently, raising his eyebrows in surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't tell me to. You just said to get dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, I respond, ``Son, for over a decade now I've given
you the same instructions every morning. `Get up, make your bed,
brush your teeth, wash your face and ears, and put on clean
clothes.' Now how many times do I have to say that before you
remember?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   You must be specific with children.
</P>
<P>
   Giving them directions is like playing Simon Says. They will
only do exactly what ``Simon'' says and if ``Simon'' doesn't say
it, well, it's not happening.
</P>
<P>
   I try logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetie, why should you brush your teeth every day?''
</P>
<P>
   He stands on one foot and looks at the ceiling earnestly
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you tell us to?'' he offers hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because of the germs. Remember?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, cavities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. The germs are there every morning and every night.
You have to kill them before they hurt your teeth. I shouldn't have
to remind you every day. Just do it, OK? It's your job to keep your
body clean so it smells good and feels good. Now go brush your
teeth and while you're at it do something with your hair, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, his brother comes along looking halfway
presentable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, did you do everything: hair? teeth? make your bed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   This is too good to be true. I give him the once over and
inquire, ``Did you change underwear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to change our underwear, too?''
</P>
<P>
   See what I mean? Specific.
</P>
<P>
   It's something to hold onto.

 &HT;    TEXAS STUDENTS WIN CONTEST ON RAISING CAMPUS PROFILE OF SOCIAL
SECURITY
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Texas A&AMP;M University students won $10,000
scholarships and $100,000 for their school Tuesday by coming up
with a plan for promoting Social Security discussions on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The students, Nathan Cray of Lexington, Texas, and Daniel Seyle
of Eureka, Mo., emerged victorious from seven teams of finalists
chosen from 155 applications received by Americans Discuss Social
Security, a non-profit organization financed by the Pew Charitable
Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were asked to give a 15-minute presentation on how
they would make Social Security a topical issue on campuses. Unless
changes are made in the Social Security program, it will not be
able to pay full benefits after 2032, and many current college
students worry the money won't be available when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Cray and Seyle suggested holding forums on 800 campuses
nationwide to inform college students about Social Security, in
coordination with the National Collegiate Honors Council.
</P>
<P>
   Cray and Seyle will present their findings at a national forum
on Social Security to be held this November in Chicago, and will
supervise the implementation of their plan from September through
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of stunned,'' said Seyle. ``We didn't expect to
win. We hope we don't disappoint you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it could have gone to anyone,'' said Cray.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists included students from Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio; Stetson University in DeLand, Fla.; Syracuse University in
Syracuse, N.Y.; Stanford University in Stanford, Calif.; Boise
State University in Boise, Idaho, and Lock Haven University in Lock
Haven, Pa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While you browse the menu at Destinee, on East 61st
Street, your napkin is lifted and handed to you and a small white
plate is set down on your place setting. If you are lucky, it will
hold a precisely cut cylinder of smoked salmon, filled with fresh
shredded crab and dabbed with caviar, a glistening stain of pesto
oil spooned around it.
</P>
<P>
   In the microworld of amuse bouche, it is a generous three bites:
cool, salty and creamy but as candid and clean tasting as it looks.
Especially between a few sips of Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the perfect first course.
</P>
<P>
   The prelude to a meal is one of the greatest challenges for
chefs, and for those who entertain at home. It must be original and
fresh _ a light whisper of the good things to come _ and it must
withstand being made ahead of time. If you are a smart entertainer,
it is also relatively easy to make, because the main course and
dessert rarely come without labor.
</P>
<P>
   The chef Jean-Yves Schillinger's cigarette-shaped amuse bouche
is an ideal solution. It takes about five minutes to assemble, can
be made up to two days ahead of time and, astonishingly, has the
look of something a seasoned sushi chef might turn out.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the salmon roll, he cuts thin slices of smoked salmon
into rectangles and spreads them with a mixture of cooked crab,
cream, salt and pepper. He then rolls the salmon into cylinders,
chills them and, before serving, cuts the ends to make clean, neat
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Schillinger varies the sauces he drizzles on the plate.
Sometimes it is a pesto sauce loosened in olive oil, as in the
recipe below, or a zucchini oil, made by simmering olive oil and
zucchini skins until the oil turns grass green. When he is bored of
these, he says, he makes a beet oil by pureeing boiled beets with
olive oil and sherry vinegar and straining it to make a lipstick
pink sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For a stroke of decadence, Schillinger dabs a little caviar on
top, a detail you can skip at home. With or without the caviar, the
rolls make for a few fantastically light, silky little bites. Just
watch _ friends will soon be copying. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALMON ROLL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Jean-Yves Schillinger, Destinee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes plus 90 minutes chilling and freezing time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 very thin slices smoked salmon
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus 2 tablespoons cooked crab meat
</P>
<P>
   2{ tablespoons heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2{ teaspoons pesto (one with little cheese)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons caviar, optional
</P>
<P>
   Chervil sprig or basil leaves, for garnish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut each salmon slice into a 2-by-4-inch rectangle, reserving
trimmed edges for another use. Cover a baking sheet with plastic
wrap. Lay the salmon out on the plastic wrap, and cover with
another layer of plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium bowl, combine crab meat and cream, mixing with a
fork to break up the crab into fine shreds and bind it lightly with
the cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. For each salmon roll, lay a rectangle of salmon in the center
of a 12-inch by 6-inch square of plastic wrap. Evenly spread about
1 1/2 tablespoons of the crab mixture on the salmon. Begin rolling
the salmon on its long side, lifting the plastic wrap to help form
the salmon into a cigarette shape. Twist the ends of the plastic
wrap tightly to make the cylinder compact, and use your hands to
make it a uniform shape. Place rolls on a small baking sheet and
chill in freezer for 1 hour. The rolls may be made and frozen up to
2 days in advance.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a small bowl, whisk together the pesto and olive oil and
season to taste with salt. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. An hour before serving, remove salmon rolls from freezer.
Remove plastic wrap and cut the ends from each roll to make neat
cylinders. Let warm to room temperature. To serve, lay a salmon
roll in the center of each plate. Spoon a little caviar (if using)
on top of each and garnish with a chervil sprig or small basil
leaf. Spoon a little pesto oil on the plate and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings. &QL;

WHY ROAST IN THE HEAT? JUST POACH, ADD SAUCE, CHILL OUT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many cooks, I often shy away from cooking meat
on a hot summer's night _ unless someone else volunteers to fire up
the grill, of course. But roasts and other large cuts of meat do
not have to be forsaken completely this time of year: simply poach
them ahead of time and serve them cool, with a flavorful sauce on
top. With a salad on the side, you've got an easy supper that cuts
down on heat in the kitchen and gives the cook a well-deserved
break.
</P>
<P>
   European chefs have created some classic dishes using this
method. There is, for example, the Italian dish vitello tonnato,
poached veal served cold and thinly sliced in a tuna fish sauce.
The French dine on boeuf a la ficelle, poached beef fillet sliced
to show off its rosy interior and served cold with any one of a
number of sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Such dishes are delicious and hearty enough to please a crowd of
meat eaters without being too heavy. I like the idea so much that I
propose two recipes of my own, one for a boned and rolled loin of
pork, the other for a boned and rolled leg of lamb, both easy to
slice. They are poached and sauced just like the classics and taste
every bit as good, but are much more economical.
</P>
<P>
   The aromatic pork is accompanied by its very own sauce, which is
made by pureeing the vegetables the pork cooks with and then adding
a small amount of olive oil. (Be sure to ask your butcher to give
you the bones after the pork loin has been deboned, because they
will add flavor to the sauce.)
</P>
<P>
   The leg of lamb is very good with a sardine sauce that is a
variation on the tuna sauce made in Italy. An enriched vinaigrette
can be used as an alternative, its anchovies and capers making it a
tasty fish-meats-meat combination. (You can substitute the pork
loin as the meat in the lamb recipe and cook it in the same way:
pork, too, goes well with either sauce.)
</P>
<P>
   Both the pork and the lamb need to be turned in the pot so they
will cook evenly. This is particularly important with the lamb,
which will swell up and will not be fully covered by the liquid at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   AROMATIC PORK IN COLD VEGETABLE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus chilling time
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds onions, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   } pound carrots, trimmed, peeled and cut crosswise into 1-inch
pieces
</P>
<P>
   } pound celery, trimmed, strings removed and cut crosswise into
1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   \ cup fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves
</P>
<P>
   6 medium cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boneless loin of pork, rolled and tied, bones reserved
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a 10{-inch-wide braising pan or stockpot, bring 14 cups
water to a boil with the onions, carrots, celery, sage, cloves,
garlic, 1 tablespoon of the salt and the pork bones. Add the pork
loin, pushing it down into the pot until it is covered with water.
Return to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Turn
pork, and simmer for another 30 minutes. Turn the pork, and simmer
for 15 minutes more, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the
center of the loin registers 145 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove the pot from stove, and allow the meat to cool in the
liquid. Remove the meat to a platter. With a slotted spoon, scoop
the vegetables from pot. In a food processor, puree the vegetables
with the remaining salt and the olive oil; there should be about 6
cups of sauce.
</P>
<P>
   3. Slice the meat across into \-inch-thick slices; there should
be about two dozen slices in all.
</P>
<P>
   4. Spread 1 cup of sauce on a medium platter or in a baking
dish. Place a layer of pork slices on top of the sauce, and then
spread the slices with more sauce. Continue until all the sauce and
meat have been used. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1
hour or up to 3 days.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   HERB-SIMMERED LEG OF LAMB
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus chilling time
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   4 medium cloves garlic, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2} pounds boneless leg of lamb, rolled and tied
</P>
<P>
   Sardine sauce or enriched vinaigrette (see recipes).
</P>
<P>
   1. In a 10{-inch-wide braising pan or stockpot, bring 16 cups
water to a boil with the bay leaf, garlic and rosemary. Add the
lamb, and return to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 1 hour
30 minutes, turning every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove the pot from the stove, and allow the meat to cool in
the liquid. Remove meat from the liquid, and slice across into
\-inch slices; there should be 25 to 30 slices.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spread 1 cup of sardine sauce on a medium platter or in a
baking dish. Place a layer of the lamb slices on top of the sauce,
and then spread the slices with more sauce. Continue until all of
the sauce and meat have been used. Cover with plastic wrap, and
refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 3 days.
</P>
<P>
   If using the enriched vinaigrette instead, simply drizzle it
over the sliced meat just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   SARDINE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 cups olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 cans (3.75 ounces each) oil-packed sardines, drained and

   5 tablespoons green peppercorns packed in brine, rinsed
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons tarragon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1. In a food processor, pulse the eggs until slightly foamy,
about 5 times. With the machine running, pour the oil through the
feed tube a few drops at a time. When about 1 cup has been added
and the sauce starts to thicken, pour a little faster, in a slow,
steady stream, until the oil has been incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the sardines and 2 tablespoons of the peppercorns. Pulse
to combine, about 10 times. Add the vinegar and salt, and pulse to
combine.
</P>
<P>
   3. Scrape the sauce into a medium bowl, and stir in the
remaining peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 cups.
</P>
<P>
   ENRICHED VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>

   10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley, leaves only, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons anchovy paste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { cup red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons capers, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 hard-cooked eggs, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor, pulse the parsley, anchovy paste, mustard,
salt, pepper and vinegar to combine. With the machine running,
slowly pour in the oil. Remove to a small bowl, and stir in the
capers and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 cups.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the nearly five-year history of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, there are many stories of
exponential growth in trade, but give credit to Leon Yeh of the
City of Industry for his marketing acumen in recognizing what
Mexican consumers would crave _ ice pops.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic-sheathed treats are flying off the shelves in Mexico
City, Guadalajara and in Baja, and so are the Jello and canned
seafood and pineapples Yeh distributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are products people want, and they can afford our
price,'' said Yeh, owner of Cosmos International, whose business in
Mexico this year is up 100 percent and is likely to double next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA speeds everything up. NAFTA makes it possible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeh is one of many California business people reaping the
benefits of NAFTA, which will eliminate all tariffs on goods
flowing between Canada, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   New statistics show that exports of California products to
Mexico were up 31 percent, or $750 million, in the first quarter of
this year compared to the first quarter of 1997, for a total of
$3.2 billion. The exports grew 33 percent last year, to $12
billion, much of it facilitated by NAFTA, according to the
California Trade and Commerce Agency.
</P>
<P>
   This followed growth in yearly exports between California and
Mexico of 23 percent and 33 percent in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson noted that California exports remain strong
despite financial troubles in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased sales to Mexico, Europe and Greater China continue
to outweigh losses to some key Asian markets,'' Wilson, a
Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
   The exports to Mexico are led by electronics, electrical and
computer equipment, and industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mexico passed Canada to become California's No. 2
export market behind Japan. Even though Japan's economy is 12 times
larger than Mexico's, Mexico is on a path to become California's
No. 1 export market, trade authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of foreign investment in Mexico comes from the
United States, and there is no sign the momentum will slow.
Mexico's gross domestic product is growing, and the Clinton
administration believes that NAFTA played a critical role in
energizing the Mexican economy after the collapse of the peso in
late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Mexico directly and indirectly support 169,400 jobs
in the state, according to the California Trade and Commerce
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA is providing benefits to both sides of the border. A
healthy trade environment is going to be good for everyone,'' said
Jim McCabe, president of Bank of America-Mexico and head of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   While it did not produce the ``giant sucking sound'' of jobs
from the United States that Ross Perot projected, NAFTA may never
be universally loved.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic parts and equipment exported to Mexico are
``revolving door exports'' or ``industrial tourists,'' said Harley
Shaiken, labor and trade specialist at the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment is bound for assembly plants where low-paid
workers assemble products that, in many cases, are returned to the
United States, Shaiken said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, before NAFTA, 40 percent of U.S. merchandise exports to
Mexico were temporary exports, while by 1996 the figure was 62
percent, Shaiken said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation and the promise of NAFTA was opening up a
consumer market that was clamoring for U.S. goods. The reality has
been the market was opened, but the purchasing power is not
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income inequality in Mexico remains one of Mexico's central
economic problems, and its economic growth is not translating into
something most Mexicans feel. The promise of a more rapidly growing
consumer society really requires not just economic growth but a
more equitable distribution of that growth.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others find fault in NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the economic growth occurring in Mexico is not
benefiting the workers, and statistics that show growth are skewed
and do not reflect reality,'' said Juliette Beck, coordinator of
the California Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of labor and
environmental organizations in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticisms, NAFTA supporters say the treaty has
definitely benefited Mexico while helping the economy at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of NAFTA, any problems _ immigration, labor,
environmental concerns _ would be worse today,'' said Jay Ziegler,
spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not have any prospect of having made the progress we
have achieved in trade. This is particularly true for California,
as California overwhelmingly produces high-tech exports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Silicon Valley giants, Hewlett-Packard has had a presence
in Mexico since 1966 and opened its first plant in Guadalajara in
1982. But enormous company growth in Mexico has occurred since
NAFTA took effect, company spokesman Michael Fournell said.
</P>
<P>
   In Guadalajara, the company manufactures paper-handling devices
and loads computers with software that is sent to markets in Mexico
and other Latin American countries. Between 1995 and 1997, sales of
H-P products in Mexico and Latin America rose 216 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is in part a result of NAFTA. The movement of goods and
services were made easy,'' Fournell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA is the uninhibited movement of goods and services.
Without it we wouldn't be able to sell as much.''

WHEN NOTHING STICKS, THANK GOODNESS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The blueberry muffins tumbled out of the baking pan
with barely a tap. Chocolate chip cookie dough spread into thick,
even cookies and lifted effortlessly from the sheet. A pan
enveloping a cherry almond cake slipped off like a swim cap. For
anyone who has ever lost half a cake when unmolding, it was
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   The trick was in the bakeware: the pans and sheets are all made
of a floppy material that looks and feels like rubber but is
actually a glass weave, coated with silicone. It can withstand
temperatures as high as 500 degrees. It requires no greasing. And
it is reusable. But its greatest edge is that nothing sticks to it.
And I mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Demarle, a cookware company in France, recently introduced the
bakeware in the United States, under the brand names Silpat (which
are mats used to line baking sheets) and Flexipan (a line of muffin
and cake pans).
</P>
<P>
   Silicone-baking surfaces first came into use back in the 1960s,
when convection ovens became popular in France. Baguettes baked in
the ovens tended to stick to their metal trays. Guy Demarle, a
scientist specializing in silicone, discovered that coating the
trays with that substance stopped the sticking.
</P>
<P>
   That led to his invention of Silpat, which was introduced in
France in 1982. It is still used primarily in professional
kitchens, where it replaces costly parchment paper, which must be
discarded after one or two uses. Silpat mats can be used as many as
2,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Demarle company developed Flexipan, which is
similar to Silpat, except that the material is slightly thinner.
That makes it more flexible, so unmolding is easier. Muffin molds,
for instance, turn inside out so you can push muffins out from the
bottom. Beside the standard muffin and cake pans, there are molds
for petit fours, mini-muffins, pyramids, domes and rectangular
cakes. (The more unusual shapes are only recently available to home
cooks.)
</P>
<P>
   In a side by side test with conventional bakeware, Silpat and
Flexipan were impressive _ but not always the best choice. There
are some things that a standard pan still does better.
</P>
<P>
   A batch of chocolate chip cookies baked on a Silpat mat browned
evenly and did not stick. The mat's lightly textured surface
prevented the cookies from spreading too much, keeping them plump
and thick. A nonstick baking sheet produced nearly the same
results; on a regular buttered baking sheet, the cookies spread a
little more and browned more on the bottom. Silpat made the biggest
difference with paper-thin cookies like tuile, or fragile cookies
like meringue, where any sticking could destroy the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   To test the Flexipan, I first made blueberry muffins, which are
notorious for grabbing hold of the pan and breaking in half when
unmolding. I spooned the sticky muffin batter directly into the
ungreased muffin mold and put it in the oven. When the muffins were
done, they pulled away as if they were made of plastic. The sides
of the muffin browned less than the bottoms, which gained extra
heat from the metal baking sheet supporting the Flexipan (use an
insulated baking sheet if you have one), but they were still moist
and tender.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in a buttered stainless-steel muffin pan, the
muffins took on a brown and cakey exterior. For these delicate
muffins, the Flexipan was better. But for banana nut muffins, the
Flexipan faltered. The milder heat on the sides failed to
caramelize the exterior and give the muffins a depth of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The Flexipan cake pan had the most interesting results. The
cherry almond cake rose as much as the same cake baked in a
stainless-steel cake pan, but the exteriors of the cakes were
markedly different. The Flexipan _ which basically peeled off the
cake _ produced a pale, moist and porous exterior. The buttered and
floured stainless-steel cake pan produced a much darker cake with a
stiff, dense crust.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more desirable? The Flexipan is certainly better for
uniced cakes, like pound cake, coffee cake or angel food cake,
which are more pleasant without a heavy crust. The stainless steel
is better for a cake that is to be iced _ a smooth, crustlike
exterior makes it easier.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Silpat mat nor the Flexipan molds are dishwasher
safe. It's not a big deal, though, since nothing sticks to them.
</P>
<P>
   At Williams-Sonoma stores, a seven-and-a-half-inch Flexipan cake
pan costs $28; a mini-muffin pan is $36. The muffin pan and other
small molds like pyramids, doughnuts, domes and mini-tarts are
available at Bridge Kitchenware, 214 East 52nd Street (Third
Avenue), (800) 274-3435. The pans are professional size (16-by-24
inches), for $72.50, but can be cut with scissors to fit smaller
baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Baking sheets, 13-by-18 inches, are $26 at Williams-Sonoma;
$17.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein of reusable, nonstick materials, Du Pont
produces Teflon liners that can transform standard bakeware into a
nonstick sheet or pan. As thin as paper, the silvery-black material
comes in various shapes and sizes to line baking pans (9-by-13
inch, 10-by-15 inch and 12-by-16 inch) and 9-inch round cake pans.
The sheets work much like parchment paper. Cookies lift off easily,
but the Teflon sheets are so thin and light that they sometimes
stick to the bottom of the spatula. Washed in the dishwasher or by
hand, they last about 200 uses. A package of six sheets is $16.98
at Zabar's.

ANTINORI GUADO AL TASSO 1995, BOLGHERI, TUSCANY. ABOUT $50. 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guado al Tasso is a new so-called Super-Tuscan wine from
Marchesi Antinori. In the simplest terms, a Super-Tuscan is an
expensive wine from the Tuscan region of Italy, usually made from
non-traditional grape varieties. The blend here is 60 percent
cabernet sauvignon, 30 percent merlot and 10 percent syrah: all the
grapes were grown at the Antinori family's estate, Tenuta
Belvedere, at Bolgheri, southwest of Florence on Italy's western
seacoast.
</P>
<P>
   After blending, the wine spent 14 months in French oak barrels.
This is the first vintage of Guado al Tasso to be released in this
country. The wine shows a remarkable combination of roundness and
underlying structure. The cabernet influence is profound but there
is no mistaking the wine's most elegant Italian pedigree.

STILL LIFE WITH SHELL BEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some artists, like Monet and Toulouse-Lautrec, were passionate
about food and liked to cook. Matisse, however, was no foodie, so
the connection between him and the food of the Cote d'Azur in
``Matisse: A Way of Life in the South of France,'' by Gilles Plazy,
Jean-Bernard Naudin and Coco Jobard (Rizzoli, $40), is merely a
device for a lavish book.
</P>
<P>
   The result has great visual appeal, with reproductions of
Matisse's vibrant paintings, an easygoing biography with an
emphasis on the years that he lived in the South of France, recipes
from that region and lush photographs of food throughout.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the occasional still life with fruit, Matisse's art
is not about food. Nor is there much in the book that explains his
taste in food or how food related to his life and art. In fact, the
book has much more to say about Matisse and women and Matisse and
decor.
</P>
<P>
   We are told that he liked seafood, especially oysters, which he
painted; that he kept cakes on hand for his models; that he liked
to nibble on palmiers and that he had a Polish cook.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recipes in this book, including those for
pissaladiere, mullet roasted with tomatoes a la nicoise,
bouillabaisse, eggplant gratin, stuffed vegetables and fig tart,
are among the Provencal classics that can be found in other
cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   North African dishes, like carrot salad with cumin, relate to
Matisse's visit to Morocco and his fascination with its colors and
patterns. There are a few Russian recipes, because in the 1920s
Nice had become a haven for Russian emigres, one of whom became a
model for Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are generally well written and easy to follow,
though few suggest using food processors. One quibble with the
recipe for pissaladiere, the nicoise onion tart: It calls for one
pound of basic bread dough, which the book says can ``sometimes be
ordered from a bakery,'' but it does not give a clue as to how to
make it or even how much flour is necessary to make a pound of
dough.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions for cooking onions gently for one and a half
hours for the topping, however, are on target. Not allowing for a
shortcut gives the onions the proper texture and mellow flavor.
</P>
<P>
   As for the five and a half pounds of beans in the pod for a bean
salad that serves six, the amount sounds excessive, but it is
correct. Few books offer recipes for fresh shell beans, which are
available now through the fall. The one in this book is worth
having.

`AOL.COM': THE SECRET TO ITS SUCCESS? SEX, AT LEAST IN PART 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the brief, event-packed decade since its founding, America
Online has become a company with that rarest and most valuable of
assets, a name, like that of Coca-Cola or IBM, so widely known as
to be synonymous with its business. It wasn't easy, as we discover
in Kara Swisher's detailed, warts-and-all history of one of the
great capitalist success stories of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other start-up companies in the age of consumer
electronics, America Online could have flared briefly and then
extinguished itself in the sea of rapid change and new competition.
Ms. Swisher, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, explains why,
instead, the company came from behind to outlast its competition
and become dominant in its field.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swisher's corporate history is well researched and
comprehensive. She lays out the company's prehistory, its origins
in the mind of a failed visionary named Bill Von Meister.
</P>
<P>
   She describes in dramatic terms its narrow escape from the
hungry jaws of Microsoft Corp.; its various troubles with its
accounting methods, power failures and other technical failures;
its internal debates over such questions as pornography on the
Internet and how to meet the steady stream of new competitors that
rose to challenge it.
</P>
<P>
   She describes every up and every down of the company's history,
when the stock went south and when it resumed its upward marches,
and the strategy it forged to keep increasing its membership rolls
even when some analysts were saying that the service it offered was
obsolescent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in other words, much to learn in Ms. Swisher's
account, though it must be said that her manner of telling it is
often annoyingly gimmicky, as if she were writing for people who
don't actually like to read.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that ``AOL.COM'' is loaded with semi-explained
terms, understandable perhaps to the regular readers of PC World
and Wired but less familiar to those of us who do not gobble down
the computer literature. Her story is speckled with phrases like
``real-time interaction and joint navigation for the Internet,''
``branded but essentially repurposed content,'' ``Internet dial-up
carriage'' and ``per-processor licensing agreements'' that might
not be understood by many readers.
</P>
<P>
   Every subculture develops a jargon that outsiders have
difficulty understanding, which is why computer instruction manuals
are often such gibberish to the otherwise literate. Ms. Swisher
does not write gibberish, but she needs to be more mindful of her
own subcultural immersion.
</P>
<P>
   She also writes with all sorts of supposedly enlivening devices,
like single-phrase paragraphs (``It was time, in other words, to
jump off the cliff.''), narrational teasers (``Was it over?'' is
her opening line) and hip locutions (``To help goose its image as
the cool place to be in cyberspace, AOL had announced its first
service branding advertising campaign in September.'').
</P>
<P>
   It's as if Ms. Swisher is not confident in the intrinsic
interest of her subject and therefore feels she has to juice it up
to hold the reader's interest. The result is a story whose
particularity is partly obscured by formulaic, imitative
storytelling techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Swisher need not have worried. Her story is very
interesting. Mainly it is a close look into the ways of the
high-tech business world. Along the way, it tells the history of an
idea, the online idea that entertainment and information could be
provided to people in their homes via telephone lines and computers
and that they could form electronic communities of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Finally ``AOL.COM'' is a classic rags-to-riches tale, centering
on a young entrepreneur named Steve Case, AOL's leading spirit,
whose worth went from middle-class ordinariness to $400 million in
about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Case, born in Hawaii and educated at Williams College in
Massachusetts, was a 24-year-old ``mid-level marketing drone'' at
Procter &AMP; Gamble in Wichita when he went to the annual Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 1983. There he met Bill Von
Meister, a man who spent a lifetime having brilliant commercial
ideas linked to the information revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Von Meister, who died in 1995, had formed a company called
Control Video Corp. to sell video-game software to users
electronically. CVC, which became a company called Quantum Computer
Services in 1985, used the new online technology to allow users to
set up chat rooms and ``talk'' to each other via computers at home.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1987, with Case in charge, Quantum signed a contract
with Apple Computer to run an online service that soon became AOL,
the smallest of the online services, trailing Compuserve and
Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swisher recounts separate efforts by Paul Allen and Bill
Gates, co-founders of Microsoft, to acquire the young company. She
describes the marketing campaign and the small decisions that led
AOL to victory in the online competition, like the campaign to send
out 250 million disks containing free AOL software to just about
anybody who wanted to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To prevail, AOL had to become ubiquitous,'' Ms. Swisher
writes, adding later that one of the ways it did become ubiquitous
was by declining to monitor or restrict the huge volume of sex talk
that took place in its many thousands of electronic chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why AOL has eight million members and Prodigy had faded
to a shadow of its former self,'' she quotes one Prodigy executive
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   She takes us through some dubious accounting practices that
enabled America Online to keep the stock price up and to raise
money for expansion and acquisitions. It was not, in short, just a
good idea that enabled Case and his team to prevail. It was a
combination of the vision thing and a swashbuckling way of doing
business that led to the company's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clunky, jargon-strewn style of Ms. Swisher's telling
of it, the AOL saga is a fascinating and instructive story.

(Houston Street), the look of decades past. It's fitting enough,
considering that the shelves lining the walls and balcony of this
cool oasis are filled with old books for sale, including cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cookbooks, at least, you won't find rare collectibles
here, but the cooking section sometimes yields treasures, like the
complete Time-Life ``Foods of the World'' series that was published
nearly 30 years ago, or copies, in excellent condition, of both
volumes of ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' the book that
put Julia Child on the map ($18 for both).
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the cookbooks were published in the 1980s, I
discovered a trip down memory lane with the 1960 ``Great
Restaurants of America'' by Ted Patrick and Silas Spitzer, for $3.
It described some places, like La Maisonette in Cincinnati and
Galatoire's in New Orleans, that are still going strong, but also
fed the appetite for nostalgia with Luchow's, the Brussels and Le
Pavillon in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook section is located behind the cafe, which serves
light food, including soups like a fine gazpacho ($2.75 or $4.25),
wrap sandwiches ($5.95), excellent home-baked fruit tarts and pies
($4.25 to $2.75 a portion) and refreshing lemonade, iced tea, iced
coffee and tart Jamaican sorrel ($1.50).
</P>
<P>
   Housing Works is the nonprofit organization that helps people
with AIDS find living quarters. And as cozy as the cafe is in the
cold of winter, on a hot and humid day it is comfortable as can
be. &QL;

   How long ago was it that yellow tomatoes started to be widely
sold, first at farm stands and then in fancy produce markets? Ten
years perhaps? Fifteen? Now, for the first time, they are available
canned.
</P>
<P>
   D'Oro diced yellow tomatoes were developed, the Austin, Texas,
company says, at the request of chefs. These are meaty Roma-style
tomatoes that have a confetti look because the pieces range in
color from pale yellow to deep orange.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor is surprisingly fresh and beautifully intense, with a
note of lush sweetness. Though there is some salt added to the
tomatoes, they only provide 50 milligrams of sodium in a half-cup,
considerably less than in many popular brands of canned tomatoes.
Yellow tomatoes are naturally less acidic than red ones.
</P>
<P>
   These diced yellow tomatoes would be excellent in soups: a
golden Manhattan clam chowder, for example. They can intensify a
risotto or be used to make two sauces, one red and one yellow, for
grilled fish. The tomatoes are about $4 for a 28-ounce can at
Zabar's, 80th Street and Broadway, and at Gourmet Garage, 453
Broome Street (Mercer Street), 301 East 64th Street and 2567
Broadway (96th Street). &QL;

   Mangia, 40 Wall Street (Nassau Street), has now opened the back
half of its new cafe and prepared-foods shop. Among the features is
the grandest of the Mangia salad bars, with 90 different antipasto
dishes ($6.25 a pound). Other counters offer hot and cold
sandwiches, folded Roman-style pizzas, soups and main dishes,
including some, like skewers of sea scallops and veal Milanese,
which are cooked to order. Desserts range from biscotti to rich
cakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sumptuous feast that deserves better than plastic cutlery
and paper plates, but Sasha Muniak, the owner, said, ``It's the
only way we can afford to keep our prices where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangia has bought the D&AMP; G Bakery on Mulberry Street, which it
is using to produce its breads and pastries. And a week ago it
closed the branch that it opened last year in Macy's Cellar
because, Muniak said, ``We didn't feel we had enough control in
that location.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Porto Rico Importing, one of the city's oldest coffee and tea
companies, has opened its fourth location. The new store, 50 Grove
Street (Bleecker Street), is similar to the others, with coffees,
teas and equipment for sale, as well as a coffee bar.

   PROSSER, Wash. _ Mike Hogue stopped the pickup truck and pointed
across my chest out the passenger window. ``Red currants,'' he
said. ``We used to have more red currants than anyone in the state,
but we got out of that business.''
</P>
<P>
   Further on, he stopped again. ``This used to be all peppermint;
that little beat-up building there is where we distilled it. Once I
went right to Chicago and sold a barrel of peppermint oil directly
to the Wrigleys. We got out when that business died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought: ``I came 3,000 miles to talk about wine, and this
guy's showing me a peppermint still. Something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was wrong. I was visiting one of the most successful
wine producers in the state of Washington, and he was simply
showing me how he and a lot of other people here do business.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has long played second fiddle to California and
even to Oregon when it comes to wines. Once that ranking may have
been justified. No longer. There is an elegance, an intensity, a
new degree of excellence in the best of the Washington wines that
deserve the attention of wine drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Winemaking in Washington is rarely the spiritual journey it
often is in California. These folks are not ex-surgeons seeking
more meaningful lives, or millionaires looking for a hobby with tax
write-offs. They are third- and fourth-generation farmers,
hard-nosed and pragmatic: if grapes and wine don't make it, out
they go. There will always be a new apple variety the Taiwanese
will pay a fortune to get. And there are hops to grow, and cherries
and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Hogue, for example, the owner of Hogue Cellars, farms some 1,700
acres, of which only 500 are wine grapes. Most of the grapes that
go into the variety of wines he makes _ mostly merlot and cabernet
sauvignon _ come from other farmers whose crops are as diversified
as his.
</P>
<P>
   This is an unusual wine state. Almost all the vineyards are
here, to the east of the Cascade Mountains, while nearly all the
people live to the west. The West Side, from Seattle to the
Pacific, is cool, green and rainy; the east is desertlike, hot and
dry. Thanks to the old volcanoes that make up the Cascade Range,
this desert is composed of rich volcanic soil in which almost
anything, including wine grapes, will grow, if irrigated.
</P>
<P>
   The melting snowcaps of those same mountains provide much of the
water this bounteous land needs. In fact, water is plentiful
because both the Cascades and the Rockies to the east channel their
runoff into the mighty Columbia River system and its long chain of
reservoir lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's best-known wineries are on the West Side:
Chateau Ste. Michelle, Columbia Winery, Quilceda Creek, Andrew
Will, DeLille Cellars. Handsome tourist meccas nestled among the
rhododendrons and evergreens of the Seattle suburbs, they offer
visitors all of the wine experience save a vineyard view. Their
grapes, and often their wines as well, come from the farm country
hundreds of miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who see only the West Side wineries miss the essence of
the Washington wine business: its vastness. It is made up of a
major viticultural region, the Columbia Valley, which has within it
two subregions in southeast corner of the state, the Yakima Valley
and Walla Walla. A fourth region, Puget Sound, encompasses a
handful of vineyards that manage to grow wine grapes in the
less-than-hospitable climate on the West Side of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   There are only about 14,000 acres of wine grapes in the state _
compared with some 350,000 acres in California _ but the areas
available for future plantings are immense. In the
10.7-million-acre Columbia Valley only 8,000 acres are currently
planted in wine grapes. The situation is similar in the two
subregions: the Yakima Valley encompasses 640,000 acres, of which
6,000 are in vines; Walla Walla has 180,000 acres, of which only a
few hundred are in in wine grapes. The Puget Sound wine region has
about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Yakima Valley and Walla Walla regions stretch from just
beyond the city of Yakima, the fruit capital of Washington,
eastward almost to the Idaho border. The Walla Walla viticultural
area straddles the Washington-Oregon border. In fact, some of the
best Walla Walla wines, including sought-after merlots from
Leonetti Cellars, are made from grapes grown in the Oregon part of
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leonetti and Hogue, more and more of the eastern Washington
wineries are becoming familiar to wine enthusiasts across the
country. Along Interstate 82 in southeast Washington are Staton
Hills, in Wapato; ; Bonair and Covey Run in Zillah; Washington
Hills Cellars in Sunnyside; little Chinook Wines, just across the
road from Hogue here in Prosse, and Preston Wine Cellars and Gordon
Brothers in Pasco. Farther east, not far from the city of Walla
Walla, are Woodward Canyon and L'Ecole 41, both in Lowden.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking wineries in this part of Washington is
Columbia Crest in Paterson, about 30 miles south of Prosser.
Columbia Crest, which sits amid some 2,000 acres of vines on a
ridge overlooking the Columbia River and Oregon beyond, is owned by
Stimson Lane, which is also the parent company of Chateau Ste.
Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   I wandered around the handsome reception center at Columbia
Crest one day, one of six visitors in a building designed to handle
hundreds. But then, Paterson is not exactly on any heavily traveled
tourist route. Stimson Lane, which is obviously building for the
future, has another 500 acres of vines downstream from Paterson at
Canoe Ridge. A neighbor there is the Canoe Ridge Winery, owned by
Chalone Inc., which also owns Chalone Vineyards and other wineries
in California.
</P>
<P>
   With a day or two of free time, a visitor might take in half a
dozen or so of these wineries because they are relatively close
together. Close for Washington, that is; Yakima County alone is
about the size of Connecticut. A wine tour here requires a bit more
driving than one in the Napa Valley, where there is a winery
entrance every 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Washington's wine history is brief compared with other regions.
A few wines were made here in the middle of the 19th century, but
the modern wine industry dates back only to the 1960s. Then,
Washington law mandated that wines and spirits be purchased only
from state stores and heavy taxes were imposed on wines from out of
state, discouraging interest in good wine,
</P>
<P>
   The barriers began to come down when California threatened to
ban Washington apples from being sold in California unless
Washington's tax barriers to California wines were lowered. By 1970
there were about 70 acres of chardonnay grapes in the state, 110 of
riesling, 150 of cabernet sauvignon, 10 of merlot and 45 of chenin
blanc, according to one estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A major influence in the early days was Associated Vintners, a
group of amateurs who first experimented with winemaking in Seattle
in the early 1960s. Associated became a commercial venture in 1962
and released its first wines in 1969. In 1972, the company bought
its first vineyard at Sunnyside here in Eastern Washington and in
1983 changed its name to Columbia Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Winery's winemaker, David Lake, is probably
Washington's best-known wine figure. A Canadian who was raised in
England and spent several years in the London wine trade, Lake
recrossed the Atlantic in 1977 and apprenticed himself to several
Oregon winemakers. He joined Associated Vintners in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, after my brief sojourn in the Yakima Valley,
Lake picked me up in Seattle, and we drove out to Woodinville,
northeast of the city, to taste some Columbia wines, all of them
made from Eastern Washington grapes. Along the way, on a
refreshingly chilly Pacific Northwest morning, happily against the
flow of Seattle's commuter traffic, he talked about Washington
wines. Like Mike Hogue, he was pleased with the present and
optimistic about the future of Washington winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling all we can make,'' he said, ``and I don't mean
just the big wineries. It's taken a long time, but we're beginning
to get the respect and the attention we really deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake makes wines from grapes from various vineyards in the
Yakima Valley, the best being from Otis, near Grandview; from Red
Willow, south of Yakima, and from Sagemoor, over near Pasco.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Willow merlots are rich, intense and linger in the
mouth. They are big, impressive wines with more Bordeaux elegance
than California heft. A surprise, to me anyway, was a 1995 syrah,
made from Red Willow vineyard grapes. It reminded me of some wines
made by Jean-Luc Colombo, a brilliant young winemaker in the Rhone
Valley in France. It's a rare California syrah that can display the
same combination of intensity and restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia produces some attractive wines meant for newcomers to
wine drinking. They include an uncomplicated riesling and a light
chenin blanc. I enjoyed the riesling, but not as much as the one I
tried several days earlier at the Covey Run winery in Zillah, to
Lake's. Covey Run happens to be owned by Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Other wines sampled (and enjoyed) on this excursion included a
1994 merlot from L'Ecole 41, actually made from grapes grown on the
Oregon side of the Walla Walla district; 1994 Leonetti cabernet
sauvignon, even though it does sell for around $50; a 1994 cabernet
sauvignon from Preston; a 1994 merlot from Gordon Brothers, and a
terrific 1994 cabernet franc, from Hogue Cellars' Genesis line.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, these wineries produce small amounts of these
special bottlings. Washington's wine production is growing, but its
potential has yet to be tapped. It is, one might say, as large as
the state itself.

CHAMPAGNE AS THE FRENCH KNOW IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Veuve Clicquot is the kind of champagne you can take to any
party and know that your host will instantly recognize and
appreciate it. This is because EVERYONE brings it.
</P>
<P>
   But Veuve Clicquot is not what the French bring to dinner
parties. They often bring lesser-known champagnes like the brut
rose premier cru by Nicolas Feuillatte (pronounced nee-co-LA
foy-YAHT), a small winemaker that puts out respectable, affordably
priced champagne. The French know it and like it, but it is hardly
considered fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Americans, the French do not turn up their noses at rose
champagne. Perhaps they know something we don't. The Nicolas
Feuillatte brut rose is a beautiful color, like the pink on the
skin of a ripe peach. It has a floral aroma, a tingly sweetness and
a small but sharp bubble with a dry _ though not tongue-curling _
finish. It is a luscious, approachable champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The standard-size 750-ml bottle comes in a tall cream-color
metal cylinder _ perhaps a little more understated than
Veuve-Clicquot's stiff black and orange boxes, but nonetheless
gift-worthy. But buy it up quickly because, come September, it will
be replaced by a 1994 vintage, retailing for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Feuillatte brut rose champagne is sold at
Sherry-Lehmann, 679 Madison Ave. (61st Street), (212) 838-7500, for
$21.95; at Acker Merrall &AMP; Condit, 160 West 72nd St. (Broadway),
(212) 787-1700, for $23, and at Beekman Liquors, 500 Lexington Ave.
(47th Street), (212) 759-5857, for $24.99.
</P>
<P>
   The champagne is also available at Manhattan bars and
restaurants, including Bubble Lounge, Bouley Bakery, Cafeteria,
Waterloo Brasserie and the Algonquin Hotel.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo., with its stockyards and slaughterhouses, and
restaurant hickory fires burning day and night, is the world
capital of barbecue, or so says the Kansas City Bar B Q Connection
(www.rbjb.com/rbjb/bbq.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Texas, Alabama and North Carolina all have their supporters _
and sites for staking their claims. But Kevin Halle, a New
Jerseyite who now lives in Mississippi and runs the capacious
Backyard Bar-B-Que site (home.cybertron.com/khalle/bb00002.htm),
says he has tried barbecue from all over the world, and to him the
real capital is in any barbecue lover's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever that mythical place may be, barbecue is virtually
sizzling on the Internet this season. Most barbecue sites seem to
be in the South, where barbecue, real barbecue, means pork. It's
mainly in the North that the art form ventures into beef, lamb,
chicken and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Home barbecuers might want to skip the regional pit wars and go
straight to a basic rundown on the most popular ways to cook
outdoors _ quick grilling, smoke roasting and ``true-blue,
slow-cooked barbecue.'' These are the ABCs of the Barbecue Man,
Larry Gerber (novaplaza.com/bbqman/hints.shtml), who is on radio
and television in the Chicago area. Click on Recipes for examples
like barbecued back ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Halle, who is a Navy chef (and a shore-side barbecuer), provides
a menu of foot-of-the-page links to navigate his site. He is lavish
with recipes, including tequila chicken wings, grilled swordfish
and buffalo stew. Go to his links menu for sauces, marinades, rubs
and pastes.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a page titled ``How to Cook a Whole Hog.'' (It
takes about 24 hours, giving the family plenty of time to watch a
video of, say, ``Babe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Better Homes and Gardens (www.bhglive.com/survival) comes to the
aid of backyard cooks with a summer's worth of meat-and-potatoes
barbecue recipes. Tick a box for flank steak or sweet peppers or
new potatoes, and up come grilling instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Another food site worth knowing, food.epicurious.com, has put up
three pages of barbecue recipes for the summer from Gourmet and Bon
Appetit magazines called How Do You Want It? Flip This and Summer
Flames. One of them, not always the same one, can be found by
clicking on Eating, and it will link to the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bobby Seale, the onetime Black Panther, has a barbecue site
on the Web (www.bobbyseale.com/bbq.html). It's there to sell his
barbecue cookbook, but he offers samples and a mini-autobiography,
with much about black American cooking and speech and the West
African roots of both (click on BobbyQue? Yes!).
</P>
<P>
   Of childhood barbecues, he writes: ``Under enormous tents which
sheltered us from the blazing Texas sun, we'd feast on dishes
prepared by the sisters of the church. Sweet potato pie, fried
chicken and fish, and barbecues of smoked beef and spareribs were
prepared by the men and women at the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   The booster sites on the Web are generally more interested in
reviewing regional barbecue restaurants than in recipes. For
Alabama, for instance, see www.wsfa.com/bbq.htm. Texas Barbeque
(pages.prodigy.com/TX/connieblack/bbq.html) offers chat, reviews,
recipes and yarns. For North Carolina, try
roscoe.simplenet.com/pork/pork.html.
</P>
<P>
   A slight counterweight to this Southern predominance is the New
England Barbecue Society site (nebs.netrelief.com), which is
dedicated to teaching Yankees _ or others not born to barbecue _
the difference between grilling and real wood- or charcoal-smoked
pit barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a member of the Smoke Ring, 121 linked barbecue
sites, some selling grills and sauces. Those with barbecue in their
hearts, of course, can't get enough of this stuff. &QL;

   ``I developed a knack for substituting ingredients as a result
of living in rural areas for most of my adult life,'' Lori Alden,
keeper of the Cook's Thesaurus (www.switcheroo.com), said by
e-mail. Those areas have included West Africa and the north coast
of California, where Ms. Alden teaches economics at Humboldt State
University and her husband is a forester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often substitute when I can't find exotic ingredients or
when I want to avoid making a long trip to the store,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of her lifetime interest appear on the very thorough
pages of her site. Her suggestions for substitutes are intended for
dieters looking for low-fat or low-calorie alternatives and for
gourmets on a budget, among others. Ms. Alden offers 10 categories
(like vegetables, alcohol, meat and fish, grain products), each
subdivided further.
</P>
<P>
   Her Sugars page (under flavorings and accompaniments) describes
how baking will be affected by the use of powdered sugar, corn
syrup, rice syrup, honey (she warns against feeding it to infants),
maple syrup plus baking soda, granulated fructose or molasses.
Under Milk and Cream, she gives substitutes for Chantilly cream,
clotted cream, whipped cream and others, with discussions of
butterfat content. For those with lactose maldigestion, milk
allergy or casein intolerance, she also has a No Milk page.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alden's bibliography (click on Sources and Links) shows just
how deeply she has mined the subject. &QL;

   More tastes of New York on the Web for New Yorkers in exile (and
stay-at-homes):
</P>
<P>
   Balducci's has a mail-order site (www.balducci.com), set up as
an online catalog with illustrations of pastas and sauces; biscotti
and cookies; delicacies like goat cheese in oil, white truffles and
foie gras; coffees, and candies.
</P>
<P>
   The ordering process uses AT&AMP;T Secure Buy Service, to relieve
those who feel uneasy about giving credit card information to a Web
site. It's also possible to find what you want on line and then
pick up the phone, call the store at (212) 260-0400, which stocks
most of what's shown, and have it delivered (Manhattan, Brooklyn
and Queens only).
</P>
<P>
   The Second Avenue Deli has a mostly text site
(www.2ndavedeli.com) for mail order. But after choosing your
cholent ($12.50 a quart) or cocktail franks in blankets ($8.50 a
tray), it's necessary to call (800) 692-3354, for delivery anywhere
in the country.

SIMPLE COOKING: GRILLED FRUIT WITH GINGER SYRUP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Johnny Earles is a self-trained chef who opened a
restaurant 16 years ago because, he said, he thought it would be
``a hoot.''
</P>
<P>
   His restaurant, Criolla's, is in Grayton Beach, Fla., in the
state's northwestern panhandle, an area locals self-mockingly call
the Redneck Riviera. When Criolla's opened, it was funky indeed _
Earles' grill was outside, his primary means of cooking was an
electric wok, and his tastes ran true to his roots _ kind of
Cajun-Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Earles trusted his instincts for flavor
combinations. His place has grown to be just about the only
restaurant in the area with a national reputation, so he is able to
make pronouncements like ``What I'm doing now is a kind of
international equatorial style of cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Earles is really about is simplicity. ``These days, I'm
going for clean, direct flavors and combinations that work,'' he
said. ``It's not the easiest thing to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   A dish he created that  &UR; is &LR;  one of easiest things to pull off is
a melange of quickly grilled fruit, brushed with a ginger sauce
that itself takes about five minutes to put together. The sauce is
a simple sugar syrup _ half sugar, half water, boiled together
until the sugar melts _ and infused with a lot of ginger. You could
use other flavors instead _ mint, lemon verbena, thyme, even chili
_ but ginger seems perfect to me.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit can be varied, but Earles and I have between us tried
just about everything, and we agree that pineapple and bananas are
the top choices. Starfruit, also called carambola, is another good
choice, although not always easy to find. Many other fruits can be
grilled, but pineapple browns so beautifully and banana develops
such a luxurious creaminess that it isn't worth looking further.
</P>
<P>
   Earles recommends gas _ or clean wood charcoal _ for grilling
fruit. ``Real wood just overwhelms the fruit with flavor,'' he
said. ``And briquettes impart a weird taste.'' Whatever your fuel,
make the fire hot and keep the grilling time short.

   SKEWERED GRILLED FRUIT WITH GINGER SYRUP
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Johnny Earles
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup thinly sliced fresh ginger (don't bother to peel it)
</P>
<P>
   4 unpeeled bananas (not overripe)
</P>
<P>
   1 small pineapple
</P>
<P>
   1 starfruit (carambola), optional
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat a gas or charcoal fire; it should be quite hot, with the
rack positioned 4 to 6 inches from the source of heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the sugar, fresh ginger and { cup of water in a small
saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3
minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit while preparing the
fruit. (Refrigerate if you're not using this right away; it will
keep for at least a week.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut the unpeeled bananas into 2-inch-long chunks and make a
shallow vertical slit in the skin for peeling at the table. Peel
and core the pineapple, then cut it into 2-inch chunks. If you're
using starfruit, cut it into slices { inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   4. Skewer the fruit. Strain the syrup and brush it on the fruit
lightly. Grill the fruit until the pineapple is nicely browned, 2
to 4 minutes to a side. While it is grilling, brush it occasionally
with the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   5. When the fruit is done, brush once more with syrup. Serve hot
or warm.

HOMEY LOOKING COOKIES WITH A FLAIR FOR FLAVOR

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cookies made by the Dancing Deer Baking Co. may
be homey looking, but their flavor is nothing if not surprising.
Dark cocoa cookies startle the palate with a beguiling dose of
tangerine.
</P>
<P>
   They are intense with chocolate and incredibly good. Sugar-cane
lime cookies, made with sharp-tasting lime oil, and heavily spiced
molasses clove cookies are also divine. The cookies are not soft
and gooey, but thick, firm and pleasantly chewy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go for straight up, yummy stuff,'' said Trish Karter, an
owner of Dancing Deer. ``That's our thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is four years old and is in West Roxbury,
Mass., specializes in blending notes sweet and sharp, but it also
knows that not all cookies need to have arresting flavor. Its
shortbread cookies are made with lavender-infused evaporated cane
juice, a passive flavor that melds with the delicate, tender dough.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cookies have plenty of sugar in them but are never
cloyingly sweet. ``We emphasize more the flavor than the
sweetness,'' Ms. Karter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing Deer cookies are all-natural and have no additives or
preservatives, so their shelf life is short. No matter: they won't
last long once you get them home. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Dancing Deer's chocolate-tangerine, sugar-cane lime and
molasses-clove cookies are available in bags of nine for $5.50, or
18 for $8, at Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street) in
Manhattan; (212) 431-1691. They are sold individually for 50 cents,
or in bags of 18 for $6.95, at Foodworks, 10 West 19th Street;
(212) 352-9333. The lavender-shortbread cookies, and all others
made by the company, are available by mail order: telephone (888)

WHEN BERNSTEIN SAW THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's difficult to understand the controversy that
surrounded Leonard Bernstein's Norton Lectures at Harvard
University in 1973 unless you were around at the time. Not
literally in attendance, because the telegenic Bernstein made sure
that his six talks were videotaped and broadcast. They were
elaborate events, run through with musical examples ranging from
simple points Bernstein made at the piano to entire compositions
performed under his direction by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   To his detractors it seemed as if Harvard's august series of
Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on Poetry, previously presented by
giants like T.S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky, was being turned into
the ``Watch Mr. Wizard'' show. But Bernstein's subject was
typically immense, the great ``unanswered question,'' in a phrase
borrowed from a haunting composition by Ives: ``Whither music in
our time?'' Meaning, Where do we go from here? What has the big
ruckus of late been about? And who won?
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus in question was the ``great split,'' as Bernstein
called it, the pitched battle (pun intended) between, on one side,
intellectually cocksure, cutting-edge composers who advocated
Serialism as the inevitable next step in the evolution of music,
and, on the other side, composers who clung to tonality _ all those
fusty, irrelevant conservatives, as the Serialists saw them. Using
his prominent forum, Bernstein intended to facilitate a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   (A mini-lesson for those who could use it: Tonality refers to
the system of writing music in the familiar major and minor keys,
where pitches are organized in a hierarchy, the primary pitch being
the tonic; 12-tone music, or Serialism, refers to the Schoenbergian
system of writing music using various predetermined series, or
rows, of all 12 existing pitches. Here, equality and ordering
replace hierarchy as an organizational concept for pitch. That's
why 12-tone music sounds ``ungrounded.'' There's no home plate.)
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Bernstein's analysis was overly sweeping,
but many of his observations, for which he was roundly condemned in
university circles, turned out to be prescient. So, a
free-admission symposium being offered Thursday at 6 p.m. in the
Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center, part of the Lincoln Center
Festival's ``Bernstein Celebration,'' is most timely. A panel
moderated by Schuyler Chapin will discuss ``Bernstein as Teacher:
The Young People's Concerts and the Norton Lectures.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, WNET has been broadcasting these lectures this
week. The final three can be seen Wednesday night through Friday at
12:30 a.m. on Channel 13.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, a revisionist campaign is under way arguing that the
``great split'' was hugely overstated. The 12-tone commando squad
never commanded anything during the fractious, much maligned 1960s,
the line goes. True, the squad was uninterested in composers
writing tonal music, but it did not condemn them, and certainly
never controlled them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you believe it. I was there, studying music at Yale, and
the Serialists ran the place, as well as other composition
departments at major universities. They made the appointments,
granted the tenure, recruited the composition students. Put in a
good word for the operas of Britten over lunch, and you faced
sneers from the composers. Try to suggest that Shostakovich was
somebody worth bothering about, and eyes would roll. Aaron Copland?
That producer of Americana corn pone? Be serious.
</P>
<P>
   This was in the universities, mind you. In the big-time
professional world, when it deigned to consider new music at all,
composers like Samuel Barber, not Young Turk serialists, got
Metropolitan Opera commissions. But the composers with intellectual
prestige were in the universities, training the next generation,
and it was a tense time.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. The development of 12-tone music was also
tremendously exciting. We all marveled over Schoenberg and Webern.
Many stimulating 12-tone works were being written. But many others
were sterile and forbiddingly complex, and the accompanying dogma
was stultifying.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bernstein had grappled, as Stravinsky, and even
Copland did years earlier, with the challenge of 12-tone music
during a period of withdrawal as a composer in the early 1960s and
had returned to his essentially tonal heritage. By 1973 he felt
that musical languages with elements of grounded tonal harmony were
gaining reacceptance on the campuses and among composers. He saw
the Norton Lectures as a way to proclaim and endorse the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein was not a deeply original thinker, but he loved ideas
and saw connections everywhere. He had recently been fired up by
the work of linguists, especially Noam Chomsky, and he saw the
linguistic search for a ``genetically endowed language faculty''
among all people as a metaphor for the idea of a ``worldwide,
inborn musical grammar.''
</P>
<P>
   His thesis was that, like languages, all music everywhere, from
every culture throughout history, shared certain built-in traits,
namely, a connection to the overtone series (the relationship of a
fundamental pitch to its harmonic overtones).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, harmonic languages for music as different as
Hindu ragas, Beethoven and the Beach Boys all relied in some way on
the concept of a tonal center. A certain degree of tonal anchoring
was inevitable because the human ear demanded it. The ``creative
mystery,'' Bernstein said, is ``inextricably rooted in the rich
earth of our innate response, in those deep, conscious regions
where the universals of tonality and language reside.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught up by his enthusiasm, Bernstein went too far. He played
the last of Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Piano, Opus 23, and, after
admiring its tone-row intricacies, asked: ``How many music lovers
do you know who can say, today, in this 50th year of Opus 23, that
they love to hear it, that they listen with love to it, as they
might listen to Mahler or Stravinsky?'' At the time, I was learning
the piece, and I loved it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein celebrated the music being written at the time that
was drawing from 12-tone procedures and fashioning synthesized
tonal and atonal languages, singling out Gunther Schuller as the
``incarnation of a new conciliatory spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up what had happened since the death of Schoenberg in
1951, he said, rather elegantly, ``It's as though . . . we have all
had a vacation from tonality'' and returned in a ``refreshed state:
fit, relaxed, and with a better perspective, which enables us to
make the new synthesis, the new eclecticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is something innate in our ears that craves tonal
grounding. If so, then the many wondrous works written with various
12-tone procedures succeed because the music violates that craving
_ it titillates, discombobulates, engages the ear.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the piano music of the strict Serialist Milton
Babbitt is more fun to me than the ponderously tonal operas of
Dominick Argento.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the best 12-tone works are fun because they disrupt, in a
sense, the ear's inclination for tonal bearings. And Bernstein
rightly observed that all atonal music and synthesized experiments
would inevitably be ``embedded in a tonal universe,'' that is,
``conceived against a contextual background of tonality.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the esthetic and techniques of Serialism are simply there,
an option for composers to draw on. There has never been a greater
diversity of options, which is exciting but creates a whole new set
of challenges for composers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein was not the first person to point this out, but he
presented the idea dynamically. Some of my teachers at the time
seethed at the thought of his Norton Lectures. Yet, though
Bernstein craved intellectual respect almost more than popular
acclaim, he went to Harvard and challenged the university musical
establishment. It didn't enhance his standing that in the years to
come he conducted less and less contemporary music. But it still
took courage to state his case and call for a cessation of
hostilities.

MEDICAL TESTS PRESENT SEVERAL OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ This is the second of four columns dealing with the
writer's recent medical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the treadmill test were in hand. The report
indicated a possible deficiency in the blood supply to one small
area of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   But the real meaning of that was unclear. It could be only an
artifact _ an irregularity in the test itself. Or it could be
nothing more than the same minor deposit in one vessel picked up on
a test seven years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   So a new decision presented itself: to go forward with the
carotid artery surgery, or first do another procedure _ an
angiogram _ to further assess the status of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The complications were multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   A dye test of the carotid would be done the next Monday. If the
blockage was severe, surgery was to follow on Tuesday. But now it
sounded as if it might be necessary to delay that until this new
issue was settled.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped at the office of the surgeon, whom I hadn't yet met,
and outlined the situation to his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   That was not a problem, she said. She would leave the surgery _
called an endarterectomy _ on the Tuesday schedule, but I needn't
feel pressed by that. If I decided to wait, rescheduling would not
be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The week went by quickly, with both daughters home over the July
Fourth holiday and an overnight for berry-picking and fishing at
the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday morning, then, I reported to the outpatient
reception at St. Luke's Hospital. By midmorning, the carotid dye
test had been performed and the essential fact was known.
</P>
<P>
   The narrowing of the artery by deposits of plaque was greater
than 95 percent. So surgery plainly was indicated. But how to
proceed first?
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon the surgeon, Michael Gorton, stopped by my room.
He seemed a youngish man _ but everyone these days seems young. It
turned out we had a common interest. He was Kansas born, and said
he'd grown up following bird dogs with his father in the quail and
pheasant fields.
</P>
<P>
   That, and his friendly manner, inspired immediate confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do this when you're ready,'' he said. ``If you want to
think about it, that's fine. I'm not scheduled for surgery the last
part of the week. But if that's what works best for you I can come
in Thursday or Friday and do it. It's not a long procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really hoped to get on with it tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say I've seen the results of the heart scan, and
I'd be very comfortable with that. But it's whatever you decide.
I'll look in a little later.''
</P>
<P>
   The next visit was by a consulting cardiologist, Charles Porter,
whose straightforward logic was expressed in terms a layman could
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy,'' he said, ``is /{deal with the most important
thing first,/} and the carotid is what's important. But you wind up
with all these options. One thing leads to another, then another.
And you find you're on a slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   He paced at the foot of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say that during the carotid surgery there happened to be
a problem with the heart. You're on the table. It can be dealt with
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, say a heart procedure was done first. And
maybe there's a sudden drop in blood pressure, and the flow to the
brain is tremendously reduced through the narrowing in your
carotid. Major damage could result that wouldn't have happened if
your carotid had been fixed before we worked on the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I believe in handling the big problem. Your heart's not the
problem. There are studies that show, when a coronary vessel is
involved, treatment with medicine, diet and exercise is as
effective as surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And no limits on normal activity?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not less activity. /{More./} You've stopped smoking. That's
good. And you have a prescription to lower cholesterol. At the
most, only 7 percent of the whole heart muscle could be affected.
Even medicating for it might be overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his counsel was decisive.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the surgeon, Mike Gorton, once more at the end of his long
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say you're comfortable going ahead?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then so am I. Let's do it tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' he said. ``You're set for first thing in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see you then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``you'll be asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Making the amazing seem routine.

VANGUARD AIRLINES RECORDS FIRST QUARTERLY PROFIT EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ After more than three years of flying in the red,
Vanguard Airlines has eked out its first quarterly profit ever.
</P>
<P>
   The profitable 1998 second quarter is a milestone for Vanguard,
the low-cost airline based in Kansas City, Mo., that has had three
chief executive officers and several strategic changes since it
took to the skies in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months that ended June 30, Vanguard earned
$323,000, or 1 cent a share, on $25.42 million in revenue. That was
a dramatic improvement from a year earlier, when Vanguard lost
$7.17 million, or 53 cents a share, on $21.65 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vanguard reported a quarterly operating profit of
$1.05 million, compared with an operating loss of $6.55 million a
year earlier. The company also boosted its cash reserves. They
stood at $1.7 million on June 30, compared with $587,000 at the end
of June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Spane, the chief executive officer who was appointed last
year to turn Vanguard around, called the results ``an enormous
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there have been many contributing factors to the
turnaround, it is my belief that Vanguard's employees must take the
most credit for their longstanding dedication to the company's
cause,'' Spane said. ``What is most encouraging is that, based on
our advance bookings, the third quarter looks as if it will be
similarly positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard employs more than 700 people in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The airline in recent months has gone to a strategy of reducing
flights elsewhere and creating a minihub in Kansas City, flying
frequently to big cities not served by Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   At least one aviation analyst was encouraged by Vanguard's
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's demonstrating that their latest strategic direction is
able to show a profit,'' said Brian Simpson, vice president with
the Boyd Group in Golden, Colo. ``They're contracting to
profitability, focusing on their core markets. The significant drop
in expenses shows they've got a good formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Vanguard's investors, principally Hambrecht &AMP; Quist
in San Francisco, should be ``cautiously optimistic'' about the
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been slow coming for Vanguard,'' he said. ``The industry
has been profitable for a long time, and they're just coming to the
fray. This shows Vanguard can make a profit during a peak travel
period. Now they have to show they can do it over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of 1998, Vanguard lost $4.27 million, or 8
cents a share, on $46.67 million in revenue. In the same period
last year, the company lost $15.1 million, or $1.29 a share, on
$43.15 million in revenue.

FERRELLGAS NOW IS OWNED BY ITS EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Ferrellgas Cos. Chairman James E. Ferrell has sold
his 58 percent share of the company to a new employee stock
ownership plan.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer makes Ferrellgas the first major company in the
propane industry to be owned by its employees, Ferrellgas
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, Mo., company, the nation's second-largest propane
retailer, announced the transfer Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Precise terms of the transaction were not disclosed. However,
the employee plan privately borrowed about $160 million to help
finance the purchase, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The change gives additional ownership in the company to about
4,500 employees in 45 states who are eligible to join the employee
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 42 percent of the company, which is a publicly
traded master limited partnership listed as Ferrellgas Partners LP
on the New York Stock Exchange, will remain publicly held and is
not affected by the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell, 58, sold the shares as part of a plan to diversify his
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business of Ferrellgas is largely what my net worth is
made up of,'' he told employees in a videotaped announcement played
at 35 company meetings held nationwide over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell, who for 33 years has headed the company his father
founded 59 years ago in Atchison, Kan., will remain chairman.
Danley K. Sheldon, the company's president, will assume the
additional title of chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution of the securities to qualifying full- and flex-time
employees, based on their salaries and length of service, will be
made in addition to 401(k) plan contributions and other benefits
those employees already receive, Sheldon said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 companies in the United States have adopted
employee stock ownership plans since Congress first allowed them in
1974. The tax code encourages the plans by giving tax breaks to the
former owners.
</P>
<P>
   Most such plans also are funded by some form of employee
contribution, either directly through payroll deductions or
indirectly from a general profit-sharing fund to build equity in
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferrellgas plan will cost the company employees nothing
because the equity already is provided by the stock Ferrell sold.
</P>

   Ferrellgas expects to give participating employees the
equivalent of 8 percent to 9 percent of their salary in the new
plan, compared with an average of 2 percent to 2.5 percent they
received under a profit-sharing plan the employee plan replaces.
</P>
<P>
   For a typical employee making about $25,000 a year, that works
out to approximately a $51,000 retirement account after 10 years
instead of $17,000 under the existing plan, if the company meets
its financial targets in the next decade, the company said.

KC PLAYS BIG ROLE IN MEMORIAL TO FULBRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Bit by bit, using the same patience and skill
required to build nuclear submarines, welder Jeff Dowell at Hankins
Roofing and Sheet Metal in Kansas City has spent much of this
sweltering summer transforming 11,000 pounds of bronze into a
depiction of a towering plume of water.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, if all goes according to plan, the 41-foot-tall
finished work will be gently lowered onto a pink granite base on an
Arkansas college campus as part of a memorial to one of the most
influential architects of U.S. foreign policy in the late 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will last for 100 years,'' predicted Maurice Jennings, one
of the designers of the memorial to the late Sen. J. William
Fulbright, which is being created on the University of Arkansas
campus in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Fulbright, who is most often remembered as the creator of the
international exchange program bearing his name or as a leading
critic of the war in Vietnam, was president of the university
before entering politics.
</P>
<P>
   University officials plan to formally dedicate the memorial in
October, when they hope President Clinton can attend. Clinton, a
fellow Arkansas native, counts Fulbright as a political mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial has several connections to the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Architects Jennings and E. Fay Jones, who created the plans for
the $746,000 fountain and setting, also designed the Visitors
Education Center and the Marjorie Powell Allen Chapel and Meadow
Pavilion at Powell Gardens near Lone Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Livers Brass, Signs &AMP; Polishing Co., a Kansas City firm
specializing in the creation of ornamental metalwork, was awarded
the contract to produce the sculptured tower at the focal point of
the Fulbright memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Van Deurzen and Associates, an Overland Park structural
engineering consulting firm, was hired to work out technical
challenges in the project.
</P>
<P>
   And Hankins Roofing and Sheet Metal was hired by Livers to
fabricate the metal and install the finished tower in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the multiple Kansas City connections are not
surprising, according to specialists in ornamental metals and
architectural sheet metal work.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is recognized as one of three national centers of
expertise for those highly specialized fields, said Rosalind
Raymond, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Sheet Metal
and Air Conditioning Contractors, a trade association in Chantilly,
Va. California and Las Vegas are the other important centers.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is important because many specialists are here,
Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Fulbright piece is an extremely complex
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Jennings chose to represent the worldwide exchange of
ideas made possible by Fulbright scholarships with a depiction of a
towering plume of water placed on a gently sloping pink granite
base over which water flows to the four points of the compass.
</P>
<P>
   The plume is made of nearly 1,300 individual pieces of bronze
ranging from 2 inches to 30 feet in length, intricately welded to
portray the involvement of thousands of students and universities
throughout the world involved with Fulbright exchanges over the
decades, Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   The piece also has been a tremendous challenge for engineers and
craftsmen turning the architect's vision into reality, said Larry
Smith, a Hankins executive helping to coordinate next Tuesday's
scheduled installation in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Simply drawing plans to follow was a challenge, Smith said. The
detail is so intricate that it overwhelmed computer-assisted
drawing devices normally used for such work. Engineers split the
views into something like pieces of a puzzle to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest puzzles has been just figuring out how
precisely to make the tower stand straight while it is being
installed, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Heat causes bronze, the primary material in the structure, to
expand. Moreover, the metal is so sensitive to heat that on most
days, the sunlit side of the structure will expand more than the
shaded side.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Deurzen consultants have worked out ways to minimize the
tower's tendency to wave in the light, which is one consequence of
daily heating and cooling.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith and his co-workers still need to make the tower stand
straight up for installation, which won't be easy in the bright
sunshine now baking the Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may end up doing the work after dark,'' he said.

A DIFFERENT MEASURE OF SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Virginia O'Brien decided to write a book about women
and success because she didn't believe the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   She instinctively knew that even if only a handful of Fortune
500 companies are headed by women, a lot of us have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Her hunch was right. Interviews with 45 women at various
management levels and surveys of 700 other women found that women
don't measure success the same way our forefathers did.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we don't need to be a chief executive officer to
succeed. In her book ``Success on Our Own Terms: Tales of
Extraordinary, Ordinary Business Women,'' O'Brien chronicles the
achievements of women of different ages, ethnic backgrounds and
educational levels.
</P>
<P>
   She found success stories such as Marlene O'Toole, who dropped
out of high school and started working at the Federal Reserve Bank
when she was 17 and earned $32.50 a week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 O'Toole joined IBM as a keypunch operator. She was the
youngest of eight and was determined to take advantage of every
opportunity offered. That tenacity paid off, and in 1997 she was
planning to retire after becoming southern regional manager for
customer support.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien also met women such as Cynthia Danaher, general manager
of Hewlett-Packard's Medical Products Group. Danaher was involved
in her children's lives even while managing 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's research confirmed that women define success
differently from the traditional model. While we may be very
goal-oriented, many of us also want to find balance in our lives
and have an effect on our communities.
</P>
<P>
   While the women in the book had taken different paths, O'Brien
identified several steps to success. The first is to identify your
own values and decide what makes you feel fulfilled, then create a
short-term and long-term plan to get you to that point. Think about
whether you'll need additional training and work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, you need to ask people you respect for their
help.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien emphasizes that you have to be willing to take risks and
responsibility to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move forward in life by taking risks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another important tool for success is to find and develop
relationships with mentors who can teach you the ropes. At the same
time, you need to network with people inside and outside your
company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite working hard, you sometimes find it impossible to
succeed at a particular company. Then it's time to move on, O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   `If it doesn't fit, you don't wear it,'' she said. ``That's part
of the message out there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien took a risk several years ago when she left a full-time
job to work as a writer. Her risk obviously paid off.

 &HT;    PENTAGON PROBE FINDS CNN REPORT WAS BASELESS
 &HT;    630&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday that
an exhaustive Pentagon review found no evidence to support a story
reported _ and later retracted _ by CNN and Time magazine that a
covert U.S. commando unit hunted down American defectors in Laos in
1970 and used nerve gas in making their escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has not and does not use lethal nerve gas,''
Cohen declared. He said the 16 American soldiers who conducted the
secret mission were ``heroes'' who ``have been hurt'' by the
CNN-Time report.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon review says the clandestine Operation Tailwind was
undertaken to engage North Vietnamese troops in Laos and to divert
their attention from Operation Gauntlet, a CIA-sponsored offensive
to gain control of terrain in what was then a neutral country
bordering Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon probe found that the gas dropped on enemy forces in
Tailwind was CS tear gas, a then-new and more potent form of the
crowd control agent, and not the deadly sarin as reported in CNN's
June 7 premiere of ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to defectors, no document, military order,
after-action report, briefing paper or official military history
mentions the pursuit of U.S. defectors as Tailwind's mission. There
is no hint, nod, wink or subliminal reference to such a mission,''
said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the use of nerve gas, we found no evidence that sarin nerve
gas was used or that it was ever transported to Vietnam, Laos or
Thailand. Sarin was stored in Okinawa at the time and remained
there until 1971,'' he said, when it was removed prior to the
reversion of the island to Japanese control in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force pilots who provided air cover to Tailwind say
they dropped tear gas, not nerve gas. The Air Force men who loaded
the munitions on the plane said it was tear gas, not nerve gas,''
said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report was retracted after the news network asked Floyd
Abrams, a well-known media attorney, to conduct a review and he
found that the central allegations were not substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   CNN fired the two main producers, Jack Smith and April Oliver.
Senior CNN producer Pam Hill resigned, but the on-air
correspondent, Peter Arnett, was allowed to keep his job after a
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   CNN officials could not be reached for comment on the Pentagon
report.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said Tuesday the report does nothing to shake her belief
in the original Tailwind account.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of documentary evidence ``doesn't surprise me, given
that this was a 'black operation','' she said in a telephone
interview. Oliver said she and Smith would release an 80-page
report Wednesday in response to the Abrams report so that people
can judge the credibility of their journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never suggested that these men weren't heroes. They were
men of tremendous courage,'' she said. ``We made no moral judgments
in this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon press conference Tuesday, some Vietnam veterans
said CNN had not gone far enough in making amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think very strongly Peter Arnett had more responsibility
than he had been given credit for. We believe that he should be
discharged,'' said retired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, a former
commander of the Studies and Operations Group forces that conducted
Tailwind and other covert operations during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that the report that (CNN) should say that the
operation did not take place _ not that the reporters did not find
enough evidence to support the accusation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub said that he and others involved in Tailwind tried to
dissuade CNN's Oliver from airing allegations about the defectors
and nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, 'April, it did not happen. You're on the wrong
track. It did not happen _ either of those two accusations','' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report was based on a review of documents from the
Vietnam era as well as interviews with participants in Tailwind and
similar operations. The report said ``inconsistencies'' were found
in the accounts of the two Tailwind survivors who were CNN's major
sources, former Lt. Robert Van Burkirk and former Sgt. Michael
Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, though, Singlaub acknowledged that the
operations in Laos were based in deniability.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the policy from the White House was that we would
not send regular troops in. We were sending in these Special
Operations forces in small numbers _ normally a 12-man team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub was asked about the policy regarding any U.S. defectors
who would help the North Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there undoubtedly was personal animosity against them by
individuals,'' he said. ``But the policy was quite clear: We would
try to return them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there were only two such defectors: Robert
Garwood, a former Marine private who returned to the United States
in 1979 and was found guilty of collaborating with the enemy at a
subsequent court martial, and McKinley Nolan, an Army private who
lived with the Viet Cong in Vietnam and later with the Khmer Rouge
in Cambodia. The report said Nolan was killed by the Khmer Rouge in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the charges of sarin gas, the report said that even
``relevant North Vietnamese military documents'' show ``no use of
lethal chemical agents by U.S. forces at any time during the
Vietnam War, but they do record the use of tear gas.''

   ``We think very strongly Peter Arnett had more responsibility
than he had been given credit for. We believe that he should be
discharged,'' said retired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, a former
commander of the Studies and Operations Group forces that conducted
Tailwind and other covert operations during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that the report that (CNN) should say that the
operation did not take place _ not that the reporters did not find
enough evidence to support the accusation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub said that he and others involved in Tailwind tried to
dissuade CNN's Oliver from airing allegations about the defectors
and nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, 'April, it did not happen. You're on the wrong
track. It did not happen _ either of those two accusations','' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report was based on a review of documents from the
Vietnam era as well as interviews with participants in Tailwind and
similar operations. The report said ``inconsistencies'' were found
in the accounts of the two Tailwind survivors who were CNN's major
sources, former Lt. Robert Van Burkirk and former Sgt. Michael
Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, though, Singlaub acknowledged that the
operations in Laos were based in deniability.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the policy from the White House was that we would
not send regular troops in. We were sending in these Special
Operations forces in small numbers _ normally a 12-man team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub was asked about the policy regarding any U.S. defectors
who would help the North Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there undoubtedly was personal animosity against them by
individuals,'' he said. ``But the policy was quite clear: We would
try to return them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there were only two such defectors: Robert
Garwood, a former Marine private who returned to the United States
in 1979 and was found guilty of collaborating with the enemy at a
subsequent court martial, and McKinley Nolan, an Army private who
lived with the Viet Cong in Vietnam and later with the Khmer Rouge
in Cambodia. The report said Nolan was killed by the Khmer Rouge in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the charges of sarin gas, the report said that even
``relevant North Vietnamese military documents'' show ``no use of
lethal chemical agents by U.S. forces at any time during the
Vietnam War, but they do record the use of tear gas.''

THE BOTTOM LINE IN BUSINESS IS MONEY, NOT MORALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Education voted this month to divest $44
million in Walt Disney Co. stock _ stock that historically has
performed very well _ supposedly as a stand against the violence
portrayed in movies produced by the Disney division that targets
its movies to an adult audience.
</P>
<P>
   If truth be told, the board cratered to pressure from the
religiously conservative American Family Association, which takes
umbrage at Disney's employee benefits plan for same-sex domestic
partners.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a safe bet that most of the state board members
weren't aware that Miramax was part of Disney until the AFA told
them. It's not as if they use Mickey in a G-string as the company
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, the federal government has paid
Disney the lion's share of $90 million to produce the first in a
series of anti-drug commercials geared at keeping America's youth
off illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't some kind of delicious irony, I don't know what
is.
</P>
<P>
   The basic question for every Southern Baptist, AFA devotee and
state school board member who claims to be offended by the
anti-family direction that some of Disney's divisions and policies
have taken is this: What makes you think Disney is different from
any other big corporation in America, where the bottom line is the
bottom line? Do you really think ol' Walt founded his company to do
anything other than make tons of money?
</P>
<P>
   As a point of personal disclosure, I must tell readers that I
worked for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram during the short but not
necessarily sweet time that Disney owned the newspaper. I do not
currently own any Disney stock, having divested the Labbe household
of such holdings shortly after Knight Ridder purchased the paper.
The divestiture had nothing to do with Disney's employee benefits
policies or the kind of films that Miramax makes; it had everything
to do with my small, personal protest over how Disney handled the
newspaper's purchase and sale.
</P>
<P>
   Silly me, I was one of the many Star-Telegram employees who
believed Disney CEO Michael Eisner when he said his company was in
the business of buying properties, not selling them. Our mistake,
perhaps, but we found out that Disney was putting the Star-Telegram
on the auction block when an eagle-eyed editor saw the story move
on the business wire early one morning. That's a lousy way to treat
a cast member.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney was a genius, not only in his creation of a funny
little mouse character in the 1920s that captured the hearts and
imaginations of people everywhere, but in his vision to market and
package that funny little mouse character in such a way as to make
it an American icon that has lasted more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Disney found a way, through Mickey and his cadre of friends, to
appeal to the broadest common denominator for entertainment in this
country. This means that people with the highest standards as well
as those with the basest are probably going to be dissatisfied with
what Disney produces. If you're looking for historical accuracy in
productions like ``Pocahontas'' and ``Mulan,'' look elsewhere. If
you're looking for the cinematic equivalent of ``Dumbo Does
Dallas,'' it won't have a Disney label on it, either.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the Disney execs have always done is to keep the
Mouse, and the Disney name, exclusive to the youth-oriented
material and activities. When the company diversified its
entertainment offerings by venturing into films and products for an
older audience, the Mouse was deliberately absent from the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake that the religious conservative groups make is
looking to any part of American industry as a model for values. Big
business values one thing today, and that's money.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that's bad; I frankly don't think it's a sin to
make money. But like anything else in this world, there are good
and bad ways to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking to Corporate America _ and that includes
Disney _ to be a pillar of virtue and morality, you'll be
disappointed.

WHAT BERNSTEIN WASN'T READY TO HAVE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No doubt many composers have all sorts of pieces
written for all sorts of occasions buried away in file drawers and
closets, works not quite ready for the public. Leonard Bernstein
produced a fair share of such pieces, and though he made no attempt
to display them during his lifetime, he would probably have been
delighted that Michael Barrett, a pianist, conductor and music
adviser to the Bernstein estate, did so for him.
</P>
<P>
   The concert at Alice Tully Hall on Monday night was called ``The
Unknown Bernstein,'' part of the Lincoln Center Festival's
continuing ``Bernstein Celebration.'' Those who arrived thinking it
would reveal unknown Bernstein treasures probably left
disappointed. But there were some curiosities and pieces with
personal significance to Bernstein that helped flesh out his
still-enigmatic persona.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the works with helpful commentaries, Barrett began
with a series of short piano pieces that he has fashioned into an
effective suite. There was a wistful ``Valse Lente''; a bumptious
ditty called ``Mixolydian Mix-Up,'' written for his daughter Jamie
on her 14th birthday; a quizzical miniature called ``One-Minute
Charlie,'' which was a present for an assistant; a clever birthday
greeting for the composer and writer Nicholas Slonimsky, in which
the tune of ``Happy Birthday'' creeps in and changes into a wisp of
Wagner's ``Tristan'' theme, and another bittersweet waltz as a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Like all composers of musicals, Bernstein wrote lots of songs
that never made it into shows. Amy Burton, a sweet-voiced soprano
who just gets better all the time, sang several. ``Lonely Me,'' a
gently doleful song with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green,
was intended for ``On the Town'' but was replaced by the more
elegant ``Lonely Town.'' ``Can You Love'' is an interesting but
meaning-laden song from the spectacular flop ``1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In this duet, a pre-Civil War first lady, Ms. Burton, discusses
the human capacity for love with a slave, sung here by the baritone
Ted Keegan. ``Screwed On Wrong,'' another curiosity, was intended
for ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, three of the Jets complain, in some amusing Stephen
Sondheim lyrics, about the travails of adolescence. But the music
is too slick and snazzy: these ``West Side Story'' teen-agers sound
like sailors from ``On the Town'' who have turned up at the wrong
show.
</P>
<P>
   Several instrumental works were performed, including Variation
on the Octatonic Scale, a trifle for flute and cello, played here
with deadpan humor by the flutist Paula Robison and the cellist
Carter Brey. ``Halil,'' a 15-minute work for flute, piano and
percussion, was written in memory of a promising Israeli flutist,
Yadin Tanenbaum, who was killed while serving in the Israeli army
in 1973. Bernstein tries too self-consciously to make a conflict
between tonal and nontonal elements into the substance of this
piece. Moreover, although the materials are often striking, the
music meanders and never finds its footing.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the best work was the best known: Two Meditations from
Mass arranged for cello and piano. Whatever one thinks of the
multistylistic theater work from which this short piece is drawn,
these ruminative, harmonically pungent meditations make an
effective concert work, and Brey played with impassioned beauty.

   American adds N.Y. flights via Houston
</P>
<P>
   By Heather Cocks
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Passenger airlines can't fly non-stop from Austin to
New York without breaking the rules, so American Airlines is doing
what it says is the next-best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 9, American, the second-biggest carrier at
Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, will add three daily flights from
Austin to New York's LaGuardia Airport, with a relatively brief
20-minute stop at Houston's Hobby Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much faster turnaround time than we are able to do at
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport,'' where layovers average
40 minutes to one hour, said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American,
which is based at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. ``Obviously we'd
like to fly non-stop to LaGuardia, but the rules prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey prohibits non-stop
flights from landing at LaGuardia if they come from more than 1,500
miles away. The distance to Austin exceeds that limit by 15 miles,
Smith said, but a brief landing at Hobby brings the flight within
LaGuardia's accepted range.
</P>
<P>
   American's New York service, aimed primarily at business
travelers, is touted as the quickest available, although other
airlines also fly there and to nearby New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines offers a daily non-stop flight from Austin
to its hub in Newark, N.J.; it routes its LaGuardia-bound flights
through its Houston hub at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.
Delta Air Lines connects Austin-to-LaGuardia flights through
Dallas; Southwest Airlines, the biggest carrier at Mueller, does
not fly into LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
   American's New York service will be the latest in a number of
expansion moves for the airline in Austin. In May, it said it would
offer 14 flights from Mueller to Dallas' Love Field beginning Aug.
31. ``We've doubled our number of flights out of Austin in the past
couple years,'' said Mark Capell, manager of passenger sales for
American.

 &HT;    Spokesman says Huffy bike manufacturer will soon close
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ The Huffy Corp. will make its last bicycle in
Celina next week (week of July 27) when the company lays off 650
workers and stops production at what used to be the world's largest
bike factory.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Miamisburg-based company announced May 28 that
the Celina plant would be closed, but the massive layoff of its
hourly workforce will come sooner than first expected.
</P>
<P>
   Only 200 parts makers and support personnel will remain employed
at the plant after the layoffs July 31. The plant officially will
close Oct. 2, according to Tom Frederick, Huffy's vice president of
finance and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy officials originally said it would take about a year to
phase out the plant, but Frederick said the company was able to
expedite added production to its bike factory in Farmington, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really has been no last-second outcry from our employees
and we are thankful for the orderly shutdown,'' Frederick said.
Huffy plans to increase bike production at the Farmington plant and
will import more bikes from Asia and Mexico to cover the lost
production in Celina.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy's workforce, represented by the United Steel Workers of
America Local 5369, have not disrupted production since the company
announced it would close the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But several workers are still angry and having difficulty
finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say what they want, but they shoved us out on the
street and now we're faced with raising our families on jobs that
pay $5.50 an hour,'' said Dennis Gehle, an employee at Huffy for 26
years. ``My wife and I both work there and thought we could retire
at Huffy, but we'll be gone next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Huffy announced it would close the Celina plant, the
company had told workers they would have to work for as little as
$6.10 an hour with no health benefits and no pension plan or risk
losing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble between Huffy and its workforce began in 1995, when
workers agreed to a 20 percent pay cut after the company's bike
division lost $10.5 million. About 2,000 hourly workers were
employed at the bike plant in 1994 before layoffs trimmed
employment to a low of 650.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Huffy officials said they needed workers to
accept more concessions so the company could trim about $15 million
from operating costs at the Celina plant.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick said the company plans to hire a national real estate
firm to handle the sale of its Celina facility. Frederick said the
company would be willing to sell the 40-year-old, block-long
building for about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the potential buyers would be manufacturers and a
quick sale would benefit both Huffy and the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy Corp. last reported break-even earnings for the second
quarter due to a $12.6 million charge related to the closing of the
Celina plant. The company also makes basketball backboards and lawn
and garden tools, and markets inventory and supplier services.

 &HT;    Enter the afterlife of old office furniture at Austin's TOPS
 &HT;    By Hank Stuever
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Let's not be `Sanford and Son,''' Mike Hudkins recalls
saying a few years ago, when he and a couple of business partners
decided to open the biggest warehouse of old office furniture they
could conceive.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to know they'd had their fingers slammed when the
real-estate market blew shut, back in the dark days, when the
Resolution Trust Corp. was seizing and liquidating purple lobby
chairs, rubber-tree plants, archaic computers with MS-DOS still
whirring away inside them. The early , unprosperous '90s. ``Let's
not be `Sanford and Son' and have just any old junk we can get our
hands on. Let's try to stay to office furniture, office supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The RTC sales were incredible,'' says Karen Richards, who
worked in real estate with Mike, and, having moved on to the
color-copier business, also helped Mike forge into the world of
used office furniture and supplies. They did a deal here, a deal
there, all those property auctions, all those polished credenzas of
failed savings and loan executives, all that bust. ``One sale, they
had a whole room that was nothing but metal desk organizers,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   You see a filing cabinet, and so does Karen. But she sees a
little more: Karen keeps her clothes, her underwear, in a
four-drawer file cabinet in one of her homes. ``A really nice file
cabinet,'' she says, laughing about it. ``It's my dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost again on a Sunday afternoon in the mizmaze of
tush-imprinted chairs. Among slightly dinged file cabinets, among
desks with their attendant coffee-ring stains, among disassembled
cubicle parts. Things the boss owned, things the company owned,
things the government owned. Paper clips the worker bees did not
steal.
</P>
<P>
   Hello in here? A stifling silence, except for the dull buzz of
war-era wall fans blowing hotly across a mesmerizing ocean of used
office furniture at Texas Office Products &AMP; Supply, otherwise known
as TOPS. Loyal customers who stumble into it keep coming back to
this five-humped Quonset warehouse at 1100 E. Fifth St., where Mike
Hudkins, et al., sell amazing and wonderful ... old ... OK, they
sell old office furniture and supplies, which isn't so amazing or
so wonderful unless you're taking it all in with a sense of
adventure. Hello in here?
</P>
<P>
   Echoes of humdrum days. The old desks and chairs seem to answer
in a Dilbertian chorus. Consider how much of our lives unfold at
work, and TOPS becomes a shifting and mysterious museum exhibit:
Cubicle Coalmine _ Interpreting American Workplace Ennui, 1930-1990
(With a Special Emphasis on Shades of Orange of the Late Middle
Century).
</P>
<P>
   For example: Jean's chair.
</P>
<P>
   I've come across Jean's chair twice in TOPS. Old chairs might
creak with character, but Jean's chair _ a rolling, swiveling,
dirtyish, pinkish thing _ clacks and rattles disapprovingly.
</P>
<P>
   All I know about Jean I've imagined, if only because she wrote
``JEAN'S CHAIR!'' in big black letters on masking tape and then
stuck the tape on the back of her chair. No one at TOPS has ripped
the tape away; there is a kind of respect in that.
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation point says a lot: I'm thinking Jean worked for
the state. (A good deal of the furniture that comes to TOPS is
``bidded out'' by state offices in Austin.) I'm seeing a poster on
the wall with an orangutan saying something clever about Mondays.
I'm seeing Jean walk up to her cubicle and asking for the millionth
time: Who moved my chair? Jean with her hands on her hips, a bit
player in the slavery epic of modern work.
</P>
<P>
   So Mike Hudkins and Karen Richards decided to get into the used
office furniture business. They haven't exactly struck gold, but it
did get them out of real estate. Karen is the owner and Mike is the
general manager and, as they see it, it's a recycling service.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harris, one of their employees, who keeps fastidious
records of customer's ``want lists,'' says a lot of this stuff
would have ended up in a landfill, well before its time. ``I think
older is always better,'' Robert says, ``but, hey, I drive an '85
Oldsmobile. Go out and just open one of those old, really well-made
file drawers and it still rolls out perfectly, and makes that nice,
metal ch-clunk when you close it. You don't find that anymore.''
Interlude: Orange ``Orange just doesn't sell as well,'' Mike says.
``In the '70s at some point, I forget, the state attorney general
or the secretary of state, someone decided that all the offices
should have more color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the bright green,'' Karen observes. ``They'll buy
green.''
</P>
<P>
   But orange panels. Could be a problem. ``We took those out to
one of those little telemarketing companies that are everywhere.
They wanted them,'' Mike says, even if they were orange.
``Telemarketers don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike found the behemoth, empty Quonset around the corner from
Hernandez Cafe _ 20,000 square feet that for a time housed
theatrical supplies. Karen, with long, auburn hair, stepping her
way neatly through the office supplies in a nice dress and heels,
remembered that the building scared her at first, ``like something
out of a Steven Spielberg movie. I said, `Do I even have to walk in
here?' There was chicken wire everywhere, and Mike is saying,
`It'll be great; it'll be great.'''
</P>
<P>
   They opened TOPS in January 1996, just when the big box stores
were trenching in, setting off an American office design mania, a
streamlined look, but one without enough cheap ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Drafting tables,'' Mike says. ``Drafting tables and folding
tables. Folding tables I love. Those are sold the minute we get
them.''
</P>
<P>
   What else? ``We can't keep old, gray metal furniture around
here. Those are `in' right now,'' he says. ``People get them and
sandblast them down to the base metal and shellac them. It's very
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   A shipshape IBM Selectric typewriter is still popular, too, that
familiar '70s workhorse. Pop in the font ball and Now is the time
for all good men to come to the aid of their country. The quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. The guy who can't successfully
get an envelope through his inkjet printer will buy an IBM
Selectric (about $80, used) just to type addresses on envelopes.
(And there's still something joyous about real typing, like playing
piano in a synthesizer age: a Selectric makes one feel like ...
Dolly Parton in ``Nine to Five.'' A portable Smith-Corona is George
Peppard in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' Anything older is like
typing foreign war correspondence, love letters between Karen
Blixen and Denys Finch Hatton.)
</P>
<P>
   TOPS, the biggest store of its kind in Central Texas, operates
on the junk dealer's universal precept: Somebody still wants it.
Somebody still wants a Dictaphone, or a microfiche viewer, or the
chance to rotary dial even as a small act of style or rebellion.
That somebody might also need flash cubes. Or a framed motivational
reminder to hang on the wall: ``I must communicate. You cannot read
my mind. Avoid assumptions about facts, feelings, and reactions.''
Somebody might want this framed print here, portraying nine
sad-looking Indians in a row, something vaguely R.C. Gorman-ish and
very dentist waiting room. Somebody might want two.
</P>
<P>
   Mike is 56, has silvery gray hair thinning on top and wears
faded gray jeans, a golf shirt, a gold nugget ring on his left hand
and old New Balance tennies, and once upon a time was a platoon
commander in Vietnam. He gets to TOPS early each morning and checks
on auction bids. If a mortgage company goes under, that's
furniture. When the University of Texas shifts its institutional
rump ever so slightly, that can be lots of furniture. If Mike hears
that 100 wooden office chairs are being have been decommissioned by
the former state Department of Human Resources office in Odessa,
360 miles away, then he has to go. He'll fly to Midland, rent a van
and, presto, here they are: 100 softly aged office chairs, the
bleached color of raw pasta, stacked like a magic trick.
</P>
<P>
   Mike looks at the clock. He's running behind. He gets two
Spanish-speaking employees to get the truck ready, and they set out
north for a big haul. A trade publisher, American Visions Media
Group, is closing its offices on Burnet Road, the former editorial
home of the fantastically named Access to Wang magazine. (It's a
computer magazine. But still, what a great name: Access to Wang.)
The truck pulls up to the appointed, featureless box building on a
hot June afternoon, and we take the elevator up to the second
floor. We step into a chaos of downsizing:
</P>
<P>
   Employees are scurrying about, emptying files into trash cans,
working up a sweat. Mike and his crew begin lifting desks and
tables and rolling them out, even as a mug of warm coffee is still
sitting atop one desk, Mariah Carey is still singing on the clock
radio. When the dust clears, the office will be shut down, most of
the employees rightsized out of a job (those remaining will
telecommute from home; Access to Wang and the company's other
titles will be published in Washington, D.C.).
</P>
<P>
   Tempers ignite as the refrigerator is being cleaned out. People
are jumping ship early. ``Where is she?'' screams one employee to
another, about an AWOL colleague. ``She only gave a half- day's
notice! She's just gone!'' Mike and his men begin to empty and lift
a bookshelf onto a dolly cart. ``No, wait,'' another woman pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Mike sighs. This is the third time he's tried to get the
furniture out of this place, after winning the bid to buy it. They
keep changing their minds, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' I suggest, ``they're just having a hard time letting
go. Maybe they're grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're right,'' Mike says.
</P>
<P>
   Then paranoia sets in amid the chaos. (What's a reporter doing
here? Gripe, gripe, gripe.) Whatever access to wang I had is
immediately revoked, and I am asked to leave the building; Mike is
scolded by an exasperated woman wearing a wrist brace; the delivery
guys shrug the great shrug of language barrier. But eventually, all
of the furniture makes its way to TOPS, including a set of drawers
that still say ``Access to Wang'' on them. Interlude: Paper, pens,
a table Forget the furniture. In the part of TOPS that is blessedly
air-conditioned, there is a trove of the color marker pens that
smell like fruit. Binder rings by the fistful (fun jewelry for the
pierce-phobic), thousands of extra-fat rubber bands, a stack of
restaurant order pads. Take a big shnurf from this Sanford
king-size permanent marker pen. Smell.
</P>
<P>
   Empty Rolodexes, and Rolodexes with lots of phone numbers
already in them. (Whose?) In one corner of the cramped supply room,
there are rubber stamps with curious messages: ``Count Deviation''
(a vampire?) or ``Debtor-in-Possession,'' and my favorite,
``Disapproved by A.W. Pogue.'' Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Lost again on a Sunday afternoon among the office junk, a man
with punkish strawberry-blond hair with blue streaks in it walks
around the desks and chairs with his female friend. He becomes
enamored with a metal desk for $65. ``I'm going to use it as a
dining table,'' Mark Zatopek, 29, says. ``In our middle room
there's this sort of `old office' I'm reconstructing. There's a
typewriter that's really old, a suitcase. I have a telephone that I
got at an antique store, from the late `40s or early '50s. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the heaviness of it all,'' he explains. ``I'm always
suspicious of new stuff. ... This table,'' he pronounces, ``can
stand on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   One time, Mark Zatopek came into TOPS and saw a typewriter
stand, and Scotch-taped to the top of it was a tattered and amended
list of phone numbers. There was a pathos in it. ``The phone
numbers looked so important. To somebody they were,'' he says.
``And then you think someone will just buy this table and tear the
phone list away.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the nostalgia business.
</P>
<P>
   It's just office supplies, not ``Sanford and Son.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hudkins returned from an auction at one of the hangars at
Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, enamored of a remote-controlled
fire hydrant that he did not buy. Because who would need that? What
he bought were ``the prettiest in-and-out boxes I've seen, the
really old kind. The wood is just really nice.'' And here they are,
forming a kind of Jenga shrine several feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Paper in, paper out. A peculiar little monument to pushing
paper.

 &HT;    The spectator sport
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Whether it's Gator fans who can't stand the
'Noles or Ohio State haters of the Michigan Wolverines, no one's on
the sidelines when they see a Bob Leathers sports painting.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrator, who moved to Stuart 10 months ago, paints
pictures of fans for fans, capitalizing on that healthy hatred that
exists between long-standing rivals. In the center of his newest
4-by-5-foot painting, for instance, two garnet-and-gold Florida
State Seminole fans stare at their tickets in shock as University
of Florida fans celebrate wildly around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to paint the athletes,'' says Leathers, who
moved to Florida from Cleveland with his wife, Barb, to be close to
their families in Stuart and Tampa. ``I wanted to do something of
the people, for the people. What's the most essential element in
sports? Fans.''
</P>
<P>
   While his Norman Rockwell-style paintings sell for between
$3,500 and $6,500, Leathers' business is based on the 16-by-20-inch
reproduction posters he sells for under $25. An ad in a big
college's alumni newsletter can sell as many as 3,000 posters.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrator works from his converted garage, and he and Barb
do everything from shrink-wrap to ship.
</P>
<P>
   They even model.
</P>
<P>
   Leathers decides which college's fans to paint by reading
marketing reports on which schools sell the most licensed
souvenirs. He then throws a party for friends, relatives and
neighbors, and has them act out the fans' roles while he snaps
pictures. They then end up in the next painting.
</P>
<P>
   While he's always working on any number of jobs, ranging from
painting the Budweiser lizards to a series of limited edition
Treasure Coast prints, it's the football feuds that he says are the
most fun.
</P>
<P>
   The die-hard Indians and Browns enthusiast created his first fan
painting in 1993 while he was a partner at a Cleveland advertising
agency. The oil painting, ``Right Church, Wrong Pew,'' has two
reviled Pittsburgh Steelers fans anchored in a section of cheering
Browns fans.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished ``Right Church, Wrong Pew,'' Leathers invested
$12,000 in NFL license fees, printing and other costs to create
1,500 posters. They sold quickly at Cleveland art galleries and
frame shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit on something, and I knew it was right even though I was
told they'd never sell,'' says Leathers, 48.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Right Church'' painting will hang in a loge section of the
new stadium being built for the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   A Leathers painting called ``Going, Going, Gone'' shows
Cleveland Indians fans cheering to the anguish of two New York
Yankees fans. That painting was bought by Indians' owner Richard
Jacobs and now hangs in the reception area of the team's offices at
Jacobs Field. Of the thousands of ``Going, Going, Gone'' posters
that Leathers has sold, one hangs on the wall of Cleveland native
Drew Carey's ``house'' on his ABC sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   His first college football painting featured two lonely Michigan
fans surrounded by Ohio State Buckeyes. He followed with another
painting of two Pitt fans engulfed by West Virginia Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrator's precise, anecdotal realism is a dead ringer
for his hero, Norman Rockwell's. A framed print of Rockwell's
``Freedom of Speech'' hangs on a pale-yellow stucco wall in his
studio.
</P>
<P>
   A large white canvas in front of the garage door awaits
Leathers' next creation. Penciled in are two startled Ohio State
fans in a mass of Michigan Wolverines. After that, he'll trap two
Gator fans amid celebrating Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's now a Florida resident, Leathers won't pick a
side: Gators or 'Noles. When it comes to football feuds, Bob
Leathers is an equal opportunity painter.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO ORDER
</P>
<P>
   To order a Bob Leathers poster, $24.95 plus $6.50 shipping, call
R&AMP;L Studios in Stuart: (561) 219-8082.

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Bengals president Mike Brown and coach Bruce Coslet
may never be this loose and relaxed again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, it's all business.
</P>
<P>
   After recounting all the offseason moves during the annual
pretraining camp luncheon at the Queen City Club, both proclaimed
the Bengals are ready to face the challenges of the brutal schedule
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pointed to Boomer Esiason's retirement to the broadcasting
booth, Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson's trade to the Washington
Redskins and John Copeland's torn left Achilles tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't the end of our difficulties,'' Brown said.
``The committee that does the (NFL) schedule has given us a doozy
(with nine games against 1997 playoff teams). It sort of looms in
front of us like an immovable object.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our work cut out for us and we know it. Yet, in spite
of all this, I feel good about where we are. While we have a real
challenge in front of us, I look forward to getting into the season
and showing we can do all right. I feel we will do all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the optimism is all the new players, especially
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals signed six free agents _ quarterback Neil O'Donnell,
defensive ends Michael Bankston and Clyde Simmons, linebacker Jerry
Olsavsky, cornerback Thomas Randolph and strong safety Myron Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The team also added a nine-man draft class featuring five
defenders, including first-round linebackers Takeo Spikes and Brian
Simmons. They are the only remaining holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Add those defensive newcomers to an already-talented offense and
the Bengals hope it equals their first winning season since 1990.
``We have a lot of new players on defense _ old players, young
players, but new players,'' Brown said. ``It will take a while for
them to gell. That's one of the challenges Bruce and (defensive
coordinator) Dick LeBeau have in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``On offense, we come back with a more veteran team. Almost
everybody is established except at the quarterback position, where
we have a competition (between Jeff Blake and Neil O'Donnell for
the starting job).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen these quarterback controversies for many, many
years. They have one thing in common _ they resolve themselves on
the field. In this case, that will happen, too, and when it does,
we'll be a better team because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet is confident the Bengals can improve on their 7-9 record
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think, overall, we've upgraded ourselves talent-wise,'' he
said. ``It'll be critical to see how fast they can get up to speed
in what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year in the draft, we had two things in mind: Continue to
build our defense and increase our team speed. We think we
accomplished both. I'm not going to make any predictions. But I can
promise you this: We're going to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Coslet _ who owns a 14-11 record entering his second full
season as Bengals head coach _ feel any pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said. ``It's a pressure-packed business. I felt the
pressure the first snap I took on a football field, the first day I
was an assistant (in 1980 with the 49ers). It's part of the job.''

 &HT;    Spokesman says Huffy bike manufacturer will soon close
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ The Huffy Corp. will make its last bicycle in
Celina next week (week of July 27) when the company lays off 650
workers and stops production at what used to be the world's largest
bike factory.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Miamisburg-based company announced May 28 that
the Celina plant would be closed, but the massive layoff of its
hourly workforce will come sooner than first expected.
</P>
<P>
   Only 200 parts makers and support personnel will remain employed
at the plant after the layoffs July 31. The plant officially will
close Oct. 2, according to Tom Frederick, Huffy's vice president of
finance and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy officials originally said it would take about a year to
phase out the plant, but Frederick said the company was able to
expedite added production to its bike factory in Farmington, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really has been no last-second outcry from our employees
and we are thankful for the orderly shutdown,'' Frederick said.
Huffy plans to increase bike production at the Farmington plant and
will import more bikes from Asia and Mexico to cover the lost
production in Celina.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy's workforce, represented by the United Steel Workers of
America Local 5369, have not disrupted production since the company
announced it would close the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But several workers are still angry and having difficulty
finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say what they want, but they shoved us out on the
street and now we're faced with raising our families on jobs that
pay $5.50 an hour,'' said Dennis Gehle, an employee at Huffy for 26
years. ``My wife and I both work there and thought we could retire
at Huffy, but we'll be gone next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Huffy announced it would close the Celina plant, the
company had told workers they would have to work for as little as
$6.10 an hour with no health benefits and no pension plan or risk
losing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble between Huffy and its workforce began in 1995, when
workers agreed to a 20 percent pay cut after the company's bike
division lost $10.5 million. About 2,000 hourly workers were
employed at the bike plant in 1994 before layoffs trimmed
employment to a low of 650.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Huffy officials said they needed workers to
accept more concessions so the company could trim about $15 million
from operating costs at the Celina plant.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick said the company plans to hire a national real estate
firm to handle the sale of its Celina facility. Frederick said the
company would be willing to sell the 40-year-old, block-long
building for about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the potential buyers would be manufacturers and a
quick sale would benefit both Huffy and the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy Corp. last reported break-even earnings for the second
quarter due to a $12.6 million charge related to the closing of the
Celina plant. The company also makes basketball backboards and lawn
and garden tools, and markets inventory and supplier services.

 &HT;    Konerko says trade is ``like breaking up with a girlfriend''
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul Konerko is learning as much about the inner
workings of baseball as he is about how the game is played on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson _ don't believe everything management tells you.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Tommy Lasorda became interim general manager of
the Los Angeles Dodgers, he called Konerko into his office and
said, ``Don't worry about anything, kid. You're a Dodger, you're
not going anywhere, you won't be traded.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later Konerko was traded to the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was the kiss of death, for the week before I
was traded I relaxed because I thought I'd be staying with the
Dodgers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So when Konerko walked into Dodger Stadium Monday afternoon, it
was a strange sensation. Instead of turning left to go to the home
clubhouse, he turned right to the visitor's clubhouse.
Nevertheless, he still walked over to his old clubhouse to say
hello to friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being traded is like breaking up with a girl friend,'' he
said. ``You still have feelings. Those guys in the Dodger clubhouse
are the only guys I've played with. While it's big for me, coming
back, it isn't that big for the fans. . .nothing like it will be
when Mike Piazza comes back for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   They are crucifying Lasorda on the Left Coast for the trade that
sent Konerko and left-handed pitcher Dennis Reyes to the Reds for
closer Jeff Shaw. The prevailing thought is that Lasorda was
pillaged and fired general manager Fred Claire told confidantes,
``I wouldn't have traded Konerko or Reyes straight-up for Shaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko was named Minor League Player of the Year for 1997 by
Baseball America and won the J.G. Taylor Spink Award as the top
player in minor-league baseball. He was the Pacific Coast League
Most Valuable Player and the Dodgers' Minor League Player of the
Year two seasons in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And Lasorda traded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed at first,'' Konerko said. ``But now I'm
happy because no matter what, I'm getting to play. It's like
changing schools. . .it takes time to learn things. But I went 0
for 4 that last two games, played just terrible, and my name is
still on the lineup card. That wouldn't have happened with the
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko takes exception to those who say that because the Reds
are rebuilding that they will be a rug for the rest of the National
League to wipe its feet on for the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we're building for the future, we're not
conceding that we're going to be terrible,'' said the 22-year-old
third baseman/first baseman/outfielder who was a catcher when the
Dodgers drafted him No. 1 in 1994. ``The players don't feel that
way. We feel we're going to compete. There is no reason why we
can't excel and raise our level of play as we go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we strikeout or don't win games, we don't say, 'That's
OK, we're young,''' Konerko said. ``No matter who we played, we won
10 in a row and we won 15 of 16 and even though we lost three
straight to the Padres, we played them tough in the last two. If we
can play them tough, we can play anybody tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Konerko is new so he can be forgiven if he doesn't realize
the Reds lost 11 of 12 games to the Padres this season, but you
have to like the way he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   And fortunately for The Young Reds, it's the way they all think.
But Konerko will be wary if general manager Jim Bowden calls him
into the office and says, ``Don't worry about anything, kid. You're
a Red. You're not going anywhere. You won't be traded.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when he'll pack his bags. He is a fast learner

few days after Tommy Lasorda became interim general manager of the
Los Angeles Dodgers, he called Konerko into his office and said,
``Don't worry about anything, kid. You're a Dodger, you're not
going anywhere, you won't be traded.'' A week later Konerko was

Wolverines, no one's on the sidelines when they see a Bob Leathers
sports painting. The illustrator, who moved to Stuart 10 months
ago, paints pictures of fans for fans, capitalizing on that healthy
hatred that exists between long-standing rivals. In the center of
his newest 4-by-5-foot painting, for instance, two garnet-and-gold
Florida State Seminole fans stare at their tickets in shock as
University of Florida fans celebrate wildly around them.

   The unassuming Liverpool home where Paul McCartney, now 56,
lived from 1955 to 1964 opened as a museum. The dwelling at 20
Forthlin Rd. was bought in 1995 by the National Trust, which spent
more than $75,000 to re-create the linoleum floors, brown wallpaper
and Spartan furnishings typical of British post-World War II life.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, who wrote ``Love Me Do'' and ``I Saw Her Standing
There'' with John Lennon in the parlor of the house, said in the
guidebook: ``My mum and dad would have found it very hard to
believe that the house is now a National Trust property. You expect
the National Trust to own places like Blenheim Palace, not a little
terrace house like this.'' But, he said, they would be pleased, and
so is he.

   Three French officials are facing trial on fraud charges in a

believed to date to 30,000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Chauvet, who stumbled on the cave with its 300-odd
paintings on Dec. 18, 1994, has accused Culture Ministry officials
of trying to deprive him of rights to exploit the trove in the
Ardeche region by producing a false exploration order dated just
four days earlier. An investigating magistrate agreed that the
authorization was backdated. If valid, the order would bar Chauvet,
employed by an archeological service, on the grounds that he made
the find while on assignment.

   NEW YORK _ In another celebration of the 150th anniversary of

together for the first time to display the full range of his
achievements. The display, running through Jan. 31, begins with his

enamelwork, pottery, furniture, jewelry and textiles.

Eugene O'Neill's works in the next eight years, Playwrights Theater
will hold a festival of musical performances, stagings, forums and
variations on his creations from Aug. 4 to Sept. 11. All are to
take place at the Provincetown Playhouse, 133 Macdougal St. in
Greenwich Village, home of O'Neill's first New York production,
``Bound East for Cardiff,'' in 1916. The festival opens with a
``ragtime revue'' featuring Steve Ross and K.T. Sullivan performing
popular songs used in O'Neill's plays.

LOLITA-TV (Los Angeles) _ Dominque Swain was the unlikely choice to
play Lolita, but the Malibu High senior beat the odds and won the

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seasonably hot and humid air will cover a large section of the
nation Wednesday, as the jet stream remains across the far northern
tier of states. However, changes are in store from the Great Lakes
to the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the change is a vigorous jet stream disturbance
plunging southward from the upper Plains. The disturbance will
drive a mound of cold air into a wedge of hot and humid air,
causing bands of thunderstorms to develop from the central Plains
to eastern Great Lakes. Some storms will turn severe with large
hail and damaging wind gusts. Storms will move into the Northeast
this afternoon. Meanwhile, the coastal Northeast will be very hot,
with readings in the 90s. The mercury will touch 100 degrees in the
Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Strong high pressure near 18,000 feet will remain above much of
the West, prolonging the heat wave. However, the monsoon
circulation will provide expanding relief from the sweltering heat
in parts of the Rockies. Thundershowers will erupt over the
mountains, as the peaks provide an elevated heat source for
currents of rising air. Most of the valleys will remain dry, where
lightning strikes may ignite scattered wildfires. Along the
immediate coast, ocean cooled air will prompt a few fog patches.
Temperatures will hold in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, thundershowers will again develop over Florida and
the Southeast in response to the heating of the day. Another
cluster of thundershowers will accompany a tropical wave in the
western Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rare Rain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday was a rare day in San Diego as nearly a quarter of an
inch of rain fell in an afternoon thundershower. Normally, summer
is a very dry time along the southern California coast, with San
Diego averaging just 0.01 inches of rain in July. In addition,
thunder typically occurs once a decade. Thunderstorms and the rain
they produce are often fueled by hot and humid air. Such conditions
are a rare combination for coastal California where cool ocean
currents suppress both heat and humidity. A pocket of muggy air
originating from the Gulf of California contributed to the record
rain. &QL;

MOVIE'S TEEN STAR FEELS CONNECTION WITH CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ David Swain knew exactly how to surprise his daughter
Dominique when he picked her up at Los Angeles International
Airport after her audition in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a rose on the seat of the car,'' he said, ``and she just
screamed at the top of her lungs, `I'm Lolita'!''
</P>
<P>
   That parody three years ago of one of the more memorable scenes
from the controversial movie ``Lolita'' served two purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It told her she beat out more than 2,500 other actresses for the
title role. It also reinforced that her parents were unquestionably
behind her in participating in a film about pedophilia _ a film
that, as it turned out, was almost never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The $58 million project based on Vladimir Nabokov's 1954 novel
was spurned by many outlets, languishing for two years before
Showtime came along.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime paid a fraction of the film's costs for the rights to
show ``Lolita'' at 9 p.m. Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The R-rated film actually will debut tonight and run for a week
at the Landmark Checci Gori Fine Art Theatre in Beverly Hills to
qualify for Academy Award consideration. It's expected to be
released in theaters again for a longer run in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita,'' set in 1947, also stars Jeremy Irons as Humbert
Humbert, a refined, witty professor of French literature who falls
in love with a child who later would become his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tragedy,'' said Irons, who has played his share
of creepy characters. ``I think it's a love story. I think it's a
portrait of America at a certain time. It has many levels. But, I
think, like any piece of work, you can take it for what you want.
For me, because I was a protagonist, it is a love story _ and a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Swain, a senior at Malibu High School, seems to
understand all of this with a charming teen-age awkwardness,
including making faces, giggling and nervously shifting her lanky
body.
</P>
<P>
   She read the famous novel and felt a connection with Lolita.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I knew what Lolita was thinking and feeling,
even more than Humbert Humbert seemed to,'' Swain said. ``And I
knew that I would do a good job portraying her. Humbert Humbert was
a sicko, but in some way you wanted him to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Swain, whose resume included one stint as a stunt double when
she was 10, was a late entrant into the national search for Lolita.
The Los Angeles casting call already had passed when the
then-14-year-old decided to get involved. Her father and manager
put together an amateurish videotape, produced in her brother's
Marina del Rey apartment, which featured her reading the novel and
making Lolita-like faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made this homemade tape, which I thought was terrific, and
she was funny in it,'' said director Adrian Lyne. ``I had already
almost decided on a professional actress, and so I thought, `What
have I got to lose if I test Dominique at the same time?' And, in
the end, the chemistry between her and Jeremy was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely schoolgirl got to work with the director of such
salacious movies as ``9{ Weeks,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and
``Indecent Proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I thought I wasn't sure if I was doing
the right thing,'' David Swain said. ``But, playing Monday morning
quarterback, it worked out great. This is a classic. This is an
important subject. If I was a pedophile, this would make me think
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, who will turn 18 in August, was 15 when production
on the movie began. Cindy Swain, a boutique owner, was on the set
the entire time the film was shot, acting as her daughter's
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one scene where she slides down a banister, and her
panties were showing,'' David Swain said. ``She made them shoot it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nudity was not an issue for the Lolita character _ however, in
the did-we-need-to-see-that department, Frank Langella, who plays
playwright Clare Quilty, is seen naked _ and Lyne employed a body
double for some of the more sensuous scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely comfortable making this film,'' Dominique
Swain said, ``I mean because of (Irons) and because of (Lyne). They
put me completely at ease. I'm just so thankful that I was able to
try things out and have my ideas taken seriously. They just gave me
the reins: `You're Lolita. You're this nymphet. Just do what you
do'.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Swain, the actress. She did not appear nearly as
comfortable on stage as part of a five-person panel to promote the
film recently at the Showtime portion of the Television Critics
Association Summer Press Tour. She was antsy and animated, but
rarely got a word in.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which of the film's locations _ which included Texas,
California, South Carolina and North Carolina _ was her favorite,
she said, ``Oh, Texas, good lord. Something that sticks out in my
mind is when we had to quit filming because there was some kind of
natural disaster, like there was this tin roof blowing off a house
and, like, flying through the set.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyne told her that it was a dust storm in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dust storm, hick bowl,'' said Swain, who said UCLA and NYU are
her top college choices.
</P>
<P>
   On that note, Jerry Offsay, the president of programming at
Showtime quickly changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to blurt out my business,'' said Swain to a
small pocket of reporters after the press conference. ``I don't
think what I had to say coincided with the message Showtime wanted
to be portraying.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the ballroom foyer, Swain's youthful personality came
out. She was refreshing and honest, but unmistakably raw. When
asked what her father did, she said simply, ``He's an electrical
engineer and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-youngest of five children enjoyed not having to fight
for attention, although she said she was concerned that the lavish
treatment she received on the set could spoil her.
</P>
<P>
   She described Irons as a ``Dinosaur. Maybe it was my immaturity.
On the set, there were these ladies who just wanted to get a
glimpse of him. I was like, `You ladies, whatever'.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she did say that Irons became her friend and that he
had a very young demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what she thinks when she sees a mismatched couple,
like Humbert and Lolita, at, let's say, the mall, she said, ``Oh,
God, that relationship is ill. Just what is either of you getting
out of it?''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Lolita,'' Swain said that she got a lot of pleasure out
of acting, but that doesn't mean she is looking at it as a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting is so much fun, I just feel like I want to do something
different, something more important,'' she said. ``I know that's
not what you're supposed to say. You're supposed to love what you
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I think I want to direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like someone way beyond her years.

`SALTMEN OF TIBET': A SPIRITUAL TREK BY YAK CARAVAN 
</HEADLINE>

   At several points in ``The Saltmen of Tibet,'' Ulrike Koch's
profoundly absorbing study of a small band of nomads trekking
across the Tibetan high country with a caravan of 160 yaks, the
camera draws back to observe from afar an annual pilgrimage that
has been taking place for 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the distant caravan almost imperceptibly
inching its way across an arid, seemingly endless steppe rimmed
with snow-capped mountains is such a primal image of human
perseverance that it has the power to sweep away for a moment more
sophisticated reflections on civilization and its discontents.
</P>
<P>
   The entire movie, in fact, could be described as a kind of
spiritual palette cleanser because of the force with which it
conveys a life reduced to its essentials but still vibrant with
faith.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of this documentary, which runs nearly two hours,
are the members of a nomadic Tibetan tribe that has subsisted for
centuries by extracting salt from a group of remote holy lakes in
northern Tibet and trading it for grain. Each spring, a tiny band
of men from the tribe leads a caravan on a grueling three-month
cross-country journey to the Himalayan lake region in northern
Tibet. Wading in the muddy shallows, they rake the salt into
pyramidal heaps, then pack and sew it into huge sacks that are
strapped to the backs of the animals for the laborious return trip.
</P>
<P>
   The entire process unfolds in a spirit of solemn joy, with
elaborate chants and prayers accompanying every step of the
journey. Once the nomads enter the lake region, they begin to
communicate in a secret ``salt language'' known only to themselves
and to the Buddhist deities they are honoring. One of the final
rituals is the creation of miniature animal sculptures, which are
left behind in the lake as an offering.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing theme of the film is the intimate relationship
between the tribesmen and their animals. There is precious little
grazing land for the yaks along the route, and sometimes the beasts
become so hungry that they begin eating sand. The film's most
touching scene involves the gentle examination of a yak that has
contracted a fatal intestinal ailment after consuming dirt. The
herdsmen are so sensitive to the animal's health that they can
gauge its condition by putting their ears to its stomach and
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating the movie are excerpts from the story of King Gesar
of Ling, a national Tibetan epic, hauntingly sung by an
unidentified female shaman who is a member of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koch, the German-born filmmaker who made ``The Saltmen of
Tibet,'' is a Sinologist and ethnographer who worked as a location
scout and casting director on the Bernardo Bertolucci films ``The
Last Emperor'' and ``Little Buddha.'' Hearing of the legendary but
seldom glimpsed salt caravans from a Chinese photographer who had
lived in Tibet, she and a film crew undertook an extensive search
through the wilds of the country to track down the elusive traders.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chinese authorities revoked permission for Ms. Koch to
shoot a 16-millimeter documentary, she returned with a digital
video camera and a crew of three to spend three months
surreptitiously traveling with the tribe. The video was transferred
to 35-mm film.
</P>
<P>
   Without bearing down too heavily, the film suggests that the
2,000-year tradition may be coming to end. When the salt men reach
the lake, they find themselves competing with modern commercial
interests, arriving in trucks. Even here, on the ``roof of the
world,'' modern industry has begun staking its claim.

`LOLITA' REMAKE CAN'T COMPARE WITH ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 2{ Stars. 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; After years of delays, the second ``Lolita''
movie is finally upon us. Can't say it's been worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lyne's overly dramatic rendering of Vladimir Nabokov's
brilliant novel is playing for one week at the Cecchi Gori Fine
Arts Theatre in Beverly Hills in order to qualify for Academy Award
consideration before it hits the Showtime cable network next month.
Academy consideration? Now there's a perverse delusion Nabokov
would have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   He probably wouldn't have cared much for anything else Lyne _
the auteur of vulgarity responsible for ``Flashdance,'' ``Fatal
Attraction'' and ``Indecent Proposal'' _ has done with his
brainchild, though. Blind to much of Nabokov's sophisticated irony,
Lyne views the thing as a full-blown tragedy about a misunderstood
pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Nabokov reserved some sympathy for nymphet-loving Humbert
Humbert _ that, more than anything, is what made the 1958 book such
a scandal _ but he was also eminently aware of what made Humbert an
overcivilized monster and first-class fool. All Lyne wants us to do
is feel the man's pain. The legion of distributors who wanted
nothing to do with this ``Lolita'' were probably right in guessing
that this spin would outrage parents and moralists. Lovers of
smart, complex literature, however, are likely to be the most
offended.
</P>
<P>
   And film fans will just be disappointed. Again. The
Nabokov-scripted, Stanley Kubrick-directed 1962 version was
infinitely more intelligent than this one, but it naturally
couldn't address the central issue _ Humbert's romantic obsession
with his 14-year-old stepdaughter _ as directly as could be done in
our supposedly more liberated times.
</P>
<P>
   At least Lyne is straightforward about that stuff; the problem
is that he doesn't get what makes this so much more than the story
of a sensitive pervert. Considering that, Lyne atypically restrains
himself from indulging the most controversial aspect of the piece.
Lolita and Humbert's few apparent love scenes are filmed with
overcompensatory discretion, either in obscuring blue shadows if
nudity's a component or well-clothed if daylight's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes probably qualify under some legal definition of
kiddie porn, but any real shock value has been aestheticized out of
them. The movie gets more visual quease from Frank Langella's
Keitelesque decision to play Clare Quilty's death throes buck
naked.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Langella is no Peter Sellers, who played the
role in the '62 version. And Melanie Griffith, despite adding an
amusing extra level of denseness to Lolita's luckless mom
Charlotte, can't erase the memory of Shelly Winters'
grotesque/pathetic '60s incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne's leads, however, are cast well enough to hold their own
against James Mason and Sue Lyon's now iconic interpretations. Yes,
Jeremy Irons is too grave and wounded to vivify Humbert's wickeder
traits. But since Lyne's limited agenda is so big on ruefulness,
you just can't imagine a better sad sack for the job. And Irons
does make it clear that, when Humbert can get beyond objectifying
Lolita, he somehow truly loves her.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dominique Swain initially comes off as a more freshly
scrubbed, natural Lolita; fitting her braces and pigtails to a T,
she embodies Nabokov's definition of nymphet more truly than Lyon
with her precocious sensuality and heart-shaped sunglasses did.
Swain is also the better actress. Though appearing more innocent,
she locates the exultation in Lolita's power over the men who
exploit her, and she gets the film's only real laughs with a
consistent display of honest, obnoxious adolescent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps a little, since even when he's reading Nabokov's
sharpest lines in voice-over, Irons always sounds like he's
delivering eulogies. Lyne's attempts at visual irony are even
clunkier: Lolita's liking for bananas, say, or repeated cutaways to
moths frying themselves on a porch lantern while Quilty taunts his
rival Humbert.
</P>
<P>
   It's not dumb ideas that ultimately scuttle this ``Lolita,''
though. It's tedium. Overlong by a good half-hour, the film plods
through variation after variation of Lolita provoking him, Humbert
losing it, Humbert apologizing, and then they drive around some
more.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lyne makes the classic mistake that Nabokov, and
even Kubrick, deftly avoided. He forgets that one man's sexual
fixation is intrinsically interesting only to those who share it,
and essentially boring to the many more who don't. ``Lolita'' _
which some bunch of academics has just declared the fourth greatest
English-language novel of the 20th century _ can and always will be
accused of many sins. But numbing viewers out should never have
been one of them.

A LESSON (OR TWO) IN COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; For Sherman Oaks-bred Matthew Morgan, graduating
from college did not mean putting on a cap and gown, but a red
nose, wild fright wig and big, floppy shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Morgan is a clown, a graduate of the famous
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Clown College in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, 24, will be part of the show when the circus comes to
the Los Angeles Sports Arena Wednesday through Sunday and to the
Forum in Inglewood Aug. 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``In clown school, we learned character development, acrobatics,
mime, slapstick comedy, water-spitting, pie-throwing and
juggling,'' Morgan explained, adding that his own clown character
is jovial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really loves older people as well as younger kids,'' Morgan
said. ``He'll often find himself in trouble, but he's so pleasant,
it's hard to blame him.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan graduated from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks,
later attending the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   His opening night with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey was
Dec. 27 in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' he recalled. ``I had done some theater
previously, but when you're in the circus preshow, it's very
interactive and improvisational. You really have to create comedy
out of nothing. So, there was some apprehension, but now after six
months I'm very comfortable out there, and I take real joy in the
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said there's genuine camaraderie backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's very close, but the clowns are probably the only
American acts in the show, except for the ringmaster,'' he said.
``Everybody's really rooting for everyone else. It's a very
supportive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he and the other 18 traveling clowns live together
on a special circus train and hang out together during down time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The friendship we have offstage allows for us to really work
together on the floor,'' he said, adding that he looks forward to
eventually moving back to Sherman Oaks, where his mother still
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a certain life in L.A. from growing up there, but I
want some concrete or solid opportunity to do something in the
entertainment field,'' he said.

IT'S NEW TO YOU: SHAKESPEARE, ETC.   
 NETWORK PROGRAMMERS' SELF-CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ So you're a television network; you're got
two classics from the world of literature, Shakespeare's
``Tempest'' and Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment,'' on your
schedule next season. What do you do to get people to watch?
</P>
<P>
   If you're NBC, you make sure two things are very certain: You
don't mention the name Shakespeare, and you don't even think of
trying out the slogan ``Must See Dostoyevsky.''
</P>
<P>
   John Miller and Vince Manze run the network's advertising and
promotion department, widely praised as the best in the business,
not the least for the creation of the omnipresent mantra ``Must See
TV.'' In recent years, they've helped make ratings hits out of
everything from ``'Gulliver's Travels'' to Homer's ``Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's apparently a limit to their inventiveness. Asked if
Dostoyevsky's name would appear on any promotions for this season's
two-hour adaptation of ``Crime and Punishment,'' Manze said, ``Let
me think,'' followed instantly by, ``No.'' Miller added, ``And I
doubt Shakespeare will appear either in `The Tempest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both shows are products of the NBC movie division run by Lindy
DeKoven. She will deliver other literary-quality projects next
season, including ``Alice in Wonderland'' and ``Noah's Ark.'' This
represents a significant shift in the direction of the television
movie, Ms. DeKoven said, especially from the days when NBC's movie
list (and those of the other networks) was dominated by true-crime
tales and other ripped-from-the-headlines dramas. Was NBC suddenly
infected with better taste?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, Ms. DeKoven said. It just had little choice after
shows like ``Dateline NBC'' started stealing all the ideas from the
news. `` `Dateline' is really a series of TV movies,'' she said.
``They're doing all the stories we used to do, the septuplets, for
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Compelled to look for films that could offer something
different, Ms. DeKoven found herself turning to classics,
especially given the big success of ``Gulliver'' three seasons ago.
The inspiration to do ``Crime and Punishment'' was personal, she
said: ''I read the book in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that gathering an audience for the complex
Russian tale of the fight between good and evil for a young man's
soul was not going to be easy. ``It's our biggest gamble,'' Ms.
DeKoven said.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than ``The Tempest'' because NBC is basically doing
Dostoyevsky straight, even if he won't be credited in the promos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tempest'' is taking certain liberties. The text will be
adjusted to a more American vernacular, its producer said, and the
setting has been changed to an island in the Mississippi bayou
during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Criticism
</P>
<P>
   Most often it is reporters and critics who decide that each
succeeding new television season is more lackluster than the last,
but this year that opinion is coming from more unusual sources:
several program executives responsible for putting together the
fall television schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The chief programmer for one network put it bluntly in
conversation with reporters who cover the television industry.
``Frankly, the new show development was weak everywhere this
year,'' said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``And I'm including ours in that.''
</P>
<P>
   A programming executive for a different network, NBC, bemoaned
the ``total absence of enthusiasm about our new shows'' he detected
among NBC colleagues during presentations here over the last
several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be out pushing these shows as hard as we can,'' he
said. ``But everybody is subdued.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he speculated, is the burden NBC is laboring under
as it prepares to enter its first season in five without
``Seinfeld'' as the top-rated anchor of its crucial Thursday night.
The network is all too aware, he said, of how important it is to
find new hits fast.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield said in a news
conference here that he was ``pretty bullish about our new
product.'' But his assessment of prospects for the coming season
was that it would be ``sensational'' if NBC ratings stayed stable.
``I would say to you that our goal is really to hold,'' Littlefield
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a business that tends to erode every season, that may count
as optimism. Executives at ABC were willing to go a bit further.
Stu Bloomberg and Jamie Tarses, the top programmers, predicted that
the network's fortunes would improve next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be totally surprised if we did not do better,''
Bloomberg said, citing what he called an ``incredibly strong''
lineup of new shows. Of course, it also won't hurt that three hours
of ``Monday Night Football,'' instead of two, will be in prime time
this season.

</P>
<P>
   A: The hamburger-loving clown first appeared in local ads
produced in 1963 by McDonald's franchise owners John Gibson and
Oscar Goldstein, according to ``Forbes Greatest Business Stories of
All Time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, the company didn't market nationally, so
Gibson and Goldstein promoted their Washington, D.C., restaurants
by sponsoring the local children's show ``Bozo's Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   When the show was canceled, they recruited the actor portraying
Bozo to appear as a new clown called Ronald McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   This first Ronald was future ``Today'' show weatherman Willard
Scott, who was used only in those local ads. Ronald made his
national debut at the 1966 Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find a studio version of the song ``Against All

 &HT;    GOP STANDS FIRM ON SHIELDING HMO'S FROM LAWSUITS
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN and REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans have no plans to ease their
refusal to allow patients to sue their health maintenance
organizations for malpractice, Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., said
Tuesday following a meeting of GOP leaders and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Liability for HMOs, currently protected from malpractice suits
by federal law, has emerged as the pivotal issue in the debate over
regulating managed care companies. The House is likely to vote on
the issue by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the American Medical Association descended on Capitol
Hill and leading Democrats pressed their plan to overhaul the
managed care industry Tuesday amid an intense lobbying campaign on
both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to be happy unless HMOs get the
same treatment they've had'' on exposure to lawsuits, Linder said
of the AMA officials. ``We're not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the matter is a 1974 law that protects insurance
companies and health maintenance organizations from lawsuits
seeking monetary awards. Democrats and a band of Republicans, led
by Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, have attacked the law as
unwarranted protection to managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs and foreign diplomats are the only ones to have liability
protection,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the chief architect
of the Democratic bill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton would veto any bill that allowed managed care
companies to keep their liability shield, Dingell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans appeared to stand behind a bill proposed last
week by a special task force appointed by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Linder spent 40 minutes with AMA officials in an
effort to soften the organization's opposition to the Republican
legislation. But it was to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the AMA, said Gingr ar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is becoming a trial lawyers' bill of rights,'' said Mark
Merritt, vice president of the Association of Health Plans, which
represents about 1,000 managed care companies. ``The task force
bill would raise the cost of health care by billions and price many
Americans right out of health insurance.''

CONTROVERSY LOOMS IN NEW FALL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Some shows court controversy like a juvenile
delinquent. Others have it thrust on them by reporters looking for
an angle.
</P>
<P>
   One fall series on Fox that seems to fit the latter description
is ``That '70s Show,'' a smart-looking throwback to an era of bad
fashion and bad hair, as experienced by six teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   A few TV critics Tuesday questioned scenes in the pilot episode
that have some of the kids smoking pot and drinking beer.
Co-creator Bonnie Turner, however, said it was simply an attempt to
deal honestly with things that happened in the '70s, and that the
show doesn't dwell on such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Turner added: ``I think we'd also be criticized if we ignored
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Touche.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another show with a target painted on its chest is NBC's
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' a comedy about a man and a woman who would make
the perfect couple, except that he's gay. So, instead, they're best
friends.
</P>
<P>
   With a post-``Ellen'' fervor bordering on hysteria, critics
wanted to know if Will (played by Eric McCormack) will get to kiss
another man, assuming that Grace (Debra Messing) certainly will get
that chance.
</P>
<P>
   James Burrows, best known as a co-creator of ``Cheers,''
replied: ``We will try to make the most entertaining show possible
and deal with the issues that way. We're not here to proselytize at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrows, one of the most sought-after directors in TV, signed to
direct the first 13 episodes of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' because he said it
had the best new script he'd seen. He told critics, ``We will do a
show that makes us laugh and is entertaining, and ... if we find an
entertaining way to do a kiss, ... we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It was at the invitation of Prince Charles that
actor/filmmaker Lord Richard Attenborough met Diana, the Princess
of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Charles wrote to me and asked me if I would teach his
very naive and shy and embarrassed young wife how to speak in
public, how to use a microphone, how to find techniques of dealing
with public speaking,'' Attenborough said. ``My real job,'' he
continued, ``was to give her confidence, to persuade her that she
really had something to say and something to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Attenborough chatted with critics via satellite Monday to
promote ``Diana,'' a two-hour documentary tribute that will air
Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Though admitting the program is a celebration of Diana's life,
Attenborough said it is not completely sycophantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her faults and her consciousness of the way she dealt with the
media _ that is in the program,'' he said. ``She manipulated the
media to a certain extent, but she used the burden of her fame to
achieve things which no other person, in my memory, has ever
done.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Viewers may not agree, but ``ER'' executive producer John
Wells actually thinks networks are showing much more patience with
new shows, particularly dramatic series, than they did a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said that five years ago, a show like ``Nothing Sacred''
never would have lasted as long as it did last season on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that going up against NBC's Thursday night was
a kamikaze mission,'' said Wells, an admirer of the show. ``You're
just diving into the deck of the carrier, and there are many, many
time slots like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wells congratulates networks for trying to broaden the
scope of what's on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in times when you really take chances do you have
success,'' he said. At the same time, he admitted, when a network
takes chances it often has a tough time attracting an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who had a hit in ``ER'' right from the start, expects his
latest effort for NBC, ``Trinity,'' to build slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday night ensemble drama, about a family of
Irish-American siblings, is not unlike ``Nothing Sacred'' in that
it focuses on human frailty and courage. (And one of the
characters, played by Tate Donovan, is a Catholic priest.)
</P>
<P>
   But Wells sees differences, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to focus on is the relationship
between the family members,'' he said, ``rather than the specific
issues.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Planned Planthood: Giving orphan plants a home
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You never know what the mail will bring from antiques dealer
Harvey Bourland. I was still mulling over his campaign to put a
watermelon on the Georgia flag and, I think, also on the Georgia
capitol dome, when he came through with a couple of other projects.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, called Planned Planthood Society, purports to save
all those plants some of us bring home from the nursery and don't
get around to setting out.
</P>
<P>
   That is a winner, but before I could find out his plans for
rescuing the unpotted, a clipping about the death of Judge Owen
McGivern, former chief justice of the appellate division of the New
York Supreme Court, fell out of Harvey's envelope. It was a long
story and interesting, but the last lines were what Harvey marked
for my attention.
</P>
<P>
   Judge McGivern had planned his own funeral _ every detail
including a low Mass ``with no incense'' in his Catholic church. He
ordered eulogies from a daughter and a son, ``not to exceed five
minutes each,'' and the singing of two hymns, ``Amazing Grace'' and
``A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,'' both of which I would have felt
were more Presbyterian than Catholic, but the judge must have known
what he was ordering. He held until the day he died that ``you
can't leave anything to chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Planned Planthood. Harvey, whose reputation for
tongue-in-cheek pronouncements is legendary among his friends, said
he got the idea for the society when he was watering the plants and
feeding the fish for a couple of vacationing friends. He noticed an
assortment of unpotted plants ``still in plastic containers and
mostly past saving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he wrote, ``are both professional people,
hardworking and successful. They had simply underestimated their
available time to transfer the plants to beds and larger,
decorative containers. Unintentional but unfortunate ... It
occurred to me that there are probably others _ the elderly and the
handicapped, who for various and valid reasons, have neither time
nor opportunity to plant or transfer `growees' to small beds,
containers or window boxes. How rewarding, I thought, if volunteers
_ in the manner of Habitat for Humanity _ could provide `homes' for
orphan plants ... Planned Planthood for the deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   The planting season is running out, but Harvey estimates it will
endure if we have a warm September. ``Almost daily I pass sidewalk
displays of `declining' plants in front of drug, grocery and
discount stores,'' he wrote. ``I am certain that these merchants
must discard a number of the plants, victims of the intense heat
and a failure of attendants to provide adequate waterings. Possibly
they would donate some of those which we could pick up, pot and/or
plant.''
</P>
<P>
   He needs volunteers for the resuscitation of plants and also to
find ``parents'' who are eager to accept plants. Churches and
nursing homes are possible prospects for accepting orphan plants,
he feels.
</P>
<P>
   If there are plant lovers about who would like to join Harvey in
this project, he will be glad to hear from you at what he calls
``my day job at Palace Forge,'' 404-237-3825, from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. weekdays or by fax any time. His fax number is 404-266-9388.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we be successful in organizing PPS,'' Harvey concluded,
``don't discard any of your ailing plants (those which can be
brought back to a healthy condition) and save a spot in your own
garden as a `holding' area for the time being. Likewise, any
chipped or not needed plant containers, fertilizer or potting soil.
A response will be appreciated.''

A FILM FESTIVAL FOCUSES ON `GENER-ASIAN X' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when it seemed that ``Asian-American
film festival'' was becoming a misnomer. Starting in the mid-1980s,
the organizers of the country's three major Asian-American
festivals _ held each year in New York, San Francisco and Los
Angeles _ were mainly a showcase for films from Asia and
desperately trawled for any American-made features they could
program alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was part of the selection committee, we would take
Asian-American submissions without seeing the film first,'' said
Vivian Huang, director of the Asian-American International Film
Festival, sponsored by Asian Cinevision, a nonprofit group. The
series is to open at Florence Gould Hall in Manhattan on Friday.
``We were so excited just to see any feature.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 21-year history, the monthlong
festival, the oldest of its kind in the country, is screening more
features made in the United States by directors of Asian descent
than films from overseas. The festival box office expects to sell
up to 7,000 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Six Asian-American features and five from Asia have been
scheduled for the festival's main screenings, in contrast to the
six Asian features and 12 domestic short films in, say, 1986. This
year's numbers signify a watershed for Asian-American independent
features, as almost a dozen that have been in production for the
last two years hit the festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The films are the calling cards for a wave of directors, most of
them trained in film schools and still in their 20s and early 30s,
who have been termed ``Gener-Asian X'' by some critics and festival
programmers. Most of the relatively young auteurs work in Los
Angeles or New York and know one another from festivals and film
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to see it as a wave,'' said Eric Koyanagi, 30, director
of ``Hundred Percent,'' ``and it'll crash or pick up momentum, and
maybe we'll be surfing in a couple of years.'' His film, which
tells of what he calls ``Asian-American Gen-X slackers'' in Venice
Beach, Calif., is scheduled to make its East Coast premiere
Saturday at the New York festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the major film schools keep statistics,
anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of Asian-Americans
enrolling has surged in the 1990s. ``My sense is that there is
definitely an increase,'' especially in the last six or seven
years, said David James, a professor at the University of Southern
California School of Cinema-Television.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Broderick, president of Next Wave Films in Los Angeles,
said that of the 800 independent films in production that his
company is tracking, about 3 percent are directed by
Asian-Americans. That may seem low, but it is still far greater
than the number of studio productions by Asian-Americans, said
Broderick, whose company provides money to finish low-budget films
in exchange for certain proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   And 1997 saw a noticeable increase in the number of
Asian-American submissions to the Sundance Film Festival, said John
Cooper, associate director of programming at Sundance. ``I would
say they're playing to a younger, more hip style'' than earlier
Asian-American films, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those films making the festival rounds reflect personal visions
of growing up outside mainstream America. Like the filmmakers,
their young protagonists feel equal parts Asian and American. Some
films have only Asian-American lead actors, and the stories take
place in locales like suburban Los Angeles and Greenwich Village
rather than Chinatown or Koreatown. The films deal more with
middle-class suburban angst than immigrant issues, and their worlds
revolve around house parties, dope smoking, transvestites, cafe
intellectuals, hip-hop music and clashes with parents.
</P>
<P>
   The films are made on budgets of $30,000 to $1.5 million and are
often shot within a month. (The directors often find inspiration in
the French New Wave.) Festival curators hail them as successors to
Wayne Wang's low-budget sleeper ``Chan Is Missing,'' a seminal work
that seemed to herald the arrival of feature films directed by
Asian-Americans when it opened in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a major eye-opener for a lot of people,'' said
Spencer Nagasako, a documentary maker who teaches Asian-American
film at the University of California at Berkeley. ``After that,
people started to think about getting their works into the
mainstream and becoming bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the years since ``Chan'' have seen only a handful of movies
by Asian-Americans reach theaters. The most prominent have been
documentaries, which have drawn critical acclaim but relatively
small audiences (Christine Choy and Renee Tajima's ``Who Killed
Vincent Chin?''), films that deal as much with life in Asia as in
America ( Wang's ``Joy Luck Club'' and ``Chinese Box'') or
avant-garde works that rarely involve Asian-American characters
(the films of Gregg Araki and Jon Moritsugu).
</P>
<P>
   Not so with ``Hundred Percent'' and its festival brethren. In
his first feature after finishing film school at the University of
Southern California, Koyanagi cast all Asian-American leads. In the
opening scene, three men debate who is the coolest Asian-American
male icon (Mr. Sulu from ``Star Trek'' vs. Judge Lance Ito) while
playing mah jongg and eating ``Asian-American soul food'' (Chinese
takeout, no less).
</P>
<P>
   Other films at the New York festival, like Francisco Aliwalas'
``Disoriented'' and Rea Tajiri's ``Strawberry Fields,'' also
address issues related to growing up in a multicultural society.
``We all kind of share similar angers and issues, even if we all
have our own personal signature to what we do,'' Koyanagi said.
``These films are all contemporary pop culture expressions of what
our lives are like now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he went to film school to learn how to make art-house
movies but awakened to a reality during the Los Angeles riots of
1992. As the city burned, he said, he watched how the mass media
reduced the conflict between blacks and Korean store owners to what
he called a ``black vs. yellow paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even talk about class conflict,'' he said. ``It
made me question who's calling these shots. Filmmaking has some
sort of sociological experience to me now as opposed to purely
artistic.''

 &HT;    SENATORS OFFER REVISED AGRICULTURE GUEST WORKER PROGRAM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan Senate coalition Tuesday introduced a
bill to replace the current agricultural guest worker program with
one that gives top priority to filling jobs with domestic workers
and streamlines the process for hiring foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win, win, win situation,'' said Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., suggesting the bill would be good for farmers and growers,
good for farm workers and good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill, which has broad support from farm employers, was
panned by farm labor advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an act of almost unbelievable cynicism on Graham's
part to pretend he is part of a compromise between farm workers and
farmers when the reality is he is giving the growers everything
they want and the farm workers nothing,'' said Rob Williams,
director of the Migrant Farmers Justice Project for Florida Legal
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would phase out the existing H-2A agriculture guest
worker program. It would be replaced with a program that provides a
computerized registry of legal domestic farm workers. Only after
all available domestic workers within an area had been employed
would visas be issued for foreign agricultural workers. The waiting
list for visas would be reduced from 60 days to 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said eight major worker protection
policies sought by farm workers had been included in the bill,
including provisions to raise workers' salaries and eliminate the
incentive to hire foreign workers, for whom payroll taxes are not
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden acknowledged that some farm worker advocates have opposed
the bill hoping for a ``workers utopia. ...But we have to deal with
the real world to make life better for workers and growers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would eliminate the current wage rate set by the Labor
Department and replace it with a wage rate of at least the minimum
wage or 5 percent above the average prevailing wage in the area,
whichever is higher.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the impact of the wage change would be to pay
lower wages and ``bring in farm workers for less wages than they do
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would eliminate the requirement that growers
provide housing for guest workers. Instead it would allow them to
give workers a voucher to help them pay for housing.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Curiel, Florida director of the United Farm Workers of
America, said the union opposes any tampering with the H-2A
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposed to anything dealing with H-2A. I feel like
somebody is trying to put something over on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he hoped ``we will have the support of all the
groups that will benefit'' from the bill.

 NEW YORK: purely artistic.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Koyanagi does not consider himself a political
filmmaker, he points to Spike Lee as one of his influences. Many of
his Asian-American peers also cite black filmmakers as
inspirations, mostly because, they say, those directors have
managed to make movies that appeal to both black and mainstream
audiences while addressing personal issues. John Woo and Ang Lee,
Asian directors who work in the Hollywood studio system, are often
listed as inspirations, as is Wong Kar-Wai, the ultrastylish Hong
Kong director.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to financing, several filmmakers have looked to
Asia after receiving unenthusiastic responses from studios and
independent production companies in the United States. They said
studio executives requested that they write white protagonists into
their scripts to make the films more marketable.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than bowing to that pressure, Koyanagi said he and the
producers of ``Hundred Percent'' found a businessman in Malaysia
who was willing to underwrite the project, which cost more than $1
million, because Koyanagi had signed Garrett Wang and Tamlyn
Tomita, two high-profile Asian-American actors.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Wonsuk Chin, 30, the director of ``Too Tired to
Die,'' part of the festival, said he had received funds from a
South Korean producer for his $1.5 million film because he had cast
Mira Sorvino, an Oscar winner, and signed Takeshi Kaneshiro, a pop
and film star in Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most young directors represented at the New York festival
scraped together their financing through more tried-and-true
domestic avenues, like loans, foundation grants and credit cards.
Chin said he received Korean support only because he had a cast
with international appeal, and because his script, about a Japanese
expatriate confronting his imminent death, had elements that could
draw an overseas art-house audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even after these films are made and shown at festivals,
distribution remains a problem. With the glut of independent movies
seeking distributors, Asian-American directors said their movies
were often passed over because of a perceived lack of mainstream
marketability. Francisco Aliwalas, 33, whose first feature,
``Disoriented,'' has been rejected by at least 20 distributors,
said: ``I find myself educating them on where the populations of
Asian-Americans are, what the numbers are, the potential growth and
the fact that they will see a film that speaks to them. But they're
afraid to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   But some distributors say films are often rejected solely on
quality. ``I have over the years seen some Asian-American films,
and none of them I felt were of sufficient quality for me to
undertake,'' said Daniel Talbot, president of New Yorker Films,
which distributed ``Chan Is Missing.'' ``It always comes down to
the film, not the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the independent film by Asian-Americans that has
generated the most buzz this year is Quentin Lee's and Justin Lin's
``Shopping for Fangs,'' mostly because of the nontraditional
distribution route the directors have taken. After receiving offers
only from small distribution companies, Lee, 27, decided to
distribute his film through his own company, Margin Films. The film
was made for $100,000, features young Asian-American leads and was
screened at several international film festivals last year. In late
May, the film opened on about 10 screens in New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles. It performed below expectations, Lee said, and he
is still hoping to break even with future screenings. Still, his
do-it-yourself marketing has won admiration. ``You've gotta tip
your hat off to them; they're not taking no for an answer,''
Nagasako said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the festival's filmmakers said they were still
hoping to sign with a distribution company. For example, Chin said
his ``Too Tired to Die,'' which has been picked up for distribution
in Japan, Germany and even Bosnia, is still looking for a domestic
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this film doesn't get shown in this country,'' he said, ``I
don't know, maybe I should just make a Jean-Claude Van Damme
movie.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Heartwarming thoughts of sun-warmed tomatoes
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing else like a tomato. Not one of those things you
buy from a store. I'm talking about a real tomato. Ripened on the
vine, red, firm, fully packed. Bursting against a tight skin,
exploding juicily in your mouth when your teeth pierce it.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a tomato freshly plucked, sun-warmed, is one of
summer's great pleasures. Who among us cannot appreciate the sweet
and sour lusciousness of that first bite, the abandon of juice
running down chin? Goodness, right down to the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Every tomato lover I know gets dreamy when we talk about tomato
sandwiches. Light bread, smeared with mayonnaise onto which I like
to toss a few basil leaves, some society garlic or chives and a
little fresh rosemary. Slap on the thick-sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle
with salt and black pepper. Ohhh.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite around my house, thanks to Lyn, is a side dish
for grits: broiled tomatoes, cut in half, unpeeled, cored, with
little pieces of garlic stuck in the halves and some salt, olive
oil, chopped rosemary, basil and bread crumbs sprinkled on them.
Broiled in a slightly oiled dish until the edges burn just a little
bit, these halves make a whole lot of good eating. Hmmm _ crab meat
or shrimp stuffed into those halves would be most excellent, too.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been fortunate to know great tomato growers,
beginning with my parents. We began the season with fried green
tomatoes, of course, and kept right on eating until the last
precious orb was picked for tomato soup. In between were sliced
tomatoes with fried corn and collards, tomatoes cooked in string
beans.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all my gardening parents are gone now, but there are still
a lot of fine tomato growers around.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Britt Flowers is one of them. He grows enough tomatoes
(mostly Celebrity and a few of the Homestead variety) in his Newnan
garden to feed a village.
</P>
<P>
   An impassioned cook, Britt got to talking the other day about
the many ways to enjoy his labor's fruit: ``Best way is with a
tomato in one hand and the salt shaker in the other. Maybe a loaf
of light bread between your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Our laughter segued into talk about tomato gravy. To a regular
gravy (``if you haven't got streak o' lean for your gravy, you're
wasting your time'') he adds chopped tomatoes _ and sometimes some
diced potatoes browned in grease. Simmer 15 minutes. The meal:
breaded, fried round steak with the gravy and biscuits for a
sopping good time. ``Throw a few scrambled eggs in on the side if
you want to,'' Britt added. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   This fruit is so good that gardeners grow too much. Happily, the
excess becomes largess. Janet Rothberg of Roswell recalls the time,
some eight years ago, when ``I went by friends' and neighbors', and
every door had a box of tomatoes by it.''
</P>
<P>
   This feels like one of those years. Even I've had success. In
containers on my back porch, a patio and a cherry thrived _
probably because I planted in pure compost, the way Britt does.
</P>
<P>
   By the first of July I was eating cherries, and several
baseball-sized green tomatoes were growing on the patio.
Anticipating the first ripe patios and a handful of cherries, I
returned from a trip last week to find both plants stripped.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels. The bushy-tailed rats had cleaned me out.
</P>
<P>
   I'm disgusted _ down but not out. Thanks to Britt's generosity,
I will escape a mad season of 'mater memories and squirrel-murder
dreams.

 &HT;    Mangos: The world's most popular fruit
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget bananas. Apples are an also-ran. Watermelons don't come
close. The world's most popular fruit is the mango.
</P>
<P>
   This sweet, succulent tree fruit _ native to Burma and India,
where it has been cultivated for more than 6,000 years _ has taken
hold throughout the world. It appears on the breakfast table in the
Philippines, daiquiris in the West Indies and barbecue marinade in
South Africa. It is picked green for salads in Vietnam and pickled
with turmeric in India.
</P>
<P>
   Here ... well, that's been a little tricky. Extracting the pulpy
fruit from beneath the leathery skin proves counterintuitive to
Americans used to the user-friendly packaging of oranges and
bananas. Should you use a vegetable peeler or a paring knife? Or
should you cut wedges away from the pit? Somehow, you always end up
with a slimy mess and a puncture wound.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have Americans had access to quality mangoes until recently.
In the '70s and early '80s, supermarket mangoes were stringy,
squishy, past their prime and expensive. Or you went to Florida on
vacation and had your first experience with the honeyed, almost
embarrassingly ripe tropical flavor and the heavy, sexy potion of a
really great specimen.
</P>
<P>
   And you were hooked.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that mangoes remained fairly scarce during
the mid-'80s. Florida, the only state among the contiguous 48 with
any kind of crop, could provide only so much. And foreign mangoes,
treated with a cancer-causing fumigant to rid them of fruit flies,
were banned by the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   But growers developed a hot-water treatment whereby the fruit is
heated to 115 degrees, and then chilled. Now we get a plentiful,
almost year-round crop of fruit-fly-free mangoes from Peru, Brazil,
Haiti and particularly Mexico, which supplies 90 percent of the
American market. Florida growers, who don't have to water-treat
their mangoes, claim theirs are superior and worth the higher
price.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, mangoes are going down in price faster than computer
chips. Remember when you paid $1.59 for one iffy mango summer
before last? Now you can get three gorgeous ones for a dollar at
some stores. Or a whole flat for $5.
</P>
<P>
   American chefs are taking full advantage. The pioneers of the
Florida/Caribbean style of fusion cooking _ chefs like Norman van
Aken and Allen Susser _ are collectively known as the ``Mango
Gang.'' At hot, hot Mango restaurant in Chicago, dishes range from
a mango tarte tatin to mango with duck prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with their lushly sweet but piney/turpentine flavor,
mangoes work equally well as dessert stars and as foils to savory
dishes. A tart-spicy mango salsa can stare down a smoked chicken or
slab of grilled tuna with equal aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Although mangoes are as custardy as a rich dessert, a whole
fruit contains just 95 calories and is loaded with vitamins A, B
and C. Try and find those kind of antioxidants in a creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   Tempted? Mango nirvana is yours for only the next few weeks,
before the Mexican mango season ends. Choose them carefully, as you
would avocados: they should give a little to pressure from your
thumb, but if they seem very soft or wrinkled, they're not worth
your time. There should also be an appetizing smell at the stem
end.
</P>
<P>
   According to Debby Tjan, a produce buyer at the DeKalb Farmers
Market, popular ``stringless'' varieties like Haden and Kent have a
shorter shelf live than the familiar, stringy Tommy Atkins variety.
</P>
<P>
   But the stringless varieties are best for overcoming any
mango-cutting phobia. And once you get over that, you're ready to
fully appreciate the fruit that won the world's heart.

 &HT;    Mango cutting: Making a hedgehog
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cutting a mango half into a ``hedgehog'' is not only a cool
party trick, not only a way to impress the heck out of your dinner
guests, but also the best possible way to extract the maximum
amount of fruit with the minimum amount of drippy, sticky mess.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you choose a ripe but not overripe mango for best
results. Eye it to figure out in which direction the large, flat
pit lies _ easy with a Tommy Atkins mango but a little trickier
with the more bulbous Haden mango. Choose a sharp knife, or the
mango will slip and you'll cut your hand and be really mad at us.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you do it:
</P>
<P>
   1. Hold the mango on a cutting board, and cut straight down
along the flat side of the pit. Rotate the mango and cut down the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   2. With the tip of the knife, crosshatch the fruit down to (but
not piercing) the skin.
</P>
<P>
   3. With both hands, turn the mango inside out and either serve
as is or cut the squares of fruit into a bowl. The small amount of
fruit still encircling the pit makes either a quick snack or a few
uneven pieces to use for a recipe.

   Produce markets willing to pay the price are assured a virtually
year-round supply of mangoes from Mexico, Haiti, Peru, Brazil and
Equador, not to mention the premium but small crop of Florida
fruit. But the peak of the season is ending soon, in mid-August to
early September, so now's the time to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Ripe mangoes vary so much in color that you shouldn't let a
pretty blush fool you. Some are perfectly ripe when they're green.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the variety, mangoes are members of the
Anacardiaceaefamily of plants, which includes poison oak and poison
ivy, and may cause an allergic reaction on the skin. If you notice
any swelling or blistering on your hands, you'll need to wear
gloves when handling mango skin. But in most cases, you'll have no
problem consuming it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tommy Atkins: These are the kinda green, kinda stringy, kinda
``what's the big deal?'' mangoes that introduced many Americans to
the fruit. The shape is symmetrically oval and the thick skin turns
orangy-yellow and speckled as it ripens. The flesh is yellow and
has a mild flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Haden: This popular variety is widely planted in Mexico and
should be plentiful through mid-August. They are large and round,
turning crimson as they ripen. The flesh is pumpkin-orange,
stringless, sweet and tangy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kent: This large and irregularly oval variety can range from
yellow to orange to green when ripe. The yellow-gold flesh has a
good tropical flavor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keitt: This very large mango remains green when ripe. It is
often picked when unripe and hard, for use in Indian and Southeast
Asian recipes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Haitian mangoes: Smallish, flat, irregularly oval Haitian
mangoes may be a bit more expensive than others, but they are worth
it for their pronounced tropical flavor. The several similar
varieties cultivated in Haiti have girls' names like Julie, Amelie
and Zephirine but are often labeled simply ``Haitian'' for export.

   SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Mizuna, Fennel and Green Mango
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This recipe, from ``Allen Susser's New World Cuisine and
Cookery'' (Doubleday) takes a Southeast Asian idea _ green mango
used as a salad vegetable _ and puts it in a Western context. We've
also found that green mango makes a killer secret ingredient in
quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   1bunch mizuna
</P>
<P>
   1bunch arugula
</P>
<P>
   1head fennel
</P>
<P>
   1medium green mango
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2tablespoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the salad: Wash the mizuna leaves and the arugula, then dry
them carefully. Pare away any blemishes from the fennel. Peel the
mango and remove the flesh from the large center pit. Julienne both
the fennel and the green mango, then toss them with a few
tablespoons of lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   For the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the
remaining lemon juice and the olive oil. Season with the sea salt
and black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble and serve: Drizzle some of the vinaigrette on the
salad leaves and arrange around the edge of the plate. Drizzle the
remainder of the vinaigrette on the fennel and mango and place them
in the center.

   Mango Upside-Down Tart
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20
minutes
</P>
<P>
   1sheet frozen puff pastry
</P>
<P>
   5medium mangoes (not too ripe)
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove the puff pastry from the
freezer and thaw for 20 minutes. Select a 10-inch round ovenproof
glass baking dish. When the pastry is warm enough to unfold without
breaking, open it up and cut a 10-inch circle, using the dish as a
guide.
</P>
<P>
   Cut down the sides of the mangoes. Cut each side in half
lengthwise into a wedge. Remove the peel with a knife or vegetable
peeler. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a 12-inch iron skillet over medium-high heat.
Stir in the mango quarters and sugar. Cook about 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally and taking care to keep the pieces intact,
until the mango is a deep golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mango to the unbuttered baking dish. Place the
circle of pastry over the top and cut a few 3-inch slits here and
there for steam vents.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 20 minutes. When done, remove and run a knife along the
underside of the pastry to keep it from sticking. Place a heatproof
dish over the bowl, and, using two potholders, invert the bowl and
baking dish together. Give the bottom a tap to loosen any remaining
pieces of mango.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot, warm or at room temperature. Garnish with whipped
cream or ice cream if desired.

<P>
   Yes, this mango salsa is a cliche of late-'80s dining. But, yes,
the flavor is timeless and has never met a piece of grilled fish or
chicken it didn't like. The trick to superlative salsa is to dice
the ingredients as evenly as possible.

</P>
<P>
   Preparation/cooking time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a standby quick summer dinner in our household. In the
time it takes to poach the salmon, the salad is ready. Serve it on
a platter rather than a salad bowl or else it turns into a bit of a
mess. Toast the pecans, if you like.

 &HT;    PENTAGON PROBE FINDS CNN REPORT WAS BASELESS
 &HT;    630&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    Subs 10th graf with CNN comment.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday that
an exhaustive Pentagon review found no evidence to support a story
reported _ and later retracted _ by CNN and Time magazine that a
covert U.S. commando unit hunted down American defectors in Laos in
1970 and used nerve gas in making their escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has not and does not use lethal nerve gas,''
Cohen declared. He said the 16 American soldiers who conducted the
secret mission were ``heroes'' who ``have been hurt'' by the
CNN-Time report.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon review says the clandestine Operation Tailwind was
undertaken to engage North Vietnamese troops in Laos and to divert
their attention from Operation Gauntlet, a CIA-sponsored offensive
to gain control of terrain in what was then a neutral country
bordering Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon probe found that the gas dropped on enemy forces in
Tailwind was CS tear gas, a then-new and more potent form of the
crowd control agent, and not the deadly sarin as reported in CNN's
June 7 premiere of ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to defectors, no document, military order,
after-action report, briefing paper or official military history
mentions the pursuit of U.S. defectors as Tailwind's mission. There
is no hint, nod, wink or subliminal reference to such a mission,''
said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the use of nerve gas, we found no evidence that sarin nerve
gas was used or that it was ever transported to Vietnam, Laos or
Thailand. Sarin was stored in Okinawa at the time and remained
there until 1971,'' he said, when it was removed prior to the
reversion of the island to Japanese control in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force pilots who provided air cover to Tailwind say
they dropped tear gas, not nerve gas. The Air Force men who loaded
the munitions on the plane said it was tear gas, not nerve gas,''
said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report was retracted after the news network asked Floyd
Abrams, a well-known media attorney, to conduct a review and he
found that the central allegations were not substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   CNN fired the two main producers, Jack Smith and April Oliver.
Senior CNN producer Pam Hill resigned, but the on-air
correspondent, Peter Arnett, was allowed to keep his job after a
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth declined to comment except to say,
``CNN's apology and retraction of July 2 stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said Tuesday the report does nothing to shake her belief
in the original Tailwind account.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of documentary evidence ``doesn't surprise me, given
that this was a 'black operation','' she said in a telephone
interview. Oliver said she and Smith would release an 80-page
report Wednesday in response to the Abrams report so that people
can judge the credibility of their journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never suggested that these men weren't heroes. They were
men of tremendous courage,'' she said. ``We made no moral judgments
in this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon press conference Tuesday, some Vietnam veterans
said CNN had not gone far enough in making amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think very strongly Peter Arnett had more responsibility
than he had been given credit for. We believe that he should be
discharged,'' said retired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, a former
commander of the Studies and Operations Group forces that conducted
Tailwind and other covert operations during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that the report that (CNN) should say that the
operation did not take place _ not that the reporters did not find
enough evidence to support the accusation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub said that he and others involved in Tailwind tried to
dissuade CNN's Oliver from airing allegations about the defectors
and nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, 'April, it did not happen. You're on the wrong
track. It did not happen _ either of those two accusations','' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report was based on a review of documents from the
Vietnam era as well as interviews with participants in Tailwind and
similar operations. The report said ``inconsistencies'' were found
in the accounts of the two Tailwind survivors who were CNN's major
sources, former Lt. Robert Van Burkirk and former Sgt. Michael
Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, though, Singlaub acknowledged that the
operations in Laos were based in deniability.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the policy from the White House was that we would
not send regular troops in. We were sending in these Special
Operations forces in small numbers _ normally a 12-man team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub was asked about the policy regarding any U.S. defectors
who would help the North Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there undoubtedly was personal animosity against them by
individuals,'' he said. ``But the policy was quite clear: We would
try to return them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there were only two such defectors: Robert
Garwood, a former Marine private who returned to the United States
in 1979 and was found guilty of collaborating with the enemy at a
subsequent court martial, and McKinley Nolan, an Army private who
lived with the Viet Cong in Vietnam and later with the Khmer Rouge
in Cambodia. The report said Nolan was killed by the Khmer Rouge in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the charges of sarin gas, the report said that even
``relevant North Vietnamese military documents'' show ``no use of
lethal chemical agents by U.S. forces at any time during the
Vietnam War, but they do record the use of tear gas.''

 &HT;    Fox leads the fall pack with staggered lineup
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif. _ It's going to be a long fall.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Broadcasting, in what may be the most extended roll-out of
TV shows ever during the fall season, will debut its first new
shows in August and its last in November, meaning Fox's fall season
will run in four separate months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing 61 new shows into two weeks is so disrespectful to
the viewer, so we're going to spread out our fall launch,'' says
Peter Roth, president of Fox Entertainment. ``I think it's better
for the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the networks have launched their fall seasons in
the second and third weeks of September, with a few debuting early
and a few stragglers coming in late. And that's still the way NBC
is doing it this fall, with 20 of its 25 new and returning series
all bunched into the week of Sept. 21 (see NBC details below). ABC,
CBS and the smaller networks WB and UPN have not yet announced how
they're handling their fall premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's fall starts Aug. 23, with the debuts of two new comedies,
``Holding the Baby'' (single dad combines business and
child-rearing) and ``That '70s Show,'' a sitcom set in the mid '70s
which is already catching flak from some for a sequence in which
teens smoke marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files,'' usually a late starter because of its complex
production, won't debut until after the World Series, which
probably means early November. That's also the case with the
troubled new Fox show ``Hollyweird.'' A horror and comedy combo
from Wes Craven (``Scream'') and Shaun Cassidy (``American
Gothic''), the ``Hollyweird'' pilot has been completely scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we failed,'' Roth said of the first version of the
show, which is being re-cast and ``re-conceptualized,'' as he put
it. ``It never achieved the levels we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other key Fox debuts:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ally McBeal'' comes back Sept. 14, with a new lawyer
joining the dysfunctional law firm. She'll be played by Australian
actress Portia de Rossi, who had a small role in ''Scream 2.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``King of the Hill'' returns Sept. 8 in its new time, 8 p.m.
Tuesdays. Roth says he's moving ``King'' from Sundays to Tuesdays
to establish a new night of comedy on Fox, and because key
competition in that spot, ``Home Improvement'' and ``Mad About
You,'' are ``aging and fading.'' Billy Bob Thornton and Sarah
Michelle Gellar will do ``Hill''-acious guest voices this season.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Simpsons'' comes back Sept. 20, with guest voices to
include (over the season) Jerry Springer, Regis Philbin and Kathie
Lee Gifford and Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

   Emmy show to expand
</P>
<P>
   Break out your Visine. The Emmy Awards are planning to expand to
a whopping four hours this year, the 50th anniversary of the TV
awards. Executive producer Don Mischer says the show will air from
7p.m.-11 p.m. Sept. 13 on NBC, starting an hour earlier than usual
to accommodate a lot of features for the anniversary. Those
features will include a series on television's top 10 moments, and
``It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time,'' a tongue-in-cheek
tribute to shows like ``My Mother the Car'' and ``Manimal.'' The
show will not have a host (there have been reports that Jerry
Seinfeld was approached and said no), but Mischer at least promises
that it will absolutely end on time at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Plans
</P>
<P>
   NBC's first show of the new season will be ``Suddenly Susan.''
Brooke Shields' sitcom re-starts at 8 p.m. Sept. 21_ and from then
through Friday night the network will launch more than 20 new and
returning shows. ``Frasier'' will debut at 9 p.m. ET Thursdays
starting Sept. 24. And, of course, ``ER'' returns at 10 p.m. ET
that same night. Four NBC shows will debut in October: the new
drama ``Trinity'' at 9 p.m. ET Oct. 16, the new Bo Derek drama
``Wind on Water'' at 8 p.m. ET Oct. 17, ``The Pretender'' at 9 p.m.
ET Oct. 17 and ``Profiler'' at 10 p.m. ET that same night.

   Cheadle on Davis, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cheadle, who'll portray Sammy Davis Jr. in HBO's
unauthorized biopic, ``The Rat Pack'' airing Aug. 22, says he
worried at first about depicting the African-American superstar as
a minstrel. While researching the role, Cheadle says he began to
realize that Davis was a more complex character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy was one of a kind,'' Cheadle says. ``He was probably the
most talented member of the Rat Pack. He could act, he could sing,
he could dance, he could play instruments. He was the first
septuple threat. Anything he touched, he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle says he also tried to convey Davis' difficulties as the
only black member of the Rat Pack (Ray Liotta is playing Frank
Sinatra and Joe Mantegna portrays Dean Martin). Davis often endured
good natured ribbing about his skin color from fellow Rat Packers
at a time when African-Americans had begun to rebel against racial
sterotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very tortured, very conflicted,'' Cheadle says. ``The
stage was his sanctuary. He was much maligned by whites and blacks.
He was Pagliacci. He was laughing through it and cashing his
checks, but at a great personal cost.''

 &HT;    SENATORS OFFER REVISED AGRICULTURE GUEST WORKER PROGRAM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan Senate coalition Tuesday introduced a
bill to replace the current agricultural guest worker program with
one that gives top priority to filling jobs with domestic workers
and streamlines the process for hiring foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win, win, win situation,'' said Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., suggesting the bill would be good for farmers and growers,
good for farm workers and good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill, which has broad support from farm employers, was
panned by farm labor advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an act of almost unbelievable cynicism on Graham's
part to pretend he is part of a compromise between farm workers and
farmers when the reality is he is giving the growers everything
they want and the farm workers nothing,'' said Rob Williams,
director of the Migrant Farmers Justice Project for Florida Legal
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would phase out the existing H-2A agriculture guest
worker program. It would be replaced with a program that provides a
computerized registry of legal domestic farm workers. Only after
all available domestic workers within an area had been employed
would visas be issued for foreign agricultural workers. The waiting
list for visas would be reduced from 60 days to 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said eight major worker protection
policies sought by farm workers had been included in the bill,
including provisions to raise workers' salaries and eliminate the
incentive to hire foreign workers, for whom payroll taxes are not
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden acknowledged that some farm worker advocates have opposed
the bill hoping for a ``workers utopia. ...But we have to deal with
the real world to make life better for workers and growers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would eliminate the current wage rate set by the Labor
Department and replace it with a wage rate of at least the minimum
wage or 5 percent above the average prevailing wage in the area,
whichever is higher.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the impact of the wage change would be to pay
lower wages and ``bring in farm workers for less wages than they do
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would eliminate the requirement that growers
provide housing for guest workers. Instead it would allow them to
give workers a voucher to help them pay for housing.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Curiel, Florida director of the United Farm Workers of
America, said the union opposes any tampering with the H-2A
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposed to anything dealing with H-2A. I feel like
somebody is trying to put something over on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he hoped ``we will have the support of all the
groups that will benefit'' from the bill.

`PLANE CRAZY': ZEN OF BUILDING A PLANE BY YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(HLW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Building a homemade airplane in 30 days sounds like a
sufficiently antic project to make for an engaging three hours of
television. But ``Plane Crazy'' also involves being in the company
of Robert X. Cringely for most of the time, which can be wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Cringely has a PBS following. Last year, he gave viewers
``Triumph of the Nerds,'' not unrelated to his book ``Accidental
Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle
Foreign Competition and Still Can't Get a Date.'' A television
sequel is promised, and perhaps ``Plane Crazy,'' too, will find its
audience.
</P>
<P>
   When the new program stays with the details of putting together
a plane in a Silicon Valley garage, it purrs along reasonably well.
You can pick up the basics of wings and engines (Cringely favors a
Subaru car engine), not to mention ``tortional resonance issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As problems batter the project and everything goes wrong,
``Plane Crazy'' has the charm of a how-not-to-do-it show. The
30-day deadline passes (it usually takes Cringely 18 months to
build a plane), and outside assistance is required before our pilot
can chance a takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Cringely is not content with that sort of trip. On screen
most of the time, he is given to talking about himself, his
upbringing, his quirks, his angst. The self-analysis and
self-celebration make for slow going and threaten to stall out.
Resorts to humor _ ``I have all the trials of Job, except, of
course, for boils'' _ make a chancy parachute.
</P>
<P>
   We learn en route that his mother calls him a narcissist, a
judgment in which he seems to take pride. To appreciate ``Plane
Crazy'' fully, you not only have to be as fascinated with flying as
Cringely is, but as fascinated with Cringely.

 &HT;    PENTAGON PROBE FINDS CNN REPORT WAS BASELESS
 &HT;    630&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    Subs 10th graf with CNN comment.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday that
an exhaustive Pentagon review found no evidence to support a story
reported _ and later retracted _ by CNN and Time magazine that a
covert U.S. commando unit hunted down American defectors in Laos in
1970 and used nerve gas in making their escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has not and does not use lethal nerve gas,''
Cohen declared. He said the 16 American soldiers who conducted the
secret mission were ``heroes'' who ``have been hurt'' by the
CNN-Time report.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon review says the clandestine Operation Tailwind was
undertaken to engage North Vietnamese troops in Laos and to divert
their attention from Operation Gauntlet, a CIA-sponsored offensive
to gain control of terrain in what was then a neutral country
bordering Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon probe found that the gas dropped on enemy forces in
Tailwind was CS tear gas, a then-new and more potent form of the
crowd control agent, and not the deadly sarin as reported in CNN's
June 7 premiere of ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to defectors, no document, military order,
after-action report, briefing paper or official military history
mentions the pursuit of U.S. defectors as Tailwind's mission. There
is no hint, nod, wink or subliminal reference to such a mission,''
said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the use of nerve gas, we found no evidence that sarin nerve
gas was used or that it was ever transported to Vietnam, Laos or
Thailand. Sarin was stored in Okinawa at the time and remained
there until 1971,'' he said, when it was removed prior to the
reversion of the island to Japanese control in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force pilots who provided air cover to Tailwind say
they dropped tear gas, not nerve gas. The Air Force men who loaded
the munitions on the plane said it was tear gas, not nerve gas,''
said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report was retracted after the news network asked Floyd
Abrams, a well-known media attorney, to conduct a review and he
found that the central allegations were not substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   CNN fired the two main producers, Jack Smith and April Oliver.
Senior CNN producer Pam Hill resigned, but the on-air
correspondent, Peter Arnett, was allowed to keep his job after a
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth declined to comment except to say,
``CNN's apology and retraction of July 2 stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said Tuesday the report does nothing to shake her belief
in the original Tailwind account.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of documentary evidence ``doesn't surprise me, given
that this was a 'black operation','' she said in a telephone
interview. Oliver said she and Smith would release an 80-page
report Wednesday in response to the Abrams report so that people
can judge the credibility of their journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never suggested that these men weren't heroes. They were
men of tremendous courage,'' she said. ``We made no moral judgments
in this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon press conference Tuesday, some Vietnam veterans
said CNN had not gone far enough in making amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think very strongly Peter Arnett had more responsibility
than he had been given credit for. We believe that he should be
discharged,'' said retired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, a former
commander of the Studies and Operations Group forces that conducted
Tailwind and other covert operations during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that the report that (CNN) should say that the
operation did not take place _ not that the reporters did not find
enough evidence to support the accusation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub said that he and others involved in Tailwind tried to
dissuade CNN's Oliver from airing allegations about the defectors
and nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, 'April, it did not happen. You're on the wrong
track. It did not happen _ either of those two accusations','' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report was based on a review of documents from the
Vietnam era as well as interviews with participants in Tailwind and
similar operations. The report said ``inconsistencies'' were found
in the accounts of the two Tailwind survivors who were CNN's major
sources, former Lt. Robert Van Burkirk and former Sgt. Michael
Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, though, Singlaub acknowledged that the
operations in Laos were based in deniability.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the policy from the White House was that we would
not send regular troops in. We were sending in these Special
Operations forces in small numbers _ normally a 12-man team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub was asked about the policy regarding any U.S. defectors
who would help the North Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there undoubtedly was personal animosity against them by
individuals,'' he said. ``But the policy was quite clear: We would
try to return them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there were only two such defectors: Robert
Garwood, a former Marine private who returned to the United States
in 1979 and was found guilty of collaborating with the enemy at a
subsequent court martial, and McKinley Nolan, an Army private who
lived with the Viet Cong in Vietnam and later with the Khmer Rouge
in Cambodia. The report said Nolan was killed by the Khmer Rouge in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the charges of sarin gas, the report said that even
``relevant North Vietnamese military documents'' show ``no use of
lethal chemical agents by U.S. forces at any time during the
Vietnam War, but they do record the use of tear gas.''

 &HT;    Dominican adventure latest stop on radio world tour
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rio San Juan, Dominican Republic -- Under the hot skies of the
equator, surrounded by postcard-perfect palm trees and
Crayola-colored beaches, three vans are speeding down a tiny,
two-lane country road like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   They wind past small, pink concrete block houses (always with
children and chickens playing dangerously close by), around
motorbikes carrying sometimes as many as four people, and, finally,
through the white walls of the Caribbean Village Playa Grande beach
resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Lord! I feel like Jeff Gordon!'' someone shouts in a
thick Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   The 54 travelers hanging on for dear life inside are about as
different from their surroundings as peaches are to plantains. They
are mostly from the metro Atlanta area, mostly baby boomers, and
mostly dressed in the same class-trip uniform _ a white Fox 97
World Tour T-shirt. That's Fox 97 (WFOX-FM), Atlanta's oldies radio
station. Leading this grand arrival into the resort are two
regular-looking guys in Bermuda shorts. Not just your everyday tour
directors, they're the WFOX-FM morning team of Randy Cook and Spiff
Carner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look. They're doing the Stroll!'' quips Spiff, as he
steps down from the van and passes through a merengue-flavored
dance line formed by hotel staffers, who stick a cold, pink drink
in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asks, ``Hey, are we on the Atlantic Ocean or the
Caribbean? And what's in this drink?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno,'' Spiff laughs back. ``But we're here, there's the
beach, and the drink's free!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Camp Randy &AMP; Spiff.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to this all-inclusive resort here at Playa Grande
Beach, on the north shore of the island of Hispaniola, is one of a
half-dozen the station offers yearly. The vacations are part of an
unusual radio promotion: Not only do the station's fans want to
tune their clock radios and car stereos to the oldies station's
disc jockeys _ they want to go on vacation with them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other radio station promotions, these trips are not
part of a contest. Anyone can go, as long as they're quick enough
to sign up as soon as the trips are announced on air (they sell out
quickly). Since WFOX-FM launched its World Tour program three years
ago, more than 4,500 listeners have spent $2 million to travel with
the station's staff (from the well-known DJs to behind-the-scenes
personnel) to destinations including Paris, England, Spain, Italy,
Las Vegas and Steamboat Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is right!'' says Cheryl Hornback, a 51-year-old
registered nurse, who is here celebrating her 32nd wedding
anniversary with Ken, a 52-year-old computer salesman.
</P>
<P>
   This four-day/three-night trip is indeed a deal _ costing each
person $472. That includes everything: double occupancy room,
airfare on a chartered flight, golf on a beachside course, taxes,
beach towels, snorkeling equipment, banana boat rides, all food,
and all the Cuba libres (that's rum and Coke with a squirt of lime
juice) and other exotic alcohol drinks you can consume.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the expected ``Animal House'' party scene. The
trips can be family-friendly, and are heavy on the socializing _
travelers get to know each other over meals, out by the pool, and
on the beach. What's surprising is that Randy and Spiff really do
host the party. Like two cutup camp counselors, they're in on
almost every aspect of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the trip, there's a familiar voice on the
answering machine. ``Hey, hear you're going with us to the
Dominican Republic!'' Spiff says in his unmistakable on-air voice.
``Be at the KLM counter in the North Terminal at 8:30. See you
there!''
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Randy and Spiff greet each traveler, handing out
plane tickets and the T-shirts. During the long wait at the gate,
the duo cracks wise and chats up listeners. On the plane, Spiff
takes the microphone and welcomes us aboard. They count heads at
the Puerto Plata airport, help us load our bags on the van, and
keep the laughs coming during the crazy, one-hour ride to the
resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, Nellie!'' Spiff blurts as the van nearly sideswipes a
Suzuki and bounces over a pothole. ``Guess that was the folks on
the bike.''
</P>
<P>
   At the resort, that's Randy down in the lobby getting up a golf
game. That's Spiff strolling by the pool carrying his Tom Clancy
paperback. His wife, Janet, chats with fans in the Calypso dining
hall as we all dine on roast leg of pork and moros. They sign
autographs and pose for endless photos.
</P>
<P>
   And, clearly, the group eats it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to drive 30 miles to work each day, and I listen to
them every morning. It's like you know them,'' says Sandy
Fulbright, a 50-year-old real estate agent from Toccoa, Ga.. As she
speaks, her son, Brian, a 30-year-old Toccoa machinist, is on the
links with Randy.
</P>
<P>
   Redheaded brothers Jacob and Benjamin Fox, ages 6 and 5, from
Calhoun, Ga. spot the DJs, and squeal as if they've seen Santa
Claus. ``Wandy and Spiff! Wandy and Spiff!'' they chant. Their mom,
Sharon, a 32-year-old assistant district attorney for Gordon and
Bartow counties, says the boys, devoted listeners, were so excited
to get Spiff's call on their answering machine that they saved the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   On beach excursions such as this, it is entirely possible to
spend all your time _ and no additional money _ inside the
exclusive walls of the resort. Repeat participants say you rub
shoulders more with the radio celebs and fellow WFOX-FM travelers
on these resort trips than at more crowded destinations such as
Paris or Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   For the bolder traveler here near Rio San Juan, there are tours
available to take you into the green hillsides and rural villages.
Ten of us signed up for the Laguna Jeep Safari trek ($65), a
fascinating, daylong look at a country we knew very little about.
We ate passion fruit, cracked open coconuts, sipped coffee over an
open-fire stove with the locals in a dirt-floor home (complete with
cockfighting rooster tied up in the corner), snorkeled in a
beautiful alcove, and soaked in the sun at a raucous, crowded
public beach where locals carried open bottles of rum into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Fun as they are, the trips can have a downside. As in any group
travel, the waits for luggage and chartered flights can be eternal.
There's little information provided about the logistics of the trip
(some in our group thought we were going near Santo Domingo, not a
beach 100 miles to the north).
</P>
<P>
   On our trip, everyone remained good sports at any bump in the
road _ perhaps inspired by Randy and Spiff, who kept their cool and
humor to the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-hour travel day on the return home, with the long
customs line as the final hurdle, Spiff couldn't resist the
opportunity for one last joke. After the agent stamped his
passport, the DJ turned around, threw his hands up the air and
shouted to the group, ``Hey, everybody! I'm in America _ and you're
not! Bye!''
</P>
<P>
   And like family members heading home from a reunion, nearly
everyone raised their hands and waved back.

 &HT;    Widows are more common than widowers
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the weekly meetings of Young at Heart, a group of widowed
members of an Atlanta area church, it's easy to pick out Eugene
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   He's the only man.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 89, is part of that tiny demographic, the widower.
Outnumbered by widows almost five to one nationally, widowers are
even rarer at Moore's age.
</P>
<P>
   This disproportion is partly due to the life expectancy of the
American man (an average of 73 years, six years less than the
American woman), but there are other reasons. Everyone, it seems,
wants to fix up the single male.
</P>
<P>
   Take Moore's relationship with a 52-year-old fellow Providence
parishioner. ``Everybody's trying to make her my wife,'' he says
with a smile. ``I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired teacher, tailor, and Lockheed employee, Moore keeps
busy sewing clothes for friends, and is working on a sleeveless
ivory evening gown for his female friend. But he has no desire to
add a train and a veil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never crossed my mind,'' he says. ``I'm not looking for
another (wife).'' There's plenty of room in his day, but his heart
is full. Still in residence there is a laughing woman named Gertie,
who was his wife for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gertie Gilbert Moore loved dancing and beautiful clothes. Most
Sundays she consented to drop Eugene Moore off at Providence on her
way to the Methodist church around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have gone to mine but she didn't want anyone to
baptize her and put her head underwater,'' says Moore, a slender,
dapper man, who jumps up from his chair at his Adamsville area home
in Southwest Atlanta to find a scrapbook with photos of Gertie and
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There she is,'' he says, settling back down between two sewing
machines in a room lined with shelves of fabric. In the photo is a
handsome olive-skinned woman in a white floor-length formal. ``I
made that dress she's got on there. I was just out of college.''
</P>
<P>
   That was around 1940, the year they were married. Gertie Moore
died on Jan. 3, 1992, six days after a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never be the same,'' he says, simply. ``You can go on,
but it's about all you can do to go on. You take the bitter with
the sweet and move on. You keep on living.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many men do not. The mortality of widowed men is
significantly higher than that for widowed women, according to U.S.
Census figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drink themselves to death, they commit suicide, they
become homeless people,'' says Atlanta psychologist Frank Pittman.
``Terrible things happen to men whose wives die and leave them
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The causes are difficult to verify, but Pittman says the
evidence suggests that ``men need women more than women need men.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Read, coordinator of the Widowed Persons Services program
in DeKalb County(Ga.) and himself a widower, says the sheer
physical toll of grief can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older widowers, sometimes they sit in their chair and grieve
themselves to death,'' he says. Women handle the loss better, he
says. ``I think women are more active through the years,'' says
Read. ``We're physically stronger, we can pick up more and work
harder, but overall they are stronger. Emotionally they can handle
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Harvill was a wreck after he lost his wife Lynne to cancer
in 1996. ``Every morning and every night I would pray to God to
just let me die, I (wanted) to be with Lynne,'' says the
44-year-old Tallahasseean.
</P>
<P>
   Even the day-to-day tasks of surviving can elude men,
particularly those of an older generation, who are accustomed to
doing less of the shopping, cooking and housekeeping chores.
``Nobody teaches us how to feed and water ourselves,'' says
Pittman. ``We try to arrange it so that we won't have to,
remarrying quickly, sometimes by the next mealtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip back to the altar is expedited by the prevalence of
willing partners. Men like Eugene Moore become hot commodities when
they're newly single. ``They will tell you the stories about the
casseroles and the women at their door,'' says Arkansas family
therapist Marta Felber, author of ``Grief Expressed: When a Mate
Dies'' (Life Words, $19.95). ``They are in great demand.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why some organizations for widows and widowers discourage
participation by those on the prowl for new spouses. These folks
scare away the men.
</P>
<P>
   Loners on Wheels, composed mostly of widows and widowers,
requires its members to remain single. If they get married they
have to quit. ``The men feel secure that way,'' says Martha
Bostock, former president of the California-based recreational
vehicle club. ``They don't feel the women are out to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hink, 68, formerly of Carrollton, went on a few outings
with a Southeastern chapter of Loners on Wheels after he sold his
house and moved into a trailer. He took that drastic step last
year, three months after Madelyn, his wife of 48 years, died.
</P>
<P>
   It was their dream house. They'd built it together, to live in
the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom told me to make no major decisions for at
least a year,'' he says.``But facing that year alone in the house
we'd built together ... seemed to add enormously to that awful
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   And though some friends thought the idea was ``nuttier than a
fruitcake,'' their three daughters supported him. Today Hink is
happy with his nomadic existence. He doesn't need a snow shovel, he
says, and if he disagrees with the neighbors, he can drive his
house away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You face the idea that this is a new life I'm leading; if I'm
not building a new life I'm doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, silver-haired, with the reverberant voice of a Methodist
preacher, Hink seems to have come to terms with his loss. He shows
off his compact living quarters, parked for the time being at a
Stone Mountain campground. Then a visitor topples a tiny pine
seedling in a plastic pot, set up on a nearby picnic table. ``Oh
God!'' he cries. ``That's Madelyn's plant!''
</P>
<P>
   As he tucks the plant back into its container, gently packing
the soil around its roots, Hink explains that the Cremation Society
gave him the seedling to plant in memory of his wife. And when he
finds a permanent home, he says, he will.
</P>
<P>
   But for now it's the only object that remains from his former
life, the only evidence of Madelyn in this new mobile world. He
seems glad to be reminded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think your grief is under control and some little thing
triggers it again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of my three daughters has had a very real dream where
Madelyn has come to them to tell them she's all right. I haven't
had that dream yet. I'm hoping.''

 &HT;    Losing a husband: How does a woman go on with her life when half
her world is suddenly gone?
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Before he flew out of a small corporate airport on
April 4, Michael Fisher asked his son Peter for a favor: ``Draw me
a picture to take with me on the plane.'' Easter was a week away,
and Peter, 6, drew an Easter bunny, with a basket full of eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Headed to Pennsylvania for a business trip, Michael told his
wife that he'd be back that night to meet the family at their
summer house on Lake Hartwell(Ga.). ``If he could spend only one
night at the lake, he'd move mountains to get there,'' says Nancy
Fisher. ``He said he wouldn't be very long.''
</P>
<P>
   She and the kids drove to the lake. They hunted for Easter eggs,
played in the water, and, when Daddy still hadn't arrived, dozed
off in bed together. Around 8:30 that evening, the dogs barked at a
strange car rolling up the drive.
</P>
<P>
   At the door were two very young sheriff's deputies. Then her
heart began to pound in her ears, as if to drown out their words.
Michael's plane had been in a mid-air collision at 10:30 that
morning. He and his three colleagues were dead. All was destroyed,
soaked in jet fuel, except for a tiny drawing of an Easter bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Today the anesthesia is wearing off. The shock that carried her
through the memorial service on May 9 (on what would have been
Michael's 43rd birthday) is gone. In its place is anger and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kind of life is over,'' says Fisher, who turned 40 in June.
``I've got a whole other 40 years to go, with a different life that
isn't going to be the one I thought of in every dream. I'd already
hit the lottery with Michael. I've already had my shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter has graduated from kindergarten. Their daughter, Stuart,
is only 9, but is turning into a ``teenager.''And Michael won't see
it happen. ``His biggest goal was to be here,''says Fisher, her
voice husky. ``That's what overwhelms me the most: the anger that
he didn't get to do any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Nancy Fisher entered a kind of Twilight Zone, a place
of sadness that most women her age have never visited.
</P>
<P>
   Like NBC-TV anchor Katie Couric, whose husband also died this
year, she lost hers while their children were still taking baby
steps. Most of this country's 11 million widows are over 60. They
are at an age when, according to psychologists, they've actually
begun to mentally ``rehearse,'' visualizing a world without their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Young widows such as Couric and Fisher are less prepared, and
death comes as an unexpected blow. Even the advice books don't
apply. ``I've got 10 widow books and none of them are any good,''
Fisher says. ``The ones I have all deal with terminal illness.''
</P>
<P>
   She's been told that she's lucky she didn't have to see that
kind of suffering. That sentiment sends her reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything to have one last day,'' she says heatedly,
``to have 10 minutes to talk to him. Just the chance to say
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, she wants to ask him what to do next. But
the closest she can get to him is his old chair. Fisher moved the
furniture from his law office at Dow, Lohnes &AMP; Albertson to the
dining room of their house outside of Atlanta _ even his filing
cabinets and the painting of the Statue of Liberty from his office
wall. When things get too tough, she heads to the swivel chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to sit where he sat so much of the day, and it helps
to have his things around,''she says, running her hands over the
dark wood of his desk. ``And it does remind me, when I get off
track: What would he be doing? I guess some people think it's
bizarre, but I'm not going box it up and pretend it hasn't
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On a table in the converted dining room is the small wooden box
that holds Michael's ashes, next to a photograph of him, the bushy
eyebrows and Puckish smile lending his face an elfin air. Peter has
put a toy jetliner on top of the box, along with some Mardi Gras
beads. When he takes out crayons now, it's to draw burning
airplanes, and falling figures.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Stuart is riding her bicycle to a neighbor's house. She
loses her balance and smacks her arm against the mail box, and her
Aunt Helena carries her back inside the house, injured and tearful,
while mom looks for an ice-pack.
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on, and small accidents displace larger ones. The
well-wishers and the covered dishes stop coming after a few months,
says Fisher, but taxes and credit card notices don't. ``The bill
collectors want to get paid,'' she says. ``They say 'Lady, that was
last month that he died.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some acquaintances have become rocks of support while some
friends have disappeared. ``There are some you still haven't heard
from because they didn't know what to say. Well, by God, say
something,'' she says, angry again. ``Come by and take the kids for
a day. Bring some food.''
</P>
<P>
   Even old friends can be at a loss in the face of your grief,
says Marta Felber, author of ``Grief Expressed: When a Mate Dies''
(Life Words, $19.95). Her husband Joe died six years ago. ``My
presence reminds them of mortality, it reminds them of Joe's death
and they loved him too,'' says the Arkansas therapist. ``This is
why the friends have gone.'' All the same, she adds, ``it really
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Atlanta widows tell of similar experiences. ``Now you're
the merry widow,'' says Jo Pate, 64, a nurse whose husband died in
1973 of a heart attack. ``And they watch for you to make a pass at
their stupid husbands, who you wouldn't have in the first place.
You know too much about them. You don't want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Loss of a mate can also feel like loss of identity. ``What
really floored me was: Before, I was Mrs. L.C. Gorree, and
afterward I was nobody,'' says Regina Gorree, 43. Her husband died
of cancer three years ago. ``So much of my life had been based on
us being a couple, and suddenly I wasn't a couple any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases a wife must become the caretaker for her husband
before his death. Hannah Allen, 88, helped care for husband, Joe,
during his last days. But, like other women her age, she also had
health problems, and was in the hospital with heart failure when
Joe died last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dressed me and carried me to the funeral, let me stay an
hour, then carried me back to the hospital,'' says the West Lake
resident, whom church friends call ``Mama Hannah.'' She is
recuperating at home, with the help of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But every day she feels the loss of ``Papa Joe,'' her mate for
24 years. ``Joe was an unusual person, one of those kind-hearted,
do-anything-he-could for you people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a spouse, or even a life partner, is as hard on the body
as it is on the spirit. ``Nobody talks about the physical things,''
says Beth Stephens, whose fiance, a pilot, died in a plane crash
six years ago. ``I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, my hair started
falling out,'' says the East Cobb portrait painter. ``I got TMJ
(temporomandibular joint syndrome) in my jaw. Physically you just
fall apart. I lost 15 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other challenges. A 1989 U.S. Census Bureau study of
Social Security benefits showed that nearly half the women widowed
in a two-year period had incomes below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also less likely than men to remarry after the loss of
a spouse, partly because of a lack of potential partners. ``The
remarriage rate is higher for widowers than for widows because six
out of 10 people over 65 are women,'' says Johns Hopkins
sociologist Andrew Cherlin. ``So elderly men have a much better
marriage market position than do elderly women.''
</P>
<P>
   With men their age marrying women 10 and 20 years younger,
widows are also simply declining to join the rat race. These days
``it's less important for them to be married to someone,'' says
sociologist Gordon Clanton of San Diego State University, who
studies the impact of social change on families. ``Women have
become increasingly independent and the culture has become more
supportive of their independence.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy Fisher is standing in line at probate court, waiting
to file a death certificate, she doesn't feel very independent.
``Somebody needs to buy me a book, `Widows for Dummies,''' she
says. ``I'm learning how to take care of everything. And in my mind
I'm shooting toward Thanksgiving and Christmas and wondering what
far corner of the earth I could be in.''
</P>
<P>
   No place, it seems, where she can get away from a world without
her husband. While she remembers Michael, she knows the world is
forgetting him. She knows that the stream of events will close over
his memory, and life will go on.
</P>
<P>
   The children are still young, she says. How much will they
recall five years from now?
</P>
<P>
   Friends might not want to mention Michael, because the memory
hurts, but please do, she says. ``Please speak of him. Say his name
as often as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The man she wants the children to remember is the man who worked
as hard as he could to be with them, who volunteered to be ``room
Mom'' at their schools and put on magic shows for their friends.
</P>
<P>
   There are things they won't appreciate about him until they're
grown.
</P>
<P>
   Getting them to that point is a job she must now pursue by
herself. That means learning how to do the magic shows and boat
rides and Easter egg hunts. And how to keep from falling apart when
she walks out on that dock alone.
</P>
<P>
   And how to make it, without him, through the next 40 years.

HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO REJECT ATTEMPT TO END CHINA'S TRADE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite heavy criticism of China's human rights
policies, the House is expected Wednesday to reject an attempt to
overturn President Clinton's renewal of normal trade relations with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton granted the renewal in June, and under the law, Congress
can override his decision if both houses pass a resolution within
90 days.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Wednesday's vote, opponents of the renewal,
which range from labor unions to the conservative Family Research
Council, acknowledged that they had little hope of winning.
However, they said the debate remains their best opportunity to
publicize Beijing's restrictive trade and oppressive human rights
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take away MFN status from China _ we know
that,'' Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said at a news conference,
referring to the old term for trade with ``most favored nations.''
That term has now been changed to ``normal trade relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf added that the fight over the issue provides ``our best
chance to vote our conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said this year's vote ``was almost
a foregone conclusion, but that shouldn't stop people from speaking
out against a policy that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing China's current status is a sure bet because many
House members realize that their districts need free trade with
that nation, according to Casimir Yost, an expert on U.S.-China
relations at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a
Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers, who have already been hurt by the Asian financial
crisis, are saying, `Don't mess with our exports,''' Yost said.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's debate, many pro-trade lawmakers cited their
hometown companies' business with China. Earlier this year, Rep.
Jim McDermott, D-Wash., whose district includes the Seattle-based
Boeing Co., a top U.S. exporter to China, said, ``The people of my
district and many others rely on exports for their jobs, and that
must not be forgotten in this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional debate over China's status routinely provokes
emotional speeches over how the United States should handle the
country that many experts feel will be America's chief military and
economic rival in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Trade opponents contend the United States should refuse to allow
normal access to American markets to a totalitarian government that
continues to block many democratic reforms and to keep U.S.
businesses out of many Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
   They also point to a growing U.S.-China trade deficit that is
expected to swell to $50 billion this year _ up from $40 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But China-trade supporters argue that China _ with 1.2 billion
people and one of the world's fastest growing economies _ is simply
too big to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   They say the best way to promote political reforms in China is
to increase its contact with the outside world by promoting trade
and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also point out that only six countries _ Afghanistan,
Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam and Yugoslavia _ don't have normal
trade relations with the United States, and they say that renewing
China's status would not give it special privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heated rhetoric, for the last nine years opponents
have been unable to overturn the trade renewal _ even after
Beijing's brutal massacrre of hundreds of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tienanamen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House defeated legislation to end China's trade
status by a vote of 259 to 173, although the minority vote
represented the highest total since 1992, when Congress passed
limits on Beijing's trade privileges but failed to override a veto
by President George Bush. The Senate did not vote on China's trade
status last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the House debate promises a few new twists.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's visit to China from June 25 to July 3 has
heightened interest in that country and its policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the House passed, 390 to 1, a non-binding
measure that reaffirmed America's commitment to Taiwan and its
people. The bill was a reaction to remarks made by Clinton during
his China trip that the United States would not support
independence for Taiwan or its membership in international
organizations. The Senate already had passed a similar pro-Taiwan
measure 92-0.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Justice Department continues to investigate
allegations that China tried to influence the 1996 elections by
funneling illegal donations into Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, congressional committees are probing questions about
whether the White House was influenced by Democratic donor Bernard
Schwartz in allowing U.S. aerospace firms, including Schwartz's New
York-based Loral Corp., to launch their satellites aboard Chinese
rockets.

   TAX-ROBERSON _ WASHINGTON - Even in death, 4-year-old Carl Wayne
Roberson of Nacogdoches, Texas, cannot escape being at the center
of a legal tug of war. This time, the boy's estate is squaring off
against an Internal Revenue Service demand for $1.36 million in
estate taxes and penalties on a $4.48 million settlement of a law
suit brought over the boy being exposed to toxic chemicals in the
uterus. Carl died Nov. 23, 1993. The boy's estate filed a petition
asking the U.S. Tax Court here to overturn the IRS decision that
the proceeds from the settlement were taxable. The estate argues
the payment should be tax-free. (Moskal, Cox News Service).

<P>
   Tens of millions of people have been forced from their homes
during the past decade by armed conflict, internal strife and
systematic violations of human rights, all the while remaining
within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   No continent has been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels. Both the communities left behind and the
towns and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

AVIATION INDUSTRY GROUP REJECTS FUEL TANK FIXES AS TOO COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An industry advisory group led by Boeing Co. and
Airbus Industries on Tuesday rejected design changes to commercial
jets to prevent fuel tank explosions such as the blast that federal
officials say downed TWA Flight 800 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After four months of study, the group told the Federal Aviation
Administration that it was too costly to eliminate all explosive
vapors in the center fuel tanks of commercial jets or dramatically
reduce the vapors' flammability.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board blamed a fuel tank
explosion for the TWA disaster and recommended that the FAA require
aircraft manufacturers to reduce the buildup of explosive vapors in
fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The industry rejected that approach in a 36-page report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not find an economic or practical means,'' said Ron
Hinderberger, a member of the panel group and director of
Seattle-based Boeing's air-safety investigation program.
</P>
<P>
   The industry group, known as the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory
Committee, is the main advisory body to the FAA on safety issues.
FAA officials now will review the report and either accept or
reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hudson, a member of the advisory panel and the executive
director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Washington,
D.C.-based advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, called the
advisory group's report ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This report simply says (to the FAA), `We are not going to do
anything now. If you want to do things you can, and we are going to
study it for the future,''' said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson also asserted that the costs for the fuel tank fixes
likely are much lower than depicted in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 800 exploded in flight off the Long Island coast on July
17, 1996, killing 230 passengers and crew. The NTSB concluded that
a center fuel tank on the Boeing 747 exploded, causing the jet to
break into pieces and plunge into the ocean. The NTSB has yet to
determine why the tank ignited, but investigators have ruled out
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The industry group concluded that design fixes to the U.S. fleet
of about 8,500 commercial jet aircraft would cost more than the
cost of damage and loss of life caused by any future fuel tank
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel-tank explosions represent less than 1 percent of the
accidents that occur in commercial aviation,'' the report said.
While the FAA estimates that future fuel-tank explosions would cost
$2 billion over the next 10 years if no fuel-systems changes are
made, measures to reduce the tanks' flammability would ``have an
economic impact far greater than this,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal would install a ventilation system near the fuel
tanks to reduce heat generated by nearby air conditioning units.
The cost of that change was estimated at $3.5 billion over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach would require ground crews to add a harmless
gas to partially filled fuel tanks prior to departure. The inert
gas would reduce explosive fuel vapors in the tank. The cost would
be about $3 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Another would add the harmless gas to fuel tanks while in
mid-flight as a way to reduce vapors. The price tag was about $20
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a less flammable jet fuel would run about $15 billion
in the United States alone and $60 billion for other nations, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel tanks, situated in an aircraft's wings and along segments
of the fuselage, are generally very safe, the organization said.
Fuel tank explosions like the one that may have downed Flight 800
are ``the result of unique circumstances at a single point in time,
rather than circumstances that generate a continuous or
intermittent ignition condition,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says 10 transport airplane accidents since 1959 involved
fuel tank explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The group has proposed further study of the ventilation and
ground-based inert gas systems, the least costly options.
</P>

 &HT;    SENATORS OFFER PENSION REFORMS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan Senate coalition Tuesday introduced a
bill to make pension coverage more affordable and easier to
transfer from one job to another.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would affect 51 million American workers who are not
covered by a pension plan by streamlining regulations, making the
plans more attractive to female workers and making it easier for
small businesses to start up pension programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation's families, businesses and employees deserve
pension rules that reflect the changing nature of the workplace,''
said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who sponsored the bill with Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. Both senators participated two months ago
with President Clinton and congressional leaders in a National
Summit on Retirement Savings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bill's main provisions are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Automatic payroll deductions by employers so employees may
directly contribute to an Individual Retirement Account.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tax credits to help small businesses start a retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eliminate the 25 percent of salary cap on contributions to
pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Allow workers who change jobs to roll over their pension and
retirement plans into the plan of their new employer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outlaw credit cards that use a worker's 401(k) or similar
contribution plan as the basis of a line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contains numerous provisions to strengthen pension
security and eliminate cumbersome regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to introducing the legislation, Graham held two forums on
pension issues in Florida. Grassley, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, sponsored the bill creating the summit and has
held several hearings on retirement savings issues.

AVIATION INDUSTRY GROUP REJECTS FUEL TANK FIXES AS TOO COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An industry advisory group led by Boeing Co. and
Airbus Industries on Tuesday rejected design changes to commercial
jets to prevent fuel tank explosions such as the blast that federal
officials say downed TWA Flight 800 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After four months of study, the group told the Federal Aviation
Administration that it was too costly to eliminate all explosive
vapors in the center fuel tanks of commercial jets or dramatically
reduce the vapors' flammability.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board blamed a fuel tank
explosion for the TWA disaster and recommended that the FAA require
aircraft manufacturers to reduce the buildup of explosive vapors in
fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The industry rejected that approach in a 36-page report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not find an economic or practical means,'' said Ron
Hinderberger, a member of the panel group and director of
Seattle-based Boeing's air-safety investigation program.
</P>
<P>
   The industry group, known as the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory
Committee, is the main advisory body to the FAA on safety issues.
FAA officials now will review the report and either accept or
reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hudson, a member of the advisory panel and the executive
director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Washington,
D.C.-based advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, called the
advisory group's report ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This report simply says (to the FAA), `We are not going to do
anything now. If you want to do things you can, and we are going to
study it for the future,''' said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson also asserted that the costs for the fuel tank fixes
likely are much lower than depicted in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 800 exploded in flight off the Long Island coast on July
17, 1996, killing 230 passengers and crew. The NTSB concluded that
a center fuel tank on the Boeing 747 exploded, causing the jet to
break into pieces and plunge into the ocean. The NTSB has yet to
determine why the tank ignited, but investigators have ruled out
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The industry group concluded that design fixes to the U.S. fleet
of about 8,500 commercial jet aircraft would cost more than the
cost of damage and loss of life caused by any future fuel tank
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel-tank explosions represent less than 1 percent of the
accidents that occur in commercial aviation,'' the report said.
While the FAA estimates that future fuel-tank explosions would cost
$2 billion over the next 10 years if no fuel-systems changes are
made, measures to reduce the tanks' flammability would ``have an
economic impact far greater than this,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal would install a ventilation system near the fuel
tanks to reduce heat generated by nearby air conditioning units.
The cost of that change was estimated at $3.5 billion over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach would require ground crews to add a harmless
gas to partially filled fuel tanks prior to departure. The inert
gas would reduce explosive fuel vapors in the tank. The cost would
be about $3 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Another would add the harmless gas to fuel tanks while in
mid-flight as a way to reduce vapors. The price tag was about $20
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a less flammable jet fuel would run about $15 billion
in the United States alone and $60 billion for other nations, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel tanks, situated in an aircraft's wings and along segments
of the fuselage, are generally very safe, the organization said.
Fuel tank explosions like the one that may have downed Flight 800
are ``the result of unique circumstances at a single point in time,
rather than circumstances that generate a continuous or
intermittent ignition condition,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says 10 transport airplane accidents since 1959 involved
fuel tank explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The group has proposed further study of the ventilation and
ground-based inert gas systems, the least costly options.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Robeson, the chairman of the advisory group and a vice
president at the Washington, D.C.-based Aerospace Industries
Association which represents airplane manufacturers, said the two
systems may eventually prove cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group sees some technologies out there that are pretty
promising. The question is can we drive the cost down so it's not a
hurdle,'' Robeson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the industry and the FAA say that they already
are taking steps to make fuel tanks safer and to eliminate
potential ignition sources.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry rejected the major changes for existing
planes, the group may issue strict design rules for new aircraft.

NEW BISHOP NAMED FOR MANCHESTER DIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. &UR;  &LR; _ Bishop John B. McCormack, a clergyman with
deep Boston roots, has been appointed by Pope John Paul II to be
the ninth Bishop of the Diocese of Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop McCormack succeeds Bishop Leo E. O'Neil, a charismatic
and beloved prelate, who died of cancer last November.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Tuesday, Bishop McCormack, 62, said he was
``honored and deeply grateful that His Holiness Pope John Paul II
has appointed me. ...I appreciate and am humbled by the confidence
and trust he places in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop McCormack has been an Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese
of Boston since 1995, serving the south region of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has accomplished this task with customary graceful ease and
a deep pastoral sensitivity to anyone who has called upon him,''
said Bernard Cardinal Law in a statement. ``He will be sorely
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop McCormack has been a priest and bishop in the Archdiocese
of Boston for 38 years, serving in Massacahusetts as an associate
at St. James Parish in Salem, and as a pastor at St. Francis Xavier
in South Weymouth and Immaculate Conception in Malden-Medford.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop McCormack was executive director of North Shore Catholic
Charities for 11 years, and for a decade served in the cardinal's
cabinet as Secretary for Ministerial Personnel and was Vicar for
the Religious for the Archdiocese, the cardinal's liaison with
religious orders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Boston, Bishop McCormack was a key force behind the
creation of the archdiocese's policies for handling allegations of
sexual misconduct by clergy, and was involved in a series of
``healing masses'' for victims of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of sexual abuse by clergy, Bishop McCormack said
Tuesday, ``eats away at all that the church stands for in terms of
trust, in terms of placing your hope in God and having someone
abuse you.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there are ``many things we could do, as a Church or as a
community'' to try to ensure such abuse does not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of his tenure here, Bishop McCormack said that he
has ``no agenda, and I have no plans to implement any new
programs,'' until he learns more about the diocese and its needs.
He plans to tour the state soon, meeting with church leaders. The
diocese encompasses the state of New Hampshire, which is home to
320,000 Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bishop takes up residence in a city riven by the
Catholic Church's insistence that Manchester's merged hospitals,
Catholic Medical Center and the Elliot Hospital, follow Catholic
doctrine and ban all abortions at both institutions. The issue
threatens to lead to the dissolution of the hospitals' union.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said of the hospital issue, ``I don't know yet how it
can be resolved. ...In some way, I will be part of that discussion,
I'm not sure at what level or when, but I'm very interested in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack attended seminary at Cardinal O'Connell Seminary
College and St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Mass. He was ordained
by Cardinal Richard Cushing and recieved a master's degree from
Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to leave Boston, because that's my home,'' Bishop
McCormack said. ``But that's part of priestly life and ministry ...
and I accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop McCormack will be installed as Bishop of Manchester at
St. Joseph Cathedral in Manchester on September 22.

CHINA EXPECTED TO GET `NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS' STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House is poised to vote today to maintain
normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China for the
19th consecutive year, despite recent controversies over the
transfer of satellite technology and illegal foreign campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of conservatives and liberals objects to the policy,
previously called ``most favored nation'' status, because of
China's human rights violations. However, the success of President
Clinton's recent trip to China has helped shore up support among
Democrats worried about labor unions and jobs, while Republican
leaders are backing the election-year issue favored by business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the president's trip, members are starting to really
believe that this is an important relationship,'' said
Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the top Democrat on
the House subcommittee on trade. ``The president's trip to China
demonstrated the importance of engaging the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the House voted 259-173 to renew trade relations with
China after an emotional debate that exposed deep divisions within
both parties, causing opponents to pick up 32 more votes than in
the previous year. But the political mood over the issue is more
positive this year, and supporters of a normal trade policy with
China are predicting a similar vote count.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have temporarily put aside their
concerns about allegations that the Chinese military might have
learned valuable information from US companies that used Chinese
rockets to boost satellites into space or that China may have
funneled illegal campaign contributions to the 1996 Democratic
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A potential violation of security guidelines is something
totally divorced from trade relations,'' said Representative Philip
Crane, an Ilinois Republican and chairman of the House trade
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Bernard Sanders, the independent from Vermont
who opposes trade relations with China on economic grounds, said,
``It is almost invariable that corporate interests and the big
money people get what they want.'' The former socialist mayor of
Burlington added, ``Corporate America is throwing American workers
out in the street and going to China where they can hire people for
25 cents an hour. They will fight like crazy to maintain that
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   American companies sell about $13 billion a year in goods and
services to China. China, however, sells $52 billion to the United
States, a figure that includes about 60 percent of all athletic
footwear and most of the inexpensive children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Cal Dooley, a California Democrat, said
Republican leaders were urging support of trade with China to
reassure the US Chamber of Commerce and other major business
interests that the GOP ``is still a voice for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Chamber of Commerce Tuesday released a report showing
that Connecticut and Massachusetts rank among the top 20 states
that export goods to China. The report, based on Commerce
Department data, ranks Connecticut 11th with $291 million in
exports, and Massachusetts is 17th with $159 million. Most of
Connecticut's exports are chemical products, industrial machines
and computers and paper products. The Massachusetts exports are
dominated by industrial machines and computers, electric and
electronic equipment, and scientific and measuring instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Workman, the international vice president for the US
Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the issue has spawned odd
coalitions. ``It is an issue that doesn't fall into neat
ideological patterns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Representative Nancy Pelosi, a liberal California
Democrat, appeared at a news conference Tuesday with Gary Bauer,
the president of the Family Research Council and one of the most
formidable figures on the Republican right, to denounce normal
trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, the
group of moderate Democrats, said, ``If the new left-right
protectionist crowd is successful, they could change the mix of
policies that has brought about one of the longest, most sustained
periods of non-inflationary economic growth in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping the issue this year is the substitution of the phrase
``normal trade relations'' instead of ``most favored nation.''
Supporters of trade relations with China added the name change to
the Internal Revenue Service bill that has passed Congress to make
it easier to explain that China would get the same treatment as
nearly every other nation.

   When the GOP took control of Congress in 1995, the NEA became
one of its first targets for elimination. Its budget has been
repeatedly slashed, and it has managed to stay alive only by slim
voting margins.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, it has been helped by changes in its
grant-giving process, a favorable Supreme Court decision and the
selection of a new chairman popular with country music lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Its former chairman, Jane Alexander, helped to reduce its
original elitist image by shifting grants from big-time cultural
institutions to smaller, community-based operations. The new
chairman, Bill Ivey, plans to emphasize support for arts education
for young people, a popular political concept.
</P>
<P>
   The annual arts funding is currently making its usual tortuous
way through Congress, bolstered against the customary House attack
by a more supportive Senate. The president has threatened to veto
the funding measure that includes the NEA money if it is
eliminated. Nobody expects that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The way the NEA goes about encouraging the arts has been
transformed since it carelessly gave financial support to some work
that was not only of dubious artistic value but offensive to most
observers. Yet the NEA remains a target for its symbolic value, as
a way for conservatives to demonstrate their concern over what they
see as our declining national values.
</P>
<P>
   This is really a stale issue. The incidents that still rankle
the moral purists occurred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial were 1989 exhibits of Robert
Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs and Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine.
</P>
<P>
   An enraged Congress passed a law requiring the NEA to take into
consideration ``general standards of decency'' and ``values of the
American public'' in deciding which projects the government should
fund. Congress wanted mainstream stuff, more Grandma Moses and less
cutting-edge experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In response, NEA now gives direct gifts to state and local arts
groups and institutions rather than to individual artists, leaving
specific choices about which projects to support up to others and
building a fire wall between itself and art that may be
controversial. If there have been any more crucifixes in urine,
they have been funded by a pass-through institution or by the
artists themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This trend toward the bland alarms many artists, who are happy
to take federal funds but don't want any strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   Four artists _ including Karen Finley, who had received NEA
support for performances in which she smeared her naked body with
chocolate _ sued to have the decency standard declared an
unconstitutional violation of free speech. They claimed it
suppressed free artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   Two lower courts agreed. But in June the Supreme Court reversed
their decisions, declaring that the government has the right to
consider standards of decency in determining which arts projects to
support.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench noted that the NEA has limited funds and must
follow some guidelines to deny many applications in any case. And
Congress, it ruled, has the power to set spending priorities.
Unorthodox artists are still free to do as they wish. They just
don't have a guarantee that taxpayers will cough up the money for
it.
</P>
<P>
   In another context, the question of arts censorship came up in
Manhattan recently over ``Corpus Christi,'' a play about a gay
Jesus figure who has sex with his apostles. After reviews of the
subject matter appeared, public outrage drove the Manhattan Theater
Club, which has a general NEA grant, to cancel the production.
</P>
<P>
   Counter-outrage from New York's literary community, which
screamed censorship, forced the theater to reschedule the play,
still being drafted. But it is not censorship for a theater to
exercise its best judgment about which plays will draw a profitable
audience. That is merely good business sense. Authors who have
written plays are not automatically guaranteed they will be staged.
</P>
<P>
   Artists like to argue that any limitations on their creativity
can have a chilling effect, inhibiting the talent that inspires new
cultural experimentation. This is a self-serving, alarmist view
substantiated by a few anecdotes but not by history, which is full
of artistic breakthroughs neither financed by government nor
supported by an elite peer group.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the role of the NEA remains important. A great
nation has an obligation to encourage and recognize the arts in all
forms as a vital component of civilized life. It is both a balm for
the spirit and an economic community asset.
</P>
<P>
   Many European governments contribute more financial support to
protect and enhance their cultural heritage than the United States
does. The political objections to arts subsidies are outdated,
exaggerated and shameful.

NEW FOREIGN LOANS ENCOURAGE RUSSIAN LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fresh from two significant, if modest, successes with
international lenders, Russia's top leaders expressed hope Tuesday
that their foundering economy was finally turning the corner toward
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Private analysts seemed less sanguine. They said the government
had gained a few months to put its fiscal house in order before it
faced another financial crisis like the one that has rocked the
nation for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Russians managed to calm foreign investors and
halt the decline of the ruble when they secured a $4.8 billion loan
from the International Monetary Fund in exchange for promising to
make basic reforms in their tax and budgetary procedures.
</P>
<P>
   That day they gained more breathing space, when international
investors bought up $4.4 billion in long-term bonds to refinance
exorbitant short-term loans that were coming due this year. The new
bonds, paying about 15 percent interest and issued in dollars,
covered about a sixth of the short-term debt, which has been sold
at interest rates of 50 percent and more.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Tuesday that the government
now had the time and resolve to overhaul its tax code and
tax-collection system to insure that it did not end up in another
cash crunch like the one this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can say that yesterday we completed a very
important stage,'' Kiriyenko said at a news conference. ``And even
more important is that we won it. I think it was an absolute
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko was referring not just to the new loans, but also to
the legislative program that he and President Boris Yeltsin
proposed last month to right the government's listing finances.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-point program, which included a new income tax, a new
sales tax and increases in property taxes, bogged down in the
Parliament, which approved barely a third of the $16.2 billion in
revenue-raising measures that Yeltsin had sought.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend Yeltsin sidestepped the Parliament's
Communists and regional governors, who feared that the measure
would cost them money, and put the programs into effect by decree.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kiriyenko said the decrees were even more draconian than the
earlier legislative program and would raise even more money than
the government had sought. Among the decrees were orders to double
the taxes on apartment houses and quadruple other land taxes, to
place a 3 percent duty on imported goods and to extend the 10
percent value-added tax to a broad range of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has been approved, and it has started working,''
Kiriyenko said. ``This is the first and, perhaps, the most
important victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Private financial experts did not disagree with the importance
of the moves. But some of them noted that Russia had promised
similar reforms before and failed to deliver. The experts wondered
why the new set of promises should be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to find it very difficult to fulfill all
the conditionalities underlying the IMF package and Kiriyenko's
anticrisis package,'' one investment banker based here said. ``The
question isn't one of willingness. It's whether they can actually
implement the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Duma, the bureaucracy, the local governments, the
financial and industrial groups _ all these bodies are going to be
acting in some way against the government's push on reforms. A lot
of these people got rich under the status quo. And they don't want
to see it change.''
</P>
<P>
   That banker, who insisted on anonymity, said his bank believed
that the government had two or three months to show real progress
before another fiscal crisis began to take form. Even Deputy
Finance Minister Mikhail Kasynov said Tuesday that Russia basically
had until year's end to install real reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF reflected some of the skepticism Monday, when it decided
to extend an initial $4.8 billion in loans instead of the $5.6
billion that had been tentatively agreed on. The fund's action,
part of a loan package totaling $11.2 billion, was widely viewed as
a warning signal to the Russian Parliament that it had to put its
stamp on fiscal changes or see the international money pipeline dry
up.
</P>
<P>
   Russian markets received that message, and one index of
blue-chip stocks fell 3.5 percent in the opening minutes Tuesday.
The index closed Tuesday off 4.7 percent, and the ruble weakened
slightly against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko nonetheless seems to be making some progress. Tuesday
the government said that he had reached agreement with the vast
natural-gas monopoly Gazprom on a schedule to pay billions of
rubles in back taxes that the utility has ignored for 18 months.
Gazprom is the world's largest natural-gas utility and Russia's
largest corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the repayment plan were not available. Last month the
government sent tax agents into Gazprom offices, threatening to
seize its vacation dachas, hunting lodges, limousines and other
perquisites unless the utility paid its debts by July 1.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Making art isn't always a solitary activity. There is
a type of intensely social artist who rubs against as much of the
world as possible to help turn the wheels of his own creativity,
the artist for whom the other side, the newest level in esthetic
thinking or a degree of change in direction, is just a handshake
and an animated conversation away. The writers Andre Breton and
Susan Sontag, the musicians Quincy Jones and Gil Evans, these were
and are spongelike presences whose enthusiasms made them hubs,
rather than moving parts, of culture.
</P>
<P>
   Arto Lindsay _ record producer, singer/songwriter, musician and
conceptual artist _ is one of this kind. A recent morning found him
at home watching the Romania-Croatia World Cup game on television.
Twelve hours earlier he'd returned from Italy to his one-bedroom
Chelsea apartment, which is filled with piles of records, some
office chairs and nondescript furniture _ you would never suspect
that this American is one of the most popular record producers in
Brazil _ and his concentration was split three ways.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Miller, the mixmaster known as DJ Spooky, was there,
discussing details of an upcoming gig, part of a music series next
month at the Lisbon Expo that Lindsay has been asked to curate.
Lindsay was making coffee for a second visitor. And he was keeping
one and a half eyes on the game. ``I'm a big Croatia fan,'' he
murmured absently.
</P>
<P>
   Stick around Lindsay for five minutes, with his lines of
communication perpetually open to the popular music of New York,
Rio, Salvador, Naples, Tokyo, Cologne, Lisbon and Paris, and you'll
realize that he is not just wide-ranging; he is modern. He is an
all-around musical weather vane, with a particularly keen desire to
introduce the pleasures of Brazilian music to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   He surrounds himself with diverse talents, and his role in music
_ an ambassador, curator and agitator as much as anything else _ is
somewhat analogous to that of Brian Eno, a friend and occasional
collaborator with Lindsay. But while Eno has long since made it to
the level of imprimatur, Lindsay remains below many radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he repositioned himself as a recording artist; his three
lovely records since then, ``The Subtle Body,'' ``Mundo
Civilizado'' and ``Noon Chill'' (all on Bar/None), are fusions of
Brazilian bossa nova, sensual funk and electronic music, with
Lindsay's uncertain and gentle voice floating on top.
</P>
<P>
   These albums have also reintroduced him as a writer. He writes
imagistic, erotically charged and slightly decadent lyrics,
sometimes veering off into Portuguese. ``I do love your lack of all
expression,'' he sings in one recent song. ``Find it not at all
distressing/life was tailor-made for our refreshment/while life is
rarely lacking dust/covered with details and fuss/you are one of
those creatures who simply are.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay was born in Virginia and moved at the age of 3 to a
small town in Pernambuco, in northeastern Brazil, where his father
was a teacher at a Catholic school. One senses this may have been
the beginning of his demeanor, which is bohemian-princely: His
family were big fish in a small pond. Later he went to an
international high school three hours away in Recife.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Manhattan in 1974. Since 1978, when he first became
known as part of the noisy No Wave trio DNA, and through consequent
periods spent with the Lounge Lizards and his own band, Ambitious
Lovers, he's been a semi-famous New York downtown character.
Whether glimpsed in the film ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' or
sloping down a Lower East Side street at midnight, Lindsay is
unmistakable: He has horn-rimmed glasses, a high forehead and
swept-back brown hair. He is tall, thin and vigorous, with a wide
mouth and long, skinny fingers that are usually clasping a
cigarette; in a bright shirt, he looks like a julienned vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the plane yesterday, coming back from Italy,'' he
said. ``We landed, and the tourists clapped.'' He made a disgusted
face. ``You know, people used to clap for a really smooth landing,
but now they just clap for whatever. But then I got to the cabin
and I thought, well, of course, I'm almost a tourist, because I've
been gone so much.'' (Lindsay keeps an apartment in Rio de Janeiro,
and spends three to four months each year in Brazil; his work also
frequently takes him to Tokyo and various European capitals.)
</P>
<P>
   He excused himself, quickly dialing a Manhattan hotel phone
number, and reached Marisa Monte, a young singer who's a sensation
in Brazil; Lindsay has produced three of her albums. ``Oi!'' he
yelped when she answered.
</P>
<P>
   Can't Type, Drive or Play the Guitar
</P>
<P>
   They chatted in Portuguese for a minute. ``Man, that record is
unbelievable,'' he said, hanging up. ``The Carlinhos Brown record
that Marisa's producing in New York right now? It's the record
Brown always wanted to make.'' Brown is another Brazilian pop
sensation; Lindsay produced his last album, ``Alfagamabetizado.''
``It was heartbreaking, because I was away the entire month, and
I'd been very involved in talking about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay loves to talk, and his communicative charm has been
crucial to his success. As he somewhat proudly points out, he can't
type, drive or play the guitar. But Lindsay is something of a
writer, certainly a traveler, and has made his living for much of
20 years as a guitarist who still cannot play chords. Though his
concerts these days usually present him as a singer with the
comfort of a good band, sometimes, as he did a few weeks ago at
Tonic, a small club on the Lower East Side, he will perform his
brand of scratchy, gestural improvised noise on a 12-string guitar
tuned to a melody that changes according to his mood.
</P>
<P>
   David Byrne _ whose 1994 album ``David Byrne'' was jointly
produced by Lindsay _ was asked how he thought of Lindsay foremost.
Pondering a little, he replied, ``A conversationalist.'' He
laughed. ``As you would expect, he doesn't direct in technical
terms; it's more conceptual. You have to interpret what he's
saying, and wonder, how do we technically achieve that?''

CANYONPLAN (Undated) - Opponents of a proposed tourist village near
the main entrance to Grand Canyon National Park called Tuesday for
a federal investigation into allegations of collusion between
federal agencies and the village's developer. Opponents of Canyon

100BOOKS (Undated) _ In a world of little time and immediate
gratification, the only thing keeping classic literature alive is
the college reading list. But a list like that published Monday by
Modern Library, a publisher of classics, of the Top 100
English-language novels of this century, will go a long way toward
stimulating interest, according to librarians, book sellers and a
professor of English. With list of how often top 10 books have been
checked out. By MICHAEL CLANCY. Story will move in the ``A'' and

MONET (Phoenix) - The Phoenix Art Museum will bring Monet to
Arizona before the Millennium. A traveling show of large, late
paintings by the French Impressionist master will open at the
museum in September, 1999. The paintings from the Musee Marmottan
in France, focus on Monet's paintings from his home and garden in
Giverny, 30 miles outside Paris. The show, in addition to the
upcoming ``Splendors of Egypt'' exhibit, fulfills the museum's
promise, after its expansion, of bringing the city ``the big
Egyptian show, the big Impressionist show.'' And it does so with a
bang. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DIRTYWORK (Undated) - It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do
it. And, surprisingly, those who do toil at stigmatized work such
as garbage collection, prostitution and bill collecting find it
relatively rewarding. Arizona State University management professor
Blake E. Ashforth expected to find a subculture of depressed, angry
workers when he began researching the subject of stigmatized, or
``dirty'' work. Instead, he found that the people working at those
jobs had discovered ways to make their work meaningful. With PHOTO.

an agreement with the Smithsonian Institution that designates the
southern Arizona attraction as the nation's first small, rural
museum to participate in the Smithsonian's new Affiliation Program.
The affiliation with the prestigious Smithsonian is only one of
seven granted in the entire nation. Many of the specimens will come

 NEW YORK: achieve that?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record he just produced in Italy, Lindsay explained (it
was a Neapolitan group called Avion Travel), ``I was singing beats
to the guys, I was changing melodies, I was changing chords.'' He
added: ``I mean, chords to me are mystical, because I can't play
them. But there's a lot of verbal and physical communication. I
tend to dance rhythms to people to show them what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the results of Lindsay's labor are some of the best pop
albums of the decade. They include Caetano Veloso's ``Estrangeiro''
and ``Circulado,'' Ms. Monte's ``Rose and Charcoal'' and the recent
album ``Pretaluz'' by the Angolan singer Waldemar Bastos. These are
recordings that represent a magic brooking between art and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Through a bilingual understanding of art and marketplace,
Lindsay has broken down some walls about what popular records are
supposed to sound like. He has ignored the rule that a worldwide
pop idol like Veloso should make records with slick-fingered studio
professionals rather than idiosyncratic improvising musicians. On
all his productions, an intimate side of the artist is revealed,
yet whatever star mythos the artist had to begin with is left fully
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arto has produced my favorite records,'' said Ned Sublette,
who is a member of the same generation of downtown New York
composers, and president of the record label Qbadisc. ``The thing
about `Estrangeiro' is just how uncompromising it seems. It doesn't
sound like they tried to make any compromises for commerciality, it
just sounds like they made the record they wanted to make, which
you hardly ever get to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaling Down Pop Excesses
</P>
<P>
   As a testament to Lindsay's position in Brazilian music, Rogerio
Duprat, a gray eminence of Brazilian popular music who orchestrated
and produced records by Veloso and others in the late '60s,
recently denounced Lindsay in the newspaper Estado de Sao Paolo. He
said that there were three things wrong with Brazilian music: the
widely loved figures Joao Gilberto and Chico Buarque, and Arto
Lindsay. (Duprat felt that all three were concerned with making
music slimmer rather than richer.) ``I felt incredible about that
headline,'' Lindsay said. ``A little overrated, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his stock in trade has sometimes been to scale down
the mass-pop excesses in the sound of some artists. But Lindsay is
just as obsessed with commercial appeal. ``I think that I'm not a
bitter person,'' he said, ``but I do feel that I haven't gotten my
due, and this does drive me.'' He added: ``I aspire to being
understood the way Caetano is understood in Brazil. He has a great
antagonistic relationship with the audience; it's not as if
everything he does is loved. People discuss things in detail: why
it's good, why it isn't good. That's why it's so frustrating for me
to do my work. Because first it was always `wacky guitarist,' and
now it's `from Brazil.' I'm anxious for the world to get past
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's interests in Conceptual Art began in the early '70s
while attending Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla. Influenced
by Yvonne Rainer and Vito Acconci, whose work he had only read
about in Artforum, he wrote a book of poems and a piece of
performance art for his thesis. Next year he wants to bring the
artist Matthew Barney to the famously bacchanalian carnival in
Bahia to work on a piece revolving around the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual Art That Baits Cynics
</P>
<P>
   He himself exhibited a Conceptual Art installation at the Vienna
Kunsthalle, six weeks ago, as part of a show on the intertwined
history of music and visual art. The piece was called
``Sufficiently Kinky,'' and went like this: Within a large room,
there was a door to a smaller room. But to get there, patrons had
to check their underwear, which was put into a styrofoam cup by a
buxom blond woman. Inside the room, there was nothing but a small
tree, a space heater and a glass of water for the patron's comfort.
</P>
<P>
   His highly praised work as a record producer notwithstanding,
Lindsay is the kind of artist who practically baits cynics; it must
be said that it's tempting to see the raw core of his talent as
that undistinguished tree within the installation's knowing,
sophisticated trappings. He speaks convincingly about being a
nonmusician, or a singer who's just on the edge of having control
over his voice, as if it's a gift. What's the benefit of
nonmusicianship, anyway? Lindsay goes squinty-eyed at the question.
``You don't have to practice?'' he suggested jokingly, exhaling
cigarette smoke. ``No. It's that you have to start over every time.
You're always embarrassed, in a way.''

MEXICO'S NEW RADICAL POLITICS: PRIMARY ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico _ A radical idea is gaining momentum within
Mexico's governing party: primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   For six decades after its founding in 1929, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party so thoroughly monopolized Mexican politics that
elections were a mere ritual in which its candidates, often
unopposed, won election to all but a handful of government posts.
Often, when faced with popular opponents, the party simply rigged
the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as government corruption and economic
crisis have fueled a surging opposition, one-party rule has come
under assault in Mexico as elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The party, known as the PRI, has lost so many elections that
opposition governors and mayors now run much of the country. Scores
of leaders have deserted the party, and many Mexicans wonder if it
can survive in a competitive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But this year has brought surprises.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has vowed that unlike previous PRI
presidents he will not anoint his successor, which has forced the
party to start looking for a new way to nominate its candidate for
presidential voting in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI began testing primaries this spring as a way of
nominating some gubernatorial candidates, and in the northern state
of Chihuahua, which borders Texas and New Mexico, the experiment
attracted thousands of new voters and appears to have been a factor
in the PRI's victory in the July 5 general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Primaries are just one way the PRI and Mexico's opposition
parties are experimenting this year, using techniques common
elsewhere but not here. They have made broadcast messages a far
more important ingredient of their campaigning than before, and for
the first time the dominant party is using television and radio
advertisements to disparage its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a year in which the way of doing politics in Mexico is
changing dramatically,'' said Rafael Gimenez, the chief poll taker
for the newspaper Reforma. ``The PRI is leading the way, but that's
provoking changes in other parties, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One result is that election costs are exploding, Gimenez and
other experts said, although there are no reliable statistics.
Another is the surging influence of poll takers and marketing
experts, and a corresponding decline in the power of traditional
brokers like labor and peasant bosses.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the 70-year rule of the PRI in Mexico, its
national candidates have been chosen by presidents and its local
candidates by the state governors. Now, by yielding the right of a
president to pick his successor, Zedillo is forcing the party to
rethink its methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old rules of presidential control are broken, which most
Priistas say is healthy,'' said John Bailey, a professor at
Georgetown University, referring to members of the PRI. ``On the
other hand, they're uncomfortable, like little kids. It's a new
game, Dad's not playing, and they have to figure out the rules for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring one of the PRI's top congressional leaders bolted
the party after a rival was chosen as the nominee for governor in
Zacatecas State. In response, a party assembly decided to use
public primaries to select candidates in five states, and they
attracted surprising levels of participation, leaving leaders
euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary in Chihuahua, Patricio Martinez Garcia, a
telegenic former mayor of the state capital, defeated a veteran
party official and went on to victory on July 5. It was the first
time the party had won back a state that was controlled by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primaries have given the party an enormous activism and
produced candidates with greater political force and legitimacy,''
Mariano Palacios Alcocer, the party president, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chihuahua primary, however, held on May 9 to select the
party's mayoral candidate in Ciudad Juarez, the state's largest
city, ended badly. Backers of one leader of the party interrupted
the vote count, occupying party headquarters and seizing ballot
boxes to protest what they said was an attempt by party leaders to
steal the election.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who was finally declared the winner lost the
general election, and voting records suggest that thousands of PRI
members, embittered by the primary, deserted the party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether a presidential primary could provoke a similar fracture
nationwide is a subject of fierce debate within the party, said
Agustin Basave Benitez, a PRI leader who is writing a book about
attempts to modernize the party. A second debate among those who
favor using a national primary to select a presidential candidate
centers on who should be allowed to vote and who should be on the
ballot, Basave said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, an economist who heads the party's wing of
foreign-trained technocrats, favors allowing the general public,
not just party members, to vote in the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants the party to drop its rule barring those who have
never been elected to public office from seeking the presidential
nomination, a requirement that prevents several members of
Zedillo's Cabinet from seeking the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Bartlett, the governor of Puebla State, who heads the
party's traditionalist wing, helped impose the eligibility
requirement and he believes that only party members should be
allowed to vote in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be the party that picks its candidate, rather than the
public that elects a candidate for the party,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   The party will decide how to nominate its presidential candidate
at a convention late this year. Leaders of Mexico's two main
opposition parties are to choose their presidential candidates at
party conventions late next year. They have announced no plans to
use primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over primaries has been unfolding as Mexico has
opened an intense 12-month cycle of gubernatorial elections in 15
states. The contests in several states have already broken sharply
with traditional Mexican campaigns, which for decades have centered
on rallies in public plazas and with candidates meeting voters
street by street.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Mexican candidates have used
television and radio in their campaigns. For years the PRI used
government-controlled newscasts to extol its achievements and to
belittle opposition candidates. And since the government loosened
informal restrictions last year that kept opposition parties from
buying air time, those parties, in several state races, have
broadcast commercials criticizing corruption by government
officials from the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of television and radio by all parties has increased
sharply this year, decades after American politics went electronic.
All three parties are building campaigns around TV commercials and
radio talk show appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering an age of modern politics in which radio and TV
are more important than personal contact with the citizens,'' said
Alfonso Zarate Flores, who edits a political newsletter. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pianist Marilyn Nonken's concert on Monday night at
the Flea included both the earliest work she plays (Schoenberg's
Three Pieces Op. 11 of 1909) and the slowest (Alvin Lucier's Music
for Piano With Pure Wave Slow Sweep Oscillators). What she prefers
is new and fast, and she does it well. She has agility, stamina and
thoughtfulness. She also has loyalty, as she showed in playing
again the composition by Jason Eckardt, Echoes' White Veil, that
she performed at Merkin Concert Hall earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Her Schoenberg performance was highly persuasive and indicative
of her strengths and her tastes. As she explained beforehand, the
pieces are startlingly new in that they belong to the first year or
so of atonality, and at the same time reassuringly old. She brought
out these qualities, but with the adverbs reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the third piece certainly had a good Viennese-waltz
swing, but in general Nonken seemed most committed to the music's
novelty and left some of the most Romantic gestures sounding pale
and lost. This was interesting. So was her intelligent underlining
of motivic links that made these pieces belong together.
</P>
<P>
   From her more usual repertory, she included, besides Eckardt's
work, Salvatore Martirano's Cocktail Music and a new piece written
for her by the British composer Michael Finnissy: North American
Spirituals. Like much of Finnissy's piano music, this weaves a
skein of transformation and embellishment around shadows from the
musical past, shadows thrown here by 18th-century American hymns,
African-American music (ragtime as well as spirituals) and Ives.
These support what is generally a gentle stream, though one that
can abruptly turn into a cascade or suddenly stop for long periods
of silence. The effect is at once celebratory and wary.
</P>
<P>
   In the very different world of Lucier, Nonken was thoroughly
absorbing. His piece depends on interactions between the piano's
sound and two pure electronic tones, which move very slowly away
from the middle of the keyboard in opposite directions and back
again. As they track across what the pianist has just played, they
seem to pick up the sound and bend it or create acoustic beats with
it. The piano changes in front of your ears, as much as it does
when this excellent performer sweeps through Schoenberg.

<P>
   MACAU _ In an isolated jail cell on a tiny island next to this
Portuguese colony sits a 43-year-old Chinese man who has held Macau
in thrall.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials here say he is one of the most
notorious organized crime figures in Southeast Asia. His lawyer
says he is merely a colorful businessman whose penchant for
publicity has landed him in a world of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Wan Kuok-koi, was arrested May 1, hours after a
homemade bomb destroyed a car belonging to Macau's police chief.
The bombing was the most audacious in a string of attacks on
government officials that terrified residents and scared visitors
away from this enclave of 502,000 people on the southern coast of
China, across the Pearl River delta from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Wan has not been charged with that crime, but Macau's colonial
authorities say they believe he was behind many other acts of
violence that have paralyzed the territory since last year. In a
testament to his formidable reputation, he is being kept away from
other inmates, in a cellblock cleared just for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the high profile he created, there was a perception that
he was too powerful, and people became afraid,'' said Lt. Col.
Manuel Geraldes, a Portuguese army officer who is a spokesman for
Macau's Security Department.
</P>
<P>
   When Portugal relinquishes Macau to China on Dec. 20, 1999, it
will mark the exit of the last European colonial power from Asia.
But Portugal's graceful retreat has been spoiled by a vicious gang
war for control of Macau's gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of bombings, shootings and stabbings has devastated the
local economy and strained relations between Portugal and China,
which have accused each other of not doing enough to curb the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever violence erupts, suspicion usually falls on Wan, who
goes by the nickname Broken Tooth Koi. He is said to be the leader
of Macau's biggest gang, 14K, and he is not a shy sort.
</P>
<P>
   Wan recently financed a film based on his exploits, called
``Casino.'' In an interview in Time magazine in April to promote
the film, he was quoted as saying of a rival gang leader, ``I'm
going to wipe him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that Wan has become a celebrity in Macau, where he
is now far better known than the beleaguered governor, Gen. Vasco
Rocha Vieira. Wan, with his deeply scarred arms and insatiable
gambling habit, has emerged as the symbol of fin-de-siecle Macau _
an unsavory gambling den where weekend wagerers mix with career
criminals and the casinos crawl with hard-eyed prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It is an image that officials here are understandably eager to
erase. ``It would give one the idea that Macau is the Casablanca of
the Far East,'' said Geraldes, with a wan smile. ``We don't accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he points out, with 27 murders in 1997 and 13 so far
this year, Macau has fewer killings per capita than Amsterdam or
Washington. And it has 37 million visitors a year, who arrive on
high-speed jetfoils from Hong Kong or rickety buses from
neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, those visitors are starting to stay away.
Macau's tourism revenue fell 14 percent in 1997, and with the Asian
financial crisis it is likely to deteriorate further this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the decline of Macau more evident in the Hotel
Lisboa, a wedding-cake-like edifice that used to be the colony's
glamorous flagship. After becoming the site of several crimes, the
Lisboa is now guarded by police officers with automatic weapons and
has the ambiance of a minimum-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's gambling industry is controlled by Stanley Ho, a Hong
Kong billionaire who has held an exclusive government franchise to
operate casinos since the 1960s. But officials say the gangs have
insinuated themselves into the business by running small VIP rooms
inside the casinos, reserved for high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, a visit to the casino at Hotel Lisboa shows that the
real action is not in the gloomy main hall, but off to the side in
a cozy VIP room said to be controlled by Wan. On a recent evening,
a young mainland Chinese man wearing a diamond-studded watch lost
$200,000 in 10 minutes playing baccarat.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare bit of good news for Macau, incidents of gang-related
violence have subsided since Wan was arrested. There is a lively
debate here about who deserves credit: the Portuguese, for
collaring Broken Tooth, or Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who
warned in a speech in Hong Kong this month that Beijing would help
Macau crack down on the gangs, which are called triads.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is anybody ready to declare the troubles over. Given the
influence that China already exerts here _ through legitimate
companies and criminal organizations with ties to Macau's triads _
some people here said the gangs were merely appeasing their future
rulers. These people said the gangsters might have called a
temporary truce to avoid embarrassing Beijing in the months leading
up to the handover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government put a big fish in jail, and now they're very
happy and think they've solved the problem of violence,'' said Joao
Severino, the irrepressible editor of Macau Hoje, a
Portuguese-language newspaper here. ``But the gangsters stopped
because they realized it was hurting business.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Macau's big fish? Wan could remain in jail for more
than a year while the government builds its case alleging that he
is a triad member. He may not even get a trial until after China
takes control of Macau, according to a recent report in The
Oriental Daily News, a Chinese-language newspaper in Hong Kong. If
Wan is convicted, he could face up to 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he has retained one of Macau's most respected
criminal lawyers, Pedro Redinha, who said Wan was ``completely
innocent'' and a scapegoat for the government's inability to
control the gambling trade. Redinha acknowledged that Wan's
interviews with Time and other publications were ``not good for
him,'' but insisted that he had been misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Casino,'' the film version of Broken Tooth's exploits:
``It was fictionalized to make it more commercial,'' said Redinha,
who was once the warden of the prison where Wan now sits awaiting
his fate.

A FILM FESTIVAL FOCUSES ON `GENER-ASIAN X' 
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs first graf to change `were mainly a showcase for films from
Asia' to `showcased more and more films from Asia')  (bl) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when it seemed that ``Asian-American
film festival'' was becoming a misnomer. Starting in the mid-1980s,
the organizers of the country's three major Asian-American
festivals _ held each year in New York, San Francisco and Los
Angeles _ showcased more and more films from Asia and desperately
trawled for any American-made features they could program alongside
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was part of the selection committee, we would take
Asian-American submissions without seeing the film first,'' said
Vivian Huang, director of the Asian-American International Film
Festival, sponsored by Asian Cinevision, a nonprofit group. The
series is to open at Florence Gould Hall in Manhattan on Friday.
``We were so excited just to see any feature.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 21-year history, the monthlong
festival, the oldest of its kind in the country, is screening more
features made in the United States by directors of Asian descent
than films from overseas. The festival box office expects to sell
up to 7,000 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Six Asian-American features and five from Asia have been
scheduled for the festival's main screenings, in contrast to the
six Asian features and 12 domestic short films in, say, 1986. This
year's numbers signify a watershed for Asian-American independent
features, as almost a dozen that have been in production for the
last two years hit the festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The films are the calling cards for a wave of directors, most of
them trained in film schools and still in their 20s and early 30s,
who have been termed ``Gener-Asian X'' by some critics and festival
programmers. Most of the relatively young auteurs work in Los
Angeles or New York and know one another from festivals and film
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to see it as a wave,'' said Eric Koyanagi, 30, director
of ``Hundred Percent,'' ``and it'll crash or pick up momentum, and
maybe we'll be surfing in a couple of years.'' His film, which
tells of what he calls ``Asian-American Gen-X slackers'' in Venice
Beach, Calif., is scheduled to make its East Coast premiere
Saturday at the New York festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the major film schools keep statistics,
anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of Asian-Americans
enrolling has surged in the 1990s. ``My sense is that there is
definitely an increase,'' especially in the last six or seven
years, said David James, a professor at the University of Southern
California School of Cinema-Television.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Broderick, president of Next Wave Films in Los Angeles,
said that of the 800 independent films in production that his
company is tracking, about 3 percent are directed by
Asian-Americans. That may seem low, but it is still far greater
than the number of studio productions by Asian-Americans, said
Broderick, whose company provides money to finish low-budget films
in exchange for certain proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   And 1997 saw a noticeable increase in the number of
Asian-American submissions to the Sundance Film Festival, said John
Cooper, associate director of programming at Sundance. ``I would
say they're playing to a younger, more hip style'' than earlier
Asian-American films, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those films making the festival rounds reflect personal visions
of growing up outside mainstream America. Like the filmmakers,
their young protagonists feel equal parts Asian and American. Some
films have only Asian-American lead actors, and the stories take
place in locales like suburban Los Angeles and Greenwich Village
rather than Chinatown or Koreatown. The films deal more with
middle-class suburban angst than immigrant issues, and their worlds
revolve around house parties, dope smoking, transvestites, cafe
intellectuals, hip-hop music and clashes with parents.
</P>
<P>
   The films are made on budgets of $30,000 to $1.5 million and are
often shot within a month. (The directors often find inspiration in
the French New Wave.) Festival curators hail them as successors to
Wayne Wang's low-budget sleeper ``Chan Is Missing,'' a seminal work
that seemed to herald the arrival of feature films directed by
Asian-Americans when it opened in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a major eye-opener for a lot of people,'' said
Spencer Nagasako, a documentary maker who teaches Asian-American
film at the University of California at Berkeley. ``After that,
people started to think about getting their works into the
mainstream and becoming bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the years since ``Chan'' have seen only a handful of movies
by Asian-Americans reach theaters. The most prominent have been
documentaries, which have drawn critical acclaim but relatively
small audiences (Christine Choy and Renee Tajima's ``Who Killed
Vincent Chin?''), films that deal as much with life in Asia as in
America ( Wang's ``Joy Luck Club'' and ``Chinese Box'') or
avant-garde works that rarely involve Asian-American characters
(the films of Gregg Araki and Jon Moritsugu).
</P>
<P>
   Not so with ``Hundred Percent'' and its festival brethren. In
his first feature after finishing film school at the University of
Southern California, Koyanagi cast all Asian-American leads. In the
opening scene, three men debate who is the coolest Asian-American
male icon (Mr. Sulu from ``Star Trek'' vs. Judge Lance Ito) while
playing mah jongg and eating ``Asian-American soul food'' (Chinese
takeout, no less).
</P>
<P>
   Other films at the New York festival, like Francisco Aliwalas'
``Disoriented'' and Rea Tajiri's ``Strawberry Fields,'' also
address issues related to growing up in a multicultural society.
``We all kind of share similar angers and issues, even if we all
have our own personal signature to what we do,'' Koyanagi said.
``These films are all contemporary pop culture expressions of what
our lives are like now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he went to film school to learn how to make art-house
movies but awakened to a reality during the Los Angeles riots of
1992. As the city burned, he said, he watched how the mass media
reduced the conflict between blacks and Korean store owners to what
he called a ``black vs. yellow paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even talk about class conflict,'' he said. ``It
made me question who's calling these shots. Filmmaking has some
sort of sociological experience to me now as opposed to purely
artistic.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Koyanagi does not consider himself a political
filmmaker, he points to Spike Lee as one of his influences. Many of
his Asian-American peers also cite black filmmakers as
inspirations, mostly because, they say, those directors have
managed to make movies that appeal to both black and mainstream
audiences while addressing personal issues. John Woo and Ang Lee,
Asian directors who work in the Hollywood studio system, are often
listed as inspirations, as is Wong Kar-Wai, the ultrastylish Hong
Kong director.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to financing, several filmmakers have looked to
Asia after receiving unenthusiastic responses from studios and
independent production companies in the United States. They said
studio executives requested that they write white protagonists into
their scripts to make the films more marketable.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than bowing to that pressure, Koyanagi said he and the
producers of ``Hundred Percent'' found a businessman in Malaysia
who was willing to underwrite the project, which cost more than $1
million, because Koyanagi had signed Garrett Wang and Tamlyn
Tomita, two high-profile Asian-American actors.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Wonsuk Chin, 30, the director of ``Too Tired to
Die,'' part of the festival, said he had received funds from a
South Korean producer for his $1.5 million film because he had cast
Mira Sorvino, an Oscar winner, and signed Takeshi Kaneshiro, a pop
and film star in Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most young directors represented at the New York festival
scraped together their financing through more tried-and-true
domestic avenues, like loans, foundation grants and credit cards.
Chin said he received Korean support only because he had a cast
with international appeal, and because his script, about a Japanese
expatriate confronting his imminent death, had elements that could
draw an overseas art-house audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even after these films are made and shown at festivals,
distribution remains a problem. With the glut of independent movies
seeking distributors, Asian-American directors said their movies
were often passed over because of a perceived lack of mainstream
marketability. Francisco Aliwalas, 33, whose first feature,
``Disoriented,'' has been rejected by at least 20 distributors,
said: ``I find myself educating them on where the populations of
Asian-Americans are, what the numbers are, the potential growth and
the fact that they will see a film that speaks to them. But they're
afraid to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   But some distributors say films are often rejected solely on
quality. ``I have over the years seen some Asian-American films,
and none of them I felt were of sufficient quality for me to
undertake,'' said Daniel Talbot, president of New Yorker Films,
which distributed ``Chan Is Missing.'' ``It always comes down to
the film, not the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the independent film by Asian-Americans that has
generated the most buzz this year is Quentin Lee's and Justin Lin's
``Shopping for Fangs,'' mostly because of the nontraditional
distribution route the directors have taken. After receiving offers
only from small distribution companies, Lee, 27, decided to
distribute his film through his own company, Margin Films. The film
was made for $100,000, features young Asian-American leads and was
screened at several international film festivals last year. In late
May, the film opened on about 10 screens in New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles. It performed below expectations, Lee said, and he
is still hoping to break even with future screenings. Still, his
do-it-yourself marketing has won admiration. ``You've gotta tip
your hat off to them; they're not taking no for an answer,''
Nagasako said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the festival's filmmakers said they were still
hoping to sign with a distribution company. For example, Chin said
his ``Too Tired to Die,'' which has been picked up for distribution
in Japan, Germany and even Bosnia, is still looking for a domestic
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this film doesn't get shown in this country,'' he said, ``I
don't know, maybe I should just make a Jean-Claude Van Damme
movie.''

<P>
   POIRIER-FILMS (Paris) _ Manuel Poirier's movie career got off to
a slow start. He was 40 by the time his first film was released,
and even then, forced to act as his own producer, he could afford
only one print. Yet, somehow, the right people saw it and liked it
and the doors that Poirier had been knocking on for years suddenly
opened. Within two years he had made three more movies, and the
last of these, ``Western,'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997
Cannes International Film Festival. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   GRAY-NEGOTIATOR-FILM (Los Angeles) _ An interview with the film
director, F. Gary Gray, 28, and his new movie ``The Negotiator.''
Gray, who grew up in tough South-Central Los Angeles came to
feature films through his directing of music videos for rap
artists. By Bernard Weinraub.

By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY-HERMAN-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Jerry Herman is returning
to Broadway this week on a deeply personal note. The 66-year-old
composer-lyricist for such huge successes as ``Hello, Dolly!,''
``Mame'' and ``La Cage Aux Folles'' _ a Broadway figure who is both
a symbol of a golden era and an undervalued songwriter _ was
diagnosed with HIV 13 years ago and watched his health decline.
Since then with the help of protease inhibitors, which he takes
after every meal, the outgoing and perennially smiling composer
said his restored health _ he also had a triple heart bypass last
year _ energized him for the first time in a decade and has led to
``An Evening With Jerry Herman,'' starring Lee Roy Reams, Florence
Lacey and Herman himself at the Booth Theater for a two-month run
that opens on Tuesday. By Bernard Weinraub.

   MAD-ARTISTS (Undated) _ In recent years there has been a lot of
interest, not least from composers, in the artistic productions of
people who would have once been called mad. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   TEXACO-OPERA-QUIZ (Undated) _ A Favorite stump-the-panel segment
on the Texaco Opera Quiz during the Saturday afternoon radio
broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera is the ``singer ID.''
Recordings of, say, five unidentified tenors singing the same
phrase of a particular aria are played in a row, and the panelists
are asked to name them. It's amazing how difficult it can be to
recognize the voices of even famous tenors like Carlo Bergonzi or
Alfredo Kraus. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   EAGLEN/SCHAFER-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Singers are forever trying to
create inventive programs, balancing art songs with arias, serious
material with lighter fare, the familiar with the novel. On
records, the challenge is perhaps even greater than in the concert
hall, for the choices must stand the tests of time and repeated
listening. How gratifying, then, to encounter two new cleverly
assembled vocal disks. Ostensibly these albums are similar, each
featuring a rising soprano singing music by Mozart and Richard
Strauss. By David Mermelstein.
</P>

   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   PALMER-ROCK-FAME (Undated) _ When the Hall of Fame announces its
14th annual class of inductees this fall _ the selection process
began earlier this month _ it's a sure bet that Earl Palmer won't
be among them. Who? Though few people have heard of Palmer, this
73-year-old has had a greater impact on rock than many a Hall of
Fame shoo-in. By Tony Scherman.
</P>
<P>
   PULITZER-PRIZE-JAZZ (Undated) _ Trivia question: who was the
first jazz musician to win the Pulitzer Prize for music? Hint: it
wasn't Wynton Marsalis. The honor belongs to Mel Powell, who won in
1990 for a two-piano concerto called ``Duplicates.'' By Terry
Teachout.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   PA-LANCASTER-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ The Lancaster sanctuary is
getting smaller, thanks in part to the car that conveys you into a
part of the world that retained its serenity until the postwar
years. In the last three years, more than 1,000 acres of farmland
in Lancaster County have vanished. The car culture has gulped down
big chunks of a landscape long associated with the horse-drawn
carriage. Open land has been turned into sites for suburban
subdivisions, big-box discount outlets and strip malls. By Herbert
Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   NY-CITY-BALLET (New York) _ The New York City Ballet is 50 years
old this year. So let's rejoice. The company and its affiliated
School of American Ballet are remarkable institutions, and George
Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, their founders, are heroic
figures. By Jack Anderson.

CHINA EXPECTED TO GET `NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS' STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House is poised to vote today to maintain
normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China for the
19th consecutive year, despite recent controversies over the
transfer of satellite technology and illegal foreign campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of conservatives and liberals objects to the policy,
previously called ``most favored nation'' status, because of
China's human rights violations. However, the success of President
Clinton's recent trip to China has helped shore up support among
Democrats worried about labor unions and jobs, while Republican
leaders are backing the election-year issue favored by business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the president's trip, members are starting to really
believe that this is an important relationship,'' said
Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the top Democrat on
the House subcommittee on trade. ``The president's trip to China
demonstrated the importance of engaging the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the House voted 259-173 to renew trade relations with
China after an emotional debate that exposed deep divisions within
both parties, causing opponents to pick up 32 more votes than in
the previous year. But the political mood over the issue is more
positive this year, and supporters of a normal trade policy with
China are predicting a similar vote count.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have temporarily put aside their
concerns about allegations that the Chinese military might have
learned valuable information from US companies that used Chinese
rockets to boost satellites into space or that China may have
funneled illegal campaign contributions to the 1996 Democratic
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A potential violation of security guidelines is something
totally divorced from trade relations,'' said Representative Philip
Crane, an Ilinois Republican and chairman of the House trade
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Bernard Sanders, the independent from Vermont
who opposes trade relations with China on economic grounds, said,
``It is almost invariable that corporate interests and the big
money people get what they want.'' The former socialist mayor of
Burlington added, ``Corporate America is throwing American workers
out in the street and going to China where they can hire people for
25 cents an hour. They will fight like crazy to maintain that
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   American companies sell about $13 billion a year in goods and
services to China. China, however, sells $52 billion to the United
States, a figure that includes about 60 percent of all athletic
footwear and most of the inexpensive children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Cal Dooley, a California Democrat, said
Republican leaders were urging support of trade with China to
reassure the US Chamber of Commerce and other major business
interests that the GOP ``is still a voice for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Chamber of Commerce Tuesday released a report showing
that Connecticut and Massachusetts rank among the top 20 states
that export goods to China. The report, based on Commerce
Department data, ranks Connecticut 11th with $291 million in
exports, and Massachusetts is 17th with $159 million. Most of
Connecticut's exports are chemical products, industrial machines
and computers and paper products. The Massachusetts exports are
dominated by industrial machines and computers, electric and
electronic equipment, and scientific and measuring instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Workman, the international vice president for the US
Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the issue has spawned odd
coalitions. ``It is an issue that doesn't fall into neat
ideological patterns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Representative Nancy Pelosi, a liberal California
Democrat, appeared at a news conference Tuesday with Gary Bauer,
the president of the Family Research Council and one of the most
formidable figures on the Republican right, to denounce normal
trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, the
group of moderate Democrats, said, ``If the new left-right
protectionist crowd is successful, they could change the mix of
policies that has brought about one of the longest, most sustained
periods of non-inflationary economic growth in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping the issue this year is the substitution of the phrase
``normal trade relations'' instead of ``most favored nation.''
Supporters of trade relations with China added the name change to
the Internal Revenue Service bill that has passed Congress to make
it easier to explain that China would get the same treatment as
nearly every other nation.

HOUSE EXPECTED TO OVERRIDE VETO OF LATE-TERM ABORTION BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House is poised to override President Clinton's
veto of legislation to outlaw late-term abortions, but abortion
opponents in Congress acknowledged Tuesday they will fall short of
the votes they need in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a prime sponsor of the bill, said
he was confident the House would override the veto on Thursday,
adding that opponents of the so-called partial-birth abortion
procedure ``continue to face an uphill battle in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to a hard-core group in the Senate,'' most of whom
have signaled they won't be swayed, Canady said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said the chances of banning the late-term abortion
procedure will improve after the November elections, when new
senators take office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., an abortion foe, said the Senate
was shy of the two-thirds majority _ or 67 votes _ needed for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a few and converted a few but we're still three
votes short,'' Smith said. ``We'll wait as long as we can to try to
get more votes on this but now we're three votes short.''
</P>
<P>
   The late-term abortion procedure involves a physician pulling
the fetus out of the birth canal feet first, puncturing the back of
the head and removing the brain. That allows the skull to be
partially collapsed and removed from the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Canady's bill, sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., would subject physicians who perform the procedure to fines
and up to two years in prison. It also would allow the father of
the fetus and, if the case of a minor, the girl's parents to sue
the doctor. The only exception in the bill is if no other procedure
would save the woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the measure in May 1997, but the 64-36 vote
was three short of a veto-proof majority. In October, the House
approved the bill 296-132, a more than adequate margin to override
Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers of Congress have approved the measure twice, and
Clinton has vetoed it twice, most recently in October.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch predicted the
Senate would fail this fall to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to get that in my opinion,'' Hatch, R-Utah,
said. ``It's become too political.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., a presidential aspirant and abortion
opponent, called the procedure ``barbaric,'' but said he didn't
know of any senators who are prepared to change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Late-term abortion refers to a procedure that occurs in the
final three months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime abortion-rights crusader Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said
the congressional push on this issue has more to do with politics
than with banning the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey said the House vote Thursday and the Senate vote this fall
are designed to maximize the political impact as elections
approach. Many polls have shown Americans strongly oppose the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a woman's choice,'' Lowey said. ``I don't think we should
be making these decisions in the Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowey said making contraception more widely available would curb
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey succeeded this week in adding an amendment to a Treasury
Department spending bill that would require all federal health care
plans to offer full prescription contraceptive coverage to
government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than calling for a sweeping ban on abortion, opponents
have focused on narrowly tailored measures such as late-term
abortion and parental consent laws because they play to a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Last week abortion foes made headway when the House voted
276-150 to approve a bill which would criminalize the act of
transporting a minor across state lines for an abortion to evade a
state's parental consent law. That measure was approved by the
Senate Judiciary Committee this month, but still must be approved
by the full Senate.

PUSH FOR CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE HEATS UP IN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
 By NICOLE TSONG
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine and Harry Reid,
D-Nev., stepped up their legislative efforts Tuesday to compel
private health insurers to cover prescription contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, according to one of their aides, said they plan to
attach their measure as an amendment to a bill funding the Labor
and Health and Human Services departments. That would move the
measure quickly to the Senate floor for a vote, according to
Adrienne Biggert, an assistant to Snowe.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowe-Reid proposal, which has stalled since it was
introduced last year, would require insurers that already cover
prescription drugs to cover as well the prescription contraceptives
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing optional about contraception,'' Snowe told
the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. ``It is a
medical necessity for women during 30 years of their lifespan.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid added that ``if people don't want to use the
contraceptives, they don't have to,'' but he argued that they
should ``have the ability if they so desire.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of private health care plans that cover prescription
drugs do not cover any form of contraception. Fifteen percent of
the plans cover all five of the most effective methods of pregnancy
prevention _ birth control pills, Depo-Provera, Norplant, the
inter-uterine device (IUD) and the diaphragm. The remaining plans
cover birth control pills only.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowe-Reid measure would require coverage of all five forms
of contraception.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman who doesn't use contraception is 15 times more likely
to become pregnant than women who do,'' Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of contraceptive devices would cut health care costs
significantly, she added.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Family Planning and Reproductive
Health Association, a Washington-based advocacy group, a year's
supply of oral contraceptives costs about $300 a year and an
uncomplicated pregnancy costs $3,368.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to covering pregnancies, some health plans cover
sterilization and abortion. According to Snowe, 86 percent of large
group plans cover sterilization, and 66 percent cover abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider that ... both of these surgical procedures are more
expensive than a full year's supply of oral contraceptives,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all the pregnancies in the United States,
approximately 3.6 million, are unintended, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The use of birth
control lowers the likelihood of abortion by 85 percent because of
the reduction in unwanted pregnancies, according to the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and public
policy organization.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved the birth control pill almost 40 years ago,
said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, the nation's
largest reproductive health care organization. However, she added,
``the exclusion from insurance coverage of this basic need in
women's health care has gone largely unquestioned ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For some women with serious medical conditions, controlling
their fertility is a matter of life or death,'' said Richard
Schwarz of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
a Washington-based group of over 38,000 women's health physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance
Association of America, a Washington-based lobbying group that
represents more than 250 insurers, testified that the Snowe-Reid
measure would drive up the cost of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He said his association opposes any mandates on health
insurance. ``It's not whether coverage exists; it's whether
employers and consumers should be compelled to purchase it,'' he
said.

MENEM ENDS BID FOR THIRD TERM AS ARGENTINA'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Facing a virtual rebellion within his
party, President Carlos Saul Menem announced Tuesday that he was
ending his bid for an unprecedented third term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's surprise announcement came less than a week after he
declared that he would run for re-election despite wording in an
amendment to the 1994 Constitution that specifically prohibited him
from running a third time.
</P>
<P>
   He won the backing of a convention of the governing Justicialist
Party last Friday, but hundreds of delegates boycotted the event
and many of the party's top leaders warned him privately that they
could not support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president will leave office without fail on Dec. 10,
1999,'' Menem announced without emotion after meeting with
governors from his party at his residence. He said he hoped future
presidents from his party ``will continue our revolution to
transform Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   The race for the presidency is now wide open, with hard-fought
primary battles almost a certainty in both the Justicialist Party,
which was founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, and the Alliance, a
coalition of two center-left parties. But few political analysts
believe the ultimate winner in next October's election will veer
away from Menem's free-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine leader, whose bushy sideburns, taste for flashy
sport cars and impish sense of humor delighted the country in his
first years in office, succeeded in reordering his nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   He took growth rates to historic levels and cut the inflation
rate from nearly 5,000 percent the day he took office in 1989 to a
current rate of just over 1 percent. His success followed the sale
of huge chunks of government-owned enterprises to private and
foreign concerns and a pegging of the value of the peso to the
American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But after winning election in 1989 and re-election in 1995,
Menem seemed to lose his magic. An unemployment rate of more than
13 percent and nearly daily news reports of corruption in his
government led to an opposition victory in congressional elections
last October. The president's popularity sank along with his
party's, and fewer than 20 percent of the people in recent polls
said they supported his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires Province, Menem's main
opponent for his party's nomination, had called for a September
plebiscite in the province on the question of the president's
re-election. While the plebiscite would be technically nonbinding,
most political analysts said Menem would have lost it in an
embarrassing landslide.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, would probably have led to a decisive defeat in
the party's presidential primary next April and left Menem's
government virtually impotent as it struggles to dull the economic
impact of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, press reports suggested that members of the Peronist
bloc on the Supreme Court were resisting attempts by the
president's allies to persuade them to interpret the Constitution
in a way that would have allowed Menem's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution includes a clause banning a second consecutive
presidential re-election. A grandfather clause amendment that
specifically excluded Menem from seeking a third term was added to
the document since the Constitution was written after his first
election.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition had threatened that they would move to
impeach any judges who backed Menem's bid, a threat that could have
become immediate had congressmen and senators in the Duhalde camp
joined the impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The route he was embarked on was a dead end,'' said Felipe
Noguera, an independent political analyst and pollster. ``By doing
this he avoids an embarrassing defeat, and avoids becoming a lame
duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Menem's choice for the nomination is Social Welfare Minister
Ramon Ortega, a former pop singer with strong support in the rural
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``From today on, I am a candidate,'' Ortega told reporters soon
after Menem's announcement. ``I am confident I will win the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortega is running head to head in the polls against Duhalde,
whose support is strongest around Buenos Aires. The two are
expected to compete hard for the party's labor base with populist
language that could frighten investors, but neither is expected to
reverse Menem's privatization policies.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, the polls favor the two candidates
competing for the nomination of the Alliance. The two, Graciela
Fernandez Meijide, a member of Congress from Buenos Aires Province,
and the mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, expressed glee
over Menem's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion has prevailed,'' De la Rua said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president came to his senses,'' Ms. Fernandez Meijide
said. However, she cautioned supporters that Menem had said he was
not a candidate before and then changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Menem's announcement seemed to leave no wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided,'' he said, ``to exclude myself from any type
of action that would allow me to compete in 1999.'' &QL;

SECRET SERVICE AGENTS APPEAR BEFORE LEWINSKY JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-STARR-LEAKS) 
(bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors summoned several uniformed Secret
Service officers before the grand jury here Tuesday as Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr tries to piece together what they knew about
Monica Lewinsky's visits to the White House last December before
her relationship with President Clinton was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's questions go beyond whether Ms. Lewinsky, a
24-year-old former White House intern, and the president had met
alone in the Oval Office or elsewhere in the White House, lawyers
familiar with the inquiry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is focusing on events in December and January, when the
employees closest to the president _ Secret Service officers and
agents _ might have seen, or more importantly, overheard matters
involving Ms. Lewinsky. At the time, she faced the prospect of
testifying in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against
Clinton. Ms. Lewinsky had expressed those fears to her friend,
Linda Tripp, and to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutors are generally interested in very specific
things _ the people present at certain meetings on certain dates,''
said Michael Leibig, a lawyer for four of the uniformed officers
subpoenaed to testify. Those four were at the courthouse Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the specifics sought would be used to try to corroborate
what other witnesses have told the grand jury; the Secret Service
has insisted that its employees saw nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing his focus to one particular date, Starr wants to know
what uniformed officers might have heard on Dec. 28, the last day
that records show Ms. Lewinsky had visited the White House, lawyers
said. According to those familiar with the inquiry, Ms. Lewinsky
saw Clinton and his personal secretary, Betty Currie, on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe the meeting is a critical event in their
investigation into whether Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky or others
obstructed justice, committed perjury or tampered with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky arrived at the White House that day, she
briefly chatted with Mrs. Currie just outside the Oval Office
before talking with Clinton, possibly within earshot of a uniformed
officer, according to lawyers familiar with the questions asked of
the Secret Service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In statements given to Starr's office, Ms. Lewinsky said she
returned several gifts in December that the president had given her
after lawyers for Mrs. Jones had subpoenaed them. In that proffer
of what she was willing to tell the Starr legal team, Ms. Lewinsky
said that Clinton told her that she would not have to produce any
gifts he had given her if they were not in her possession,
according to those familiar with the language of the proffer. One
of the key questions that Starr's prosecutors are trying to answer
is whether Mrs. Currie accepted the gifts on her own, at the
request of Ms. Lewinsky or under orders from the president or
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse Tuesday, Leibig, the lawyer for the four
uniformed officers, told reporters that several officers were on
duty Dec. 28 and that ``some of them knew about'' the meeting
between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr has a set of facts that he has from other witnesses
and he's trying to confirm those facts,'' Leibig said Tuesday. But
he added: ``I don't think any of them have seen any evidence of a
crime. I don't think they saw the president in an embarrassing,
compromising or off-color situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky have testified under oath that
they did not have a sexual relationship. The president has also
said that he did not encourage anyone to lie. In his deposition in
the Jones case, Clinton acknowledged having several meetings with
Ms. Lewinsky at the White House. But he said he was not alone with
her, except perhaps for brief moments when she delivered some
papers.
</P>
<P>
   But one lawyer familiar with the inquiry said that he believes
two Secret Service officers have told investigators that they had
seen the president and Ms. Lewinsky enter a room together alone. It
is not known whether the officers said they saw them enter the Oval
Office or the president's private study, a small room adjacent to
the Oval Office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the same time that uniformed officers filed out of a minivan
outside the courthouse Tuesday morning and went to the third floor
grand jury room, lawyers for the president, Ms. Lewinsky and the
independent counsel's office gathered on the federal courthouse's
fifth floor to argue before a federal appeals court. The issue was
related to a February complaint by the president's lawyers that
Starr had illegally leaked sensitive grand jury information to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's whirlwind day of activity signaled that the six-month
inquiry's pace has dramatically escalated since Supreme Court Chief
Justice William Rehnquist refused to block Secret Service agents
from testifying before the grand jury last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven current and former officers are under subpoena to testify
this week. Instead of meeting just two days this week, the grand
jury is scheduled to meet three days, adding a full-day session
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cockell, the chief of the president's security detail who
asked to be reassigned last week, did not testify Tuesday, nor did
Ms. Tripp or Mrs. Currie, both of whom are expected to return to
the grand jury room for further testimony. Cockell is expected to
testify for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers familiar with interviews conducted with
some of the agents and officers, Starr's prosecutors are most
interested in corroborating some details given to them by other
witnesses. But they are also hopeful that the officers and agents
will fill in key details about important events.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have also asked questions about White House
meetings in January when the president's close friend, Vernon
Jordan, was working to find Ms. Lewinsky a job. And, lawyers said,
they have asked officers about meetings held at the White House in
the days after Ms. Lewinsky signed an affidavit swearing that she
had not had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll by The New York Times/CBS News shows that a
majority of the American public say it is inappropriate for Starr
to force Secret Service personnel to testify about what they have
seen or heard while protecting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Only 36 percent in the nationwide telephone poll said making the
agents testify was appropriate, while 58 percent said it was
inappropriate. The poll, conducted Sunday and Monday with 567
adults, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The public was split on whether Secret Service agents actually
know anything that could be used against against Clinton. Forty-two
percent said they thought the agents do have such knowledge, 31
percent said they do not, and another 27 percent said they did not
know.

HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO REJECT ATTEMPT TO END CHINA'S TRADE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: CORRECTS spelling of massacre and Tiananmen in 16th graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite heavy criticism of China's human rights
policies, the House is expected Wednesday to reject an attempt to
overturn President Clinton's renewal of normal trade relations with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton granted the renewal in June, and under the law, Congress
can override his decision if both houses pass a resolution within
90 days.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Wednesday's vote, opponents of the renewal,
which range from labor unions to the conservative Family Research
Council, acknowledged that they had little hope of winning.
However, they said the debate remains their best opportunity to
publicize Beijing's restrictive trade and oppressive human rights
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take away MFN status from China _ we know
that,'' Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said at a news conference,
referring to the old term for trade with ``most favored nations.''
That term has now been changed to ``normal trade relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf added that the fight over the issue provides ``our best
chance to vote our conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said this year's vote ``was almost
a foregone conclusion, but that shouldn't stop people from speaking
out against a policy that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing China's current status is a sure bet because many
House members realize that their districts need free trade with
that nation, according to Casimir Yost, an expert on U.S.-China
relations at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a
Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers, who have already been hurt by the Asian financial
crisis, are saying, `Don't mess with our exports,''' Yost said.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's debate, many pro-trade lawmakers cited their
hometown companies' business with China. Earlier this year, Rep.
Jim McDermott, D-Wash., whose district includes the Seattle-based
Boeing Co., a top U.S. exporter to China, said, ``The people of my
district and many others rely on exports for their jobs, and that
must not be forgotten in this debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional debate over China's status routinely provokes
emotional speeches over how the United States should handle the
country that many experts feel will be America's chief military and
economic rival in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Trade opponents contend the United States should refuse to allow
normal access to American markets to a totalitarian government that
continues to block many democratic reforms and to keep U.S.
businesses out of many Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
   They also point to a growing U.S.-China trade deficit that is
expected to swell to $50 billion this year _ up from $40 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But China-trade supporters argue that China _ with 1.2 billion
people and one of the world's fastest growing economies _ is simply
too big to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   They say the best way to promote political reforms in China is
to increase its contact with the outside world by promoting trade
and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also point out that only six countries _ Afghanistan,
Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam and Yugoslavia _ don't have normal
trade relations with the United States, and they say that renewing
China's status would not give it special privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heated rhetoric, for the last nine years opponents
have been unable to overturn the trade renewal _ even after
Beijing's brutal massacre of hundreds of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House defeated legislation to end China's trade
status by a vote of 259 to 173, although the minority vote
represented the highest total since 1992, when Congress passed
limits on Beijing's trade privileges but failed to override a veto
by President George Bush. The Senate did not vote on China's trade
status last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the House debate promises a few new twists.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's visit to China from June 25 to July 3 has
heightened interest in that country and its policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the House passed, 390 to 1, a non-binding
measure that reaffirmed America's commitment to Taiwan and its
people. The bill was a reaction to remarks made by Clinton during
his China trip that the United States would not support
independence for Taiwan or its membership in international
organizations. The Senate already had passed a similar pro-Taiwan
measure 92-0.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Justice Department continues to investigate
allegations that China tried to influence the 1996 elections by
funneling illegal donations into Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, congressional committees are probing questions about
whether the White House was influenced by Democratic donor Bernard
Schwartz in allowing U.S. aerospace firms, including Schwartz's New
York-based Loral Corp., to launch their satellites aboard Chinese
rockets.

 &HT;    Hamilton shooting for the top
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LANIER ISLANDS, Ga. _ Halfway through last season, Georgia
Tech's Joe Hamilton was sweating out his job as the No. 1
quarterback. With this season still more than six weeks away,
Hamilton has left the worrying up to his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes in coach George O'Leary's office followed by five
games of proving he makes the difference for Georgia Tech have put
Hamilton in the position not only to be at the top of his team but
also his conference.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this decade, that honor has been owned by Florida
State. Charlie Ward, Danny Kanell and Thad Busby have been named
first-team All-ACC quarterback five out of the six seasons they've
played in the conference. But this year the Seminoles are turning
to a soon-to-be 26-year-old Chris Weinke, who spent almost seven
years playing minor league baseball before coming to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   FSU coach Bobby Bowden gushes about his quarterback, his
physical gifts and his maturity, but the conference's
top-quarterback label is clearly up for grabs for players such as
Hamilton, Wake Forest's Brian Kuklick, North Carolina State's Jamie
Barnette and North Carolina's Oscar Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's name kept popping up in discussions at the ACC
football meetings Monday and Tuesday. Especially in conversations
by the coaches and players who faced him in the last half of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a different level (than other ACC quarterbacks),''
said Anthony Poindexter, the Virginia safety who opted for his
senior year over the NFL. ``He's almost like a running back. Scouts
won't look at him as an NFL quarterback, but he gives defenses a
lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton burned Virginia for 368 yards of total offense last
year, the third-best single-game production in Georgia Tech
history. He passed for 337 yards, hitting on 21 of 26 attempts, but
it's his mobility that bothers Virginia defensive coordinator Rick
Lantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey Hamilton can pull the ball down,'' Lantz said. ``The guys
who can pull the ball down and make big plays and avoid a sack and
make something happen, those guys are frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton didn't turn his season around until after Tech's 16-13
loss to North Carolina, but the Tar Heels' first-year coach Carl
Torbush still had plenty nice to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what you're looking for at quarterback,'' Torbush said.
``He's not just an athlete or a good quarterback, he's a good
leader. We've done a pretty good job of containing him, but every
year we play them we're worried because he's something special.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, O'Leary wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had just completed his first full season as a starter.
As a redshirt freshman, he'd thrown seven touchdowns compared to 13
interceptions and passed for only 134 yards a game as the Jackets
slumped from 6-5 in 1995 to 5-6 in 1996. Hamilton, who is heading
into his junior season, was also facing the challenge of learning a
new offense under Ralph Friedgen, who had just returned to Tech as
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if Joe was going to be able to be the leader
that we wanted at that position,'' O'Leary said. ``(Now) there's no
question he is. He's always been a good athlete that could play
quarterback, now he's a quarterback that's a hell of an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, O'Leary thought Hamilton was trying to do too much
and told him so in a midseason meeting. If Hamilton didn't find a
way to get more help from the players around him and play within
Tech's offense, O'Leary would bench him.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton responded by piling up 1,369 yards of offense during
the last four regular-season games, bringing his season total to
2,792, a school record. In that span he completed 71 percent of his
passes (79 of 111) for 1,172 yards and seven touchdowns. ``In the
last five games he played as well as anybody in the country at that
position,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton finished second in the ACC in total offense behind
Busby with 253 yards a game. He was third in passing efficiency
behind Virginia's Aaron Brooks and Busby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure put on Joe,'' Georgia Tech running
back Charles Wiley said. ``He was a young guy without much
experience. With the way he was able to finish the season, he
showed us all. ... You could see the confidence. He began to take
control. You could hear it in his voice.'' Hamilton has lost his
top receivers, but he returns with his backfield and offensive line
intact. He also has respect from the ACC, including FSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Charlie Ward,'' Bowden said. ``To me he just
gets better and better.''

 &HT;    On deck: Philadelphia Phillies
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight and Thursday at 7:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Veterans Stadium, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South will televise tonight's game;
Thursday, WUPA. Both games will be broadcast on 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight: LHP Tom Glavine (13-4, 2.71
ERA; 15-6, 3.45 lifetime against Phillies) vs. RHP Carlton Loewer
(4-2, 6.34 ERA; first appearance vs. Braves). Thursday: RHP Kevin
Millwood (10-5, 4.30; 2-0, 1.80 lifetime vs. Phillies) vs. RHP
Tyler Green (6-6, 4.71; 3-0, 3.12 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: The Braves lead the overall series 221-184 and
haven't lost the season series since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves took two of three from the Phillies in
Atlanta in early April, but later in the month dropped three of
four in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies leaders: Avg _ Doug Glanville (.316); HR _ Scott Rolen
(18); RBIs _ Rico Brogna (69); SB _ Glanville (17); ERA _ Yorkis
Perez (2.81); K - Curt Schilling (198); Saves _ Mark Leiter (20).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Phillies went into Tuesday's game having won 10 of
their last 14 and are just three games out of the wild-card
spot.... Rickey Bottalico is still not ready to take over the
closer role, remaining in a set-up spot. ... The Phillies are
shopping interim closer Mark Leiter. ... Shortstop Desi Relaford
has been moved to the No. 2 spot in the order. ... Loewer's record
is not indicative of how he has pitched. The rookie allowed 47 hits
in 44 innings and 31 earned runs. But the 24-year-old first-round
draft pick from Mississippi State in 1994 throws as hard as anyone,
his fastball reaching 95 mph, and his changeup can be tough to hit.
He does have problems dealing with adversity and at times will hang
a pitch. He has allowed seven homers in the few innings he has
pitched. Teams are hitting .281 against him.
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Glanville, the center fielder and leadoff hitter, has
been a great addition to the Phillies, his on-base percentage at
.354.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: The Phillies want more power production from catcher
Mike Lieberthal, who has eight homers and 45 RBIs.

   Hoch's Hecklers
</P>
<P>
   American Scott Hoch's appearance at the British Open came at the
request of Yonex, his sponsor. The next one might be more of a
struggle. Never thrilled with typically cold British Open weather,
Hoch was heckled by fans Friday on his way to missing the cut.
``Hoch, like the weather now?'' one asked. Another yelled, ``We
don't want you.'' Said Hoch, ``I've never tried to make myself the
most popular guy in the world, but I still do not believe anyone
should be subjected to what I had to go through out there. At times
what they said was pretty upsetting.''

   Senior Open
</P>
<P>
   John Bland, who finished second behind Graham Marsh in the 1997
U.S. Senior Open, withdrew from this year's tournament Tuesday
because his wife is ill. He returned to his home in South Africa.
The 19th U.S. Senior Open begins Thursday at the 6,906-yard, par-71
Riviera Country Club. A purse of $1.5 million and a top prize of
$267,500 are being offered. Chip Shots
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo's deal with Adams Golf, according to reports in
Britain, will pay him $16.65 million, plus a guaranteed minimum of
$1.6 million in 1999, increasing to $4.25 million between 2004 and
2008. Faldo reportedly owns 900,000 shares of Adams Golf stock. ...
While Britain was anointing Justin Rose, the 17-year-old amateur
who will turn pro this week, it forgot to beat up quite as heavily
on Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who missed the cut. The British
tabloids are merciless with their treatment of Montgomerie. If
there's a photo depicting Monty in a unflattering pose, they will
find it. Outside of the Royal Family, nobody gets ripped worse. ...
Royal Birkdale's nasty sixth hole, a 480-yard par 4that never plays
like one, played to 4.62 strokes for the tournament.

 &HT;    O'Meara enjoys late rush
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Something odd is happening in golf's major
championships. The time warp has gathered in both extremes. While
some of its ascending stars might actually buy a Hansons CD, let's
leave a place in line for the Jimmy Buffett guy.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of time for Tiger Woods, Justin Rose, Se Ri Pak,
Jenny Chuasiriporn and Matt Kuchar.
</P>
<P>
   Hold up on the Clearisil. Don't forget about the Rogaine. This
is Mark O'Meara's moment.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years of trying to rationalize that his U.S. Amateur
victory in 1979 was truly a major championship, in three months
Mark O'Meara has produced two major wins of undeniable worth. Who
cares if he's 41? He's got the Half Grand Slam with wins at the
Masters and British Open and he's the oldest player in the modern
era to capture two majors in a season _ the first American to do so
since Tom Watson in 1982. Plus, O'Meara has every chance in the
universe to be favored when the PGA Championship arrives at Sahalee
Country Club near Seattle next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf ball sitting on the ground doesn't know how old you
are,'' O'Meara said Sunday in the glare of the Claret Jug. ``It
doesn't know if you're 41 or 50 or 22 or 17. It kind of just sits
there, kind of waiting to get hit. Granted, I don't hit it as long
as some of the young players, but once in a while I wield a pretty
wicked putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting, isn't it? The guy who was supposed to show Tiger
Woods the ropes has climbed between them and recorded two
knockouts. Woods has raised everyone's game and nobody's more so
than his close friend, O'Meara. Or, as Tiger calls him, ``Mark O.''
In their private matches at Isleworth Country Club in Orlando or in
practice rounds on the PGA Tour, there have been equal trade-offs.
O'Meara seems to have helped Woods with his off-the-course
behavior, showing him the value of cooperating with the media and
tuning in with the fans. In turn, Woods' game has pushed O'Meara's
to its career maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our relationship has been good for both sides,''
O'Meara said Sunday. ``I admire Tiger Woods tremendously. I think
he has been a tremendous asset to the game. Our friendship is a
unique one. If I can help Tiger _ if he can confide in me if he has
problems or difficulties with certain areas _ I'm more than happy
with that. For me, he has been a driving force. For me to go out
and play with such a talented player who has really taken the game
to another level, he has helped everybody work on their games. For
me, I've used that to my advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot away from joining the O'Meara-Brian Watts playoff
Sunday night, Woods spoke in the media center while his buddy
prepared to secure his second major. On Monday, O'Meara hitched a
ride back to Orlando on Tiger's leased jet. That they shared a
drink from the Jug was the evening's foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to make the putts,'' Woods said, having
seen a few that took money from his pocket at Isleworth. ``Look at
the Masters this year. You know the guy is capable of gutting it
out and winning major championships.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's recent success, however, will not affect their
friendly rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No shots,'' O'Meara grinned. ``No shots for Tiger. Not when he
hits it 60 yards by me on every hole.''

   United Airlines is offering tickets that combine air travel
between three of its U.S. gateways and Paris with fast train
service between Paris and Lyon, France.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which offers nonstop service from Chicago, San
Francisco and Washington (Dulles International Airport) to Paris'
Charles de Gaulle Airport, is timing its flights to connect to
SNCF-French Rail's high-speed TGV train service from the airport to
Lyon; the flights connect to four daily southbound trips and three
daily northbound trips to and from Lyon, a major center for
business in France.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United, a unit of UAL Corp., said
that prices for the combined airplane-rail tickets were competitive
with those for one-stop air travel, through Paris, between the
three U.S. cities and Lyon. United passengers who take the TGV earn
500 miles in the carrier's frequent-flier program for each
round-trip rail trip and 250 miles for each one-way rail trip
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   To make the connection between United's flights and the TGV,
travelers must take a short bus ride to the train station, which is
located at the airport. Molinaro said that later this year
travelers would be able to use a new tram service at Charles de
Gaulle to make the transfer.
</P>

   Corporate VAT Management, a software company based in Seattle,
has introduced a new version of its software that helps businesses
reclaim value-added tax from 15 European countries and Canada for
expenses incurred for telecommunications charges and conference
show fees, among other items.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier version of Corporate VAT's software helped businesses
recover VAT for travel and entertainment expenses. The new version
is designed to reclaim VAT for these expenses, as well as for
expenses incurred for telecommunications charges, legal and other
professional fees, trade show and conference costs, and purchases
of equipment and product samples.
</P>
<P>
   The software costs $995 to license annually.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   Marriott International is putting self-service business centers,
jointly operated by Mail Boxes Etc. and USA Technologies, into 13
of its U.S. hotels. The centers, which are activated by credit card
and available 24 hours a day, provide access to a personal computer
with Internet and e-mail, a laser printer, fax and photocopier.
Centers are currently located in the lobbies of full-service
Marriott hotels in cities like Atlanta, Baltimore and Scottsdale,
Ariz. The company expects to open another 20 by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Two hotel companies have set discounted rates for European stays
through the end of August. Libertel Hotels, a chain of 35
boutique-style hotels in Paris owned by a subsidiary of Vivendi, is
offering savings of up to $139 a night, depending on the hotel. For
example, one night at its two-star hotels is priced at $63,
compared to a regular rate of $100. The Westin Demeure Hotels, a
chain of eight luxury hotels in Paris; Amsterdam, Netherlands;
Geneva, and London that is affiliated with Westin Hotels and
Resorts, a unit of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, is cutting rates
from 14 percent to 30 percent, depending on location.

BONDS UP SHARPLY ON SUGGESTION OF SLOWING ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GREENSPAN-NYT, MARKET-NYT) 
(rl) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury bonds rose sharply Tuesday after
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested the Asian
crisis was slowing the economy, reinforcing expectations that
interest rates will remain steady.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year bond increased 23/32, to 106 20/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
dropped to 5.66 percent from 5.71 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In his twice-yearly appearance before Congress, the Fed chairman
dampened speculation that the central bank might lower short-term
interest rates soon. But bond traders said he also appeared to
reaffirm the Fed's cautious approach, suggesting no change in
policy. Many had expected Greenspan would not signal any change
because of the financial crisis in Asia and expectations that it
would slow growth in the second half of this year, offsetting the
effect of a strong labor market and rising consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Brien, a trader for First Continental Trading in Chicago,
said there was a little something for everyone in Tuesday's
testimony but that it was clearly interpreted as a positive sign
for bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Greenspan has commented several times in the past that
the economy is in a virtuous cycle, and today so are the bonds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been watching the market movement of the past few days,
and it is clear to me that the market has taken some direction from
Greenspan's testimony today,'' Brien added.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan spoke to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. He
will conclude his testimony before the House Banking Committee
Wednesday.

   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Tuesday to provide $98 million for
the National Endowment for the Arts next year, turning aside
warnings from opponents that the agency will continue to fund what
they called ``obscene'' and ``sickening'' works that offend many
conservative and Christian taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In a bipartisan show of support, members voted 253-173 to
restore the funding, which had been stripped out of the 1999
Interior Department spending bill before it reached the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing to restore the funding, Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.,
told her colleagues that ``man does not live by bread alone.'' She
cited ways she said the NEA had helped enrich communities by
funding local writers, artists, theater groups and symphony
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters, led by Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., also noted
changes the agency had adopted, including adding members of
Congress to its board to help guarantee that NEA grants are
dispensed in what one member called ``a more appropriate manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no more (Robert) Maplethorpes,'' declared House
Interior Committee Chairman Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, in a reference to
an exhibit by the famous photographer that was supported in part by
a 1994 NEA grant despite claims that some of his photographs were
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Regula said regulations are now in place at the NEA to help
``control'' the disbursement of grants to artists whose works may
be considered obscene or pornographic. Regula's argument on behalf
of what one supporter called ``the new and improved NEA'' helped
win over some members who last year voted in favor of eliminating
the arts agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now think that we should give the NEA a chance to work under
new guidelines and mandates of law that now govern the agency,''
said Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., one of many social and fiscal
conservatives who led an uprising in the House a year ago to kill
NEA funding.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House then was 217-216 against funding the NEA,
but the agency was kept alive in the Senate, where a bipartisan
group of lawmakers refused to end federal support for it.
</P>
<P>
   The assurances of NEA changes, however, did not quell concerns
among hard-line opponents of federal arts funding. Some of them
continued to insist that the federal government should not be in
the business of subsidizing what Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., called
``sickening'' and ``blasphemous'' art works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with these reforms we still have a bad NEA in place,''
added House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a leading advocate of
killing off the arts agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fiscally responsible to give taxpayer dollars to some
artists who produce art that offends many of the taxpayers?'' DeLay
asked his colleagues during the debate. ``The federal government
has no business in an agency like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although funding for the NEA was never really in doubt this
year, social and Christian conservatives had demanded that
Republican leaders try again to eliminate it. Ending arts funding
was listed as a priority legislative item at a ``values summit''
DeLay and other GOP leaders held with conservative and Christian
leaders in May.

COMMENTARY: LOTT'S LESBIAN ALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest volley in the escalating, Trent Lott-inspired
culture war against gay Americans, 15 religious-right organizations
have co-sponsored full-page ads in national newspapers, The New
York Times included, to promote the idea that Christian ``hope and
healing'' can rid homosexuals of their sinful ways. The human face
for this campaign is Anne Paulk, billed as ``wife, mother, former
lesbian,'' but a far more credible poster boy would be Marshall
Applewhite, the departed guru of Heaven's Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paulk represents Exodus International, an association of
``ex-gay'' ministries and agencies that purport to ``change'' gay
people into straight. Yet the ads don't mention that two Exodus
co-founders, Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper, not only failed to
``change'' but fell in love and exited Exodus to start a family
they consecrated with a marriage ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus' unscientific boasts of ``success'' in general must be
taken on faith, and even Ms. Paulk's status as a ``former lesbian''
has been questioned by Margaret Carlson in this week's Time
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But of Applewhite's ``change,'' at least, there can be no doubt:
with castration and suicide, he did successfully rid himself and
some of his co-religionists of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Short of Applewhite's final solution, there is no sound research
to suggest that a homosexual can be transformed into a heterosexual
_ were that even a desired goal _ any more than a heterosexual can
be turned gay. ``What really happens is a suppression process,''
says Doug Upchurch, 30, a computer trade-association executive in
Austin, Texas, who spent 12 years being ``cured'' by ex-gay
ministries and now proselytizes against them on the Web
(members.aol.com/exexgay).
</P>
<P>
   Though Upchurch had girlfriends and ``had experiences with the
girlfriends physically,'' he couldn't change his sexual orientation
and eventually realized he didn't want to. He now lives happily
with a male partner.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality is not a disease and needs no ``cure.'' For all
the tough-love sentiments, the real agenda of this $200,000
Christian Coalition-Family Research Council media blitz is not to
heal but to divide Americans for political advantage. By pushing
the false premise that homosexuality is not an innate human
condition but a sinful choice that can be reversed through prayer
and counseling, the ad's sponsors are putting it in the same
category as kleptomania and alcoholism, much as did Lott (whose
name is invoked in the ads).
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's only a small step to the argument that gay
Americans who refuse to change are no more entitled to civil-rights
protections than thieves are. The false premise that homosexuality
is a choice also facilitates the ads' promotion of such gay-bashing
canards as ``homosexual recruitment in public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-ex-gay man I spoke to, Michael Seiler, points out the
damage the ads' hype of ex-gay ministries, often amplified by
unskeptical news coverage, can inflict on the vulnerable. In the
1980s Seiler, then in his 20s, was a ``poster boy'' for Desert
Stream, a California ex-gay ministry; now, via a long route that
included the Yale Divinity School, he is an Episcopal priest at St.
Mark's Church in Philadelphia. He says that ``not one'' of his
circle at Desert Stream has changed sexual orientation, but that
the other fallout was severe. By insidiously preaching to gay
people that ``their relationship with God isn't working'' if they
can't ``change,'' ex-gay ministries ``destroy faith and often
destroy lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a ``priest and pastor who picks up the pieces,''
Seiler calls this ``outrageous spiritual malpractice'' and says
that ``it's despicable that this message is going out in the name
of Christ.'' He also mocks the unproven high ``cure'' rates _ 40
percent _ tossed around by Exodus affiliates. ``What does that mean
_ that someone has not had sex with someone of the same sex for the
last three months? That's not a real high bar.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lott and the other congressional leaders, Dick Armey and Tom
DeLay, who share his views really want to prove that all gay people
should and can turn straight, why don't they begin the experiment
at home, by ``healing'' their own party?
</P>
<P>
   They could enlist high-profile gay Republicans, like Rep. Jim
Kolbe and D'Amato-Pataki political strategist Arthur Finkelstein,
in ex-gay ministries, along with gay Capitol Hill staffers, then
publicize the results.
</P>
<P>
   The operators at the 800 number in the ads are standing by for
their call.

PLANNED AUCTION OF METEORITE FOUND BY BOYS CREATES BIG STIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was supposed to be the happy ending for the seven Monahans,
Texas, schoolboys who took on City Hall for the return of a
foot-shaped meteorite that fell out of the West Texas sky as they
played basketball in March.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend's Internet auction of the 2.2-pound rock _ with
the boys' hearty approval _ has triggered a firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA scientist who analyzed the meteorite angrily asserts that
it is being poorly stored and may already have lost its rare purple
salt crystals, which the boys' representative denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment of Earth is very hostile to salt grains,''
said Everett Gibson, a Houston-based geochemist who was upset that
one of the boys was photographed by People magazine holding aloft
the exposed meteorite. ``It's disappointing that greed has taken
this to levels never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Established auctioneers questioned the ethics of the offering by
naturalhistoryauction.com, an Ithaca, N.Y.-based firm whose owner
has announced that he will be bidding for the rock himself and
personally guaranteed a $20,000 floor price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a casino where the croupier is placing bets,'' said
David Herskowitz, of the San Francisco auction house Butterfield
Butterfield &AMP; Dunning's. ``Would you go to that casino?''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Pitt, a consultant with Phillips Fine Arts Auctioneers of
New York, said: ``It's highly unusual and creates the impression of
impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   And a swarm of private meteorite collectors and dealers are
fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are words summing up my feelings: frustration,
disappointment, horror,'' said Mark Lerner, a Wall Street
investment banker and meteorite collector.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Farmer, a meteorite dealer from Tucson, Ariz., said: ``I'm
interested in buying it and I have the money, but I won't be faxing
any bids. It's a tremendous conflict of interest. How can you have
a fair auction when it's run from the house of a person who has
said he'll be bidding?''
</P>
<P>
   Bidding starts at 5 p.m. Friday. Auctioneer Michael Casper has
promised to pay the seven boys $20,000 if bids go no higher. The
last bid will be taken at 11 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Casper said his attorneys told him it is legal for him to bid as
long as the other participants are aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do what's in the best interests of the kids that
will bring the most money,'' he said. ``It is an unusual item that
is in a collectible category. It could go for $20,000. It could go
for $100,000. Scientifically, there's a limit to its value. But
when it comes to the end collector, I've seen a meteorite worth
only $10,000 go for $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Arnold, a Tulsa meteorite dealer representing the children
for a 25-percent commission, said he does not regret handing the
sale to Casper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of the people making the biggest stink has contacted
me directly,'' Arnold said. ``They're like the hyenas of the
meteorite community. One starts to howl, then another starts to
howl. Most of them don't have two nickels to rub together and bid
in the auction.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he contacted some of his biggest detractors, whom he
said were largely reassured after he explained ``why the parents
and I chose to go this route.''
</P>
<P>
   The big auction houses had not contacted him and would have
taken six months or longer to publicly offer the Monahans
meteorite, Arnold said. In the meantime, a meteorite shower has hit
Portales, N.M., taking some attention away from the boys' rock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Gibson said photos of the rock on the auction Web site do
not show surface salt crystals he had examined in March, suggesting
that they had decayed.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold said the meteorite looked fine the last time he saw
it. While not held in a climate-controlled container, the plastic
bag holding it appeared adequate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear, Herskowitz said, is that the ``meteorite market is
extremely hot. In the last year and a half, I've never seen any
natural history commodity hotter. Meteorites in general have gone
up 50 percent in value, some tripling.''
</P>
<P>
   Two meteorites auctioned in May fetched $100,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, who now call themselves the ``Meteorite 7,'' garnered
national publicity after Monahans police confiscated the rock from
them because it landed on city property. Under public pressure, the
City Council voted to return it.
</P>
<P>
   Another, slightly larger meteorite discovered the next day by a
sheriff's deputy has been donated to NASA. In return, the space
agency has agreed to give Monahans a mockup for display purposes,
one-third of the original rock, and arranged for Arizona State
University at Tempe to return a slice of a 1938 meteor found near
the West Texas town, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of the Meteorite 7, 8-year-old Patrick Lyles, said
he's enjoying all the attention, including appearances on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America'' and Nickelodian's ``Nick News.'' Now he's
looking ahead. His share of auction proceeds will go into a college
fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the field of study?
</P>
<P>
   ``Meteors,'' he said.

ARAFAT SEES NO PROGRESS IN TALKS WITH ISRAELIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said on an official
visit here Tuesday that no progress has been made in the most
recent attempt to restart the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   And in Israel, far right members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's fractious coalition threatened once again to bring down
the government if he agrees to the US-backed proposal for a further
13 percent West Bank troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The first direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians in
months began Sunday at the urging of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who have accepted the US plan, have been
attending the talks reluctantly, saying they would not accept any
changes to the proposal first made in January. Netanyahu has
rejected the US offer, saying that it jeopardizes Israel's security
and its water resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Cabinet minister Ariel Sharon, the man considered
most capable of leading a right-wing revolt, is still holding
Netanyahu's feet to the fire. Sharon has reportedly warned that a
no-confidence vote would topple Netanyahu if he proceeds with the
US plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the eye of this diplomatic storm, Arafat chose to come here
to consult with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak about how to
handle the potentially pivotal negotiations. But as he prepared to
leave Tuesday, Arafat expressed deep pessimism about the ongoing
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, nothing has come out of all the sessions that have
been held, nothing that can give any positive indication of
improving their (the Israelis') position,'' Arafat said. ``On the
contrary, they are still repeating previous statements and
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were due to meet again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after the
meeting, ``Nobody is hopeful. ... We were waiting for new Israeli
ideas within the framework of the US proposal; ... these meetings
were called because it was mentioned that perhaps the Israelis will
come up with some creative ideas, but the Palestinians report they
have not received any creative ideas so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``However there is a third meeting, which is crucial. If you ask
me, the sole creative idea would be for the Israelis to accept the
US proposal and then ask to fine-tune this or that point,'' Moussa
added.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa said the Palestinians could not compromise on the US
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Palestinians have retreated from their original
position that the Israelis should withdraw from 30 percent of the
West Bank in this second stage, which according to the agreement is
to be followed by a third redeployment. Netanyahu's government
maintains that it will not move forward with the peace process
until the Palestinians come up with a plan for reciprocal measures,
such as a further crackdown on the terrorist infrastructure of the
militant Hamas organization.
</P>
<P>
   After almost 18 months of a deadlock on this phase, many
observers believe that even if these current talks produce some
movement, there are still many pitfalls ahead in the so-called
``final status'' talks. They are the end game of the peace process
in which the most contentious issues, such as the status of
Jerusalem, are to be addressed. Israel sees Jerusalem, which it
captured in the 1967 war and later annexed, as its unified,
indivisible capital. The Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the
site of the capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
   Peace negotiations ground to a halt in March 1997 after Israel
started building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which
it occupied in 1967. A spate of suicide bombings by the military
wing of the Palestinian Hamas organization deepened the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now Arafat is turning to Egypt's Mubarak for counsel, as he
often has throughout turning points in the peace process. As a
close US ally, Egypt can play a pivotal role in the process of the
talks. And Egypt has had experience with Israel on tough, technical
peace negotiations when the former enemies carried out the historic
peace agreements signed 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed el Said, a senior researcher at the Al Ahram Strategic
Center in Cairo, said, ``The Egyptians know how to deal with the
Israelis, with the stalling tactics. But Netanyahu poses a unique
challenge. It is clear to us and to the world that he is opposed to
this agreement. So it will be very hard to negotiate with someone
who does not believe in the plan that is on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the many months of haggling between both sides,
el Said, replied, ``We're all getting bored with it. Even the
United States is getting impatient now. Something has to move soon,
or the whole structure will collapse.''

 &HT;    Streeter could be ready for season
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Servic
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Clemson coach Tommy West has never been a big
believer in the power of positive thinking _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Because now it appears that quarterback Brandon Streeter, who
suffered a severely dislocated ankle during spring practice, will
be completely recovered when the Tigers begin preseason drills in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that if you were hurt, you were hurt and your
attitude didn't matter,'' said West. ``But Brandon has made a
believer out of me. He always said he'd make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   This is huge news for Clemson, which figures to be pretty strong
offensively if Streeter, a junior from, Gettysburg, Pa., is running
the show. Without him, the Tigers would have been forced to turn
conservative and nobody wanted that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right after I hurt it I would come back and be ready
for this season. There's too much at stake,'' said Streeter, who
met with the media Tuesday at the ACC Football Kickoff at Lake
Lanier Islands. ``I'm ready to play and I'm expecting to have a
good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson opens the season at home against Furman on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Bly gets busy
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina cornerback Dre' Bly was an All-American as a
freshman after intercepting 13 passes. Last season teams got smart
and threw away from him. As a result, Bly had ``only'' five
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   This season Bly will be assured of getting back into the action.
Rather than playing one side of the field, Bly will always be
matched up with the other team's best receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke does well
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke will be 26 years old when he starts at quarterback
for Florida State against Texas A&AMP;M on Aug. 31. He will also be
financially set.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when he turned down a scholarship to take a shot at pro
baseball, Weinke took his $475,000 signing bonus and invested every
penny. He bought an apartment building in his hometown of
Minneapolis and put the rest in the stock market. His assets are
now valued at more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke tried baseball for six years before giving football a
try. With Dan Kendra out with a knee injury, he is now the starter.
</P>
<P>
   UVA anxious for Auburn
</P>
<P>
   Some preseason publications have Virginia finishing second in
the ACC behind Florida State. Anthony Poindexter, the Cavaliers'
All-America safety, said it won't take long to find out how good
Virginia's his team really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we go to Auburn we'll know exactly where we are,'' said
Poindexter, a senior from Forest, Va. ``If we can walk into a place
like Auburn and beat them, we deserve to be a Top 15 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia had Auburn on the ropes last season, but lost 28-17.
They will take A much more experienced team will visit to
Jordan-Hare Stadium on Sept. 3 for a Thursday night game on ESPN.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   If Bly is a consensus first-team All-America this season, he
will become only the fifth player in the second half of the century
to earn the honor three times. The others were UCLA linebacker
Jerry Robinson, UCLA defensive back Kenny Easley, Pittsburgh
defensive end Hugh Green, and Georgia's Herschel Walker.

 &HT;    Falcons practice to get late start
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The start of training camp for the Atlanta Falcons
has been pushed back six hours, and while that might not sound like
much, it's enough to put rookie linebacker Keith Brooking on edge.
</P>
<P>
   There was supposed to be a mandatory meeting today, and the team
was scheduled to practice in pads at 9 a.m. on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But because NFL rules stipulate that training camp cannot begin
until 15 days before the first preseason game, the Falcons will
meet at 9 a.m. on Thursday and hold their first full practice at 3
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, the team's first-round draft choice, is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel it in the air; things are changing,'' said
Brooking, who has been staying for about six weeks with other
rookies at the Falcon Inn in Suwanee. ``It's a great feeling, a
lifelong dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to some of the other guys, and we know it's
going to be a long five or six weeks, longer than we're used to.
But I can't wait. I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves said Tuesday he anticipates no excused
absences from training camp, where 80 men will compete for 53
roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' first preseason game is scheduled for Aug. 7 in the
Georgia Dome against the Tennessee Oilers.

 &HT;    EDUCATIONAL GAP FOR HISPANICS WILL SHAKE NATION, REPORT WARNS
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Poor educational performance among Hispanic
youths will spell trouble for the entire United States as those
children grow up to become a larger part of the work force and
population, a leading Hispanic advocacy group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to close the education gap, our community and our
economy will suffer,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the
National Council of La Raza, whose study of recent educational data
confirmed that Hispanic students continue to lag behind their black
and white classmates.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress's refusal to invest the full $600 million that
President Clinton had sought for Hispanic education, ``part of the
solution has got to come from our community,'' said Yzaguirre.
</P>
<P>
   The La Raza report called on Hispanic families and community
groups to become more involved in public schools and with
individual students, but the report's more resonant message may be
that all Americans have a stake in seeing that the 10 million
Hispanics who are under age 18 succeed in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next several decades, Hispanics will constitute more
than 40 percent of net, new labor force entrants,'' the report
said. ``As the baby boom generation retires, the health of the
Social Security and Medicare system _ not to mention every other
government service from defense and law enforcement to highways and
national parks _ increasingly will be dependent on the tax
contributions of today's Latino school children.''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was more blunt Monday: ``The
21st century will be ruthless,'' she told the audience attending
the La Raza national convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leyer es poder,'' she said in Spanish. ``Reading is power.
Education is power. Without it you cannot possibly be successful
whether you are a Hispanic American, African American, Asian
American or any other kind of American, because the 21st century
will be ruthless in its demands that all of us do what we can to
have the education and skills necessary to compete in the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton homed in on the report's findings that only 16 percent
of eligible Hispanic children participate in pre-kindergarten
educational programs such as Head Start. Hispanic students perform
more poorly than their white and black peers throughout school,
according to the report, and are more likely than their peers to
enter the work force without high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reveals the seriousness of the education gap that exists
today and underscores the tremendous urgency of action,'' Clinton
said. ``The gap of learning and opportunity not only hurts
individual young people and not only just holds back their
families. It hurts all of us. It weakens America's chances of
making sure every American has a productive future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we move forward as a nation when today too many of our
children are being left behind, deprived of the opportunities they
need to participate fully in the growth and prosperity of
America?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   La Raza's prescription for improving the education of Hispanic
students is directed at itself and the 240 Hispanic community
groups that are its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Hispanics alone cannot eliminate the education gap
between Latinos and other Americans, these disparities will not be
reduced without heightened involvement by every sector of the
Hispanic community,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of suggesting, even by implication, that improving
Hispanic educational attainment is principally an objective for
others to address,'' it said, ``the National Council of La Raza
believes that the Latino community must first adopt the highest
possible educational expectations for its children, accept
responsibility for improving educational achievement and engage
every segment of the community to do everything it can to address
the issue.''

 &HT;    Coming of age, quickly
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In his first four seasons with the New York Jets,
quarterback Glenn Foley appeared in 13 games, threw nearly twice as
many interceptions as touchdown passes and never started and
finished with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Jets report to training camp at Hofstra University
today, Foley, a former seventh-round draft choice, officially will
be anointed as the new starter for coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy whose career largely has been defined by nagging
injuries and a nondescript internship, the expectations are about
to dramatically increase. Noted as fearless and a bit reckless,
Foley knows he may need both qualities to survive the pressure he's
about to encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things that make it different for me is the position I
play and the city where I play it,'' Foley said. ``But you know
what? All over the league, there are young guys being asked to do
the same thing. You can go to anybody's camp, and you'll find it's
a step-up year for someone there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the NFL's coming-of-age process _ that critical
maturation of young veterans _ is as much a staple of camp life as
a first day drill, rookie hazing and extreme humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But when many NFL teams begin training camp today, there will be
limited time for grooming. Since the current player movement system
took effect in 1993, the young veterans are expected to step in for
departed free agents and immediately take up the slack. The success
or failure frequently is reflected in a club's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who hasn't experienced a complete-game victory at
quarterback since 1993 at Boston College, became the Jets starter
for two games last season when Parcells lost confidence in Neil
O'Donnell. When O'Donnell was cut three weeks ago by Parcells, the
takeover was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the highly-publicized feud between Parcells and
O'Donnell, and the inability of Foley to avoid injury in the past,
the New York quarterback situation figures to be one of the more
scrutinized stories in any training camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are others. In New Orleans, cornerback Alex Molden finds
himself in a make-or-break camp in his third NFL season. Molden, a
first round pick in 1996, has been paid nearly $5 million, but has
started only 17 games with two interceptions. But he became the
senior member of the Saints projected starting secondary after
former All-Pro corner Eric Allen was traded to Oakland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Now he must produce for himself and the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``To remain successful under the current rules, you have to
speed the (learning) curve,'' said Ron Wolf, general manager of the
Green Bay Packers. ``You'd better hit on some players, coach them
well and get them on the field. The luxury of developing young kids
over three or four years, that's long gone. Because roster turnover
is the nature of the beast now, you better be prepared. Having the
solid veterans on your roster in that two-to-five range is more
crucial than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   For a second consecutive year, Wolf and Pittsburgh director of
football operations Tom Donahoe, arguably the league's finest
roster architects, will find out just how crucial. Between them,
the Packers and Steelers lost nine 1997 starters because of free
agency or salary cap manipulation. Both franchises again will be
forced to promote players they might otherwise prefer to nurture as
backups.
</P>
<P>
   That means youngsters like guard Marco Rivera and free safety
Darren Sharper will be starters in Green Bay; linebacker Mike
Vrabel, strong safety Lethon Flowers and offensive tackle Jamain
Stephens in Pittsburgh. They will be monitored in training camp
with dozens of other young veterans around the league who are being
force-fed into lineups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some people we really like, and we're asking them to
step up now,'' Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. ``We're going to
toss them in the pool without a life jacket and see what happens
... but we're counting on them to swim.''

MINISTERS HIT BOY SCOUT STANCE ON GAY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: VerEeckecq in penultimate graf is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Reverend Malcolm Bertram has fond memories of being a Boy
Scout _ the friends he made, the practical skills he learned, the
values he absorbed that have helped guide him in life.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertram says he is appalled by the recent attitudes of the
organization that helped make him a man.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram, 64, a United Church of Christ minister, along with
clergy in several Christian and Jewish denominations blasted the
Boy Scouts of America Tuesday for ordering the Unitarian
Universalist Association to stop giving out religious awards to
scouts who are Unitarians because the church promotes gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Boy Scouts have gone off the edge,'' said Bertram.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts considers homosexuality immoral and prohibits
gays from joining the organization, a position that has drawn
increasingly harsh criticism from human rights groups and religious
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that people disagree with us, but we have a
long-held position regarding traditional family values, which we
have always taught,'' said Gregg Shields, national spokesman for
the Boy Scouts of America. ``A person who is an avowed homosexual
is not a role model for those values.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative clergy sympathized with the Boy Scouts action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been handled as smoothly as it could have, but
I think the Boy Scouts are right to make people understand clearly
what the organization says about homosexuality,'' said the Reverend
Marc Soares, pastor of Gospel of Life Christian Church, a
storefront Pentecostal congregation in Worcester, Mass. ``I do
believe the Bible regards homosexuality as a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the Boy Scouts exclusion of gays from its organization
promises to bring more clashes with liberal religious congregations
because in many communities scout troops are sponsored and housed
in churches and temples.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A small but growing number of congregations across the
country, angered by the Boy Scouts stance on homosexuality, have
refused to support Scout troops or allow troops to meet in their
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Mass., for example, St. Paul's Lutheran Church
several months ago decided to stop sponsoring a Boy Scout troop it
had long supported, according to Bishop Robert L. Isaksen, leader
of the New England synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America. The congregation did allow the troop to remain in their
building.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the Boy Scouts and the Unitarian
Unversalists was provoked by a manual widely disseminated by the
Unitarians describing the denomination's beliefs and practices.
</P>
<P>
   The manual, which Unitarian scouts study to qualify for the
``Religion in Life'' award, accuses Boy Scout officials of
``homophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts angrily demanded that the Unitarians stop giving
out the awards until the manual is reworked to the Boy Scouts'
satisfaction. Leaders of the Unitairan Universalist Association,
headquartered in Boston, have refused.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Rabbi David Wolfman, director of the Northeast Council of
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which represents Reform
Jewish synagogues, said the Boy Scouts' move would make it
difficult for some rabbis to give out religious awards to Jewish
scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a decision we leave to individual rabbis and
congregations, but if I were in the pulpit I would hate to send out
the message that I'm condoning the Boy Scouts' attitude toward gays
and lesbians,'' Wolfman said. ``The question is, is this an
organization I want to continue to support?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some priests in the Catholic Church also have misgivings about
the Boy Scouts position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the Boy Scouts are trying to make it a very
black and white issue of how a particular church should deal with
the issue of homosexuality,'' said the Reverend Robert F.
VerEeckecq, pastor of St. Ignatius Loyola Church in Chestnut Hill,
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic Church considers homosexuality a sin, it
strongly condemns discrimination against gays and lesbians. ``A lot
of churches are genuinely trying to struggle with the complexity of
the human person and it seems like the Boy Scouts don't appreciate
that,'' VerEecke said.

2 OF 3 MEN CHARGED IN JASPER SLAYING SENT TO PRISON ON PAROLE
VIOLATIONS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Two white men charged with killing an
African-American in Jasper by dragging him behind a pickup have
been returned to prison on parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill King, 23, of Jasper and Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur
Springs are currently being held in one-man cells at the Diagnostic
Unit in Huntsville, said prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. Both
are charged with capital murder in the June 7 slaying of James Byrd
Jr., who was dragged almost three miles along back country roads
east of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both on parole and they were charged with capital
murder,'' said Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles. ``You're not
supposed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Being charged violated the men's paroles.
</P>
<P>
   They were transported to Huntsville under strict security
Friday, Rowles said. The pair had been held without bond in
separate high-security cells at the Jasper County Jail since they
were arrested late the night after Byrd was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper, also charged with capital murder,
remains in Jasper. Rowles said Berry is on probation, not parole.
The Jasper County District Attorney's Office filed papers June 8
seeking to have Berry's probation revoked, but no court hearing on
the matter has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claimed he violated probation by not reporting to
probation officers as ordered, by associating with the other two
men, who were both known felons.
</P>
<P>
   Berry and King were co-defendants in a burglary in Jasper County
and were sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1992. They were
released on shock probation in early 1993.
</P>
<P>
   King returned to prison as a probation violator in June 1995. He
was released in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was given a seven-year sentence for breaking into a house
in July 1987. He was paroled the following February. He went back
with 15 years on a drug possession charge in May 1989, then paroled
in May 1991 but returned on a parole violation in February 1994. He
was released last September.
</P>
<P>
   His court-appointed defense attorney, Douglas Barlow of
Beaumont, said he was not told that Brewer was returned to prison.
He said he found out about the move after some of Brewer's family
tried to visit him in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``His security is of my utmost concern,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr., who represents
King, said he is sure both men will be kept in solitary confinement
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't envision that they would be put in the general
population,'' Cribbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Fitzgerald said the two men are being kept in
administrative segregation because they have been identified as
possibly being members of the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate
Knights of America, a skinhead group, while they were both housed
at the Beto I Unit in Tennessee Colony.
</P>
<P>
   They will be kept in solitary cells away from other prisoners
and will be let out to exercise alone for one hour every day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said county officials requested
that the two be housed at the Mark Stiles Unit near Beaumont, for
the convenience of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs and Barlow said that also would cut down on lawyers'
travel time in preparing for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said making the defendants handy for their attorneys
is not considered when prison officials decide where to send them.
He said the two men could be sent to separate units. They may be at
the Diagnostic Unit _ where prisoners are usually sent to while
awaiting assignment _ for several weeks before they are assigned
more permanent prison homes.
</P>
<P>
   King and Brewer, who were named in one indictment separately
from Brewer, are set to be tried together. No date has been set,
but most involved in the case predicted it will be in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the very early stages now,'' Cribbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors haven't gotten back all the lab results yet, he
said, and defense teams haven't really started their own
investigations.

FRESH FROM BRITISH OPEN, ROSE TO PLAY DUTCH OPEN AS A PRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ The men are still being separated from the
boys in golf, but not always in the traditional order.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mark O'Meara won his second major of the year at age 41
when he captured the British Open on Sunday, change still appears
to be in the wind in this game where experience and maturity have
long had the edge on youthful insouciance and exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example was the darling of Royal Birkdale,
17-year-old Justin Rose of England, who shared the lead after two
rounds, sank a 45-foot wedge shot to a thunderous ovation on his
final shot of the tournament and finished in a tie for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   And all that was as an amateur. When the British Open was
concluded, Rose announced that he was turning professional, and
would play on the European Tour, beginning this week at the Dutch
Open in Hilversum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that has been weighing on my mind,'' Rose said
of his decision. ``It has always been a possibility, but I was
going to use this week as a way of helping me decide. The way it's
gone, I would be silly not to, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods was considered an anomaly when he became the world's
top-ranked golfer at 21, but Rose has now confirmed that he has the
ability to be an exception to the rule as well. He is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Matt Kuchar, the American amateur champion,
finished in a tie for 21st at the Masters at age 19 and then
followed that up by tying for 14th at the U.S. Open. Sergio Garcia,
an 18-year-old Spaniard who won the European amateur championship
in 1995, shot a 72 on Sunday to finish 12-over par, which would
have earned him much more attention if not for Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger obviously has brought this on,'' said David
Leadbetter, the coach who has worked with Price and Nick Faldo.
``He's got players thinking that maybe they should think about
making the leap earlier. There are a lot more young ones coming
into the game. You're going to find players getting better younger,
rather like tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter has also worked with Rose, who came to see him in
Florida earlier this year. ``He's a phenomenal talent, and I think
he will win a British Open one day,'' Leadbetter said. ``He is a
young body with an old head.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose concluded his amateur career in veteran style. His
imagination-stretching final birdie did not make him the first
amateur in 68 years to win the British Open, but it had brought him
within remarkably close range. His 69 on Sunday left him in a
four-way tie for fourth, two shots behind Mark O'Meara and Brian
Watts and one shot behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has held himself together really well,'' Woods said.
``Hopefully it will continue, and he can keep playing well and make
the right decisions. I know that it would have been very difficult
for me to turn pro at that age because my game really wasn't ready
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has shown some skills, and hopefully he'll be
able to keep being consistent. That's the key, because the media
are going to build him up to be something pretty big, and hopefully
he will be able to keep playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rose, Woods also won the Silver Medal, which is given to
the low-scoring amateur at the British Open. He did so in 1996, but
unlike Rose, Woods finished in a tie for 22nd that year. Rose's
finish is believed to be the best for an amateur here since Frank
Stranahan was second in 1953. But Stranahan was no teen-ager, and
on Friday when Nick Price heard that Rose had shot a 66, he turned
to Woods and jokingly said, ``You're 22. You're an old man
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who was born in South Africa and moved to Britain at the
age of 5, was indeed remarkably composed on Sunday after dropping
two shots on the front nine. He finished with three birdies on the
final seven holes, playing creatively when in difficulty and
maintaining his rhythm throughout the round. But what made his
precocity even more pleasurable to watch was that his on-course
demeanor bore little resemblance to those of his tightly wound,
tightly focused elders.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked through the massive galleries that followed him on
Saturday and Sunday, he waved or flashed a thumbs-up sign to those
who shouted his name. On Saturday, when a group of teen-age girls
shrieked as he walked by, Rose started giggling himself. As he
walked down the 14th fairway, he turned to his caddy, Stuart
Bradley, and said, ``This is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after he finished his round, that word still applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the week, all I wanted to be was a part of
it,'' he said. ``I didn't realize I would be such a part of it,
almost getting the feel of being a winning player coming up the
18th.'' &QL;

FALLING BUILDING DEBRIS KEEPS NEW YORKERS ON THEIR TOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - When a New Yorker looks up at the sky these days,
it's often not just to marvel at how tall the buildings are _ but
to wonder whether one of them might be about to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal pieces of a big one _ the 48-story Conde Nast building,
going up in Times Square _ came tumbling down during rush hour
Tuesday morning, after a construction-elevator on the 25th floor
snapped off its track, smashed through 20 layers of scaffolding,
and crashed into a nearby senior-citizens' hotel, killing one woman
who lived there and injuring 12 others.
</P>
<P>
   Shards of glass fell to the street for hours afterward. The
elevator's metal rails _ the ones that didn't fall _ were visibly
tottering all day, twisted and twirled like a roller-coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Police hurriedly closed off several of Manhattan's busiest
blocks to cars and pedestrians, to ward off further calamity. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, on the scene, said the blocks may remain closed
for two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is way down in New York City, but Tuesday's incident is
bound to intensify another sort of anxiety that some people feel
here while walking around _ an anxiety stemming from the physical
matter of the city itself, a mix of decaying old brownstones, on
the one hand, and towering new construction-projects, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The sky isn't falling, but all too many bits and pieces of the
city are. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _Last December, bricks and masonry fell to the sidewalk from
some of the classiest buildings on Madison Avenue, shutting down
several blocks during the peak of the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   _An abandoned building on 42nd Street collapsed just 36 hours
before _ and one block away from _ the Times Square New Years' Eve
revelry.
</P>
<P>
   _In April, a 500-pound steel beam smashed into a box seat at
Yankee Stadium, a few hours before the start of a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   _Falling bricks at a school in Brooklyn killed a girl, while a
60-pound chunk that fell from a school in Queens caused one-third
of the student body to stay home the next day out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   _At least a dozen apartments or their brick facades have toppled
during this same span of time, from Brooklyn to the Bronx, from
Harlem to the Bowery.
</P>
<P>
   A modern novelist might make metaphor of these disasters: a
city, more orderly than ever, booming, soaring, prospering _ while,
beneath the surface lurk chaos and decay.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Birkhahn, spokesman for the Buildings Dept, rejects the
notion of some connection, or trend, in the run of mishaps. ``There
are 1 million buildings in New York City,'' he said. ``There have
been about 20 incidents this year. As a percentage, it's a very,
very low number.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there have been ``more incidents in high-profile
areas,'' such as midtown Manhattan, where most New Yorkers work and
most tourists stroll. This increase has, in turn, heightened media
coverage of collapses generally. However, he maintained, the number
of disasters involving buildings in the city overall ``has remained
relatively constant over the last 5 or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged, in recent months, that the city has only
60 building inspectors _ not enough to monitor the vast stock of
aging buildings.
</P>
<P>
   However, Birkhahn countered that the city has over 90
construction inspectors, which he said is more than at any time
during this decade. He also emphasized, ``Most buildings in New
York City are properly maintained,'' though he added,
``Unfortunately, some aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   As of early Tuesday evening, the cause of the accident at the
Conde Nast building, which took place at 8:24 AM, was not known.
Just last Friday, city inspectors rode up the same elevator that
crashed Tuesday, examining each floor for problems. They reportedly
found none.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.6 million square-foot skyscraper is scheduled to open this
summer. It will house a huge law firm and the Conde Nast publishing
empire, which includes The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and several
other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Officials identifid the woman killed Tuesday as Theresa
Feliconio and said she was 73 years old. She was sitting in her
living room on the top floor of the Woodstock Hotel _ a
senior-citizens' home across the street from the Conde Nast
building _ when a metal fragment punched a hole in the roof.
Emergency-rescue workers, who found her amid the debris, said she
died instantly from the blow. The other residents have since been
relocated to another nearby hotel.

   JORDAN, Mont. _ At the old Clark farmhouse, where Freemen
theorists once advocated the supremacy of white males, a new kind
of pecking order is incubating.
</P>
<P>
   Under bright lights, 1,000 pheasant brooders are fattening,
preparing for release this summer into the rolling hills of the
Missouri Breaks. The 960-acre Clark ranch, which two years ago was
embedded into the nation's consciousness as a symbol of far-right
anti-government resistance, is being reinvented as a place for
tourists to pay to hunt birds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, about two dozen Freemen, a group of rural extremists
who claimed they were not subject to U.S. laws, holed up at the
Clark ranch with 100 firearms in a standoff with the FBI. After 81
days, they gave up. The siege ended on June 13, 1996, without a
shot fired.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jordan residents have returned to their natural rhythms,
complaining about low prices for beef and wheat and praising the
heavy rains that painted an emerald green across Montana's Big
Open.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, a federal jury in Billings, Mont., convicted the
group's six ringleaders of banking fraud and other charges. It
failed to reach a verdict on charges against six others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there are two or three on the edges that are left,''
Nickolas Murnion, the Garfield County attorney, said of the
collapse of the Freemen movement. ``But most everyone is just kind
of sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone lawyer in this county of 1,500 residents, Murnion was
often the target of Freemen death threats and pseudo-legal screeds.
</P>
<P>
   For his persistent opposition to the extremists, Murnion was
recently honored in Boston with the John F. Kennedy Profile in
Courage Award. Although Murnion said he saw the Freemen movement as
dormant, he warned of a return of economic conditions that could
make desperate farmers receptive to extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a ranch worth $1.2 million on paper, not owe a
dime, and still not make a living wage,'' said Murnion, a
third-generation rancher, adding that wheat prices had fallen by
half in three years and that cattle prices here were below
production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a village with a population of about 500, is in a
struggle to survive, a struggle repeated in small towns across the
thinly populated plains. This spring, only an increase in the real
estate tax kept Jordan's hospital from closing. One rural school is
threatened with closing because it has fallen below the state
minimum of five pupils for a one-room schoolhouse, and the county
courthouse was destroyed in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Residents had grumbled about the invasion of reporters, federal
agents and paramilitary leaders during the Freemen siege. Today,
they realize that the siege pumped millions into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   No Freemen tourism is on the horizon, though. Because no blood
was shed, Jordan is not on the itinerary of the far-right sites of
martyrdom that includes Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, Idaho. The
siege left virtually no mark, a testament to the healing power of
the land. Grass grows at the Garfield County Fair Grounds, once a
muddy command post teeming with federal agents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a hilltop, the green and white Clark ranch house looks little
changed from the days when photographers trained the
highest-powered lenses on what was identified as ``the Supreme
Court of Justus Township.'' One recent afternoon, though, the
occupants, Dean Clark and his wife, were out, having casually left
the front door open and the television on. He was farming and she
was feeding the ring-necked pheasants. After the siege, Clark
retrieved the ranch from Freemen relatives and was paid $50,000 in
compensation by the government, which had blocked access to his
cropland in the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Down a hill is the ranch's fishing pond. During the siege,
reporters calculated that there were enough trout and walleyes in
the pond to sustain the 25 holdout Freemen for months. On a recent
evening, Bud Holter, the retired owner of a sporting goods store,
displayed a creel filled with fat trout. His two teen-age
grandchildren frolicked in the swimming hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my get-away-from-it-all place,'' the children's
mother, Jeri Lester, said as she watched them swim. Referring to
the pastoral site that was once ``the Freemen compound,'' she
sighed and said: ``This is so peaceful. It is heaven on earth.''

IRWIN BROTHERS HOPE TO REUNITE AS PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Blake got the basic family size, so he's the
outside linebacker, and he always had an edge as long as he made
sure his bigger _ much bigger _ brother didn't catch him.
</P>
<P>
   Heath got the extra size, so he's the offensive lineman, and
when he could catch his little brother, you probably didn't want to
be around to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown up a little,'' Heath said Tuesday between Patriots
training camp sessions at Bryant College. ``Back then, we'd fight a
lot. He was always faster. But if I could catch him, I could get
him.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the Brothers Irwin, back together on the football field
for the first time since Boulder High in Colorado and hoping to
still be teammates when the NFL season starts next month.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Brothers Irwin _ nephews of Hale, the longtime
professional golfer after a successful collegiate football career
at Colorado; and sons of Phil, also a former Colorado football
standout.
</P>
<P>
   While Heath, 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, is fighting for
playing time after a couple of years of mostly watching, Blake,
who's 6 feet and 237 pounds, is fighting for his football life.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-round pick now in his third season, Heath is getting in
position to grab a spot at guard or center should someone falter or
be injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday coach Pete Carroll mentioned him as part of what he
considers a solid and huge second offensive line unit that also
includes Scott Rehberg, Jason Andersen, Damon Denson, and Ed Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good to Heath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of watching,'' he said. ``But we've got players here
who play the line who are great players, and it's hard to break
into a group like that. All you can do is work as hard as you can.
And hope. You don't want to see injuries and play because of that.
But I want to play sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago as a rookie, Heath played behind William Roberts
at left guard and was listed among the Patriots' inactive players
before every game. Last year he saw limited time behind Max Lane at
left guard and was on the field goal and extra point units. He made
his one and only career start at Buffalo when Zefross Moss was
injured and Lane moved over to fill in for Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's ready for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching gets old,'' he said. ``On the line, it's not like we
rotate five players. You don't get in unless someone gets hurt.
It's been too long now, but that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake Irwin thought his days of playing football with his
brother ended when Heath left Boulder for the University of
Colorado and Blake _ after drawing little interest from recruiters
_ went to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Let a proud older brother take over here. ``I think they thought
he was a little short,'' Heath said of Colorado's lack of interest
in his brother. ``They never did do great in-state recruiting. They
were between coaches and just screwed up. They let him get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Story of Blake's life.
</P>
<P>
   Undrafted last spring, he landed here as a free agent largely
because the Patriots showed more interest than others. He liked the
idea of being with Heath and also knew defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell, who played with Hale at Colorado and then coached Phil
Irwin there.
</P>
<P>
   Blake came out early this summer and spent several days with
Heath. They golfed and went to the beach. Tuesday they matched up
at various times on the field.
</P>
<P>
   They both know it's not going to be easy for him to stick. In
short, he's a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you're stupid if you don't think that way, especially
as a free agent, coming in undersized and all that,'' Blake said.
``Of course it's a long shot. But things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of smaller guys can play in this league,'' Sidwell said.
``He has a chance. Obviously, special-teams contributions are going
to be critical to whether he makes the team or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin knows it. He blocked a punt in Tuesday's morning session.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of us rookies, it's special teams that are going to
matter,'' he said. ``You need to be a little lucky and to work hard
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The working hard part comes easy.
</P>
<P>
   It's what earned Blake a scholarship within a couple of days of
his arrival at New Mexico. It's what earned him second-team
All-Western Conference honors there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable; I've never met a man who works as hard in
my life,'' Heath said. ``No one ever gave him any credit. No one
ever gave him anything. I got lucky with the genetic boost. He
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, told of the comments, smiled. ``He would say that. He's a
good brother. But I haven't had a lot of breaks. I have had to work
for it. Nobody wanted me out of high school. Nobody really wanted
me much after college, either. That's how it's always been. I'm
used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's here, hoping to make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell vouches for the family stock and for what he's seen of
the younger Irwin thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a real smart guy,'' Sidwell said. ``He looks like
he's a good hitter and he's tougher than heck.''
</P>
<P>
   He's ready for that shot, however long it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be on a practice squad or anything,'' Blake said.
``Effort's the main thing. You have to try and outwork people or at
least work as hard and be smart about things. And try not to make
mistakes, because you don't get as many shots as other guys do.''

TAPES BECOME ISSUE IN CISNEROS TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge said Tuesday he wanted to know
where the originals are of 88 tape recordings that are the heart of
the government's conspiracy case against former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin set a September hearing to
determine the legality and authenticity of the recordings of
telephone conversations the government plans to use in the trial of
Cisneros, set for Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin also threatened to bring Cisneros' former lover, Linda
Jones, before the court to testify about the alterations on the
tapes she secretly made of her telephone conversations with
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   In unusually strong language, the judge lectured defense lawyers
and prosecutors for putting off the crucial issue of the tapes
until just months before the scheduled trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing should have been done way, way back,'' Sporkin
said. ``There is no margin of error any more. Let's get this thing
working.''
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to use to the tapes to corroborate
testimony that Cisneros and Jones conspired to conceal $250,000 in
``hush money'' to buy her silence about his financial help to her.
Prosecutors contend that Cisneros wanted to conceal the payments
while he was undergoing background checks as President Clinton's
nominee for secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Jones went by her married name, Linda Medlar, when she and
Cisneros had an affair, and the recordings are known as the
``Medlar tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisneros wants a Cabinet slot; Medlar wants money. Those are
their personal agendas, and in order to achieve those they have to
commit a crime,'' prosecutor Mark Jackowski told Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski said Cisneros was not being extorted by Jones and that
he only paid her ``to keep her mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   A 21-count indictment handed down last year by a federal grand
jury also charges Cisneros of orchestrating a conspiracy that
bought the silence of two former aides, John Rosales and Sylvia
Arce, in exchange for jobs at HUD.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from a $4 million investigation by independent
counsel David Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of Lubbock, Texas, is serving a 3-1/2-year prison
sentence in Texas after pleading guilty to 28 counts of bank fraud,
obstruction of justice and money laundering, charges that also
resulted from Barrett's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros looked weary following the second of a two-day hearing
on pre-trail motions. He declined to comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Simon, a lawyer for Cisneros, argued that the tapes were
illegally made by Jones, who sought to blackmail and extort funds
from the former San Antonio mayor and a rising star in the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Simon also pounced on the tampered tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are massive alterations of the tapes,'' he told the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski argued that even though the tapes had been edited,
portions could be used in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not organize or participate in the taping, he
said, and copies were turned over to investigators by Jones' lawyer
after her public disclosure of the conversations on a tabloid
television show.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin ordered a Sept. 16 hearing to determine whether the
tapes are legal and can be submitted as evidence and to hear expert
testimony about the authenticity of the taped conversations the
government wants to use in trial.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are considered crucial to the government's case
against Cisneros, who became HUD secretary in 1993 and resigned in
1996 to become president of the Spanish-language television network
Univision in Los Angeles.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the tapes were first aired on the television show
``Inside Edition.'' During a paid interview on the show, Jones
described the financial arrangement she had had with Cisneros
following their extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   On the tapes, a voice identified as Cisneros' tells Jones: ``The
FBI loves things that have to do with sex and intimacy and so
forth, but they're real bad at tracking down financial things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones told ``Inside Edition'' that Cisneros made those comments
as the FBI was conducting a routine background check into his
Cabinet nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to her charges on ``Inside Edition,'' Cisneros
said in 1994: ``You've got to take tapes with a grain of salt. It's
supposed to be 40 hours of tapes, and little snippets are leaked
out. It wouldn't stand up in a court, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have urged the judge to toss out all 21 counts
in the indictment returned against Cisneros, Rosales, Arce and
Jones.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that inflation remains more of a risk than recession,
despite the sharp slowdown in economic growth caused in recent
months by Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan
signaled that the central bank was unlikely to raise interest rates
anytime soon. But he said the economy retained considerable
momentum despite the drop in exports induced by Asia's woes. And
with unemployment hovering near its lowest levels in almost three
decades, he said the Federal Reserve would have to be
``particularly alert'' to the possibility that a renewed surge in
growth could set off a destabilizing spiral of wage and prices
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's assessment of the economy was generally upbeat and
covered a wide range of what he called ``important cross
currents,'' from the strikes against General Motors to strong
growth in the money supply and a continued consumer spending spree.
But he stressed the view _ pushed by a group of Federal Reserve
officials who have been calling for months for a rate increase _
that inflation has by no means been vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   He effectively dismissed the possibility of a rate cut _ raised
by some economists in recent weeks as growth has slowed _ by
ignoring the topic altogether. He labeled forecasts that the
economy might have contracted during the spring ``conjectural'' and
noted that many economic indicators have remained quite strong.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee
was concerned about two conflicting outlooks. Under one, the
pressure on wages would grow as employers scrambled to find the
workers they need at a time of continued healthy growth, setting
off a cycle of inflationary price increases. Under the other,
Asia's woes could hit the United States harder, leading to a more
pronounced economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we expect that the situation will develop relatively
smoothly, the committee believes that, given the current tightness
in labor markets, the potential for accelerating inflation is
probably greater than the risk of protracted, excessive weakness in
the economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's choice of words suggested that the Fed, at its last
policy meeting, on June 30 and July 1, had retained its policy
``bias'' toward raising rates _ effectively a warning to the
financial markets that it is on a heightened state of alert against
inflation. The Fed has left its benchmark federal funds target rate
unchanged at 5.5 percent since March 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greenspan repeated his warning to investors that it will be
difficult in the long run for companies to meet Wall Street's
ever-increasing earnings expectations. And he reiterated the
Federal Reserve's warning to banks to be careful that the loans
they are making now do not come back to haunt them when the next
economic downturn comes.
</P>
<P>
   Investors heeded his warnings about earnings growth, and drove
stocks lower Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
105.56 points, or 1.14 percent, to 9,190.19, its lowest level in a
week. Bond prices jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan will appear Wednesday before a House Banking
subcommittee for a second day of testimony about monetary policy
and the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from the Senate committee Tuesday,
Greenspan said he supported proposals to create private investment
accounts as part of the Social Security system. But he said he
opposed allowing the federal government to invest the Social
Security trust funds in the stock market, saying such a policy
would inevitably tempt politicians to interfere with companies in
which the government was a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman also reiterated his calls for Congress to
approve more financing for the International Monetary Fund, whose
reserves have been depleted by the Asian crisis and the bailout of
Russia. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Clinton
administration's full $18 billion request for the fund Tuesdy, but
the fate of the request in the House remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about growing federal budget surpluses, Greenspan said his
first choice was to use them to reduce the national debt but that
using them for tax cuts would be preferable to allowing them to be
spent on new entitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the economic outlook, Greenspan said demand in the
domestic economy appears strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their incomes and wealth having been on a strong upward
track, American consumers remain quite upbeat,'' Greenspan said.
``For businesses, decreasing costs of and high rates of return on
investment, as well as the scarcity of labor, could keep capital
spending elevated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These factors suggest some risk that the labor market could
get even tighter,'' Greenspan said. ``And even if it does not,
under prevailing tight labor markets increasingly confident workers
might place gradually escalating pressures on wages and costs,
which would eventually feed through to prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan quickly added, though, that ``a number of factors
likely will serve to damp growth in aggregate demand, helping to
foster a reasonably smooth transition to a more sustainable rate of
growth and reasonable balance in labor markets.''
</P>
<P>
   If the slowdown does not happen on its own, Greenspan warned,
``firming actions on the part of the Federal Reserve may be
necessary to insure a track of expansion that is capable of being
sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's new economic forecast, released Tuesday, shows that
the central bank expects inflation to pick up slightly through the
rest of this year and into next year, with the Consumer Price Index
rising 2 to 2.5 percent next year, up from less than 2 percent this
year. It expects unemployment to be between 4.25 and 4.5 percent in
this year's fourth quarter, with the rate rising just slightly next
year. The rate for June was 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast shows growth running at 3 to 3.25 percent for this
year, implying some rebound from the sharp slowdown in the second
quarter after the first quarter's 5.4 percent annualized growth
rate in gross domestic product. By next year, the Fed sees the
economy slowing to what many analysts consider its noninflationary
trend level of 2 to 2.5 percent.

STOCKS TUMBLE AFTER FORECASTS OF LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., see related CREDIT and GREENSPAN)  
(rl) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forecasts of slowing growth in corporate earnings
later in the year and cautionary words about inflation from Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sent stocks tumbling on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The declines halted a nearly two-week rally among technology
shares, pushing the Nasdaq composite index lower after nine
straight gains.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports dominated the landscape throughout the day as
concerns raised by companies of weaker results later this year
overshadowed strong results of the quarter that just ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a stock market which is high; it's overvalued,''
said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany
Corp. ``Everything has to go right, and when one of the most
dependable companies tells us that its earnings are going to be a
disappointment, it stirs worries about profits.''
</P>
<P>
   That company was Merck, America's largest drug company, which
said second-quarter earnings rose 14 percent on sales of new pills
to treat asthma and baldness and increased sales of Zocor, a drug
to reduce cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of the drug maker fell 9 13/16, or 7 percent, to 128
9/16 after it warned that such a performance would not be repeated
later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   While other drug companies reported strong earnings, Merck's
second-half warning sent most drug stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, IBM rose 6 1/8, to 128 1/8. Although it reported
only slightly better-than-expected earnings on Monday, there is
some optimism that the company's performance will improve later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his semiannual testimony before Congress on Tuesday,
Greenspan signaled that the nation's central bank was more
concerned about inflation than slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market, especially sensitive to Greenspan's perceived
warnings about inflation, interpreted his remarks as a sign that
interest rates would likely remain steady. But in the stock market,
major indexes ended sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.56 points, to
9,190.19, its lowest level in a week and a 1.14 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed down 19.03 points,
to 1,165.07, off 1.61 percent. The Nasdaq index lost 1.74 percent,
falling 35.11 points, to 1,979.14. Microsoft, Cisco and Dell led
the declines. Several high-flying Internet-related shares, such as
Amazon.com, America Online and Yahoo, were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of traders were optimistic Greenspan was going to talk
about slow growth and low inflation and the Fed would move to a
more neutral stance,'' said Anthony Conroy, a managing director at
Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. But he focused more on
inflationary pressure in the United States rather than on the drag
of Asian economies, Conroy added.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expressed confidence the market would soon rebound
from Greenspan's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to talk the markets down,'' said Robert
Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper
Investments. ``It's a buying opportunity.''

HOUSE VOTES TO FUND ARTS AGENCY AT CURRENT $98.5 MILLION LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Endowment for the Arts overcame
conservative opposition Tuesday as most House Democrats and 58
Republicans voted to fund the agency for another year at $98.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the NEA may have staved off threats of
extinction, the measure to fund the arts agency at current levels
passed by a comfortable margin of 253-173.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House voted 217-216 to eliminate all funding for
the NEA, which provides matching grants for arts groups and state
and local arts organizations. The money was later restored at the
insistence of the Senate and the White House. The Senate has yet to
take up NEA funding this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the House Republican leadership used a procedural
device to briefly eliminate all funding for the arts agency but
then permitted Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., to offer an amendment
that restored the funds.
</P>
<P>
   The 58 Republicans joined 194 Democrats and the House's one
Independent to continue funding the agency. The NEA money is
included in a much larger appropriations bill that funds the
Interior Department and related programs at $13.4 billion in fiscal
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also funds the NEA's less controversial sister agency,
the National Endowment for the Humanities, at $110.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, was the only one of 13 Texas
Republicans to vote for NEA funding. Last year, Granger was sharply
criticized in the local arts community for going along with the GOP
leadership's efforts to kill the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a community that's very supportive of the arts,''
Granger said in an interview. ``My vote last year was never
intended to be a vote against the NEA. It's worthy funding.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, who has led the
effort to eliminate the NEA for the last decade, voted against the
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NEA has a very enthusiastic, well-financed lobby on its
behalf,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven House Democrats voted against the NEA amendment this
year, and three of them were Texans: Reps. Charlie Stenholm of
Abilene, Ralph Hall of Rockwall and Jim Turner of Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   William Ivey, the newly installed chairman of the NEA, called
the House vote ``both`a;real and symbolic victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old debate over the existence of the NEA finally has given
way to a more thoughtful dialogue about the appropriate level of
federal arts funding in America,'' Ivey said in a statement. ``It
is now time to move ahead with the important work of this agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The NEA budget has dropped from a high of $175 million in 1992,
and has been threatened with extinction every year since the
Republicans took control of Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's lopsided vote, the preceding debate was as
passionate and as divisive as many others since conservatives began
targeting the NEA for funding art which many of them consider
pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., described the agency as ``an
organization that has wasted taxpayer dollars in ways that are
offensive to many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee panel that decides funding for the NEA, voted for the
funding measure.
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress has imposed reforms that have made the NEA more
responsive. They include more congressional oversight, a reduction
of administrative costs, a more widespread distribution of grants
and a focus on education and small-town music programs.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, acknowledged that
the reforms are good. But he added: ``We still have a bad agency in
place. I believe the federal government should get out of the arts
business entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sid Yates, D-Ill., the subcommittee's ranking member
and a longtime NEA champion, said, ``The general welfare is the
government's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates, who will be 89 in August, is retiring this year after 46
years of congressional service and many members paid tribute to him
during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of how the tide had turned, however, was the statement of
Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., a critic of the NEA in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now think we should give the NEA a chance,'' he said.

GM SATURN FACTORY STILL OPEN, BUT FRUSTRATION SIMMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Del.)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRING HILL, Tenn. _ A month after strikes at parts factories in
Flint, Mich., forced every other General Motors assembly plant in
the United States to close, the enormous Saturn factory here is
still churning out cars, as workers have quietly set aside union
solidarity in favor of preserving the nation's best-known
experiment in cooperation between labor and management.
</P>
<P>
   The local union worked with the factory in stockpiling parts
before the strikes began, workers here say and union officials
confirm. When the stockpiles ran out this month, GM began buying
replacement parts from a half-dozen other factories, including
spark plugs from Japan and a transmission valve from a nonunion
factory in Michigan. Despite grumbling from a few workers and union
officials, Saturn is now making cars with the replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt OK about it mainly because the biggest thing is to
satisfy your customers,'' Stacey Young, a unionized wheel inspector
and strong supporter of the local union leadership, said as he
stood inside the entrance of the United Automobile Workers union
hall here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an odd twist, the workers here are horrified by GM's
long-term plans to start equipping Saturn cars and trucks with
dashboards, engines and other components from Pontiacs, Chevrolets,
Oldsmobiles and other GM products, instead of manufacturing those
parts here.
</P>
<P>
   GM intends to buy a lot of those parts for Saturn from other GM
factories and lower-wage outside suppliers. Workers had hoped that
the success of the Saturn brand would prompt GM to build more
models here and even produce most of the parts here, thus
preserving the Spring Hill factory's unusual self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest expression yet of workers' frustration came on
Sunday, when they voted overwhelmingly to authorize their leaders
to call a strike if further negotiations fail to resolve the local
union's concerns. Yet in a sign of continued reluctance to cause
any harm to the GM division they helped to build, local union
leaders have since said that they will talk for at least 30 days
before actually starting a walkout. If the Flint strikes are
settled during that time, national leaders of the UAW are unlikely
to give their permission soon for any more local strikes, so as to
give GM and the union a chance to recover for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn workers voted by a two-thirds majority in March to keep
their innovative labor contract, which has given workers a large
say, until now, in many business decisions. The vote was a defeat
for union dissidents who wanted to return to the same national UAW
labor contract in force at every other GM factory in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But relations with management have deteriorated considerably
since the referendum, partly because GM now plans to build a
Saturn-brand sport utility vehicle with relatively few parts from
the factory here. GM is also paying workers a second-quarter bonus
of $390 apiece when the union says $1,400 is owed.
</P>
<P>
   Though many workers are particularly upset by their bonuses,
their leaders are more worried about the planned sport utility
vehicle. Though there has been no suggestion that GM will close the
7,300-employee factory here, employment will decline if less work
is done inside, Michael Bennett, the local union chairman, warned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They are looking at just basically outsourcing everything they
can, and run it through a lean assembly and still call it a
Saturn,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hudler, Saturn's chairman and president, began meeting
here Tuesday with local union officials in an effort to reconcile
differences. But having created one of the nation's most successful
brands, GM is determined to put the Saturn name on more models, and
not just models produced by the workers here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturn is not just Spring Hill anymore,'' said a GM official
who insisted on anonymity. GM is currently expanding the factory
here and wants to use its equipment to full capacity, so job losses
are unlikely regardless of what vehicle models or parts are
produced here, the official added.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have made no secret of their desire to improve the
automaker's economies of scale by building just a few vehicle
underbodies, engines and transmissions and then varying the sheet
metal that goes over them.
</P>
<P>
   GM, the world's largest automaker, previously used 22 vehicle
underbody designs, each costing more than $500 million to engineer
and sometimes differing by millimeters. Now the company has 14
chassis and plans to shrink the number to nine within the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Anger started to build here two years ago, when GM decided that
a long-awaited Saturn mid-size sedan, scheduled to go on sale next
year, would share an underbody with the Opel Astra sedan from GM's
Opel division in Germany. The Saturn SL will be produced in
Wilmington, Del., at a much older GM factory with a more
traditional union agreement than here.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn employees are particularly distressed to see work being
done elsewhere because the small-car market is withering, as low
gasoline prices and tax breaks for light-truck buyers have
persuaded many Americans to buy sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks instead. Small-car sales dropped 7.6 percent during the
first half of this year compared with the first half of last year,
while sales of sport utility vehicles rose 18.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn now makes only small cars, with prices ranging from
$10,595 for an economy version to $17,500 for a sports coupe with
lots of options. Even within the small-car market, Saturn has been
losing ground in the last two years to Asian competitors that have
used the weakness of their home currencies to offer lavish rebates
and other discounts. During the first half of this year, Saturn's
sales tumbled 9.4 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's reliance on small cars worries even workers like
Barbara Mason, a transmission-gear assembly worker here who
supports the current arrangement. ``Our biggest concern is job
security,'' she said over a glass of iced tea at the Poplar House
Restaurant, a diner near the factory. ``We need something to come
online to preserve our job security.''

JUDGE'S FORAY INTO HEALTH CARE POLITICS RAISES EYEBROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge from Boston Tuesday made what legal
experts called a rare and ethically questionable foray into the
volatile health care debate in Congress, joining lawmakers at a
news conference called to promote an expanded right for patients to
sue health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge William G. Young said he was simply speaking
about a ruling he made in an insurance case last year, and that he
did not endorse any legislation. But several specialists in legal
ethics said his appearance was imprudent, and one said it might
disqualify Young from hearing insurance cases in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inescapable fact is that he is lending the prestige of his
judicial office to one side in a political debate,'' said Stephen
Gillers, a law professor at New York University who writes on
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is certainly a mistake and could be construed as
a violation of judicial ethics,'' Geoffrey Hazard, a judicial
ethics specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said before
the Capitol Hill event took place. ``He will be speaking, by his
presence at least, on a political and very volatile issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, a Republican-appointed judge, appeared at a news
conference where Senator Edward M. Kennedy and four other lawmakers
urged Congress to change a federal law that bars 123 million
Americans from suing health insurers for denying needed medical
care. The change is being promoted most heavily by Democrats, who
see the issue as a winner for them at the polls this November.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Young made an impassioned speech about
his October decision to dismiss a claim by a Haverhill, Mass. woman
against an insurer. In that case, Diane Andrews-Clarke said
Travelers Insurance Co. contributed to her husband's death because
its agents denied him a treatment for alcoholism that was
specifically covered by his health policy. Young's opinion sharply
criticized the law that forced him to dismiss the case, as well as
Congress for failing to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene-stealing speech, TuesdayYoung told reporters that
Andrews-Clarke deserved a jury trial on her claim. ``Wherever an
American citizen is denied a jury trial anywhere, American
democracy is reduced everywhere,'' he said. A large poster, created
by Kennedy's staff, featured a photograph of Young and two quotes
from his opinion in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars said it is not uncommon for a judge to offer an
emotional ruling from the bench, and that the judicial code of
conduct encourages judges to offer their opinions in ways that help
improve the law. But judges are encouraged to do so at bar
association meetings, academic conferences, and in similar forums,
not at overtly political events.
</P>
<P>
   A Capitol Hill news conference, coming amid heated congressional
debate, ``is not a judicial place,'' said Gillers of NYU.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Lubet, who specializes in judicial ethics at
Northwestern University, said Young violated no rules, even though
the news conference probably fell outside the boundaries that allow
judges to write, teach, and speak on matters involving improvement
of laws. ``It strikes me as possibly imprudent, but not
prohibited,'' Lubet said.
</P>
<P>
   At the event Tuesday, Young said he had a ``duty'' to speak on
the matter of health insurance law. ``A judge is not prevented from
speaking out about judicial administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Young considered the question of whether
appearing at the news conference would force his recusal from
future insurance cases. ``I will take it on a case-by-case basis,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he had confined himself to commenting on a case he
had already decided, and that gave no opinion on legislation. ``A
judge is entitled to speak on a matter of public importance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lubet said that Young probably faces little risk of
disqualification from future cases, as he proved in the
Andrews-Clarke case that he is willing to enforce laws that he
considers unfair. ``He's shown himself to be marvelously impartial
in that he applies a law with which he disagrees,'' Lubet said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was appointed to the federal bench by President Reagan in
1984. He presided over the municipal bond kickback trial of Mark S.
Ferber. Last month, he issued the injunction barring former au pair
Louise Woodward from spending money she earns from the sale of her
story before Woodward faces civil claims in the death of Matthew
Eapen. As a state judge, Young presided over the ``Big Dan's''
trial, in which four men were convicted for a gang-rape at a New
Beford, Mass. tavern.
</P>
<P>
   As a federal judge, Young is bound by the Code of Conduct for
United States Judges, which says that ``a judge should refrain from
political activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillers said that appearing at the news conference might violate
that provision, as well as provisions that urge judges to uphold
the ``independence'' of the judiciary and not to ``lend the
prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the code says that judges should not join
activities that would force them to recuse themselves from future
lawsuits, Gillers said. The code was approved by the federal
judges' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gillers compared Young's appearance on Capitol Hill to the case
of US District Judge Patrick F. Kelly of Kansas, who appeared on
the television program ``Nightline'' in 1991 amid an ongoing
protest by the antiabortion group Operation Rescue that closed
Wichita abortion clinics and sent protesters before Kelly's court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a federal appeals court overturned the convictions of
five protesters, saying Kelly's TV appearance raised questions
about his impartiality. The appeals court ordered a new trial by a
different judge.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS CITES STEEP DROP IN EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Instruments Inc., the leading maker of semiconductors for
mobile phones, Tuesday reported a greater-than-expected decline in
second-quarter profit, attributing it to weak prices for memory
chips.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based company's net income fell to $43 million, or 11
cents a share, down from $249 million or 65 cents, in the same
period a year earlier. Texas Instruments' earnings before charges
fell to $142 million, or 35 cents a diluted share, from $213
million, or 54 cents, before charges and gains in the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected earnings before the charges of 37 cents a
share, according to a survey by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues declined about 15 percent, to $2.17 billion from $2.56
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor industry is ailing because of a global
oversupply of chips, falling prices and the economic turmoil in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were also hurt by flat sales of digital signal
processors, the chips used in cellular phones and disk drives.
Sales of the specialized chips were unchanged from the first
quarter, although up from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments said it expected prices to remain depressed in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the dynamic random-access memory chips used in
personal computers fell about 30 percent from the previous quarter
and about 70 percent from the same period a year ago, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments agreed last month to sell its memory-chip
operations to the rival Micron Technology Inc. for $641 million in
stock plus $190 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texas Instruments rose $2, to $60.9375, in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Texas Instruments set aside $233 million before taxes in the
second quarter to pay for a revamping that included the sale of its
memory chip business to Micron and the elimination of 3,500
employees through layoffs and attrition. The company also reported
a gain of $83 million from the sale of its joint venture with Acer
Corp. to Acer.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., said demand for digital
signal processors should pick up next year, driven by an expected
recovery in disk drive sales, as well as the introduction of new
products that incorporate the chips, such as motor controllers for
refrigerators and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   William Aylesworth, Texas Instrument's chief financial officer,
said the unusual sluggishness in the digital signal processor
market was largely because of economic woes in Asia, which had been
one of the fastest-growing markets for the chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the third quarter, there is going to be continued
pressure on margins because of the weak orders from the second
quarter,'' Aylesworth said.

EX-CENTENNIAL OFFICIAL GIVES UP ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bond Fletcher made a fortune trading stock in Centennial
Technologies Inc. in 1996 and 1997, enabling him to live a lavish
lifestyle that included an impressive collection of houses, cars,
boats _ even an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the 36-year-old sidekick to Emanuel Pinez,
Centennial's disgraced former chief executive, agreed to give up
virtually everything to settle fraud charges brought by the
Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who was accused of helping &UR;  &LR; Pinez in a scam to drive
up Centennial's stock price, was ordered Tuesday by US District
Court Judge Patti B. Saris to pay back more than $7 million in
illegally obtained profits. Fletcher previously pleaded guilty in a
separate criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Under a civil settlement with the SEC made public Tuesday,
Fletcher will pay approximately $3 million _ all that he says he
can afford. The balance was waived by the court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cash and securities in various bank and brokerage
accounts, Fletcher must surrender his spacious Beverly, Mass. home,
his private airplane, five vehicles _ including a Ferrari, a Land
Rover and two Harley Davidson motorcycles _ three boats and several
jet skis.
</P>
<P>
   He must also relinquish at least 238,000 shares of Centennial
stock that he claims he is owed by Pinez, and any additional
property valued at more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher will retain ownership of his business in Beverly,
Mediajet Inc., which makes computer font cartridges, and a 1992
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   While he must give up his primary residence in Beverly, he gets
to keep a home on an island in New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee
and a 24-foot pontoon boat to access the property. The house in New
Hampshire is held in trust for his daughter, as is another home in
West Virginia, where his daughter and ex-wife currently reside. The
West Virginia home is not part of the settlement either.
</P>
<P>
   The house in Beverly and other personal property will be
surrendered within 10 days to a court-appointed receiver, who will
sell them. The proceeds will then be distributed to Centennial
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   SEC attorney Grant Ward said the ultimate value of the
settlement depends on the sale price of Fletcher's assets, but they
were estimated to be worth $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the SEC was first to win a judgment against Fletcher,
several other parties _ including his ex-wife, a former girlfriend
and Centennial shareholders _ are also suing to obtain his assets,
so various legal complications remain. It's unclear when
shareholders will see any money from the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who was an executive at Centennial from 1987 to 1994,
was charged by the SEC in a criminal indictment with helping Pinez
create false records that inflated the company's revenues. The
alleged scam was intended to drive up Centennial's stock price and
boost the fortune of Pinez, who owned 25 percent of the company at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for helping to fabricate false purchase orders and
other documents that inflated Centennial's sales during 1996,
Fletcher received at least 260,000 shares of Centennial stock from
Pinez, which Fletcher &UR;  &LR; sold for nearly $7 million in late 1996 and
early 1997. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was discovered by Centennial's board of directors and
its outside auditing firm in February 1997. Pinez was immediately
fired and subsequently charged with securities fraud. Four others,
including Fletcher, were subsequently indicted. Fletcher is
cooperating with federal investigators. Meanwhile, Pinez remains in
jail, and faces a November trial.

contributions they received from an El Paso businessman convicted
of bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox's Republican opponent for the attorney general contest,
John Cornyn, demanded that Mattox return the $11,000 he received
from concrete company president Stanley Jobe. Mattox refused,
saying Jobe is a prominent El Paso civic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question Mattox's low ethical standards in accepting $11,000
from a convicted felon,'' Cornyn said. ``Does he want to fight
crime, or does he intend to make criminals his allies?''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the state attorney general has a ``moral and legal
obligation'' to fight crime and should not be taking money from
convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox, who was Texas attorney general from 1983-1990, said if
Cornyn believes what he says, then he should not have taken
campaign contributions as a state Supreme Court justice from
lawyers who had cases pending before the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Cornyn has trouble remaining impartial when somebody
contributes to him, but not me,'' Mattox said. ``Stanley Jobe is a
major civic figure who has given to state and national charities
and who has paid his debt to society.''
</P>
<P>
   People convicted of felonies cannot vote, but nothing bars them
from making campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe was convicted in 1994 of bank fraud with several other
businessmen in a scheme of floating checks. Jobe paid a $15,000
fine and served one month in a halfway house and five months in
home detention. Jobe has maintained his innocence and still is
appealing his case.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro spokesman Billy Rogers said Mauro has known Jobe for about
15 years and saw nothing wrong with the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley Jobe is a respected businessman in El Paso who is a
major contributor to Democrats as well as the United Way and the
University of Texas at El Paso athletic department,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, the Texas land commissioner, came under fire last year
when he gave a $61,000-a-year state job to a former campaign
contributor, Ruben Johnson, who had just been released from prison
on bank fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush gingerly avoided answering
questions about whether his opponent, Mauro, should return $30,000
in contributions he received from Jobe. Bush said that would be up
to Mauro, though Bush said he would return such contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that I want to make sure that people know that
everything is above board in my campaign,'' Bush said. ``We don't
have background checks on everybody who gives, but if I were
notified that a convicted felon had given me money, I would give
the money back.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1994 and 1995, Bush apparently took $9,000 in
contributions from the families of four Texas men convicted of bank
fraud and income tax evasion who had received full pardons from
President Bush during his last days in office.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable of those individuals was Edwin L. Cox Jr. of
Dallas, the former chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department. Cox had been convicted of bank fraud in 1988 for
inflating the value of collateral for loans. Cox received a pardon
from President Bush on Jan. 18, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign reported receiving $2,000 from an Edwin L. Cox
of Dallas about a year after the pardon in 1994 and another $2,500
in 1995
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said she did not know if the
individuals pardoned were the same as those reported as
contributors by Bush, their fathers or their sons. Hughes noted
that any contributions would have been made after the pardons.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers declined to comment on the Bush contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Jobe's contributions erupted Tuesday after Jobe
sent angry letters to the El Paso Times and the Austin
American-Statesman complaining about Democratic lieutenant governor
candidate John Sharp returning his $10,750 contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe, who did not respond to calls Tuesday, told the papers that
Sharp knew he was a convicted felon when he received the money.
Sharp returned the money Friday after the El Paso paper contacted
his campaign, claiming he had not known about Jobe's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic comptroller candidate Paul Hobby also returned $1,000
he received from Jobe after learning of his conviction. Hobby, a
former federal prosecutor, said the donation was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent people to federal prison for bank fraud, and while I
know nothing of the facts in Mr. Jobe's case, I want to run a
campaign that is consistent and above reproach, Hobby said.''

JUDGE'S FORAY INTO HEALTH CARE POLITICS RAISES EYEBROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge from Boston Tuesday made what legal
experts called a rare and ethically questionable foray into the
volatile health care debate in Congress, joining lawmakers at a
news conference called to promote an expanded right for patients to
sue health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge William G. Young said he was simply speaking
about a ruling he made in an insurance case last year, and that he
did not endorse any legislation. But several specialists in legal
ethics said his appearance was imprudent, and one said it might
disqualify Young from hearing insurance cases in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inescapable fact is that he is lending the prestige of his
judicial office to one side in a political debate,'' said Stephen
Gillers, a law professor at New York University who writes on
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is certainly a mistake and could be construed as
a violation of judicial ethics,'' Geoffrey Hazard, a judicial
ethics specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said before
the Capitol Hill event took place. ``He will be speaking, by his
presence at least, on a political and very volatile issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, a Republican-appointed judge, appeared at a news
conference where Senator Edward M. Kennedy and four other lawmakers
urged Congress to change a federal law that bars 123 million
Americans from suing health insurers for denying needed medical
care. The change is being promoted most heavily by Democrats, who
see the issue as a winner for them at the polls this November.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Young made an impassioned speech about
his October decision to dismiss a claim by a Haverhill, Mass. woman
against an insurer. In that case, Diane Andrews-Clarke said
Travelers Insurance Co. contributed to her husband's death because
its agents denied him a treatment for alcoholism that was
specifically covered by his health policy. Young's opinion sharply
criticized the law that forced him to dismiss the case, as well as
Congress for failing to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene-stealing speech, TuesdayYoung told reporters that
Andrews-Clarke deserved a jury trial on her claim. ``Wherever an
American citizen is denied a jury trial anywhere, American
democracy is reduced everywhere,'' he said. A large poster, created
by Kennedy's staff, featured a photograph of Young and two quotes
from his opinion in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars said it is not uncommon for a judge to offer an
emotional ruling from the bench, and that the judicial code of
conduct encourages judges to offer their opinions in ways that help
improve the law. But judges are encouraged to do so at bar
association meetings, academic conferences, and in similar forums,
not at overtly political events.
</P>
<P>
   A Capitol Hill news conference, coming amid heated congressional
debate, ``is not a judicial place,'' said Gillers of NYU.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Lubet, who specializes in judicial ethics at
Northwestern University, said Young violated no rules, even though
the news conference probably fell outside the boundaries that allow
judges to write, teach, and speak on matters involving improvement
of laws. ``It strikes me as possibly imprudent, but not
prohibited,'' Lubet said.
</P>
<P>
   At the event Tuesday, Young said he had a ``duty'' to speak on
the matter of health insurance law. ``A judge is not prevented from
speaking out about judicial administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Young considered the question of whether
appearing at the news conference would force his recusal from
future insurance cases. ``I will take it on a case-by-case basis,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he had confined himself to commenting on a case he
had already decided, and that gave no opinion on legislation. ``A
judge is entitled to speak on a matter of public importance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lubet said that Young probably faces little risk of
disqualification from future cases, as he proved in the
Andrews-Clarke case that he is willing to enforce laws that he
considers unfair. ``He's shown himself to be marvelously impartial
in that he applies a law with which he disagrees,'' Lubet said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was appointed to the federal bench by President Reagan in
1984. He presided over the municipal bond kickback trial of Mark S.
Ferber. Last month, he issued the injunction barring former au pair
Louise Woodward from spending money she earns from the sale of her
story before Woodward faces civil claims in the death of Matthew
Eapen. As a state judge, Young presided over the ``Big Dan's''
trial, in which four men were convicted for a gang-rape at a New
Beford, Mass. tavern.
</P>
<P>
   As a federal judge, Young is bound by the Code of Conduct for
United States Judges, which says that ``a judge should refrain from
political activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillers said that appearing at the news conference might violate
that provision, as well as provisions that urge judges to uphold
the ``independence'' of the judiciary and not to ``lend the
prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the code says that judges should not join
activities that would force them to recuse themselves from future
lawsuits, Gillers said. The code was approved by the federal
judges' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gillers compared Young's appearance on Capitol Hill to the case
of US District Judge Patrick F. Kelly of Kansas, who appeared on
the television program ``Nightline'' in 1991 amid an ongoing
protest by the antiabortion group Operation Rescue that closed
Wichita abortion clinics and sent protesters before Kelly's court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a federal appeals court overturned the convictions of
five protesters, saying Kelly's TV appearance raised questions
about his impartiality. The appeals court ordered a new trial by a
different judge.

JERRY HERMAN: CELEBRATING HIS MUSIC AND PRECIOUS LIFE ITSELF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry Herman is returning to Broadway this week on
a deeply personal note. The 66-year-old composer-lyricist for such
huge successes as ``Hello, Dolly!,'' ``Mame'' and ``La Cage Aux
Folles'' _ a Broadway figure who is both a symbol of a golden era
and an undervalued songwriter _ was found to have HIV 13 years ago
and watched his health decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in bad shape, I was losing ground,'' Herman said
quietly, seated in the airy living room of his home in Bel Air. ``I
watched my friends disappear and I was positive I was going to be
next. I was frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, Herman's doctor suggested an
experimental regimen involving protease inhibitors designed to
build up the immune system. ``Three weeks later, I woke up one
morning and said, `Maybe it's my optimism, because I am the most
optimistic person on this planet, but I think this is working.'''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said his viral load now is undetectable, his T-cells,
part of the immune system, have risen to ``a comfortable level''
and his energy is back. Although he takes protease inhibitors after
every meal, the outgoing and perennially smiling composer said his
restored health _ he also had a triple heart bypass last year _
energized him for the first time in a decade and has led to ``An
Evening With Jerry Herman,'' starring Lee Roy Reams, Florence Lacey
and Herman himself at the Booth Theater for a two-month run that
opens on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The show, in which Herman will sing as well as accompany Ms.
Lacey and Reams _ both veterans of his musicals _ developed from
the composer's 1989 stint, with Reams, at Rainbow and Stars. That
club date has evolved into a theater piece that was fine tuned last
year at Westport, Conn., and Dennis, Mass., among other places, and
this past spring at Coconut Grove in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The evening includes music from Herman's hits and, even more
significant for him, from shows that failed, like ``Mack and
Mabel'' and ``Dear World,'' which probably includes his best music.
(In England, ``Mack and Mabel' fared better; it won the Evening
Standard award for best musical.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a celebration,'' the composer explained. ``I'm getting
out there and saying, `Hey, everybody, I'm well.'''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds, of course, like a happy Jerry Herman song that
closes Act I of a glitzy musical starring Carol Channing or Angela
Lansbury. The composer himself, whose candor is matched by his
cheerfulness, acknowledged almost with a laugh that he is, most
certainly, a throwback to an era on Broadway that has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   His elegant home includes a basement that he proudly displays to
visitors _ actually a museum with framed posters, reviews, awards
and costumed mannequins from his hit shows.
</P>
<P>
   What seems deceptive about Herman is that, for all his Broadway
gossip and dish about the old days, the composer is shrewdly
self-aware and, with only a sliver of annoyance, views himself as
not as fully appreciated by critics as he should be.
</P>
<P>
   Herman has always been more popular with audiences than critics,
although he said that Walter Kerr and Clive Barnes were longtime
advocates. His three major hits ran more than 1,500 performances
each, a record for a composer-lyricist. (And give Herman a hefty
annual income.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would have liked more important people in the business
to have recognized that it's not that easy to write a song like
`Mame' _ it sounds easy but it's not,'' he said. ``And it's true I
choose to write as simply as I can _ although I wrote some very
complicated material in `Dear World' that Walter Kerr said was
close to light opera. I know how to do that, but I love writing
songs that people can hear twice and leave the theater knowing at
least the first eight bars of the song. That means a lot to me. And
what I really want, more than anything else, is to be an
entertainer, to entertain masses of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable comparisons with his contemporary, Stephen
Sondheim, dismay him. The two men are, of course, polar opposites.
If Herman's supple melodies and simple lyrics are reminders of
Irving Berlin _ and Herman still remembers seeing ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' on Broadway as a 14-year-old and returning home to Jersey
City and heading straight to the piano to play two songs from the
show for his parents _ Sondheim's modernist compositional style is
vastly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think there's a feud between Sondheim and me; that's
absolute nonsense,'' Herman said. ``We're worlds apart. He comes
from another place. I had him to a party once for Angela and Carol
and we all sat around a piano and sang and it was very lovely. I
mean, I worship this man's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman moved to Bel Air from New York in the early 1990s at a
low point in his life. His companion, Martin Finkelstein, a space
planner and designer, had died of AIDS at the age of 36 in 1989.

 &HT;    Earnings back up BellSouth's strategy
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- BellSouth Corp. announced record revenue and earnings
Tuesday, citing the quarterly results as a clear sign the company
is shifting away from dependence on traditional local phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended June 30, the Atlanta-based
telecommunications company reported revenues of $5.66 billion,
compared with $4.92 billion during the same period a year ago.
Earnings during the second quarter were 82 cents per share, up from
66 cents per share in 1997. Net income for the quarter was $818
million, up from $701 million during the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great growth for a big phone company,'' said Jeff
John, research associate at Robinson-Humphrey. ``I think they are
doing a fairly good job of managing the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   In two years, BellSouth has gone from the largest regional phone
company to the second smallest while analysts have speculated on
how long it can avoid a marriage. But officials cite quarterly
results as vindication for a strategy of independence in an era of
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive officer, boasted
that the quarter numbers show rapid growth in the newest services,
as well as in its traditional phone services. ``We're generating
solid growth across all areas of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has embarked on a three-legged plan for success _
local service to the Southeast, wireless phones and an ambitious
international business. While still strong, the long-established
business on the home turf is slowly becoming less dominant.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's growth in access lines in the Southeast was only 4
percent. By contrast, digital and data services, which accounted
for $432 million in revenue, were up 44 percent from a year ago.
The operating revenues of BellSouth's phone unit accounted for
$4.14 billion in revenue _ about 73 percent of company sales. A
year ago, BellSouth local service represented $3.75 billion in
revenue, or 76 percent of the total. About 11 percent of the phone
unit's revenues came last quarter from data services, up from 8.8
percent a year earlier, according to BellSouth spokesman Al
Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Even how BellSouth sells local service is changing. The lines
being sold _ especially to businesses _ are increasingly high-speed
lines, like those called ISDN. And residential customers are
signing up in record numbers for profitable features like caller ID
and voice messaging. Those calling features provided $392 million
in revenue, up 19 percent from the same quarter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of BellSouth customers have caller ID,
Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of wireless is also strong. In its wireless operations in
the United States, BellSouth has added 563,000 customers, up 14
percent from a year ago. But perhaps BellSouth's most promising
numbers came from overseas, where it has invested billions of
dollars to buy licenses and build wireless networks, mostly in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's international revenues last quarter were $472.2
million, up nearly 48 percent from the same period a year ago. The
company now has nearly 1 million international customers, a 69
percent jump _ much of it due to the start of service in Brazil, a
market of potentially huge importance.
</P>
<P>
   The venture co-owned by BellSouth in Brazil currently has
280,000 subscribers in Sao Paulo, with about 1.7 million others on
a waiting list, according to John Price, spokesman for BellSouth
International.
</P>
<P>
   And after years of cutting its work force from a crest of more
than 100,000, BellSouth now has 86,188 employees, 3,219 more than a
year ago. However, the phone unit, which contains most of the
company's unionized workers, shrank by 3,079 to 59,700 workers.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is currently in talks with the Communications Workers
of America, aimed at reaching an accord before contracts expire
Aug. 8.

 &HT;    Intellivoice believes it has the right touch _ none
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- No hands.
</P>
<P>
   A still-small but ambitious Atlanta company is betting its
growth on the trend toward ever-more sophisticated consumers who
want wireless technology and the ability to use it without touching
any buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Technology from Intellivoice Communications permits users of
wireless phones to dial by giving oral commands to the phone. The
same system allows a phone user to navigate through an answering
party's voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   The capability is convenient any time but especially for someone
driving a car at the same time as wanting to make a phone call.
Studies have shown a correlation between auto accidents and
drivers' use of wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Intellivoice is hoping the trend in wireless parallels the move
in wire-line phones toward more features. BellSouth, for example,
has reaped increasingly large profits from its marketing of
features like caller ID, call waiting, call forwarding and
three-way calling. Intellivoice believes it can be in the perfect
place if the same thing happens with wireless phones, said Beth
Abernathy, president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that hope is a recent survey by Yankee Group that
shows wireless phone users picked voice-activated dialing as their
most-desired feature _ over voice mail, caller ID and other
options.
</P>
<P>
   Intellivoice, founded 10 years ago, has 60 employees _ about
one-third of them engineers, Abernathy said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still privately held, and revenue is less than
$30 million a year. But a public offering of stock depends more on
consistency than on magnitude, Abernathy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An IPO is a goal, an objective of this company. We need more
predictable revenue before we are properly positioned to go that
route.''
</P>
<P>
   But the telecommunications world is shifting so quickly the
winds could easily shift in an IPO's favor _ perhaps even with one
big deal, she said. ``It could happen a month from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more positive news was last week's announcement of a
deal for Intellivoice to provide voice recognition systems to
Ericsson, technology the huge Swedish telecommunications firm will
market in Chile. Intellivoice equipment will be added to Ericsson's
network switches, making it possible for Ericsson phone users to
make calls without dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America has become increasingly enticing for Atlanta-based
telecommunications companies. Yankee Group predicts the number of
Latin American wireless subscribers will grow from 9 million last
year to 43 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is the largest investor, spending billions of dollars
on licenses and networks. World Access, an Atlanta-based equipment
maker, has announced a series of deals, including the recent start
of network services in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Intellivoice, too, sees enormous possibilities in Latin America,
Abernathy said. ``Chile is just the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress north of the border has been promising, if somewhat
halting. The company has linked with several big companies, but the
market has not yet grown enough to fuel the growth for which
Intellivoice hopes. Still, the trend is in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``blue chip'' customers Intellivoice has signed up so
far are Bell Atlantic's wireless unit, which has 500,000 customers
using Intellivoice technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intellivoice also has deals to provide its expertise and
equipment to Boston Technology, Comverse and Atlanta-based Premiere
Technologies, which has gone so far as to invest in Intellivoice.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere sees Intellivoice as one key to creating systems that
provide ``unified messaging,'' giving a user access to voice mail
and e-mail from either phone or computer.

 &HT;    Countdown clock ticks on downtown arena
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- From center court (or center ice for hockey fans) the
red and white banner hangs high over the new downtown arena under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   July 26, 1999, the banner reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the day we turn it over to the owners,'' said Bob
Evans, construction superintendent for Atlanta Arena Constructors,
a consortium of contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see them put that sign up,'' said Janet Marie
Smith, who as president of Turner Sports and Entertainment
Development Inc. is coordinating the $250 million arena project.
She knows Turner will need a couple of months after the
construction is completed to add all the finishing touches.
Operations such as food and beverage will have to be in place in
time for the first event, which likely will be an exhibition game
of the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got no choice but to be on time,'' said Stan Kasten,
president of the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Braves. ``We are
playing in the fall of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The arena is beginning to take shape as concrete is poured,
showing the outline of the seating bowl and the unique design of
the skyboxes. The Atlanta arena will be the first designed to stack
luxury suites on one side of the building. That design eliminates a
suite-level concourse, permitting everyone in the arena to sit
closer to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we think about it, the happier we are with that
decision,'' Kasten said. ``I'm at that point where I'm getting more
excited every week as we peel off another layer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they went on sale May 7, buyers have committed to 90
percent of the 90 suites, despite the annual price tag, which
starts at $62,000 for half a suite and goes to $225,000 for a full
suite.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,236 club seats, located just below the suites, went on
sale this week. They start at $8,000 each and go up to $9,500,
depending on location. Priority will go to Hawks season ticket
holders and people tied in with the new Thrashers team.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Turner sports development executives are
borrowing heavily from ideas tried at Turner Field. The Hawks Walk
and the Thrashers Nest will be open to the public at non-event
times. When an event is taking place, the old Omni scoreboard will
let people outside on the concourse know how the game is going.
They also will have clear views to the court. There will be an
arena version of Turner Field's Chop House and Skyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just in the process of interviewing programmers and
animators,'' Kasten said. ``We have the concepts. Now we have to
start putting more flesh on those bones.''
</P>
<P>
   The big decision facing Kasten is selling the right to name the
arena to a corporation. Kasten would not disclose how many or which
companies are included in the naming rights negotiations or how
much money he believes that sponsorship will generate.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Inc. paid $100 million for the right to name the new
basketball arena in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end product will be tailored to the needs of the naming
partner,'' Kasten said. ``We have a value that no other arena has,
over and above the unique building. We are located in between one
of the busiest convention centers in the world and CNN, one of the
top three most respected brands in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said the naming rights deal will be done by the end of
the year, and perhaps as early as Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The builders are doing their part to get the building done on
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner has a huge obligation to the NHL, and we have to
back that commitment,'' said Evans, who worked on the team that
built the Georgia Dome and the Atlanta Federal Center. ``They can't
slap our hands and call our moms and dads. We haven't let them down
before, and we won't now.''

 LOS ANGELES: in 1989.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was unbearably painful, the only time in my life that I had
a really serious relationship,'' Herman said. The composer himself
was ailing. So he sold his East 61st Street townhouse to Sally
Jessy Raphael and bought an 18,000-square-foot mansion in Bel Air
from the television producer David Wolper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only time in my life when I knew depression _
that's what made me leave New York and come to a place where I have
sunshine every day, where I hear birds every morning,'' said
Herman, who was now sitting at a table beside his swimming pool as
a cook served chicken-salad sandwiches and iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   His professional experience in Hollywood was less happy. The
1969 ``Hello, Dolly!'' starring Barbra Streisand, was, he said, ``a
heartbreaker.'' Gene Kelly, the director, wouldn't speak to him:
Kelly is one of the few people somewhat harshly treated by Herman
in his 1996 memoir, ``Showtune,'' written with Marilyn Stasio, a
book critic who writes the Crime column for The New York Times Book
Review.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Streisand's extraordinary voice, he said, she was
far too young to play the 60-year-old Dolly. ``She turned in a
really skillful performance; the problem was the direction,'' he
said. ``They tried to make it real, and `Dolly' is, more than
anything I've written, a farce and a cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1974 ``Mame,'' starring Lucille Ball, was even worse. ``I
begged them to cast Angela Lansbury,'' Herman said; Ms. Lansbury
had starred in the 1966 Broadway version. ``The movie was totally
unsatisfying. Lucille Ball turned in a hard-working performance,
but she couldn't sing, she couldn't dance. She was a clown. And
Mame is an elegant sophisticate.''
</P>
<P>
   Have any of his other musicals turned into films? ``Thank God,
no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years in which he grappled with his health, Herman didn't
write very much but, in his words ``kept the Dolly torch alive,''
meaning he worked on the numerous productions of the musical.
Several times over the years he has been offered the opportunity to
turn the film ``Pocketful of Miracles'' into a musical. The movie,
a 1961 remake of ``Lady for a Day,'' starred Bette Davis as a
street vendor who turns into a grand lady for one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look at it I think, `Yeah, this is like a Jerry
Herman musical that I should have done 20 years ago,''' he said.
``It doesn't have anything really fresh or new or exciting to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime he wrote ``Mrs. Santa Claus,'' his first
television musical, for his friend Ms. Lansbury; it was broadcast
on CBS in 1996. He has also asked various writers, including
Terrence McNally, about coming up with ideas for a Broadway
musical, but nothing has seized his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had great source material _ `Auntie Mame,' `The
Matchmaker' for `Hello, Dolly!,' `La Cage Aux Folles,' _ you
couldn't ask for anything better,'' he said. ``They all had
something to say. It wasn't just mindless.'' The anthem `` `I Am
What I Am' came out of `La Cage.' And when I get material that
doesn't give me something to write about, I just say to myself,
`I'm not going to go through the drama that you have to go through
on Broadway.'''
</P>
<P>
   What seems to please Herman most about the current show is that
it features what is perhaps his most haunting music: from the three
productions that failed on Broadway. One is ``Mack and Mabel,'' now
something of a cult classic, which starred Bernadette Peters and
Robert Preston, as Mabel Normand and Mack Sennett. (``Bob Preston
was much, much older than Bernadette, and Gower Champion, the most
brilliant musical stager, found it difficult to recreate the look
of silent film.'')
</P>
<P>
   The two others are ``Dear World,'' an adaptation of ``The
Madwoman of Chaillot,'' starring Ms. Lansbury, for which she won a
Tony Award, and ``The Grand Tour,'' based on the S.N. Behrman play
``Jacobowsky and the Colonel.'' It starred Joel Grey and Ms. Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   One melancholy song from ``The Grand Tour'' has special
resonance for Herman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the song for the character but I was actually writing
it for myself,'' he said. Smiling, he began to sing:
</P>
<P>
   I'll be here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Alive and well and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply called surviving.

IN POLITICAL PLOY, SENATE MOVES TO WIDEN CLINTON'S TRADE POWERS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Finance Committee voted Tuesday to give
the president enhanced authority to negotiate international trade
agreements, setting up an unusual political confrontation with the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton badly wants this authority, called fast track,
which would allow him to negotiate trade accords that Congress
could not amend but only vote up or down. In his State of the Union
Message, he called the authority ``necessary to open more new
markets, create more new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does not want to deal with the matter now.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who control Congress want him to have fast-track
authority. And they especially want to deal with it now.
</P>
<P>
   The president does not want to address the question this year
because fast-track legislation is opposed by the vast majority of
Democrats in the House and by the labor unions that are the
Democrats' biggest donors and most loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   An open division on such a sensitive issue is the last thing the
Democrats need when they and the president are campaigning together
to try to win enough seats in the November election to regain
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The split between the president and Democrats in the House is,
of course, the precise reason the Republican congressional leaders
are now planning to vote on the matter in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' strategy is to first bring up the matter in the
Senate, where procedural votes last year demonstrated that
fast-track legislation would pass by a filibuster-proof margin. The
Finance Committee approved the bill Tuesday by a vote of 18-2.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to fast-track authority, the bill would promote
trade in sub-Saharan Africa, implement an international
shipbuilding pact, allow some Caribbean countries to send some
products to the United States free of duties and quotas, grant
normal trade status to Mongolia and extend training programs in
communities where workers have lost jobs because of trade
agreements. The White House supports these provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican view is that Senate passage of the fast-track
measure would raise the stakes in the House. Last month House
Speaker Newt Gingrich promised a vote before adjournment for the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-track legislation was pulled from the House floor last
November before it could be voted down. The opposition was led by
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and about 80 percent of the
Democrats sided with him. They were joined by a few dozen
Republicans. Nose counts showed that the measure would have been
rejected by a margin of 20 votes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders maintain that the prospects this year have
improved. ``My instinct is that a lot of members who were wavering
last fall now realize that it's important for us to pass this,''
Gingrich said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., chairman of the Agriculture Committee,
said he thought he could pick up an additional 30 votes from
lawmakers in farm states.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats in the House, even those who support the
fast-track legislation, doubt that much has changed. ``I frankly
still don't see the votes here,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui of
California, a leader of the Democrats who favored the fast-track
bill last year.
</P>
<P>
   White House tacticians say that their vote counts show that
their position on the issue in the House has not improved since
last year. Presidential press secretary Mike McCurry said Tuesday
that the Republican stance was ``more political mischief than
commitment to free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Every president since Gerald Ford in the mid-1970s has had the
fast-track authority. Without it, trade discussions would be
difficult. Other countries would be reluctant to sign accords that
Congress could pick apart bit by bit. The Clinton administration
used the authority to get the North American Free Trade Agreement
through Congress in 1993. But Clinton's fast-track authority
expired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups generally favor free trade. So do farm
organizations, although some individual farmers are opposed,
particularly those who think they have been hurt by imported wheat
from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition comes from labor unions, who fear that
low-paid workers overseas will get American jobs.

PUBLIC SLOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE SEX DISEASE THREAT TO NEWBORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While scientists are making strides in understanding how common
sexually transmitted diseases can dramatically increase the risk of
both low-weight, premature babies and HIV infection, Americans'
reluctance to talk about such diseases is getting in the way of
confronting this public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that a pregnant woman with gonorrhea has a 50
percent risk of having a baby at a weight low enough to put it at
risk, compared to a 7 percent risk in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me that people don't want to talk about it,'' said
Dr. Laura Riley, director of infectious diseases in obstetrics and
gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Riley said she had
suggested the topic for a network morning televison program, but
``they wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suspect that bacteria from the vagina often get into
the uterus _ which should be sterile _ and into the amniotic fluid,
where they can ``produce toxins which set off the cascade of
labors,'' and trigger extreme prematurity, said Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The link between STDs and AIDS was strengthened by a 1996 report
by the Institutes of Medicine that showed an existing STD also
increases a person's chance of HIV infection when exposed to the
HIV virus by three to five times.
</P>
<P>
   There are different likely mechanisms, said Dr. Michael St.
Louis, chief of epidemiology and surveillance with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   One is that an STD increases the shedding of HIV cells in
genital fluids as much as tenfold; also, some STDs cause a
breakdown of the skin cell membranes, creating a portal of entry
for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Although common STDs, including gonorrhea, syphilis and
chlamydia, can be cured with single-dose drug therapy, the benefits
of intervention receive relatively little attention from the media
and medical providers, St. Louis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's striking that it hasn't gotten tremendous interest.
People think of STDs as a problem where people get what they
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are particularly susceptible to contracting STDs because
of the complexity of their reproductive anatomy and because of the
difficulty in many cases of getting male partners to use condoms.
Also, STDS in women especially are hard to diagnose when they are
in a stage without symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   And, women with STDs are at greater risk than men of becoming
infected with AIDS. According to a study by the University of
California at San Francisco, women are about eight times more
likely to be infected with HIV by a male partner than men are by a
female partner.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis said the CDC has documented many instances of doctors,
even gynecologists, not asking their patients questions about
sexual behavior and assessing risk.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those at risk are not screened or treated, leading
in many cases to reproductive cancers, chronic pelvic pain,
sterility and spontaneous abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Properly screening and treating pregnant women for STDs will
also decrease the numbers of extremely premature babies and the
associated emotional, physical and financial burdens, St. Louis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The highest rates of syphilis and gonorrhea are concentrated in
communities in the South where HIV prevalence among childbearing
women is also the highest in the country, according to the 1996
study.
</P>
<P>
   But in communities with improved STD treatment, the incidence of
HIV infection decreased an average of 42 percent compared with
communities that had minimal services, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
   Newer and simpler diagnostic urine tests and improved therapies
can greatly reduce the dollars spent treating the consequences of
STDs, St. Louis said. ``We have greatly underinvested in the
prevention of STDs.''

CLINTON ORDERS CRACKDOWN ON SUBSTANDARD NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.Y., Conn., N.J., Alaska, Del., S.D., Utah, Kan.,
Calif., Texas)  (th) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday ordered a crackdown on
nursing homes that abuse patients or repeatedly violate health and
safety standards established by Congress 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that inspections were too predictable, Clinton told state
officials to inspect nursing homes at night and on weekends ``so
there is no time to hide neglect and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the government said, a nursing home has ``near
certainty that it will never be surveyed on weekends or during
evening hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton said, ``Whenever we find evidence that a
nursing home is failing to provide its residents with proper care
or even mistreating them, we will fine that facility on the spot.''
In the past, nursing homes were often given many opportunities to
correct problems before being fined.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed federal officials to focus their enforcement
efforts on nursing home chains with a history of poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Government data show that two-thirds of nursing homes in the
United States are not fully complying with federal standards. And
in four states, federal officials said, virtually no nursing homes
were cited for serious deficiencies last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's actions followed prodding by Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
Grassley plans to hold hearings on the subject next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Tuesday was the latest twist in a 17-year
struggle over the regulation of nursing homes. Efforts by President
Ronald Reagan to relax the rules died in a storm of bipartisan
protest.
</P>
<P>
   After a study by the National Academy of Sciences, Congress set
stringent, detailed standards for nursing homes in a 1987 law. The
Clinton administration issued rules to carry out the law in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala sent
Congress a report evaluating compliance and enforcement in the
three years since the rules were issued.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the administration said that the average number
of violations found in nursing home surveys ``has declined steadily
for the last few years, for reasons that remain unknown.'' While
the overall quality of care may have improved, it said, states vary
in their willingness or ability to detect serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ordering more inspections, Clinton announced several
other initiatives to improve the quality of care in nursing homes
and to reduce the number of patients with bedsores, dehydration and
nutrition problems.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will significantly increase the number of nursing
homes identified as ``poor performers,'' officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About $80 billion a year is spent on the care of 1.6 million
people in more than 17,000 nursing homes. The federal government
helps finance care for two-thirds of the patients, through Medicaid
and Medicare. Most inspections are conducted by state employees,
under formal agreements with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked Congress to increase the budget for
inspections by $13 million, to $167 million next year. To help pay
for some of the new initiatives, Clinton wants authority to collect
``user fees'' from nursing homes that care for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now writing an appropriations bill to provide money
for federal health programs. Clinton appears likely to get at least
some of the extra money he requested for nursing home inspections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In adopting a tougher stance, Clinton defied the advice of
nursing home executives who urged the administration to relax
enforcement of federal standards even as they gave hundreds of
thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Just 19 months ago some administration officials proposed to
scale back inspections of nursing homes that care for elderly
people under Medicaid and Medicare. The White House spurned those
ideas soon after they were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In its report to Congress, the administration Tuesday
emphatically rejected proposals to let a private organization
inspect nursing homes for compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it found ``overwhelming evidence'' that
inspectors from the private body, the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, ``often miss serious
deficiencies,'' including the deaths of some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said, ``We have concluded that private accreditation
organizations would actually put nursing home residents in
jeopardy. They are not tough enough, they miss a lot of things, and
we are telling Congress formally now that we will not allow private
accreditation agencies to substitute for state reviews of nursing
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis O'Leary, president of the joint accreditation
commission, said he could not comment on the report because he had
not read it. But in an interview, he said, ``We believe we can do
at least as good a job as the federal government and the states in
the evaluation of nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that nursing homes, at their best, ``can be a
godsend for older Americans.'' But, he added, ``at their worst,
they can actually endanger their residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton instructed states to increase inspections of repeat
offenders, and to impose civil fines for each instance of serious
or chronic violations. Until now, penalties were based on the
number of days a nursing home was out of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection reports will be posted on the Internet, so the public
can find out exactly how well a specific nursing home complies with
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked Congress to establish a national register of
nursing home employees convicted of abusing patients. Cases of
physical abuse and assault are surprisingly common.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton asked Congress to require nursing homes to
conduct criminal background checks of all potential employees. And
he told the Justice Department to step up prosecutions in cases
where patients suffer harm because of ``egregious violations'' of
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Data in the report show that New York state cited two nursing
homes for ``substandard quality of care'' last year, while
Connecticut and New Jersey cited eight each.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, Delaware, South Dakota and Utah had no nursing homes
cited for substandard care, the report said. But, the data show,
Kansas issued 70 such citations, California issued 65 and Texas
issued 52.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health
Department, said: ``We feel the quality of care in nursing homes is
very high in New York. We are about 10 years ahead of other states
in having a rigorous enforcement program. As a result, our homes
consistently meet high standards.'' &QL;

A MATCHMAKER PROMISES BLISS IN `TRISTAN'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Wash.)   (af)  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No one else runs an opera company, or talks about
opera, with the fervor of Speight Jenkins. ``You see, in `Tristan
und Isolde,' Wagner wanted everyone in the audience to experience
his frustration in not being able to consummate his love for
Mathilde Wesendonck,'' Jenkins, the general director of the Seattle
Opera, said recently, warming to his favorite topic. ``He couldn't
have her, and so we have to feel it. It's the apotheosis of erotic
yearning, the absolute pinnacle of all his works, of all opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Opera's new production of ``Tristan und Isolde,''
which opens on Saturday evening, brings together the hottest Wagner
singers of the moment, the Canadian tenor Ben Heppner and the
English soprano Jane Eaglen, for the first time in the title roles.
</P>
<P>
   As the opera world waits to see whether Ms. Eaglen and Heppner
are the Flagstad and Melchior for the new millennium, outsiders
might assume that it was Seattle's high-tech money that attracted
such big names.
</P>
<P>
   But no, it was Jenkins, who has a proven record of creating
high-profile projects in Seattle, especially of Wagner. He has long
cultivated relationships with Ms. Eaglen and Heppner, and he
clearly intends the new ``Tristan'' to be the pinnacle of his
16-year tenure here.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Jenkins has transformed a company noted
regionally for its productions of Wagner's ``Ring'' cycle into one
that consistently attracts international attention for its devotion
to high musical and theatrical standards. A passionate Wagnerian,
Jenkins plays the role of a nontragic Wotan, overseeing every
element of every show and turning the cast and the production team
into an ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speight has a gift for creating nuclear families,'' said
Francesca Zambello, the director of the new ``Tristan.'' This
production is the crowning example of Jenkins' activity as a
visionary matchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has been assembling the company for ``Tristan'' since
1994, when Ms. Eaglen made her Seattle debut and first American
appearance, as a last-minute substitute for an ailing Norma. As it
happened, the ``Norma'' production coincided with a meeting of
Opera America in Seattle and thus served as an audition for every
company in the United States, where Ms. Eaglen now works for half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who had never heard her sing, was overjoyed with her
performance. He describes her as a Wagnerian soprano in the
powerhouse tradition of the Americans Eileen Farrell and Helen
Traubel, ``but with more secure high notes.'' He immediately made
plans for her return to Seattle in ``Turandot,'' in 1996, and
``Tristan,'' if the right tenor could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jenkins was priming Heppner, whom he first heard in
the 1988 Metropolitan Opera auditions. He invited Heppner to
Seattle in 1989 for his first Walther in ``Die Meistersinger,'' a
role he has since taken to La Scala in Milan and Covent Garden in
London, and recorded with Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony for
Decca/ London.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner returned to Seattle for ``Rusalka'' in 1990,
``Lohengrin'' in 1994 and ``Andrea Chenier'' in 1996, each time for
his first professional appearance in the male lead role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Ben would make the perfect Tristan, because he is
a real tenor, with a beautiful lyrical quality, not a baritone like
most `heldentenors,' '' Jenkins said. ``He is also psychologically
sound, a good person, so he understands what Tristan is singing
about in Act III.''
</P>
<P>
   Both singers are a bit awed by the inevitable comparisons with
the likes of Flagstad and Melchior. ``I thought it would be nice to
be able to try out the role in someplace relatively out of the
way,'' Heppner said. ``But then I found out that people are flying
in from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``Tristan'' team is also ``family.'' Ms.
Zambello, the director, made her mark in Seattle with her
production of Prokofiev's ``War and Peace,'' performed by an
American and Soviet cast during the Goodwill Games in the summer of
1990 and, as it happened, during the final breakup of the Soviet
Union. Armin Jordan, the conductor, is returning to Seattle for the
first time since leading ``Die Walkure'' in 1985. He will conduct
the next complete ``Ring'' cycle, in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner attracted Jenkins to Seattle in the first place and has
always been the focus of his plans. When he produces ``Parsifal''
in 2003, his 20th season, he will have reached his goal of staging
all 10 of Wagner's repertory mainstays. But in 1983, Jenkins came
to Seattle as a lecturer, not a producer. In fact, he had never
produced or directed an opera in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a prosperous Texas family in 1937, Jenkins became an
avid opera lover as a child. His interest was kindled when he was
6, he said, ``when my mother told me that in one opera a woman was
put to sleep on a mountain surrounded by fire and that women flew
through the air on horses.'' He ``really got'' opera for the first
time, he added, in a 1954 Dallas production of ``Le Nozze di
Figaro,'' with Victoria de los Angeles as the Countess. Then came a
decisive Wagnerian revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard Birgit Nilsson sing Isolde at Bayreuth in 1959,''
he said, ``it was like seeing the sun rise for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins went to New York after graduating from the University of
Texas, so that he could be close to the Met. After dropping out of
Cornell Medical School (having attended too many operas) and
graduating from Columbia Law School, he worked as a music critic
for Opera News and The New York Post, and attained name and face
recognition as a host of ``Live From the Met'' on public
television.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When the Seattle Opera invited him to lecture in connection with
its 1983 ``Ring,'' the board had already decided to replace Glynn
Ross, who founded the company in 1964. Beverly Brazeau, a longtime
member of the board, heard Jenkins' lecture and was so impressed
with his passion for opera and his ``mesmerizing'' delivery, she
said, that she invited him to speak to the search committee. He was
immediately offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   With strong encouragement from James Levine, of the Metropolitan
Opera, who suggested to Jenkins that he would make a better general
director than music critic, he accepted and, at 46, began a new
life. His only regret, he said, was that he did not take a course
in accounting at New York University before leaving New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, in his own way, had built popular support for opera in
Seattle and put the company on the map with an annual ``Ring''
cycle performed in both German and English. But by 1982, the board
felt the need for new leadership. Ross increasingly squandered the
budget on international stars to attract audiences to each
production with little left over for sets, costumes or the rest of
the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins immediately took a different direction, with a new
emphasis on theatrical values. He cites, in particular, the Met
``Fidelio'' of 1970 with Leonie Rysanek and Jon Vickers as a model
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intellectuality of the drama was made clear so that the
music could take off from there,'' he said. Although for Jenkins as
for others, opera meant great singing, he would see that operas in
Seattle presented singers within the strongest theatrical context,
which was far more than just sets and costumes.
</P>
<P>
   His next priority was to create an ensemble of rising stars, a
core group of young singers, mainly Americans, who would share his
understanding of opera as theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in pleasant all-purpose singers,'' he said.
``I'm always on the watch for singers with real character and
presence.'' Over the years Jenkins has built up a passionate
devotion in his audience for his core of singers, including Carol
Vaness, Vinson Cole, Dale Duesing, Joyce Castle and Lauren Flanigan
as well as Ms. Eaglen and Heppner.
</P>
<P>
   The first proof of Jenkins' vision, methods and flair for
controversy was the ``Ring,'' performed complete in 1986 but begun
with ``Die Walkure'' the year before. ``Seattle Opera as it is
known today was born on July 28, 1985,'' Jenkins said. ``On that
night the Rochaix-Israel `Walkure' bowed, and for the first time in
the city's history boos and cheers were heard at equal volume when
the final curtain fell.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-modern production by Francois Rochaix and Robert Israel
quickly became famous for its Valkyries flying on wooden horses, a
fulfillment of his childhood dream, and, after much
experimentation, a flame-throwing Fafner.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle area is headquarters for both Boeing and Microsoft,
and audiences appreciate high-tech stagecraft. Whatever its
strengths and weaknesses, the new ``Ring'' was powerful theater
that challenged the audience's preconceptions about Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 ``War and Peace,'' which cost more than $2 million, was
even more of a blockbuster, but as such spectacular and costly
productions took their toll, Jenkins' lack of a business background
began to look like a tragic flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no budget for that `Ring' '' he said. ``We were just
spending money.'' By 1992 the company had a deficit of more than
$2.5 million on a budget of $8 million. ``It was terrifying,'' he
added. ``For the first time in my life I thought we would not be
able to meet our payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   A different kind of general director would have found himself on
the next Boeing out of town, but the board had such faith in
Jenkins, and he was so forthright about his lack of expertise, that
it brought in Kathy Magiera, who had a decade of experience in the
computer software industry, as administrative director. The company
also received a grant from the National Art Stabilization Fund to
get its finances in order and master long-range planning. Within
four years the deficit was paid off, and the company has been in
the black ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Clarkson, the president of Boeing Enterprises and the
chairman of the opera board, praised Ms. Magiera for bringing rigor
to the company's finances but said that the board particularly
appreciated the way Jenkins had handled this difficult transition
without destroying the company's morale, while continuing to raise
its standards. This transformation won Jenkins the respect of
Seattle's business and political communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hero in Seattle,'' Mayor Paul Schell said. ``Because
his `down-home' manner makes the arts feel accessible to everyone,
he is a great spokesman for the community of art in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins works tirelessly to promote opera in Seattle. In recent
years, he has invited audience members to join him after
performances, and several hundred stay for 45 minutes or so, even
though it makes for a late evening. He was in his element after the
opening of ``La Boheme'' in May. It was a typically satisfying
night of Seattle-style opera, without a trace of the stale routine
that defuses so many ``Bohemes.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But there had been an unexpected bit of last-minute drama. Mimi
and Rodolfo were to be played by Nuccia Focile and Paul Charles
Clarke, who are married to each other, but three days before the
opening, Ms. Focile's doctors ordered her not to perform, because
of her troubled pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins told the post-premiere audience how he had contacted
Sheri Greenawald, who had six weeks before starred in the company's
production of Daniel Catan's ``Florencia en el Amazonas,'' at her
home in West Virginia at 3 a.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenawald was on the next plane to Seattle, where the
costume shop awaited her. Although she had not sung Mimi for years,
her powerful dramatic sense, which had triumphed in ``Florencia,''
blended seamlessly into the tight ensemble. Once again, Jenkins'
version of family values had worked.
</P>
<P>
   His audience listened to the story with a mixture of admiration
and concern. ``Weren't you stressed?'' someone asked. With his
boyish modesty, Jenkins responded: ``If I can't perform at a time
of crisis, I shouldn't be in this business. It's all part of the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he sparked a spirited debate about the relative merits of
``La Boheme'' and ``Rent'' with some younger people. ``I just can't
forgive what they did to the character of Mimi in that show,'' he
said. Southern politeness did not prevent him from speaking his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are never left guessing about Speight's support,'' Ms.
Greenawald said. ``He's always at your dressing room at every show,
always understanding the etiquette of a situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' forthrightness is appreciated by directors as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some producers are wimps,'' said Stephen Wadsworth, who will
direct the new ``Ring'' production. ``They hide in their offices
during rehearsals, afraid of conflict. Speight is always there with
his wild, fabulous intellect, constantly making observations of the
greatest acuity. When he senses trouble, he walks directly up and
tells you what he thinks, not because he's trying to do your job
but because he feels responsible for the final outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zambello says that Jenkins shares her sense that opera is
psychological and spiritual and, above all, theatrical. ``
`Tristan' is such a challenge because it's all internal,'' she
added. ``There's about 15 minutes of action in the whole thing, if
that much. But the characters are so fascinating. They are both
grownups who have already lived full lives, not two crazy kids like
Romeo and Juliet. It's about their values and the way their love
undermines these values.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this ``Tristan'' will be a culmination of Jenkins'
leadership, he has plans far beyond it; beyond, even, the ``Ring''
and ``Parsifal.'' He is just starting a young artists program,
which is intended to serve as a bridge between conservatory opera
programs and major careers. Not surprisingly, the emphasis will be
on acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singers have to learn to speak across the sound, the way
Callas did, to convey the connotative possibilities of the words,''
Jenkins said. Singers will receive training in acting and movement
as well as dramatic and vocal coaching. They will participate in
master classes and learn about the business side of a musical
career.
</P>
<P>
   More Valhalla-like in its ambition is a major overhaul of the
Opera House. Located near the inescapable Space Needle in Seattle
Center, which was built for the 1962 World's Fair, the house has a
pleasant theater but minimal backstage facilities and lobby areas.
</P>
<P>
   More pressingly, it, like the rest of Seattle Center, needs to
be seismically retrofitted before the next Big One. Seattle has
been on a building spree for the arts in the last few years. A new
Seattle Art Museum opened recently, and Benaroya Concert Hall, the
new home of the Seattle Symphony, is soon to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations Jenkins plans for the Opera House will keep the
Seattle Opera on a technical par with its cultural peers and give
it a facility worthy of its artistic reputation, but the cost will
be high: around $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because Seattle Center is owned by the city, half of this amount
will come from a bond issue to be voted on by the public, probably
next year. Success will demand all of Jenkins' formidable political
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Southerner,'' he said with a grin, ``and so politics is
just something that comes naturally.''

   `THE UNICORN: MYTH AND MIRACLE IN MEDIEVAL FRANCE, 1200-1300' &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   When it comes to allegory, layers of meaning and richness of
symbolism, there is no age or place to touch medieval France. Its
arts, both verbal and visual, abound with fantastic beasts,
representing Christ or the Devil, chaste love or carnality.
</P>
<P>
   The French soprano Anne Azema, best known for her work with Joel
Cohen and the Boston Camerata, has the cool, pure voice to bring
these tales to life. She speaks some texts and, more effectively,
sings others, dealing with love, anthropomorphic animals and the
odd miracle.
</P>
<P>
   There are tunes both sprightly and haunting, including, among
the latter, the lovely ``Ensement com la panthere'' (``Just like
the panther''), an anonymous 13th-century composition; ``Sour cest
rivage'' (``On this shore''), and ``L'Unicorne,'' which tells the
familiar story of the unicorn's betrayal by a maiden whom it
trusts. The disk is an effective evocation of another time and
sensibility. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Is this a hi-fi riot or just a laugher? The answer may lie in
the soul and sound system of the beholder. Of the four works
offered here, three are obvious: Beethoven's ``Wellington's
Victory,'' Tchaikovsky's ``1812'' and Liszt's ``Battle of the
Huns.'' The fourth is Tchaikovsky's ``Capriccio Italien.'' Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   If the smartly fashioned ``Capriccio'' was thrown in for
respectability, the ploy is nullified by Lorin Maazel's rather
casual, hasty reading. But when we leave civility behind and get
into the trenches, the real fireworks begin. Maazel sets off a
musical barrage, and so does RCA's recording crew, delivering the
Bavarian orchestra's sonic salvos in Dolby Surround Sound.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this blazing program confirms that it takes
roughly 15 minutes to wage symphonic war. That is the duration of
the three main battles. Liszt's vision of the clashing Huns is
warfare to test your speakers, and ``1812'' emerges in sonic
triumph. But even in this Technicolor setting, ``Wellington's
Victory'' remains the essence of dubious battle.
</P>
<P>
   The suave and stalwart band from Bavaria everywhere fights the
good fight. &QL;

ANALYSIS: COUNTRY OF BROKEN PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ The signs in Abuja scarcely bolster Nigeria's
latest plans for democracy. The House of Representatives is a
construction site. In this mixed Muslim and Christian nation, a
lavish mosque is completed, but the cathedral lacks walls.
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished, a capital yet in the making, Abuja is in many ways
suggestive of Nigeria as whole, a country still seeking a firm
basis for democracy and unity 38 years after independence. It is
this solidly democratic state that the country's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has now solemnly promised
Nigeria's 105 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   If he breaks the habits of his military predecessor and fulfills
the commitments made in a speech to the nation on Monday, his
achievement will be an enormous one, for Nigeria is the giant of
the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria has ceased to be a rallying point of continental
appeal,'' the Nigerian journalist Egbuns Kemakola lamented this
week, comparing the state of what he called ``the epicenter of
black humanity'' to one of ``refurbished feudalism.'' Poorer and
angrier, Nigerians unquestionably want democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar seems to be aware of this. But broken promises have
been the staple of the armed forces. Of eight vows to return to the
barracks since the first military coup in 1966, only one has been
honored, and that was back in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Ibrahim Babaginda, who ruled from 1985 to 1993, set no less
than five dates for a transition that never came. The dribbling led
to a brick wall _ Babaginda's annulment of the apparent
presidential election victory in 1993 of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the
opposition leader who died in detention this month.
</P>
<P>
   In appearance, Abubakar is a very different man, ponderous,
achingly solemn, unused to the limelight, married to a high-court
judge who is said to have been gravely troubled by the plundering
of the late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians want nothing less than true democracy in a united
and peaceful country,'' he said on Monday, peering out from behind
thick spectacles. The general seemed incapable of dissimulation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are nagging questions about him. In his maiden speech
on June 9, one day after Abacha died, Abubakar indicated he would
hand over power on Oct. 1, so he has already accorded himself one
extension by prolonging military rule until next May.
</P>
<P>
   And although he remained in the background, he was very much
part of Abacha's regime, the most repressive and ruinous in
Nigeria's history.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar's very modesty and apparent shyness prompt the
question: How independent is he and, if somebody is pulling the
strings, who is that? Insistent reports here suggest that none
other than Babaginda has considerable influence over him.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, many Nigerians seemed ready Tuesday to give
their new ruler the benefit of the doubt, for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the speech on television with friends and
everyone spontaneously started applauding,'' said Marilyn, a Lagos
lawyer who declined to give her family name. ``We are used to two-,
three-, even five-year transitions, so 10 months seems bearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdulrahman Odunowo, a young man with a start-up
telecommunications company, said: ``I want democracy. But I
certainly do not want the chaos of an over-rapid transition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decaying ministries here, where most public servants work
for salaries of about $40 a month, the murmurings were generally
approving Tuesday. But the peeling paint, the files marked
``secret'' scattered on the floor, the staff clocking in for work
around midday, spoke of an inertia born of misrule that will be
hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everything remains to be done: the formation of new
parties, the raising of funds for those parties, the establishment
of a credible electoral commission, a decision on the constitution,
and the forging of a wavering and battered nation threatened with
dislocation by the anger over Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that none of this will happen. ``The whole speech
is very sad and dangerous,'' a leading opposition figure, the
lawyer Gani Fawehinmi, said Tuesday. Fawehinmi heads the Joint
Action Committee of Nigeria, made up of 55 democracy groups, which
wanted a national unity government to decide Nigeria's democratic
future, an idea that Abubakar rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In Abuja, the enormous road to a real transition is clear
enough. Power now lies in the Asa Rock presidential complex, a huge
compound where Abacha placed his signature, for a price, on
virtually every business deal. It was there that Abubakar spoke on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, at the half-completed House of Representatives the
cranes were immobile Tuesday and there was no sign of activity.

U.S., BRITAIN MAY SEEK SPECIAL COURT TO TRY PAN AM BOMB SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that the
United States and Britain would seriously consider the creation of
a special court in the Netherlands to try two Libyans suspected of
planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am jetliner that exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marked a turnaround for the administration,
which said in the past that the Libyans would have to be tried in
the United States or Britain for the December 1988 bombing, which
killed 259 people aboard the 747 jet and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department said many details were still under
discussion, the proposal is similar in many respects to one offered
by the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, and reflected a growing
sense within the administration that there may be no other way to
bring the Libyans to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for the lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Libya
because of its refusal to hand the suspects over for trial in the
United States or Britain, Gadhafi has proposed that the two men be
tried under Scottish law and by Scottish judges, but not in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal outlined Tuesday by the administration drew a mixed
response from family members of the American victims, who took part
in a conference call with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that this might be the only way to see justice
done, given Libya's refusal to extradite the suspects for trial in
the United States or Britain. Others, however, described the plan
as a collapse by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Colonel Gadhafi just what he says he wants, a trial
in a third country,'' said Stephanie Bernstein, a clinical social
worker from Bethesda, Md., whose 36-year-old husband, Michael, died
in the attack. ``Sanctions are not perfect, but they are working.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah,
have been identified by U.S. investigators as Libyan intelligence
agents. They are accused of planting a suitcase packed with
explosives aboard the Pan Am 747.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have been working very hard to see whether there is a way
in which it is practicable to hold a Scottish court outside the
United Kingdom, and what steps would be necessary to make this
possible,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Tuesday's announcement might be
considered ``a tactical reversal'' given the administration's
earlier insistence that the trial take place on U.S. or British
soil, Rubin said the proposal was a ``win-win'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a creative alternative,'' he said. ``Either we achieve
our fundamental objective, which is a trial under a Scottish or
American court system, or we call Gadhafi's bluff and demonstrate
the value of the sanctions to nations that have been less than
supportive of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that under the proposal three
Scottish judges appointed by Britain would hear the case in the
Hague, which is also home to the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the United States and Britain agreed that
Scottish judges and legal procedures would be used in such a trial
_ rather than U.S. judges and procedures _ because the crime
occurred in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that ``many questions have
to be resolved if there is to be a trial,'' including the issue of
where the suspects would be jailed if convicted. ``Really, nothing
has been decided at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been under pressure from some
of the families of the victims to consider Gadhafi's proposal, or
something like it, because the international sanctions against
Libya seem to be fraying and because there seems no other way to
hold a trial and to air the evidence publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay on the present course, with the present policy,
there will never be a trial,'' said Bert Ammerman of River Vale,
N.J., whose brother, Tom, died on the flight. ``This new proposal
is a pragmatic, realistic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But other family members said they violently opposed the
proposal. ``I'm absolutely devastated by what's happening,'' said
Susan Cohen of Cape May Courthouse, N.J., whose daughter, Theodora,
20, died in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total shift in the administration's policy,'' said
Ms. Cohen, who took part in the conference call. ``We've blinked.
We're letting Gadhafi dictate the conditions for a trial.''

RESCUE RAISES FEARS ABOUT RUSH TO CAVING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Includes spelunking box.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high-profile rescue of a caver wedged into a narrow crevice
for nearly two days would hardly seem the best advertisement for
this perilous underground sport. But then, the caving community is
hardly on a mission to attract new members.
</P>
<P>
   A dangerous hobby _ and one that, according to experts requires
a ``certain kind of mindframe'' _ the world of caving is generally
kept out of the public eye intentionally to prevent amateurs from
jumping, untrained, into nearby holes. Details of most expeditions
are kept largely hidden; the precise locations of its most
challenging venues are, in some cases, carefully-guarded secrets,
according to experts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Craig Douglas made his first appearance Tuesday,
speaking with reporters after being pinned more than 100 feet
underground for two days in Gallupville, N.Y., his rescuers
remained anxious about talking about the Keyhole Cave where he had
been trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure `insular' is the right word,'' said Mike Warner,
40, manager of Speleo Books in Schoharie, N.Y., in describing the
network of cavers. ``It's a community that is concerned about the
well-being of the caves -- and the cavers.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, 24, of Medford, Mass., was rescued early Monday
morning. Tuesday, after undergoing surgery to free the blood supply
to his right leg, he held a press conference at Albany Medical
Center to thank the more than 200 emergency workers who helped pull
him to the mouth of the cave the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling shyly, glancing frequently at family members across the
room, Douglas described the underground ordeal that began Saturday
afternoon, when he slipped into a narrow crevice and caught his leg
beneath a ledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was ever any fear,'' said Douglas, a
recent University of New Hampshire graduate. ``At some point, I
realized this was going to take a little work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the praise he had received for his enthusiastic
participation in the 43-hour rescue, Douglas denied he had played
an unusual role, calling himself just ``a lucky guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got myself out of a situation I got myself into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the assistance he received was, in some measure, unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Douglas first became lodged underground, the
network of cavers nationwide was on alert. Private cavers from
seven states were on their way. A private physician from North
Carolina was preparing a flight to Schenectady, near the
Gallupville sinkhole where Douglas had gotten stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Public rescue assistance was on its way as well, but it was this
private -- and extremely tight-knit -- community of cavers that led
the way in Douglas's rescue, ensuring his extrication went as
smoothly as it did, according to cavers who were present. Emily
Davis Mobley, who lives nearby and manages the Barton Hill Karst
Preserve where the cave is located, slept no more than 45 minutes
throughout the ordeal, carefully directing the 73 cavers who made
their way into the hole, sending food and drinks along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really touching and heartwarming to be down there and
having them help me,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   The close-knit association that saved Douglas, however, is the
same one that is reluctant to disclose its favorite adventure spots
in North Carolina, Kentucky and the western United States. The
cavers' reasons are simple: safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I don't want people to go caving -- that it's my
private thing and you can't come,'' said Bev Schwartz, 30, of
Somerville, Mass. ``It's that caves are very delicate, fragile
environments. Formations within them have been
</P>
<P>
   building for thousands of years. One accident and it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Speleological Society, there are 39
grottoes - or caving clubs - nationwide. Within those, there are
approximately 11,500 members, although the estimated number of
people who go caving is likely much higher.
</P>
<P>
   For Morrie Gasser of Hopkinton, Mass., who helped in the rescue,
the rescue was gruesome _ crawling for two hours along 150 feet of
narrow passages, some so tight, he had to take off his helmet and
push it ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in tighter spots, spots where I had to take off my
coveralls or exhale to get through, but those would be short,
little stretches with reason to do that because of something
interesting on the other side,'' said Gasser. ``This particular
cave is not visited that often because it has, basically, no
redeeming qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet caving experts say their ranks are growing. The beauty
underneath is unparalleled, they say; so, too, is the spirit of
adventure, and, in the words of some, the thrill of literally going
where no one has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underground environment can be really beautiful,'' said
Fred Wefer, president-elect of the speleological society. ``There
are many situations where you find yourself crawling for long
distances flat on your belly in the mud and you come up on a
situation that's just incredibly beautiful. You know that number of
people who've seen that is very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the caving Catch-22, he said: ``The more people who do
it, the more damage that is done to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPELUNKER (Pronounced spi-LUN-ker) n. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a combination of ``splatter'' and ``plunk.'' And
that is just what most people might expect to happen on a caving
trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the word ``spelunker'' _ which was introduced into the
English language in the 1930s by a writer in western Massachusetts
_ actually has its roots in the Greek language, from ``spelaion,''
the word for cave.
</P>
<P>
   Clair W. Perry, a reporter for the Berkshire Eagle in
Pittsfield, Mass., is widely credited with being the first to use
``spelunker'' to mean ``caver'' in his writings about the
underground webs. Some believe the term was coined by an earlier
writer, Roger Johnson, but Perry insisted it was his; in a quote
reprinted in his 1961 obituary, Perry said he took the Greek root
and ``added `unker' to it because it reminded me of a man dunking
himself in a cave.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, he might not want credit.
</P>
<P>
   After years of mockery, the word ``spelunker'' has come to mean
a ``novice'' or ``clutzy rookie'' among experienced caving pros.
There's even a saying: ``Cavers rescue spelunkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started caving in the late 1960s, it was okay to be a
spelunker,'' said Thom Engel, 44. ``But I think people just got to
the point where they said, `I'm a caver, I go in caves.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ When the Astros selected Lance Berkman in the first
round of the 1997 amateur draft, the conjecture was the
power-hitting Rice University product would make his debut in the
majors at the same time the Ballpark at Union Station opened in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 150 games and 550 at-bats in the minor leagues,
nothing has altered that timetable. Berkman is progressing, but
there are enough rough edges in his game that a quick ascent to the
majors is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full season in professional baseball, Berkman is
hitting .290 with 18 home runs and 68 RBIs in 95 games at Class AA
Jackson. But those numbers are deceptive. The switch hitter is
having an excellent season from the left side, hitting .329 with 17
homers and 57 RBIs in 231 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But batting righthanded is a different matter. Berkman is
hitting only .206 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 107 at-bats against
lefthanded pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman is a natural righthanded hitter, but like many young
switch hitters he had far more at-bats from the left side during
high school and college and got stronger from that side. He
realizes he must improve drastically from the right side to make an
impact in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I've been pretty inconsistent this year, especially
from the right side of the plate,'' Berkman said. ``I've always hit
more home runs lefthanded because you get more at-bats from that
side. I've got more power righthanded as far as distance goes, but
as far as frequency, it's better from the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (lefthanders) have been pitching me inside a lot, and
there are times when you can turn on it and really crush it. There
are other times when you look horrible. It's touch-and-go. That's
what I mean by inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   That aside, Jackson manager Jim Pankovits has been wowed by
Berkman's level-headed approach toward improving every aspect of
his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got just about every tool available to be
successful,'' said Pankovits, who played with the Astros from
1984-88 and has managed six seasons in the minors. ``He understands
what he needs to do. He doesn't have a big head or anything. He's
got everything he needs to play in the big leagues. It's just a
matter of getting experience, but there's no doubt in my mind he'll
be in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkman had a homecoming last weekend when Jackson played a
six-game series against the San Antonio Missions that ended Monday
night. His family lives in New Braunfels, so he was able to stay at
home and make the 30-mile commute to play in San Antonio. He was
8-for-23 with two home runs and five RBIs in the series, which
Jackson won 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman said he benefited during the series from being around
his father, Larry, whose instruction and encouragement helped him
during his careers at Austin High School in Austin and New
Braunfels Canyon High School and later in three seasons at Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has everything to do with where I am,'' Berkman said. ``He
taught me how to play the game the right way from the time I was a
little kid. He can still look at my swing and tell me what I'm
doing right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series happened at just the right time. We've played
100-plus games, and it's hot every day now. It's the time of year
where you might wear down a little. This was a good lift for the
final month of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Another homecoming for Berkman could take place within the next
two years if the Rice product comes back to Houston and plays in an
Astros uniform. If Berkman continues on his current pace, he will
play next season at Class AAA New Orleans and could be ready for
the majors in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not really pointing toward any specific time
(to reach the majors),'' Berkman, 22, said. ``I think the key thing
is getting the at-bats and the experience you have to have. The way
you learn is by playing. You have to figure out what works and what
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million clichs about baseball being a game of
adjustments, but it really is. And you have to be able to make
those adjustments. The more you play, the better you can make the
adjustments. If you have experience to draw upon, you're better
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker is a firm believer in not
rushing players to the majors, so Berkman likely will follow the
Class A, AA and AAA path that has been ignored recently by other
clubs with their No. 1 picks. Hunsicker says that in Berkman's
case, fans should not expect too much too soon even though Berkman
led all collegiate players with 41 home runs and 134 RBIs in his
junior season at Rice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you have a first-round draft pick with local
ties, the expectations are expanded and heightened,'' Hunsicker
said. ``We need to put it in perspective. He'll be a quality
player, but he still has a ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very focused and has a very mature approach. He knows
what he has to do and has a plan to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making adjustments at the plate, Berkman also is
learning a new position. After playing first base at Rice for two
seasons, he was shifted to left field, where he played as a
freshman at Rice and for part of his high school career. With Jeff
Bagwell under contract until 2001, the Astros wanted to find
another position for Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   Pankovits says Berkman's work in left field this year has been
better than adequate, and the manager has little doubt he will be
able to play the position in the majors. But the Astros acquired
left fielder Moises Alou from Florida last winter, and Alou also
has a contract until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Alou can demand a trade at the end of this season because he was
traded in the middle of a long-term contract. It's not certain how
that scenario will play out, and Berkman says it is of little
concern to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I figure it, if you play good enough, that makes them
do something with you,'' Berkman said. ``If I flounder around and
don't live up to their expectations, then they can keep me in the
minors for as long as they want to. They've got a great left
fielder right now and actually have four great outfielders, if you
count (Richard) Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got four guys who can absolutely play the outfield,
but if I perform up to their expectations for me, it kind of forces
their hand to make some sort of move. If I'm doing well in Class
AAA, they'll either trade me to get somebody they need or trade
somebody else to make room for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much turnover in the game that you really can't
worry about those things when you're at my level. There's so many
teams. If you're a good enough player, you will get your
opportunity to play in the big leagues at some point. It may not be
with the team that drafted you, but you'll go as far as your talent
will take you.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Berkman will have to bet better from the right side.
There are recent signs of improvement. His lone home run against a
lefthander came over the weekend against the Missions, and he had a
two-run single batting righthanded in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the left side, he's been one of the better hitters in the
league,'' Pankovits said. ``He drives the ball to all fields; he
shows tremendous patience at times. He can really drive the ball.
He's hit some moon shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Righthanded, he's made some progress lately. He hit a bomb the
other night. He's got some pop, but it's a matter of mechanics that
need to be smoothed out a little bit. He needs work righthanded
more so than lefthanded. I think he can be a good power and good
average hitter. He has the ability to use the whole field; he can
drive the ball the other way; he can hit the fastball and breaking
ball. Most of the time, he has pretty good patience at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Berkman hit 12 home runs in 53 games last season at Class
A Kissimmee, his power numbers are decent but not exceptional this
year. Berkman admits he is still trying to define himself as a
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know what kind of hitter I am in pro baseball,''
Berkman said. ``This is my first full season. I don't know if I'm
going to hit enough home runs to be considered a straight power
guy. And I don't know if I'll ever have a high enough average to be
considered an average guy. I guess right now, I'm a little of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can hit for power, but obviously I'm not a Mark
McGwire or anything like that, or even a guy who's going to hit 30
or 40 right now. I'm also not a guy like Tony Gwynn who hits .360.
I'll hit for a decent average and have a decent amount of home
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reachable goals, to be sure. If Berkman can continue to progress
over the next 1{ years, there's a good chance he'll reach the
majors just in time to help open the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great,'' Berkman said. ``That would mean I've
made great progress. That's all I'm hoping for right now. I've
always felt that if you learn something each day, you'll get better
each day.''

MASSI EMERGES AS WINNER OF 122-MILE STAGE IN PYRENEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCHON, France _ The Tour de France entered the Pyrenees
Mountains Tuesday, and a sense of order returned to the overall
standing: Jan Ullrich, Bobby Julich, Bo Hamburger, Laurent Jalabert
and Luc Leblanc.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were Laurent Desbiens, Andrea Tafi and Jacky Durand, who
ruled the roost during the last few days and now are no higher than
Tafi's 54th place. Proving that anything is possible with enough
courage and savvy, however, an unlikely winner emerged after the
122-mile stage across the fabled Circle of Death peaks.
</P>
<P>
   That was Rodolfo Massi, an Italian who rides for Casino and not
one of the major climbers. He benefited from a long breakaway with
Cedric Vasseur, a Frenchman with GAN, and Alberto Elli, another
Italian with Casino, to give the French team its third victory in
10 stages of this 85th Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Massi did no work during most of the breakaway from the first
climb _ the daunting Aubisque peak, rated in the highest category
of difficulty _ through the second climb, the similarly rated
Tourmalet. Team strategy called for him to ride in the slipstream
of Elli and Vasseur, saving his strength for the last two climbs,
the Aspin and the Peyresourde, both rated first category, or a
notch lower than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth climb, Massi took off, leaving his weary teammate
and the unwitting Vasseur behind. Massi had enough power left to
hold off a late charge by Marco Pantani, an Italian with Mercatone
Uno, the winner of the recent Giro d'Italia and _ on the 364 other
days of the year _ a far superior climber to Massi.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani reverted to his habit of unleashing his charge too
late and once again finished a Tour stage in second place. The
winner was timed in 5 hours 49 minutes 40 seconds, or 36 seconds
faster than Pantani across the finish line after an 8.1-mile
descent from the Peyresourde into Luchon.
</P>
<P>
   Third in the stage, which started in Pau, was Michael Boogerd, a
Dutchman with Rabobank, 59 seconds behind. Clocking the same time
were nine other riders, including Ullrich, a German with Telekom
and the defending champion; Julich, of Glenwood Springs, Colo.,
with Cofidis, and Leblanc, a Frenchman with Polti.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich regained the overall leader's yellow jersey, which he
yielded to Desbiens on Sunday. The German is 1:18 ahead of Julich.
Hamburger, a Dane with Casino, is third, 2:17 behind the leader,
with Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, 2:38 behind and Leblanc 3:03
behind. The 151 remaining riders get another chance to climb
Wednesday before a day off on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An ecstatic Julich attempted to be blase afterward. ``Last year
I had goose bumps when I finished with the leaders in Morzine,'' he
said. ``This time I knew my place was with the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen riders quit the race in the Pyrenees, some out of
exhaustion, some because of crashes on foggy and slippery roads.
The major casualty was Francesco Casagrande, the Italian leader of
Cofidis, whom Julich was obligated to work for. With Casagrande
gone, the American becomes the team leader for whom everybody else
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'' includes another American with Cofidis, Kevin
Livingston of Austin, Texas, a strong climber who finished 14th
Tuesday, 1:58 behind, and ranks 18th overall, 5:38 behind. He will
very likely excel Wednesday in the final climb to the Plateau de
Beille, which will make its debut in the Tour but which Livingston
knows from his second-place finish last year in the Tour de
l'Avenir.
</P>
<P>
   The weather turned overnight, dropping from a reading of 104
degrees to half that atop the climbs. A heavy fog and swirling
mist, especially on the first climb, contributed to the
difficulties, making descents from the four peaks treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor was the absence of the Festina team, which
was expelled in a drug scandal late Friday. The team's nine riders
are usually dominant in the mountains and would surely have
attacked Ullrich and the other favorites early in the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., who rides with United States
Postal and who lost more than 18 minutes Monday when he suffered
heatstroke and finished in a daze, was able to brave the conditions
and complete Tuesday's stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he has had stomach troubles for the last month and
that he was not able to keep down any food or drink on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from such a high to such a low in two days,'' he said,
referring to his second place in the individual time trial on
Saturday to his 160th place Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he was game to see how he would do in the Pyrenees
when he spoke in Pau before the start of Tuesday's stage. ``I put
my body through a lot yesterday,'' he said. ``How it reacts today I
don't know. You can only push your body so hard and then it doesn't
want to go any harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton finished the mountain stage in 126th place, among a big
group of riders bringing up the rear, 31:34 behind Massi. In his
way, he rode just as courageous a race as the winner.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ Although she has never run for office before,
Margarethe Cammermeyer would seem to have a resume tailor-made for
politics: she is a mother of four, a nurse with a doctorate degree,
a retired Army colonel and a Vietnam War veteran who won the Bronze
Star.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing that voters in this fast-growing district
north of Seattle are sure to hear about Ms. Cammermeyer in her run
for Congress is that she also is a homosexual. Or, as Rep. Jack
Metcalf, the Republican incumbent, called her in a recent mailing,
``a controversial lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of four lesbians running for national office this year,
Ms. Cammermeyer is trying to do something no one has ever done:
become the first openly homosexual nonincumbent elected to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, the American people are poised to make history,''
said Winnie Stachelberg, the political director of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay political organization. ``Any
one of these candidates could do it. But Colonel Cammermeyer seems
very well-positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, say Republican strategists. Sensing voters'
hesitation, if not outright queasiness, about homosexuality,
Republican leaders have condemned it with renewed vigor lately.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has
compared homosexuality to kleptomania, and Republican leaders in
the House have been citing the Bible in an effort to prove that
homosexuals are sinners.
</P>
<P>
   A career military woman, Ms. Cammermeyer was thrust into the
national spotlight six years ago when she was forced out of the
Army National Guard after acknowledging that she was homosexual.
She sued for reinstatement, and won. But she has never been a
crusader, she said, and her run for public office now is not
intended as a pioneering effort on behalf of gay rights. And yet,
she has already run into enough cold stares and withdrawn hands to
realize that running for Congress is far different than serving in
the Army, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to shake somebody's hand and they put their hands
under their armpits _ that hurts,'' she said. ``In the military,
everybody salutes _ it's a basic way of acknowledging someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her campaign is well-financed _ she has raised more
than $500,000 so far _ and she is trying to unseat a 70-year-old
congressman who was re-elected in 1996 by only 1,927 votes out of
256,944 votes cast _ Ms. Cammermeyer still faces an uphill race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, when you vote for the colonel you are
making a statement about sexual orientation,'' said Paul Newman, a
longtime Republican strategist who lives on Whidbey Island in Puget
Sound, the heart of Washington state's Second Congressional
District. ``In that sense, she has probably actually shored up some
of the support for Jack Metcalf.''
</P>
<P>
   In a May fund-raising letter, Metcalf sharply criticized Ms.
Cammermeyer for her ``lesbian life style.'' In the introduction of
the letter, he wrote, ``We are in a life-and-death struggle for the
spiritual and cultural heritage _ and future _ of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf's campaign manager, Chris Strow, said in an interview
last week that the congressman would no longer raise the issue of
sexual orientation. He said the Metcalf campaign was not trying to
fan a hatred or fear of homosexuals, but was ``merely pointing out
that we face a formidable opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cammermeyer is using her military and nursing background to
push for better health care. The rights of patients in health
maintenance organizations will be a centerpiece of her campaign,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Ms. Cammermeyer campaigns with one of her sons or
grandchildren. She is liberal on most issues, but then says she has
a license to carry a concealed gun, and was a sharpshooter in the
Army. ``People have created this illusion about me and my
history,'' she said. ``They forget that I'm a nurse, a soldier, a
mother and a grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   But once people hear her discuss the issues, the question of
sexual orientation still remains a barrier, say many in this
district, which runs from this old blue-collar town north to the
Canadian border, and from Whidbey Island and the San Juan Islands
east to the crest of the Cascade Range.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was a recent meeting before a small group of carpenters.
Ms. Cammermeyer gave a short outline of her positions on trade and
job issues, most of which are favorable to labor. Then she left,
and the carpenters were divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``She handled herself very well,'' said John Morgan, business
manager of the Skagit Valley local of the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters. ``But a fair percentage of carpenters are turned off by
that other issue. The image of the beer-drinking, wolf-whistling,
conservative guy is not all false.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cammermeyer, a 56-year-old native of Norway, has led
something of a dashing life. As a young child in World War II, she
was used as a decoy by women smuggling weapons to resistance
fighters in Nazi-occupied Norway. She moved to the United States
with her family when she was 9. She married, had four children and
spent 31 years in the Army Reserve, earning a Bronze Star Medal for
meritorious achievement in Vietnam. Late in life, she said, she
realized she was a lesbian.

ARRESTED CUSTOMER FILES SUIT AGAINST CONTINENTAL AIRLINES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Kansas City, Kan.) 
 
By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Continental Airlines customer says in a federal
lawsuit that he was arrested after quizzing personnel about lax
security procedures that allowed his luggage to be put on a plane
without verification he had boarded.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Lewis said he told a ticket agent there could have
been a bomb in his Atlanta-bound bags, while he sat safely on the
ground at Bush Intercontinental Airport _ waiting for a boarding
call on a tardy plane.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking into the potential security lapse, the ticket
agent called airport security to arrest Lewis. He subsequently was
turned over to Houston police and charged with making a terroristic
threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who filed suit against the Houston-based airline, the
city of Houston, the police department and the airport security
service, alleges malicious prosecution and wrongful arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand you can't make a joke, or a threat, but I wasn't
threatening anyone. And I wasn't joking,'' Lewis said. ``I saw an
open door for a problem to occur and I pointed it out, but that
wasn't what they wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Pope, assistant to Houston City Attorney Anthony Hall,
said her office has not yet reviewed Lewis' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And Continental spokesman Dave Messing said the air carrier has
a policy against commenting on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started April 25, 1997, when Lewis left his Kansas
City, Kan., home for a meeting in Atlanta the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Logging thousands of miles a year as a sales representative for
Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, Lewis said his fast-paced job has
taught him to be patient when it comes to travel snafus.
</P>
<P>
   Tired and eager to get some rest before an 8 a.m. presentation
the next day, Lewis said he was calm when he arrived at Houston's
airport on a lay-over for a 9:30 p.m. connecting flight and was
told the flight would be delayed 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 44, said he sat down in front of the ticket agent so he
would be sure to hear the boarding call. When 30 minutes passed
without a flight announcement, he became concerned.
</P>
<P>
   He approached the ticket counter and was told his flight _ and
luggage _ had left for Atlanta 10 minutes earlier, according to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Continental employees were apologetic, but erroneously told him
no other airline had a plane to Atlanta before Continental's 11
a.m. flight the next day, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis arrived at the airport at 5 a.m. the next morning, he
discovered a Delta flight was departing Houston at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he went to the Continental ticket counter to exchange
his ticket and lodged several complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he ended up the culprit instead of the victim when
he questioned the wisdom of putting his bags on board a plane he
hadn't boarded.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the travel-savvy Lewis was told it is against the
law to say the word bomb in an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he was searched and interrogated, then taken to the
Harris County Jail where he was incarcerated for 12-14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although the charges ultimately were dismissed for lack of
evidence, Lewis said he incurred considerable expense hiring an
attorney and is now nervous everytime he is in an airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to deal with people and I know I wasn't out of
line,`` said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's Messer said the airline requires passengers and
bags to be matched on international flights only.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great overreaction,'' said Susan Taylor, attorney
for Lewis. ``It was clear he wasn't making a threat to anyone.''

 EVERETT, Wash.: a lesbian.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, having risen to chief nurse in the Washington state
Army National Guard, she was forced out of the military when she
acknowledged to a superior that she was a homosexual. Ms.
Cammermeyer filed suit _ not to overturn the policy on homosexuals
in the military, but to get reinstated _ and won. She served until
1996, when she retired. Her story was made into a television movie,
``Serving in Silence,'' produced by Barbra Streisand and starring
Glenn Close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn did a wonderful job,'' Ms. Cammermeyer said. ``She
became a colonel in three weeks, when it took me 26 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired and living on bucolic Whidbey Island with her partner,
Dianne Divelbess, and surrounded by sons and grandchildren, Ms.
Cammermeyer said she could have coasted along in an easy life. But
she decided to run for public office, she said, because she
``wanted to get involved, to see things get done.''
</P>
<P>
   In a district that has two Navy bases and a large retired
military population, Ms. Cammermeyer hopes to score points with her
military background. At a recent picnic for Vietnam veterans in the
small town of Anacortes, on Puget Sound, she was well-received.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represents someone who took on the government and won,''
said Mary Ann Harris, a veteran who organized the picnic. ``So many
of us were isolated because of what happened over there. There is
this camaraderie, this sense of unconditional acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities have been drawn to Ms. Cammermeyer's campaign, and
that has been a source of criticism. She received donations from
Ms. Streisand and Ms. Close, from Rosie O'Donnell, the talk show
host, and from Krist Novoselic, the former drummer for the Seattle
band Nirvana. Most of the money has come from small donations in
the district, Ms. Cammermeyer says. But Metcalf has made an issue
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign would rather receive $100 from someone like you
than $1,000 from Barbara Streisand,'' he wrote in his fund-raising
letter, misspelling the singer's first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about all the insurance companies, the developers and
tobacco money pouring into his campaign?'' Ms. Cammermeyer asked in
response to a question about contributions to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, three other lesbians are running for office; all are
Democrats. They are Christine Kehoe, a San Diego City Councilwoman
trying to unseat two-term Rep. Brian Bilbray, a Republican from
California's 49th Congressional District; State Rep. Tammy Baldwin
of Wisconsin, running for the open seat in Wisconsin's Second
Congressional District, and Susan Tracy, seeking the open seat in
Massachusetts now held by Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II. Kennedy, who
represents that state's Eighth Congressional District, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   There are two members of Congress who have announced that they
are homosexuals _ one is a Democrat, Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts; the other is a Republican, Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf has served two terms representing Washington's Second
District, and has spent nearly 40 years in politics. Though he won
only 48.7 percent of the vote in the last election, which had a
third-party candidate, his campaign is confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ours to lose,'' said Strow, Metcalf's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   In recent appearances, the congressman has shown a tendency to
stumble at times. But he is a veteran politician who has been
written off before. And his roots run deep in this district; he
still owns a family-run lodge on Whidbey Island.
</P>
<P>
   While Metcalf's concerns have been eclectic in the past,

CORRUPTION CASE REACHES BEIJING COURT  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chen Xitong, a former Politburo member and rival of
President Jiang Zemin, was formally charged in a Beijing court this
week with corruption and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was ousted from his post as party secretary of Beijing in
1995, accused of deep involvement in a scandal that emerged when
one of his deputies, Wang Baosen, was found dead, apparently a
suicide. The two were said to have embezzled tens of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's case has been watched closely because it is so
politically delicate.
</P>
<P>
   It took three years for leaders to agree on how to charge him.
It remains unclear when Chen's trial will be held, or whether it
will be publicized. Although leaders want to make Chen an example
of their campaign against corruption, they are not eager to give
him a forum to implicate other leaders.

 JOHNSON &AMP; JOHNSON TO ACQUIRE DePUY FOR $3.5 BILLION  
 (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the big diversified health care manufacturer,
agreed Tuesday to buy DePuy Inc., a successful maker of orthopedic
devices, for $3.5 billion in cash. After the purchase, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson would be one of the largest makers of artificial joints and
other devices that replace or strengthen body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Johnson &AMP; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J.,
was seeking to regain momentum after disappointing losses of market
share in sales of another type of medical device, coronary stents,
which prop open clogged arteries. DePuy makes hip and knee
replacements and titanium mesh implants that are used increasingly
often in lower back operations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which makes Tylenol and Band-Aids as well as
prescription drugs and hospital supplies, said it would offer $35
each for outstanding shares of DePuy, a century-old company based
in Warsaw, Ind. Roche Holdings AG of Switzerland, which bought 84
percent of DePuy 14 months ago, would collect about $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Roche got the DePuy shares as part of a $10.2 billion purchase
of Corange Ltd., a Bermuda-based holding company that also included
Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, a big German maker of drugs and
diagnostic products.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Johnson &AMP; Johnson
shares declined 87.5 cents to $76.25 and DePuy gained $3.0625 to
$34.5625. Roche American Depository Receipts rose $4 to $103.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely a good deal for Roche,'' said Sergio
Traversa, an analyst at Mehta Partners, a health-care research
firm, ``Roche wants the cash because it gets almost one-third of
its income from managing its financial investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche is also expected to reduce debt it assumed in the Corange
deal, while retaining business in pharmaceuticals, diagnostics,
vitamins, fine chemicals, and flavors and fragrances, said Arvind
Desai, an analyst at Orbimed Advisors, a health-care research firm.
Roche is the world's 11th-largest maker of drugs and and is first
in sales of diagnostic products.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson chairman Ralph Larsen said the combination
with DePuy could create ``the leading company in the $9 billion
orthopedic products market.'' Johnson &AMP; Johnson had $630 million in
orthopedic sales last year; DePuy had $770 million.
</P>
<P>
   DePuy chairman James Lent will head the combined orthopedic
products unit, which will be based in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts had predicted that Johnson &AMP; Johnson
would buy a cardiovascular device company to bolster its share of
the market for coronary stents after agile competitors like Guidant
Corp. and Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc. seized chunks of the
market for the tiny titanium tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson's United States sales of stents in the United
States have declined 50 percent so far this year, compared with
sales in 1997, Desai said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Kruger, an analyst in San Francisco with Nationsbank
Montgomery Securities, said that even after the DePuy deal, the
company still might purchase a cardiovascular device company.
``Johnson &AMP; Johnson needs more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Johnson &AMP; Johnson declined to comment on further
acquisition plans but noted that the company is testing a number of
stents. Robert V. Andrews, the spokesman, said the new products may
include stents with radioactive or anticoagulant coatings and
miniature stents for smaller arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson has retained its big but relatively
slow-growing hospital and surgical supply businesses at a time when
other drug makers like Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Pfizer Inc. have been
selling these divisions so that they can concentrate on high-growth
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Traversa said the Johnson &AMP; Johnson units might be valued higher
by investors if they were spun off as separate companies.

12,000 FLEE SERB ATTACK ON A TOWN IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia _ Terrified ethnic Albanians fleeing three
days of fighting in nearby Orahovac are arriving here with accounts
of scores of civilian deaths after attacks on homes by government
artillery and rampages of violence by soldiers and Serbian
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days about 12,000 refugees have made their way
through about 10 miles of forests and mountains to this town, where
the ethnic Albanian rebels are in complete control, according to
local officials. The streets are filled with people wandering
almost in shock, and their condition adds weight to the impression
that they have experienced something appalling. But their accounts
of events were often confused or lacking in detail and could not be
independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a score of interviews, refugees gave accounts
similar to that of Faik Vuciterna, 38, a father of six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began on Saturday,'' he said. ``They began to massacre us
first by artillery shelling. Many were killed.'' Many refugees said
their neighborhoods were shelled by government forces retaliating
against ethnic Albanian separatists. The separatists had attacked
ethnic Serbian targets in Orahovac, a city of about 20,000, which,
like the province, is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the shelling stopped,'' Vuciterna said, ``the sniping
began. I don't know where it came from because it seemed to be
everywhere. The soldiers began to go through our neighborhood
killing people. They were in civilian clothes, some of them were in
uniform, about 100 of them altogether. They were armed.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard those words, an old man sitting on his haunches
nearby began to moan. ``Ohhhh, they had every kind of weapon,
everything to kill people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man cut in. ``They had the dum-dum,'' he said, using a
vernacular term for an anti-aircraft cannon with explosive shells
which Serbian forces often fire against buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my friends was hit by a sniper bullet,'' Vuciterna
said. ``Then they hit him with the dum-dum and he exploded in front
of me. He was my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing scenes reminiscent of the war in Bosnia, refugees
said they believed Serbian forces wanted to drive ethnic Albanians
from the area in order to more easily control it.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees talked of seeing their Serbian neighbors joining
marauding government forces to attack ethnic Albanians, then loot
and burn their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the provincial capital, a senior Serbian official
categorically denied there were any indiscriminate attacks on
civilians in Orahovac. The government announced it would allow the
press to visit the city on Tuesday. It was closed to the press on
Monday, making it impossible for reporters to confirm the refugees'
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At the local health clinic here, the director and the chief
nurse were tallying the number of people they have treated in the
last three days for what they say are war wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse counted out the names of patients from a logbook. At 5
p.m. Tuesday she said, ``It looks as if it comes to 112.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinic director, Dr. Rame Morina, first insisted all of the
patients were civilians. Then he conceded that about 10 percent
were soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they had not been able to treat many of the
seriously injured because they have run out of some medications.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of wounded have died or been left behind on
the trails that refugees are taking through the mountains, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   A more complete picture of what happened in Orahovac was not
available because, while the Serbian government had sealed off
Orahovac, the ethnic Albanian fighters were barring journalists
from entering Malisevo for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   An ethnic Albanian man who asked to remain anonymous said he and
a group of about 20 were caught by soldiers as they were trying to
escape the city. ``Over the radio I heard the order given to the
soldiers, `Finish your job.' They were going to shoot us,'' the man
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the soldiers then saw a white BMW on the road carrying
two men racing to rescue their families. When the soldiers turned
their guns on the car, he said, his group took the chance to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we ran, three of our group were shot dead, I guess eight
were wounded, and the rest of us got here today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men, who said they and 72 other ethnic Albanians had hidden
in a basement for three days, said they emerged to find homes in
their neighborhood being torched by Serbian soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will wait here to see if any of my relatives arrive, then
I'll go back and kill the Serbs,'' one man said. His companion
flashed 10 fingers three times, then ran his hand across his throat
to indicate how many Serbs he intended to kill.

ZAMORA TO APPEAR IN SAME COURTROOM AS FORMER BOYFRIEND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ In what figures to be an emotional yet
arms-length reunion for the former high school sweethearts,
convicted murderer Diane Zamora will appear in the same courtroom
Wednesday as her ex-fiance and co-defendant.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Don Leonard said Tuesday that he will
decide whether Zamora, now serving a life prison sentence, can
consider an offer of immunity from David Graham's prosecutors. They
claim the two killed 16-year-old Adrianne Jones of Mansfield in
1995, months before they left Texas for what seemed like bright
futures at separate military academies.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora and her attorney, along with Graham, his lawyers and
Tarrant County prosecutors are expected to be in the courtroom for
Wednesday morning's hearing, outside the presence of the jury. For
Graham and Zamora, it will be their first time in close proximity
since shortly before their arrests in September 1996 _ nine months
after Jones' slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's attorneys want to call Zamora as part of their defense
case, possibly on Thursday. Prosecutors, who did not seek her
testimony, agreed that nothing she might say could be used against
her in her own future legal proceedings, if any. She is seeking a
new trial and so, under the tentative pact, her remarks could not
be used against her if she wins a second trial.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the judge rules the immunity offer is valid, Zamora
cannot be compelled to testify if she exercises her Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination, the judge said after Tuesday's
testimony, in which the prosecution's case appeared to be winding
down.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were read a detailed, four-page typewritten statement
that Graham gave investigators at the U.S. Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, Colo. In it, he claimed he had sex with Jones and
killed her a month later to appease a jealous Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this precious relationship we had was damaged by my
thoughtless actions, the only thing that could satisfy her womanly
vengeance was the life of the one that had, for an instant, taken
her place,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham now contends the confession was obtained improperly
and is riddled with lies. He says he was not present for the
killing and lied to protect Zamora, who attended the U.S. Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md. He claims she killed Jones by herself.
</P>
<P>
   Although defense attorney Dan Cogdell assailed the tactics used
by interrogators to get them, Leonard ruled that Graham's oral and
written statements were properly obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors then heard from an Air Force investigator who testified
that, during the initial questioning at the academy, Graham was
alert and friendly but for several hours did not acknowledge
involvement in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell attempted to portray that interrogation as ruthless
coercion that featured inadequate warnings about self-incrimination
and false promises of leniency. But criminal investigator Roy
Stalvey, the day's only witness, said Graham was fully warned and
treated well by Air Force agents and police detectives in Grand
Prairie, where the murder occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his initial reluctance, Stalvey said, Graham became
emotional and gradually began to admit culpability when confronted
with information obtained from Zamora and other witnesses. Rather
than volunteer information about what was used to stun Jones,
Graham forced investigators to play a guessing game about the
object, even dropping sarcastic hints along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he said he wasn't going to say. I asked him `Why
not?' and he said `That was the only thing that would directly link
me to this crime,''' Stalvey recalled. ``He had his hands
interlocked behind his head, and he was kinda rocking back and
forth while he was doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would chuckle when we made an incorrect guess. And then he
would say, `You're never going to guess it. It's really dumb.' He
said that after each time.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeated references to ``dumb'' turned out to be a clue that
dumbbell weights were involved, Stalvey said. However, a medical
examiner ruled out the possibility that such a weight was used;
instead, he speculated that the head blow was caused by the butt of
Graham's gun, which has been verified as the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Graham stated that on Dec. 4, 1995, with Zamora hiding in the
trunk of her car, he drove to Jones' home in Mansfield, picked her
up and took her to a remote area of Tarrant County. Zamora then
emerged from the hiding spot and struck Jones, Graham stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that it was either her or us, and Diane struck her
in the back of the head with one of the weights while I held her,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrianne somehow crawled through the window and to our horror,
ran off. I was panicky and just grabbed the Makarov 9 mm to follow.
To our relief (at the time) she was too injured from the head
wounds to go far. She ran into a nearby field and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that short instant, I knew I couldn't leave the key witness
to our crime alive. I just pointed and shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued, ``I fired again and ran to the car.
Diane and I drove off. The first things out of our mouths were `I
love you,' followed by Diane's `We shouldn't have done that,
David.' Well, nice time to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also now asserts _ and prosecutors agree _ that he never
had a romantic relationship with Jones, although Zamora believed he
was involved with the Mansfield High School sophomore. At the time,
Graham was a senior at Mansfield, while Zamora was a senior at
nearby Crowley High near Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The crime remained unsolved for nine months, until Zamora
confessed her role to a roommate at the Naval Academy.

QUARTERLY EARNINGS AT TI FALL 83 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK P. COUCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Instruments said Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings
fell 83 percent because of worldwide weakness in semiconductor
demand and the continuing price decline of memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based TI, which makes chips for mobile phones, modems and
other electronic devices, said its quarterly net income fell to $43
million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $249 million, or 56
cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales slumped, too.
</P>
<P>
   TI said its second-quarter revenues were 15 percent lower than a
year ago, dropping to $2.2 billion from $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hit to TI came in the memory-chip business. TI said
it lost $222 million, or 36 cents a share, in that division this
quarter, compared with $20 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago.
Average prices for dynamic random access memory chips were down 30
percent from the first quarter and 70 percent from the same period
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The losses didn't panic company executives or investors because
TI announced in June that it is selling the memory chip division to
Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho, in a deal valued at about $830
million.
</P>
<P>
   TI will get 28.9 million shares of Micron stock in exchange for
its memory division. To break even, Micron shares must be valued at
about $31 a share, said William Aylesworth, TI's chief financial
officer. TI will have to take a charge against future earnings if
the Micron stock trades at anything less than that per-share price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sale, which TI executives hope to complete by the end
of the year, has been greeted warmly by stock-market investors, and
Tuesday's announcement of poor second-quarter results didn't dent
the recent $10 run-up in TI's price per share.
</P>
<P>
   TI shares rose $2 to close at $60.94. Micron shares dropped 38
cents to close at $27.88.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker demand in the entire semiconductor market caused TI's
orders to drop to $1.9 billion for the three months ending June 30
from $2.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such temporary declines are part of doing business in the
up-and-down semiconductor business, Aylesworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the semiconductor market has grown at an average
of 15 to 18 percent a year, but it almost never grows at 15 percent
in any one year,'' Aylesworth said. ``It's far more volatile than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   TI embarked on a cost-cutting program during the second quarter
to cope with weaker demand. The company said in June that it would
eliminate 3,500 jobs. The company charged $233 million against its
quarterly earnings to cover severance packages and other
restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   TI is speeding up the process because it expects the crimp in
semiconductor sales to continue during the third quarter. The
restructuring is supposed to save the company $270 million in
expenses by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   TI also said that it earned $83 million during the quarter from
the sale of its stake in a memory-chip joint venture to former
partner Acer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   TI is betting that faster-growing, higher-profit specialty chips
will be its future earnings salvation.
</P>
<P>
   TI is the world leader in making digital signal processors,
chips that translate sound and motion into the language of
computers. Those chips are used in many electronic products.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, digital signal processor revenues were 25
percent higher than last year and contributed more than 50 percent
of the company's quarterly semiconductor earnings of $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Aylesworth said TI estimates that there are 30,000 independent
programmers working on applications of digital signal processors
and that 70 percent of them are using TI's chips and software.
</P>
<P>
   Those programmers are studying ways to use the chips to make
collision-avoidance systems in motor vehicles, faster modems for
connecting to the Internet, better hearing aids, even ``Dick
Tracy''-style interactive watches.
</P>
<P>
   Stripping away TI's troubled memory business and special
charges, TI reported quarterly operating income of $142 million, or
35 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that even in difficult market conditions, when
you strip away the charges and memory business, it validates our
strategy,'' Aylesworth said.

   UNITED NATIONS _ Denis Halliday, an Irish expert in development
who was given the job of injecting momentum into a faltering relief
program in Iraq, has decided to leave the post after less than a
year, U.N. officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials said that in running the program that
lets Iraq sell oil and buy food, Halliday had become frustrated by
constraints imposed by the Security Council and Iraqi policies, and
he was also said to have objected to the U.N. sanctions because of
the hardships for ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Halliday, on leave in Ireland, said in a statement he was
``winding up for personal reasons at the end of September.'' He
made no other comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the program that lets Iraq sell oil to meet
its people's urgent needs has grown hugely.

 &HT;    Glover helps put U.S. into basketball win column
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even with Puerto Ricans supplementing the Chinese
cheering section, the United States finally had a majority of the
crowd on its side and a Goodwill Games win under its belt Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by Georgia Tech's Dion Glover in the final seven
minutes, the young Americans defeated China 91-76 in a round-robin
game that was closer than expected due to China's superb free-throw
and outside shooting. The Chinese made 22 of 23 free throws and 10
of 24 3-pointers _ but grabbed only five offensive rebounds _
before a sparse Madison Square Garden crowd announced at an
unbelievable 5,639.
</P>
<P>
   The victory keeps alive U.S. hopes of reaching the semifinals.
However, even if the college all-star team takes tonight's game
against Brazil, advancing will hinge on results of the China-Puerto
Rico game. The U.S. and Puerto Rico (a 96-92 overtime loser Monday
to Brazil) each have one loss, and the semifinalists could be
determined by scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost, we knew it would have been over,'' said Elton
Brand, the center from Duke. ``We know we can win now, and we know
we can play well, especially in the clutch.''
</P>
<P>
   After blowing a 19-point lead in its 84-76 opening-game loss, to
the glee of the partisan Puerto Rican crowd, the U.S. had a tough
time staying ahead of China until the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some defensive pressure and everyone stepped it up a
bit,'' said U.S. coach Clem Haskins, who blamed youth and a short
(10-day) training camp for the loss to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 66 and 6:40 remaining, Glover went to
work in the next three minutes. He made a driving layup, a
hanging-on-the-rim dunk, assisted a Wally Szczerbiak 3-pointer, and
added another layup to help the U.S. take a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, who played just four minutes in the first half, admitted
it's tough being a sub. He said he got a pep talk from Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to keep my head up and go make plays,'' Glover
said.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, a Long Island prep star who is now at Miami (Ohio)
University, had 23 points, followed by Brand and Khalid El-Amin
with 14, Georgia's Jumaine Jones with nine (all in the first half)
and Glover with eight (all in the second).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dreamed of playing here all my life, and to play well is
something I never could have imagined,'' Szczerbiak said.
</P>
<P>
   China trailed 49-47 at halftime after Jinsong Jhang made one of
his four first-half 3-pointers with 26 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   In other games Monday, Lithuania defeated Argentina 81-77 and
Russia topped Australia 81-73.

 &HT;    Joyner-Kersee competing in last heptathlon
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. -- Muhammad Ali should have been this dominant.
Or Jack Nicklaus. Or Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee has ruled her craft, the heptathlon, like
few other athletes have theirs, going unbeaten for 12 years after a
silver medal showing at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. She captured
two Olympic gold medals in the multi-event, setting the current
world record of 7,291 points at the Seoul Games in '88. For good
measure, she won a long-jump gold medal and two bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the generation's greatest female athlete is ready to take
her final bow at age 36. JJK, as she is known in track circles,
closes out her farewell heptathlon tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this a celebration,'' she said. ``I'm sure I'll be sad
when it's over, but I also look forward to it being my last.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from modest roots in East St. Louis, she was named by her
paternal grandmother after then-first lady Jacqueline Kennedy,
because ``she wanted me to be the first lady or something.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew up as a self-described tomboy who spent her summer
afternoons jumping railroad tracks. She recalls long-jumping off
her porch into the front yard. To soften the landing, she and her
two sisters used sand brought home in potato chip bags from a
nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was go to one Olympic Games and be on
television,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``Just be on television. I never
thought I'd be around for all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she wasn't the best two summers ago in Atlanta, she
counts it as her crowning moment. After dropping out of the
heptathlon with a hamstring injury, she returned to win a bronze
medal in the long jump, soaring from sixth to third on her final
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Seoul Games provided the low moment of her storied career.
She and her sister-in-law, Florence Griffth-Joyner, dealt with
unsubstantiated rumors that their gold-medal efforts had been aided
by performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a moment of triumph and glory in '88, my performance was
swept under the rug,'' she reflected. ``I hope no other person
achieves a great thing and has to deal with innuendo and
accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other athletes who might have turned belligerent,
Joyner-Kersee remains one of the sport's goodwill ambassadors,
seemingly always wearing a smile. On the eve of retirement, she has
left Southern California for her hometown of East St. Louis. She's
taken on the role of city spokesperson and activist. Her foundation
led the effort to raise $7 million for a youth project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not losing a great athlete from track and field,'' said
Bobby Kersee, her husband and coach. ``We're losing a great
person.''

 &HT;    City too busy for Games
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Goodwill Games has hung banners from funky
Greenwich Village to the affluent Upper West Side, plastered its
logo on city buses and done everything in its power to paint the
town Ted.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Turner's sporting extravaganza is, if not lost in New
York, in danger of being overlooked. Games highlights playing on
the giant television screen atop a Times Square skyscraper Tuesday
morning took a distant second among pedestrians to a fallen crane
and its debris at a nearby construction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, there's so much excitement _ buildings falling
down,'' said Jesus Santiago, a security officer with the Times
Square Business Improvement District. ``A little game of
basketball, it's nothing. We watch it on TV. If the Knicks are
playing the Bulls, that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   This New York state of mind also spills over to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I know it's here,'' George Horner of Scottsdale,
Ariz., said of the Games. He said his trip is too short to attend
an event, preferring to take his wife and daughter to a Broadway
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the start of the Games,'' maintained Goodwill president
Mike Plant. ``You have to build a buzz and build awareness. The
thing I am adamant about, it is not an indication of the quality of
athletes or organizational glitches. Everyone needs to understand
this city has more (entertainment) opportunities than any other
city in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed no disappointment at attendance so far. Mondays
have been the toughest sells, but he said, ``as I told the staff,
that's why restaurants and Broadway theaters close on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Monday, 288,591 tickets from an available total of
462,960 had been sold. Some 10,000 were sold Monday, the highest
single-day total by 2,000. Many were for next week's figure
skating. Projections are now to sell 350,000 seats, down from the
original 400,000 of an original 600,000 available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sell out every session,'' Plant said,
``just as the Atlanta Olympics didn't sell out every session.
There's a misconception that multi-sport events sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they just look that way. At the 1991 Pan American Games
in Cuba, free tickets were distributed to people too poor to buy
them. Stadiums were filled.
</P>
<P>
   There have been discrepancies here between tickets sold _ or
distributed, since some are donated to children's charities _ and
actual spectators. At gymnastics Sunday, 11,440 tickets were
reported sold, but attendance was only 5,179.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field, the marquee event, drew 9,136 and 5,816 the
first two days, with the first sellout coming today at the final
session. The stadium location, on Long Island, makes it difficult
for New York City dwellers to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you have prize money, the athletes definitely turned
out for it,'' veteran American half-miler Mark Everett said. ``It
would have been nice if more fans supported it. I think the
performances would have been better. You saw that in Atlanta, where
every event was packed with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rallis Gialaboukis, whose family operates a food cart at 46th
Street and Seventh Avenue, has sold plenty of hot sausages to U.S.
basketball players, but has no time for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I know anybody personally who's going?'' he asked. He
thought for a moment and answered no.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is a hassle, he pointed out. And the weather, with
temperatures expected to reach 97 degrees today, doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Said Santiago, the security officer, ``If I could go to the
Goodwill Games or the pool, I think I choose the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   With an average rating of 1.6 over the first two nights of
competition, the Games moved slowly out of the TV starting blocks
as well. Turner Sports executives were looking for a 2.0 cable
rating over the course of 15 nights.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a positive spin on it, the executives point out that the
average Braves' audience is a 1.7 and that the average for the last
Goodwill Games four years ago in St. Petersburg, Russia was 1.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say if the average won't reach 2.0,'' said
Turner Sports vice president Greg Hughes. ``We think there's a good
chance the number will build. Tuesday's telecast had Michael
Johnson in the men's 400 meters. Then Wednesday, it will be Jackie
Joyner-Kersee in her last heptathlon, with MIchelle Kwan in figure
skating still to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell if that will translate into ratings, but we
know those are compelling stories.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a TV hotbed, it's metro Atlanta. Locally, the Games
drew a 4.0 rating Sunday and a 4.8 Monday.

 &HT;    USA Team Handball hopes sport gains notice
 &HT;    By Jon Gallo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Heading into USA Team Handball's inaugural USA Cup,
Atlanta All-Stars head girls coach Carol Peterka said something
that isn't usually heard before an international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is not that important for us,'' she said. ``We don't
have high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Peterka and Atlanta All-Stars head boys coach Matt Ryan
are hoping for at Georgia State University's Sports Arena is just
to get the sport established.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we want to do is lay a foundation that we can
build on in the future,'' said Ryan, who is the program coordinator
for U.S. Team Handball after captaining America's handball team at
the 1996 Olympics. ``We want to show people what our sport is all
about. This is just a steppingstone in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament will feature some of the best 14- to 16-year-old
teams in the world. The boys division includes teams from Quebec
and Puerto Rico, along with the Atlanta All-Stars and Atlanta
Select, a team comprised of Team USA and boys from the Boys and
Girls Club of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the girls division, the Atlanta All-Stars will face two
all-star teams from Quebec, as well as an all-star team from New
York and one from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those countries are very far ahead of us in terms of
developing their players, especially Canada, who I think is the
team to beat,'' said Peterka, a three-time Olympian for USA
Handball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here, we need to show kids that there are other sports
than just basketball, volleyball and softball. And handball is one
of those sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta All-Star boys open their double round-robin
tournament against the Atlanta Select this morning at 9, while the
the All-Star girls play New York at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of competition, the two teams with the top
records in each division will play each other Saturday at 1:30 and
3 p.m.

CANADIAN CORP. TO ACQUIRE U.S. STYRENE PRODUCER FOR $860 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nova Corp. of Canada will acquire the bulk of the styrene
operations of the Huntsman Corp. for $860 million (U.S.) in cash
and preferred stock, the companies announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Calgary-based Nova, which was spun off from
its gas-company parent on July 3, about 13 percent of the world's
capacity for styrene, a basic chemical used in packaging and
insulation. That would push it past Dow Chemical and BASF of
Germany as the world's largest styrene producer.
</P>
<P>
   For Huntsman of Salt Lake City, the largest privately held
chemical company in the United States, the deal represents a chance
to pay down debt and to increase funds to homeless shelters and
other charities that its ownership family has long supported.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it will let Huntsman funnel more than $100
million into research on genetic predispositions to cancer. Jon M.
Huntsman, the company's chairman, lost both his parents to cancer
and has had two bouts with the disease himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts said the fit of the two companies was a good
one, many were surprised by the timing of the deal. Styrene is
being sold these days at rock-bottom prices, and Huntsman, which
had revenue around $5.2 billion last year, has a reputation for
buying in tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Nova, which had sales of $2.4 billion last year, seems in poor
financial shape to buy anything right now. The company recently
announced that its second-quarter earnings would come in well below
its estimates. Shares of Nova, which are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, rose 56.25 cents Tuesday, to $17.625. The stock
began trading on July 6, closing that day at $21.375.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, chemical-industry analysts seemed pleased with the
deal. ``The link-up with Huntsman gives Nova access to good
technology and brain power,'' said James H. Wilbur of Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Winfried Fruehauf of Levesque Securities in Toronto, said,
``Nova's already a low-cost producer, and this will make it even
more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Nova's strategy runs counter to a trend in its industry.
Chemical companies have been bailing out of ethylene, styrene and
other basic chemicals in favor of higher-priced niche products like
agricultural chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Nova, in contrast, is
looking to divest itself of Dylark, a $70 million automotive-resins
business, because ``we want to send a clear message that we are
focusing only on commodity chemicals,'' said Jeffrey M. Lipton, the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Nova has sounded that note since January, when Trans-Canada
Pipelines Ltd. and Nova _ then a natural-gas company with a
chemical component _ announced that they would merge. The chemical
operations retained the Nova name, and began preparing for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton immediately began trumpeting Nova as a commodity chemical
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get the word out to other chemical companies that
we can provide a home for commodity businesses they want to
divest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton added that he was already speaking to various makers of
polyethylene to strike a deal similar to the one announced with
Huntsman. He declined to name any, but analysts cited Union Carbide
as one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Tuesday's deal, Huntsman will receive $625
million in cash and $235 million of nonvoting preferred shares,
which can be converted to a maximum of 10 million common shares of
Nova stock in two years. Nova will also assume $60 million of
Huntsman's debt. After the deal, Huntsman will become Nova's
largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Huntsman expects the two companies to combine some purchasing
operations and to seek ways to combine product lines and
operations. His son, Jon M. Hunstman Jr., will sit on Nova's board.

AIR FORCE NOMINEE FACES CRITICAL SENATE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ariz., Fla.)  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a Senate committee's crucial
confirmation vote, President Clinton's choice to be the next
secretary of the Air Force was still confronted Tuesday by a fierce
attack on his truthfulness and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   That attack has imperiled the secretary-designate's prospects
for confirmation to a job whose nominees generally breeze to Senate
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee, Daryl Jones, is an Air Force Academy graduate and a
former fighter pilot who is a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force
Reserve. During Senate hearings on his selection in the past month,
former squadron mates of his, including a former commander,
surfaced to accuse him of lying about his flying record and
pressuring enlisted airmen to buy Amway household products that he
and his wife sold.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary nine-hour hearing last Thursday, Republicans
on the Senate Armed Services Committee confronted Jones, voicing
concerns about his judgment and the discrepancies in his
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Jones defended his record, insisting that he was falsely accused
in some instances, made honest mistakes in others and had differing
recollections. His testimony, though, failed to persuade many of
the Republican senators on the committee, which met privately
Tuesday afternoon to debate the nomination. Senators and White
House officials said Tuesday night that the committee's vote, set
for Wednesday, was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Not since a Democratic-controlled Senate rejected President
Bush's choice of Sen. John Tower to be Defense secretary in 1989
have senators been so riven by a Pentagon nomination. The Senate
has not rejected a president's pick to head a branch of the armed
forces in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaning against him,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
committee member. He said that he was especially troubled that
Jones collected flight pay _ $88 a month _ for nearly four years
after he stopped flying F-16s and took a desk job.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his supporters say the accusations are false, or are
the result of innocent mistakes or honest differences of opinion,
and they have launched a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Jones defended himself Monday on the ABC program, ``Good Morning
America,'' and has met with senators this week to ease their
worries. Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen have called
wavering senators on behalf of Jones, who would become the first
black secretary of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's been tough on me, I do believe the process
has been open and fair,'' Jones said this week. Jones, a lawyer and
Democratic state senator who is considered a rising political star
in Florida, declined to comment Tuesday, citing the upcoming vote.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Jones' nomination has stirred accusations of
racism and political favoritism, and offered a glimpse into what
Jones' supporters say is a good-old-boy network that pervades Air
Force Reserve units in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The service secretaries are civilians responsible for budgets,
recruiting and training, but not combat operations. Over the years,
administrations have rewarded the jobs as political perks, but the
Clinton administration has also used the appointments to expand
opportunities for women and minorities in the upper echelons of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Jones, 43, would succeed Sheila Widnall, the first
female secretary of an armed service, who resigned last fall. The
Air Force job pays an annual salary of $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jones wins Senate confirmation, some of his supporters
wonder aloud whether he will be able to shed the taint of the
accusations and gain the respect of the 380,000 service members and
115,000 civilians under his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would weigh heavily in my final judgment,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, who like Jones is a native of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have criticized the administration for not
fully vetting Jones before nominating him. But administration
officials say most of the accusations against Jones were publicly
known beforehand and have been exaggerated or misstated by critics.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Jones had a sterling career at the Air
Force Academy and as an active-duty F-4 Phantom pilot. Most of the
criticism regards his record after he had left active duty and, in
1990, joined the 93rd Fighter Squadron, a reserve unit flying F-16s
based at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. He was the first
black pilot in the unit's history.
</P>
<P>
   Former squadron members told senators last week that other
pilots, many Vietnam War veterans who had known each other for
years, resented Jones from the start, suspecting he won a coveted
slot in the unit because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those individuals felt that race was very much a factor in his
being selected as a pilot for the 93rd,'' Lt. Col. William Vrastil,
a former squadron member told senators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Jones was also launching his political career in the
Florida House. But his civic duties took time away from his flying,
and it began to show, officials said. At least twice, Jones scraped
the tail of his $20 million F-16 on landing. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ A 48-story elevator scaffold at the problem-plagued
Conde Nast building construction site collapsed Tuesday, raining
tons of steel on West 43rd Street, killing an 82-year-old woman and
creating daylong chaos by forcing the evacuation of nearby
buildings and closing much of Times Square to traffic and
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator tower, which carried construction workers up the
side of the gleaming structure, began peeling away from the
building about 8:25 a.m. and a long piece of steel broke off,
plunging through the roof of the Woodstock Hotel across 43rd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said more people could have died had construction
workers not waved pedestrians and cars away as a 26-story section
of the scaffolding collapsed. City officials said Thereza
Feliconio, an 82-year-old resident of the Woodstock Hotel, was
killed by the steel that fell into her building, while 12 other
people suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A piece of tower broke off and started gaining momentum as it
fell,'' said Edward Young, a Fleet Bank official who watched the
accident from his 39th-floor office at 1133 Avenue of the Americas,
at 43rd Street. ``It pierced through the roof of the Woodstock. It
went like a spear through a piece of cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident created an eerie mix of chaos and quiet in an area
normally teeming with activity, as city officials closed most of
Times Square and surrounding streets from morning to night because
they feared that additional debris might fall and that an adjoining
scaffold damaged in the accident might also crash down.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as theatergoers streamed into the area, the part
of Broadway north of Times Square resembled one big pedestrian
mall.
</P>
<P>
   But the accident and the closings had a damaging ripple effect
throughout midtown, disrupting traffic as far as away as Central
Park well into the evening. And hundreds of businesses in the Times
Square area essentially shut down for the day, leaving many
restaurants, theaters and shops to complain about the loss of tens
of thousands of dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the third major mishap at the site since
construction began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva suggested two possible
reasons for the accident: either bolts were missing that were
needed to secure the elevator tower to the building, or a load
being carried by a giant crane had mistakenly struck the elevator
tower and fatally weakened it.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 p.m. Tuesday, after city officials surveyed the scene
from surrounding rooftops, they expanded the area that was closed
and evacuated, fearing that debris from the 600-foot-tall
scaffolding could fall up to two blocks away. Streets and buildings
more than 100 yards from the scene were closed, including Times
Square south of 45th Street, 43rd Street between Avenue of the
Americas and Eighth Avenue, and 42nd and 44th Streets between
Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to understand the danger of this,'' sid Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani at an afternoon news conference a block away from
the Conde Nast Building, which is at the southeast corner of 43rd
Street and Broadway. ``The immediate area is closed because as you
start the process of securing buildings, we don't know what could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the city and the contractor, Tishman Construction,
would begin securing the scaffolding Tuesday night by tying cables
to it and wrapping netting around it to prevent wooden planks,
toolboxes and other material from falling to the streets below.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said it would take three to five days to secure the
scaffolding and dismantle what is left of the elevator tower. About
half the 600-foot tower crashed down, including all the tower above
the 22nd floor.
</P>
<P>
   City officials gave mixed signals about when streets would be
reopened. Giuliani saying the evacuations and closings could end as
soon as Wednesday, but others indicated they might last until this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to be very cautious in closing off as much area as we
thought necessary,'' Giuliani said. ``No one really knows how
secure everything is up there. There's a difference of opinion on
that. We have to assume it isn't safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disruptions, officials said the the situation could
have been worse, since additional injuries or even deaths were
prevented by quick-thinking construction workers. Pedestrians and
drivers on 43rd Street who witnessed the accident told how the
scaffolding suddenly let loose with a loud screech as it started to
tear, and workers began shooing people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several stories worth of this torn tracking just started to
separate from the structure, and the construction workers began
herding people out of the way,'' said Andrew Mullen, who works for
a technology company at 1133 Avenue of the Americas. ``It was like
Godzilla coming. Everyone was scattering and I ran for my life.''

ELECTED BODIES WITH HARDLY A CULTURED BONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On most nights when opera is the attraction at the
Kennedy Center, the presidential box is either empty or filled by
low-level staff members or their friends. The faces everyone
recognizes turn out mainly for musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Not many senators or representatives show up, either, for
Washington's choice concerts and recitals or at big exhibitions at
the National Gallery, the Phillips Collection and the Corcoran
Gallery, or even at most plays at the city's award-winning Arena
Stage. High culture is about as popular a diversion in official
Washington as stock-car racing in the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, successive owners of the Washington Redskins
_ George Preston Marshall, Edward Bennett Williams, Jack Kent Cooke
and now his son, John Kent Cooke _ have never had any trouble
filling their box on autumn Sunday afternoons with politicians,
high-voltage lawyers and media luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   During working hours, some of the pols plot ways to cut federal
spending on the arts and to keep the remaining dollars _
pathetically few by the standards of most advanced countries _ out
of the hands of artists whose work is deemed offensive to ``general
standards of decency and respect for the diverse trends and values
of the American public,'' to quote the legislative formulation
whose constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court last month.
</P>
<P>
   The artists, understandably, feel beleaguered. When William
Bolcom's new Sixth Symphony, with a movement aggressively titled
``Marche II Contre les Philistins,'' was given its premiere in
Washington earlier this year by the National Symphony Orchestra,
the composer said in a program note that it was a protest against
``the increasingly hostile climate for the arts in our current
society.''
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course. Sena. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
of New York and Rep. Sidney Yates of Illinois champion the arts
even in today's chilly climate. In the not yet distant past,
Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court was a devotee of classical
music, not only as a listener but as a performer. A violinist, he
played chamber music for guests at home.
</P>
<P>
   But not since 1968, when Eugene J. McCarthy flew to Chicago for
the doomed Democratic National Convention with the poet Robert
Lowell and the novelist William Styron on his private plane, has a
high-profile American politician, at least in my memory, so
publicly associated himself with symbols of Art.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Republican-controlled Congress that has most visibly and
most recently been trying ``to drive a stake into the heart of
federal funding for the arts,'' as the departing chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, Jane Alexander, complained when
she left the capital recently to return to acting.
</P>
<P>
   But today as yesterday and the day before, with Republicans as
well as Democrats in control of the White House, with Democratic as
well as Republican majorities on Capitol Hill, the arts and
intellectual activity in general are often bashed and seldom
boosted by political Washington, left or right.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, though no worse than the run of American
presidents, is not much better, and presidents set the tone in this
as in so many other aspects of American public life. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, unlike Jacqueline Kennedy, appears disinclined to
compensate for her husband in this area. During their triumphal
tour of China, neither uttered a word of protest in public (or, so
far as is known, in private) about the Shanghai Bureau of Culture's
refusal to allow a production of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a classic
Chinese opera, to appear at this year's Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' tastes run to rock-and-roll, television sitcoms
and Hollywood yard goods, if their guest lists are any guide. Harry
Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the creators of chunks of
television bubble gum, were the first people invited by the
Clintons to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. True, they are
longtime Arkansas friends. But Barbra Streisand, who slept there
too, is not, and at the big White House bash last winter for the
British prime minister, Tony Blair, the featured entertainers were
Elton John and Stevie Wonder, neither of whom has any links to the
First Family or to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the cultural table for the press that evening, the actor
James Brolin said of Clinton: ``He's the most fun president we've
ever had. I think we can all agree about that.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that most American politicians care so little about
the arts or intellectual life in general? Why do many who do hide
it? Why do others go out of their way to pillory culture? Is a
philistine climate in Washington, often reflected in statehouses,
an accident or a historical inevitability?
</P>
<P>
   I think we set ourselves on the road to a philistine political
tradition long ago, when we resolutely turned our backs on the old
aristocratic cultures of Europe, setting up what Tocqueville
identified as a lasting tension between elitism and egalitarianism
_ tension very likely to be resolved in favor of the egalitarians,
he said, given ``the ever-increasing despotism of the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, New England brahmins and Virginia planters like Adams
and Jefferson and Madison gave the young United States something
approaching an aristocratic tradition in politics. All of them were
cultivated men.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1828 the nation took a fateful turn against the Eastern
elite with the election of Andrew Jackson, the quintessential
backwoodsman, who became the first American president without a
trace of the aristocrat in his lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Having established the primacy of the frontier in American
politics, his supporters crowded into the White House to celebrate,
leaving muddy footprints on the chairs and carpets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, William Henry Harrison beat Martin Van Buren,
campaigning as the ``log cabin and cider'' candidate and ridiculing
Van Buren as an Easterner so effete that he actually had a bathtub
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's victory provided a corollary precedent to Jackson's:
if you aren't a man of the people, pretend to be. Like his running
mate, John Tyler, he was a Virginia aristocrat, but he ignored that
and ran instead on his exploits in the western wars: ``Tippecanoe
and Tyler, Too,'' said the campaign handbills.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the great mass of American politicians have shied
away from identification with things artistic and intellectual.
``Elite'' is one of the dirtiest words in the lexicon of American
politics, and those who are suspected of having a mansion instead
of a log cabin lurking in their backgrounds feel the need to hide
it with ostentatious symbols of the common touch.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Hudson River squire, served hot dogs to
the king and queen of England, and George Bush, an upper-crust
Connecticut Yankee, made a show of nibbling pork rinds. Talking
about the tables down at Mory's would have projected the wrong
image.
</P>
<P>
   The frontier style in American politics, as it might be called,
is related to the scarcely concealed notion that there is something
unmanly about the arts; John Wayne didn't talk about Rembrandt or
listen to Callas. Traditionally, American men have admired (and
aspired to be) tough guys, denizens of bars and smokers of cigars.
</P>
<P>
   The more genteel side of life, in this stereotype, is left to
the women, twittering away at card parties. Arts-loving men have
often been derided as homosexual or at least limp. For politicians,
it is safer not to run the risk.
</P>
<P>
   In this as in other things, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New
York is an exception, an opera lover since childhood who turns up
not only in the audience at the Met but onstage, to make some sort
of presentation or other. But then, he is the mayor of a city where
high culture is a multimillion-dollar business, and business,
unlike the arts, has long been seen as a proper preoccupation of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   FDR wrote one of the noble chapters in governmental financing of
the arts with the Works Progress Administration's support of
artists who painted murals and frescoes on public buildings and
writers who created a series of historical guides to the then 48
states. No one objected very much; artists were on the bread lines
just as much as assembly-line workers and haberdashers.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by his arts-loving, saxophone-playing legal aide,
Leonard Garment, Richard Nixon financed the National Endowment more
generously than any of his successors, although he himself had no
particular artistic leanings.
</P>
<P>
   And John F. Kennedy and his culture-vulture wife, Jacqueline,
created Camelot, disdained today by the revisionists but
astonishing at the time. Not only were the intellectually lively
like Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and John Kenneth Galbraith recruited
for key places in the administration (Hannah Arendt said that
Kennedy had ``emptied the Harvard faculty''), but the artistically
distinguished were invited to state occasions, from Robert Lowell
and Robert Frost to Pablo Casals.
</P>
<P>
   Like President Nixon, President Kennedy may have had pedestrian
tastes; indeed, Richard Reeves says in his book about the Kennedy
presidency that JFK cracked jokes behind his wife's back about the
soirees she arranged. But Kennedy had keen enough political
antennae to know that high style sold well for the two of them _
our own version of royalty _ however much an exception that
represented from the usual rules of American public life.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians have dreaded seeming out of touch with the
mainstream of American culture, especially its more populist
elements. They take it as a given that refined sensibilities play
badly ``out there.'' Cowed by polls, fearful of retribution at the
ballot box by voters whose instincts they habitually underestimate,
they attend prayer breakfasts even if not very religious and
surround themselves with movie and television stars.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow from H.L. Mencken, they have turned the nation's
political culture into a Sahara of the Bozart, where eggheads are
punished unless they keep their heads down, as Adlai E. Stevenson
and Eugene McCarthy both learned; where the yahoos thrive and where
few voices are raised in celebration of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   If American politicians have little interest in traditional arts
_ or seem actually scared of them _ one can imagine their lack of
interest in defending truly controversial art. If they would just
as soon stay away from Mozart and Renoir and Shakespeare, shock art
makes them squirm.
</P>
<P>
   And especially in the last century and a half, much of
avant-garde painting, music and literature has been adversarial and
difficult to access by the uninitiated. The homoerotic photographs
of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano's cross submerged in
urine not only offended members of the religious right but
doubtless upset many in the mainstream as well.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, this kind of work has ignited a political
bonfire that came close to consuming the whole idea of federal arts
subsidies. While such art is part of a long tradition of esthetic
radicalism, it also marks a departure, not only shocking the
artistic sensibilities of some of those who experience them but
also offending the religious beliefs of millions at a time when
religion and politics are unusually closely linked in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' Moynihan commented, ``it seems to me that
there is an unusually assertive desire to shock. Maybe that's
because artists feel that they live on the margins of a
materialistic culture, or maybe it's just my age. At any rate, when
you get shocked audiences, you're going to get shocked people in
Congress too, because Congress as a whole _ the Senate, at least _
has a range of dispositions, talents and tastes not very different
from the country's.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For every Pat Moynihan who reflects the values of the faculty
lounge, in other words, there are a lot more Jesse Helmses who
reflect those of the Bible Belt, where the crabbed spirit of the
Puritans still shines. And artists, as Mencken observed, ``are
never Puritan and seldom even ordinarily respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates, who has been fighting these battles for decades, said
that few presidents, in his view, had put their hearts into the
arts, settling instead for ``fine-sounding words of support for
worthy ideals.'' Presidents operate within limits, he suggested,
``and some artists always go beyond the limits _ they operate out
on the edge, and that is what they are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the difference between Europe and America is
history.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, European monarchs, including popes, took it upon
themselves to support the arts, as did nobles and aristocrats.
Popes hired Michelangelo and Raphael, the Esterhazys employed
Haydn, and Frederick the Great, a composer of repute himself,
brought Voltaire to Potsdam for philosophical discourses.
</P>
<P>
   As the power of the absolutists waned, the obligations of
cultural patrons passed to democratically elected politicians,
along with the remaining aristocrats. A deference to cultural
elites persisted. I once asked Herbert von Karajan in the days when
he dominated the Salzburg Festival what he did when a production
ran over budget. He looked at me as if I had yet to learn the facts
of life and answered, ``I call Vienna, and the ministry sends
money'' _ an exaggeration, no doubt, but an accurate depiction of
lavish Austrian spending on music.
</P>
<P>
   Many British and French and other European politicians are
patrons of the arts in both senses, not only regularly voting for
large subventions but regularly attending plays and concerts. Some
are cultural figures themselves, whether full-time politicians with
artistic avocations (like Denis Healey, the former British foreign
secretary, a music lover who writes serious books and takes
photographs good enough to merit exhibitions) or full-time artists
with political avocations (like Andre Malraux, a minister under de
Gaulle, or Vaclav Havel, the president of the Czech Republic, or
Kurt Masur, a leader of the Leipzig revolt against the old East
German regime).
</P>
<P>
   The most successful French ambassador to Washington since World
War II, Emmanuel de Margerie, had previously headed France's most
distinguished art museums.
</P>
<P>
   Since London, Paris and Helsinki are their countries' cultural
as well as political capitals, the political classes there may be
more naturally friendly to the arts than in our country, where the
economic and cultural capital, New York, is an hour's flight away
from the halls of Congress. The political capitals of the largest
American states, which control arts budgets of their own, are also
distant from their cultural and intellectual capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Those who control the government money bags are in Albany,
Austin, Springfield and Sacramento, not New York, Houston, Chicago
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the worlds of government and the arts lived in close
proximity to each other, the antagonism might persist, unless the
politicians could stop worrying about looking like elitists in
their constituents' suspicious eyes. Cultural capitals are almost
by definition elitist places.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious drawback in the United States must be the lack of
a core cultural tradition, accepted by all, which the politicians
can foster with tax dollars. In a country as heterogeneous as this,
it is hard to imagine the almost universal love of serious music
that possesses Italy, for example.
</P>
<P>
   I remember hailing a cab in Milan on the night of a Sviatoslav
Richter concert many years ago and learning that the driver was
going, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the multicultural, egalitarian tradition weighs heavy.
Politicians and the rest of us are encouraged to believe that all
artistic traditions have equal merit. The result is a fragmented
view of the arts, a world where the politicians pander rather than
lead, resting content with their philistinism instead of
championing art _ (italics)any(end italics) art _ at the risk of
their political necks.

HOUSE APPROVES CONTINUED FINANCING FOR NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR
ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharp election-year conversion, the House on
Tuesday overwhelmingly approved money for the National Endowment
for the Arts, long the scourge of conservatives and a prime target
of Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 253 to 173 virtually guarantees that one way or
another, the arts agency will continue to receive the $98 million
it received this fiscal year, even though the money is attached to
a more controversial bill financing the Interior Department. Senate
leaders have said they intend to support the arts money and
President Clinton has said he wants it too.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote _ supported by 58 Republicans, 194 Democrats and
one Independent _ was foreshadowed by a committee vote last month
that approved the money and rejected the Republican doctrine
against using taxpayer money for the arts. Still, arts
organizations were relieved on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old debate over the existence of the NEA finally has given
way to a more thoughtful dialogue about the appropriate level of
federal arts funding in America,'' William Ivey, the new chairman
of the endowment, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote for the popular arts subsidy reflects the
moderating influence of a pending election. Republicans had also
provided themselves political cover by approving a number of
changes last year that they said would reduce previous problems.
The restrictions include broadening the distribution of grants to
more than just a few urban areas and building in safeguards against
the financing of artistic works that many conservatives deemed
obscene.
</P>
<P>
   The vote reflected a certain sentiment against New York state
and New York City. The state has long been the endowment's largest
beneficiary, breeding resentment among rural lawmakers who felt
that their artistic institutions could not compete with Lincoln
Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Moreover, many
conservatives perceived New York City as a hotbed of left-wing art
that offended mainstream sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes, which Congress passed last year but has yet
to fully implement, no state can receive more than 15 percent of
the total $98 million. New York is the only state that still
receives more than the 15 percent limit. Of the total given to all
states for exhibits and shows that travel across state lines, New
York received 25 percent, or $5.4 million of the total $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the grants that went for arts that stayed within the state,
New York received only a fraction more than 15 percent _ 15.47
percent _ of the total money given to all states during the current
fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. Still, New York fared far better
than any other state, receiving $12.5 million in fiscal 1998
compared with second-place California, which received $6.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was clearly legislation targeted at New York state,''
said Cherie Simon, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for the
Arts. ``Everyone understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has repeatedly trimmed the agency's budget, from a peak
of $176 million in 1992. Ms. Simon of the endowment said the agency
had undergone substantial internal restructuring in response to
congressional concerns. For one thing, she said, the agency was
spreading its money around more evenly to other states,
acknowledging that 20 states had been ``undeserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are intended to tighten the rules to try to avoid
financing controversial projects. Congress prohibited financing of
grants to individual artists, except in literature. And it
prohibited arts organizations from giving part of their grants to
third parties.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as May, Republican leaders had promised the
Christian right that they would de-fund the agency, and
conservatives had made eliminating the agency one of their top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition,
recently criticized the agency for financing several projects he
called blasphemous. He cited financing for the Manhattan Theater
Club to stage ``Corpus Christi,'' in which Christ is portrayed as a
homosexual (although the theater subsequently used the money for

JOYNER-KERSEE MOVES ON _ WITH SATISFACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ When she was 10 years old back in East St.
Louis, Ill., Jackie Joyner persuaded her two little sisters to help
her fill old potato chip bags with sand from a nearby park, lug
them home, and empty them onto the front yard. From the banister of
their porch, she then crouched, arched her back, and gleefully
jumped over and over into the makeshift pit.
</P>
<P>
   A heptathlon career that began with a young girl leaping off the
porch railing at 1433 Piggott Avenue ends Wednesday night when
Jackie Joyner-Kersee walks off the Mitchel Athletic Complex track,
almost sure to be smiling regardless of the outcome. At 36, with
six Olympic medals and the satisfaction of knowing her career has
inspired countless other young girls in other front yards to
believe in themselves, she finds it is time to move on. It is time
to go home, to her foundation, to the youth center she is building,
to her sports marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever wants to say goodbye,'' she said Monday, ``but the
realization is, you've got to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there's one very important farewell remaining _
Joyner-Kersee will do the long jump at a Grand Prix meet Saturday
in Edwardsville, Ill., just a few miles from her old neighborhood _
her last heptathlon began Tuesday at these Goodwill Games.
Ironically, it was at the inaugural Goodwill Games in 1986 where
Joyner-Kersee became the first heptathlete to score more than 7,000
points. She calls it the biggest moment of her long career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' declared the woman born in 1962,
named after Jacqueline Kennedy because her grandmother ``was
hopeful I would become the first lady of something.''
</P>
<P>
   She has. ``If I can achieve a quarter of what Jackie has
achieved, I'll be a happy woman,'' said Marion Jones, her heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered the finest female athlete of her generation,
Joyner-Kersee may be best remembered for her courageous performance
in the 1996 Olympics. Having been forced to withdraw from the
heptathlon after pulling a hamstring in the first event, she had 4
1/2 days to gather herself for the long jump. She did. Despite the
painful throb in her bandaged right thigh, Joyner-Kersee's last
attempt was good enough for a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   She has not competed in the heptathlon since, although she
finished second to Jones in the long jump last year in the US
nationals and played occasionally for the Richmond Rage during the
American Basketball League's inaugural season. Although
Joyner-Kersee had attended UCLA on a basketball scholarship, she
found the game had passed her by. But she says she had fun giving
it a whirl.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to her days of pigtails and cutoff shorts, of running
hurdles on Saturday mornings in the hallways of Lincoln High
School, of cheerleading for boys' teams at the community center,
fun plainly has been the root from which grew Joyner-Kersee's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into athletics, it was all about having fun,'' she
said. ``Even training up until the very last day, I have really
enjoyed myself trying to get in the best shape possible while
looking forward to the day when I don't have to do repeat 500s.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Joyner-Kersee chuckled. ``Things have been going well
in several events and not so well in other events,'' she said of
her workouts, shooting a look at her coach and husband. ``Bobby,
don't you say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Telling Bob Kersee to hush is like telling him not to breathe,
but this time he obliged, at least momentarily. In the years since
they met when he coached her at UCLA, Kersee has frequently been
criticized for his authoritarian manner. But the couple, married in
1986, long ago reached an accommodation between their split lives
as coach-athlete vs. husband-wife. In her autobiography, ``A Kind
of Grace,'' Joyner-Kersee writes about the ``mad room'' off the
garage where all arguments over track were left before the couple
entered the house. ``Bobby loves to tell people he's the boss at
home, that if we are deadlocked over an issue, he has the
tie-breaking vote,'' she wrote. ``If he wants to say it, he'll have
to put it in his book, because that isn't how it is in my book. Or
in our house.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kersee wore his awe on his sleeve. ``The moments of
victory have been great, but watching her go through adversity,
watching her struggle through tough times and keep that smile on
her face, stay friendly, thinking positive, stay uplifting ...
we're not losing a great athlete from track and field, we're losing
a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been tough times: asthma so severe that Joyner-Kersee
several times has had to compete in a breathing mask; allegations
of performance-enhancing drugs in the wake of the Ben Johnson
scandal at the 1988 Olympics that punctured her joy over winning
two gold medals there while breaking the world heptathlon record
and Olympic long jump mark. ``It was like my performance was swept
under the rug,'' she said, calling it the worst experience of her
career.
</P>
<P>
   But long after the details of her career are forgotten,
Joyner-Kersee's influence on women's sports will remain. Throughout
her career, she has fought back against the notion that one cannot
be both a lady and an athlete, fought her parents, boyfriends,
public perception. Indeed, the title of her autobiography stems
from an answer she once gave to a reporter from Time magazine: ``I
don't think being an athlete is unfeminine. I think of it as a kind
of grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As women,'' she said this week, ``all we ever wanted was to be
respected for what we were trying to do, and I think that's what's
happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Joyner-Kersee, a four-time Olympian whose 7,291-point
total is still the heptathlon world record, she can still see
herself jumping off that porch into a purloined pit of sand. ``As a
young girl, all I ever wanted to do was just go to one Olympic
Games and be on television,'' she said. ``I didn't know I was going
to break world records, win medals, and be out here as long as I
have been.''

STARR SEEKS APPEALS COURT ORDER IN DISPUTE OVER LEAKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr urged a federal
appeals court Tuesday to intervene in the dispute over leaks from
his grand jury investigation of an alleged affair and cover-up
involving President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As Secret Service agents testified before the grand jury on one
floor of the U.S. District Courthouse, Starr and attorneys for the
president, for one of his aides and for former intern Monica
Lewinsky met behind closed doors on another floor with a panel of
appeals court judges.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the dispute said Starr wants the appeals
court to block a ruling by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson concerning allegations that prosecutors violated federal
law by providing information to reporters about the grand jury
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   All of the attorneys declined comment as they left the closed
hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals. Charles Bakaly, a
spokesman for Starr, did not return telephone inquiries about the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over grand jury leaks began in February _ a month
after Starr expanded his investigation of Clinton's Arkansas
business dealings to include his relationship with Lewinsky.
Clinton's private lawyers, David Kendall and Robert Bennett, asked
Holloway to find Starr's office in contempt for violating federal
law requiring grand jury information to be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago, Johnson summoned Starr to her chambers _ along
with Kendall, Bennett and Lewinsky's legal team _ to respond to the
allegations, which were bolstered by Starr's published admission
that he and his chief deputy, Jackie M. Bennett, informed reporters
about certain aspects of the grand jury inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that June 15 hearing, Johnson apparently ordered
Starr to provide information that would help her determine whether
he or his team of prosecutors and investigators illegally disclosed
grand jury evidence. As she has done with most of her orders,
Johnson ordered her ruling on the leaks complaint to be kept
secret. Two weeks ago, Starr asked the appeals court to put
Johnson's order on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and accused magazine
publisher Steven Brill, who wrote the article in which the
prosecutor was quoted, of ``a serious misrepresentation'' of his
comments about the Clinton-Lewinsky investigation and his
discussions with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-January, Starr and Bennett have been overseeing a
grand jury inquiry into whether Clinton or any of his associates
tried to illegally cover-up his alleged sexual encounters at the
White House with Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied under oath engaging in
sex. Clinton has said publicly he never told anyone to lie. He also
denied any misbehavior involving his meeting outside the Oval
Office with Willey, a Democratic activist later hired by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Their claims reportedly are contradicted by taped conversations
between Lewinsky and a former friend, Linda Tripp, who turned about
20 hours of tapes over to Starr. Tripp, who has testified during
the grand juries previous six day-long sessions, was not at the
courthouse Tuesday but is expected to return Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Starr's prosecutors called Secret Service employees
before the grand jury hoping to learn more about Clinton's alleged
encounters with Lewinsky while she was working at the White House
as an intern and later as a staff member, then after she was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for four of the subpoenaed officers said prosecutors
seem to be focusing on an alleged meeting between the president and
Lewinsky in late December after she had been summoned to testify in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also are trying to learn what the president's
bodyguard might have overheard from conversations between Clinton
and his advisers about Lewinsky, said Michael Leibig, a lawyer for
four uniformed Secret Service officers. ``The prosecutors are
generally interested in very specific things _ the people present
at certain meetings on certain dates,'' Leibig said.
</P>
<P>
   Leibig said none of his clients saw any evidence of a crime
while protecting Clinton. ``I don't think they saw the president in
an embarrassing, compromising or off-color situation,'' the lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's grand jury session was the second at which Secret
Service personnel testified. On Friday, hours after winning a
ruling from the Supreme Court, Starr's prosecutors questioned two
uniformed officers and a former member of the president's personal
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service had asked the courts to recognize a
``protective function privilege'' as the agency tried to block
Starr from questioning agents. The agency argued in a series of
hearings that if compelled to testify, agents would be pushed away
by presidents out of concern that conversations would not be kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cockell, the chief of the president's security detail who
asked to be reassigned last week, did not appear at the courthouse
Tuesday. He is expected to testify for the first time on Thursday.

 &HT;    Blast survivor won't be intimidated
 &HT;    By Rheta Grimsley Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ There are roses, lots of them, in beribboned
florist vases and varying stages of wilt. Blood-red petals pool on
bookshelves and tabletops.
</P>
<P>
   The dead roses and other reminders of the crime are everywhere
in the yellow, subdivision home of nurse Emily Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   There is the piano she can no longer play; a plastic surgeon
worked on her hands, but she still has trouble punching a
telephone, using a knife and fork, fastening a bra.
</P>
<P>
   There is the new, wide-screen TV, the only one Emily can see
since she lost her left eye and much of her vision.
</P>
<P>
   There are the big clumps of hair in the hairbrush, evidence of
the thinning of the long, dark shock that might have been Emily's
only vanity.
</P>
<P>
   There are the newspapers, with daily reports of the search for
bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph, a man some North Carolina
residents see as a hero, a modern-day Robin Hood. Rudolph was
spotted Jan. 29, the day of the bombing, outside the abortion
clinic where Emily Lyons worked.
</P>
<P>
   And if external reminders aren't enough, there is her own body.
Emily Lyons wears a Coke bear shirt and cutoffs that show her
leprous legs. There have been nine surgeries since Emily was
injured and a policeman killed at the clinic. Every time she feels
she's making headway, it's time for another nail to be pulled from
abscessed tissue, or a hole in her leg to be plugged, or a ruptured
eardrum fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after she started getting around on her own, Emily had
surgery on her right leg to remove five nails. ``It was five days
before I could walk again,'' she says. ``I felt I was right back
where I'd started. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That's not true, of course. She is better. With a lighted
magnifying glass she can see to read a little, and when the phone
rings, she can answer.
</P>
<P>
   When they called to ask Emily to come to Washington to testify
against gutting the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization
(RICO) law, she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Me?' You want me? I'm nobody.''' Then she thought
about it. She thought about how more people could end up dead or
maimed if certain politicians have their way. She called her ear
surgeon to make sure the recently repaired eardrum was ready to
stand an airplane ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is or it isn't, I'm still going,'' Emily told the
doctor. Her husband, Jeff, went with her. She took a friend to help
her dress. Her mother bought her some new clothes for the trip.
(Emily's weight has dropped dramatically since the bombing.)
</P>
<P>
   The woman who once was nervous every single day for two years
while teaching an Arkansas nursing class stood before Washington
cameras and was cool as an October morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blown up, I can't be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has been live with Larry King, written up in
Cosmopolitan and featured on ``American Journal,'' Emily Lyons is
reserved, quiet. She doesn't complain, or see herself as some kind
of emerging feminist heroine. Resting on a couch with her cat,
Snowball, Emily tries to figure out which of the Tom Clark gnomes
she loves is missing from her collection. A hobby store has a big
sale going on.
</P>
<P>
   Her sense of humor is alive and well. She took one of those
Halloween, rubber eyeballs with her to Washington and threatened to
``pluck'' it from her face and let it fall to the floor for
dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for an occasional laugh, she says, the hospital
bed would be in her living room instead of an exercise bicycle
``and I'd be wallowing in it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone sent a limousine to ferry Emily home from the
hospital, she asked it to stop at the clinic. Blood stained the
pavement, but that day, at least, Emily's eyes were too weak to
see.

 &HT;    Manhunt for Rudolph expected to drag on
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Federal law enforcement officers have settled into
what they expect to be a slow and arduous search for Birmingham
bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the searchers concentrated on an area of the Nantahala
Forest near the house Rudolph's family moved into when he was 14,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mechanics in Atlanta were examining a 1977 Nissan
pickup truck, trying to determine how far Rudolph may have driven
it. The truck was taken from an elderly Nantahala man the night of
July 9 and abandoned nearby with two flat tires on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having experts examine it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of
the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   George Nordmann, 71, reported the truck and about six months of
food stolen on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Near Nordmann's home, which has been a focal point of the
renewed searching in the past week, investigators found an
observation point and a campsite. They believe Rudolph watched
Nordmann's residence for several days. His thumbprint has been
identified on a food wrapper at the observation point,
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also were trying to determine if a boot print
matched the Danner boots Rudolph bought from a Nantahala outlet,
they said. But the boots are a popular brand, worn by many hikers
and even by searchers for Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph had not been seen since Jan. 30, the day after the
bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic killed an off-duty police
officer and severely injured a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are moving slowly, partly for fear of booby traps,
officers said. Agents want to question Rudolph in three bombings in
Atlanta _ the July 1996 explosion in Centennial Olympic Park and
the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic and a gay
nightclub. Investigators believe those bombs may have targeted
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working systematically very, very hard in arduous
conditions,'' Killorin said. ''This is what we know. The man is in
the area. We've confirmed that. Absolutely, we're very careful
because this person is wanted for a homicide bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about Rudolph can call 1-888-283-2662.

COURT HOLDS SECRET HEARING ON GRAND JURY LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (with CLINTON-STARR) 
(bl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court held a secret hearing
Tuesday about a matter with no name based on a sealed lower court
ruling apparently relating to illegal disclosures of secret grand
jury material.
</P>
<P>
   Even that little could be learned only through leaks from people
who spoke on the condition that they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the hearing were lawyers representing the White House,
Monica Lewinsky, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, White House
adviser Sidney Blumenthal and President Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
   None of those who attended the hearing would discuss it, on pain
of sanction from the court.
</P>
<P>
   W. Neil Eggleston, a special legal adviser to the White House
who was present, said: ``I'm just calling you back to be polite. I
can't talk about it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Bennett Marsh, Blumenthal's lawyer, said nothing.
``Nothing,'' she said. ``I'm not saying anything about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the spokesmen for those who attended the closed session
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' said Charles Bakaly, spokesman for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,
said he was ``curious but uninformed'' about the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Parties who did not attend the hearing said it had arisen from a
complaint filed in February by David Kendall, one of Clinton's
private lawyers. Kendall accused Starr then of disclosing grand
jury material that was harmful to the president, and asked Norma
Holloway Johnson, the U.S. District Court judge who oversees the
independent counsel's grand jury, to punish him.
</P>
<P>
   Those sympathetic to Starr said the hearing was strictly a minor
procedural matter. But those sympathetic to the president said it
related to an order harshly critical of Starr that was recently
issued by Judge Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, she admonished him and others not to talk
about sealed matters, after his public acknowledgment that he had
spoken to reporters about his investigation, lawyers familiar with
the warning said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes after the closed hearing began Tuesday, 11 news
organizations, which had had no inkling of it, filed an emergency
motion seeking admission. When Theodore Boutros, representing the
media organizations, showed up at the courthouse to file the
motion, the appeals court clerk would not even confirm that a
hearing was under way, Boutros said. Nor would the clerk provide a
docket number or a case name under which to file the motion.
</P>
<P>
   So Boutros filed a four-paragraph plea for admission, which was
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the D.C. Circuit to hold a secret hearing without even any
glimmer about what the hearing is about is extraordinary,'' Boutros
said, ``and it seems to me completely unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Boutros had some choicer words, but they were
off the record.

   MIAMI _ As the National Transportation Safety Board began
investigating the fire aboard a Carnival cruise ship on Monday,
some passengers said Tuesday they had smelled smoke long before the
crew told them of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers aboard the cruise ship Ecstasy, which had just
embarked on a five-day trip from Miami to Key West, and Cozumel,
Mexico, when the fire began shortly after 5 p.m. in the stern,
complained that even though they were quickly sent to a safe area
on the forward decks, they were told little of what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Moore, 31, an engineer from Atlanta, said that as time
dragged on in the safe area, an open deck, he kept thinking about
the film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't scared,'' he said, ``But then it kind of got
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake and Jill Levy were sitting in a restaurant when they were
ordered to the deck. ``I was scared; I was thinking about my
family,'' Jill Levy said. ``And they weren't giving us
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Margaret Torrez, 47, whose cabin was close to
the stern, said that in her hallway, ``there was nothing but
smoke.'' After that, she said, ``we were told there was a small
incident'' that made it necessary to go up on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dickinson, the president of Carnival Cruise Lines, disputed
claims that passengers were not told what was happening. He said
that beginning at 5:30 p.m., the crew made ``dozens'' of
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference, Robert Francis, a vice chairman
of the National Transportation Safety Board, noted that 35
nationalities were represented on board. ``We're very interested in
the relationship between the crew and the passengers, and the
language question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson also said that fire alarms first went off in a laundry
room area, where the fire is believed to have started. He said one
theory being put forth by Carnival technicians was that a spark
from welding there might have ignited some lint.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said the fire quickly spread two decks above, to the
mooring deck, which had no sprinklers. He said the deck was quickly
sealed off from the rest of the ship. Had the ship been on the high
seas rather than two miles out, he said, the fire could have taken
longer to fight, but it would definitely have been put out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all of the fire was on the mooring deck,'' he said.
``It was fully open on three sides. There was sufficient oxygen to
let the fire burn.'' The fire would eventually have died down, he
added, because once the flames consumed some nylon mooring lines on
the deck, the only other element for it to feed on was steel.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said there was no damage to any passenger cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they had not yet formed theories about the
cause. Francis said of the welding theory that it was too early to
draw conclusions. He also said the Coast Guard and Miami law
enforcement agencies would investigate the response from crew
members and the adequacy of the sprinklers and alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board already reviewed those areas in April, in the
wake of its investigation of a fire in 1996 aboard the cruise ship
Universe Explorer off the coast of Alaska. That fire originated in
the laundry room. Five crew members died from smoke inhalation, and
the safety board recommended closer monitoring of heat and smoke
detectors in laundry rooms of ships.
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously injured on the Ecstasy, although at least
54 people, mostly crew members, suffered minor smoke inhalation.
Seven of them were taken off the vessel before it docked.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was first spotted at 5:30 p.m., about an hour after the
ship left port. Initially, crew members fought it alone, but at
6:15 the captain, Vittorio Satori, radioed for help. That call went
out 15 minutes after the ship's 2,575 passengers were ordered to go
to the decks, Dickinson said. Shortly before 8 p.m., the fire was
described as being under control.

PENTAGON REPORT DISMISSES NERVE GAS CHARGES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With veterans of a once-secret mission by his side,
Defense Secretary William Cohen issued a detailed Pentagon report
on Tuesday dismissing charges raised by media reports that U.S.
forces involved in a 1970 operation in the Vietnam War used nerve
gas to kill American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report on ``Operation Tailwind,'' a special forces
mission into Laos that was the subject of a CNN-Time magazine
report in June, found that the operation was both a reconnaissance
and diversionary mission to draw enemy forces away from a larger
CIA-backed operation to cut enemy lines of communication inside
Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Citing declassified documents and interviews with participants,
the Pentagon report found no evidence to support the CNN-Time
charges that the secret operation in September 1970 was used to
hunt down and kill American defectors with sarin gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to defectors, no document, military order,
after-action report, briefing paper or official military history
mentions the pursuit of U.S. defectors as Tailwind's mission,''
Cohen said at a Pentagon news conference. ``There is no hint, nod,
wink or subliminal reference to such a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only two documented American defectors in the Vietnam
War, the report said, and neither was in Laos at the time of
Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve gas was kept in storage in Okinawa throughout the Vietnam
War and was never used in Southeast Asia. Instead, records show, a
highly concentrated form of tear gas was dropped by Air Force jets
on enemy troops during Operation Tailwind, to help the special
forces unit as it was being lifted out of Laos by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found no evidence that sarin nerve gas was used or that it
was ever transported to Vietnam, Laos or Thailand,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable News Network and Time magazine, which are owned by
Time-Warner, retracted the reports nearly one month after they were
made public, apologized to the soldiers involved in Operation
Tailwind and dismissed the CNN producers involved.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said it was important for the Pentagon to conduct its own
investigation and issue a public report because the CNN-Time report
was being used in anti-American propaganda in the Middle East,
specifically Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to the extent that Saddam Hussein could seize upon
that and use that telecast as an effort to discredit the United
States, may have been successful in his own country,'' Cohen said.
``It certainly called into question the United States position as
far as urging the strict enforcement of the sanctions that
currently Saddam must comply with.''
</P>
<P>
   Special forces veterans who were interviewed by CNN producers
said that the producers had ignored their statements denying ever
using nerve gas or hunting defectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the report we were horrified,'' said Maj. Gen.
John Singlaub of the Army, who commanded the Studies and
Observations Group special forces units in Vietnam and is now
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not believe that they would make those charges,
because the number of times that they brought it up to those of us
who were interviewed, we would say, `April, it did not happen,'''
Singlaub said at the news conference, referring to April Oliver,
one of the producers who was dismissed. ```You're on the wrong
track. It did not happen, either of those two accusations.'''
</P>
<P>
   At CNN, a spokesman refused to confirm or deny reports that the
network had reached a settlement with Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, a
retired Naval officer who has said that his statements were
distorted by CNN and Time. The Washington Times reported on Tuesday
that CNN agreed to pay Moorer an undisclosed sum and was
negotiating with Col. Eugene McCarley, the Army officer who led
Operation Tailwind.

GREENSPAN RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT INFLATION THREAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
roiled the stock market Tuesday as he dashed investors' hopes for a
cut in interest rates anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before Congress, the nation's central banker lauded
the ``impressive'' performance of the U.S. economy, but repeatedly
raised concerns about a return of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With labor markets very tight ... the risks of a pickup in
inflation remain significant,'' Greenspan said in his semiannual
report to Congress on the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a theme he would return to no less than 10 times during
his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,
telling lawmakers ``under prevailing tight labor markets
increasingly confident workers might place gradually escalating
pressures on wages and costs'' and ``the potential for accelerating
inflation is probably greater than the risk of protracted,
excessive weakness in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While warnings about the adverse consequences of inflation
pepper virtually every Fed speech, Greenspan took pains to warn
investors who might interpret recent data about the second quarter
to suggest the Fed planned to lower interest rates sometime soon,
Fed watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to make sure the markets knew in no uncertain terms
that there would not be a rate cut anytime in the near future,''
said Bryan Jordan, economic analyst for Banc One Investment
Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Investors on Wall Street took the hint, sending the Dow Jones
Industrial Average down 105.56 points, or 1.14 percent, to close at
9,190.19.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Greenspan's comments did not suggest the Fed
planned to raise interest rates at its next Open Markets Committee
meeting on Aug. 18, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking solace in that, bondholders pushed the price of the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up 11/16 point, or $6.88 per $1,000
in face value.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has held steady on interest rates since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire warnings about inflation, Greenspan also told
lawmakers the conditions for continued growth with low inflation
are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent economic performance, with its combination of
strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have
witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the
American economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers estimate the inflation rate will average about
2 percent in the fourth quarter _ up from about 1.75 percent in the
same period last year _ and then rise to about 2.5 percent by the
fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the dangers of inflation, Greenspan also raised
concerns about what a Fed move to raise interest rates might mean
to the struggling economies of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be aware that monetary policy tightening actions in
the United States could have outsized effects on very sensitive
financial markets in Asia, a development that could have
substantial adverse repercussions on U.S. financial markets, and,
over time, on our own economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed observers say there is a noticeable split at the Federal
Reserve, with Greenspan more worried about the repercussions of
raising interest rates than some of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Greenspan, personally, he's less inclined to raise
interest rates,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest
Corp. in Minneapolis. ``He's concerned about the international
situation getting worse and creating turbulence around the world if
the Fed hiked interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part because of the Asian economic crisis, U.S. output
slowed sharply during the second quarter, Greenspan noted.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors' strike, which has idled auto plants across
the country, could slice half a percentage point off the nation's
gross domestic product during the second quarter, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   While marveling at the overall performance of the U.S. economy,
Greenspan has not hidden his opinion of the extraordinarily high
value of many stocks, referring in a now-infamous speech in
December 1996 to investors' ``irrational exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Greenspan again raised concerns that securities
analysts have developed ``unrealistic'' expectations for stock
values over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, we are discounting the hereafter,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The markets have little heeded those warnings. The Dow shot past
the 9,300 level for the first time last week, while both Nasdaq and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks hit record levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he thinks the stock market is too high,
and there's no question the stock market gives him the back of its
hand,'' said Robert Dederick, economic consultant for Northern
Trust in Chicago. ``But he wants it on the record.''

MARKET PLACE: MERGER WITHOUT INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mass., Canada)  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the articles of faith in the world of mergers
and acquisitions is that integration is essential to a successful
deal.
</P>
<P>
   That means melding sales forces, executive staffs, back-office
operations and research efforts into a seamless whole.
</P>
<P>
   But John Roth, chief executive of Northern Telecom Ltd. of
Canada, and Dave House, chairman of Bay Networks Inc., who are
trying to rally Wall Street behind their companies' pending merger,
have a different idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dave and I talked about doing this deal, we came to the
conclusion that the vision we both shared is very compelling and
the best thing to do is don't integrate,'' Roth said in an
interview Tuesday. ``Bay will be a subsidiary of Nortel, but it
will continue to be Bay Networks. It's a `If it's not broken don't
fix it' kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not what the financial community has been waiting to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   On the day last month that Northern Telecom announced an
agreement to acquire Bay for $9.1 billion, Northern Telecom's
shares lost more than 15 percent of their value, largely on fears
that the Canadian company was paying too much for an operation with
too poor a track record.
</P>
<P>
   House and Roth agreed to an hour-long telephone interview
Tuesday in an effort to win support for the merger, expected to be
completed in September. But concerns about integration may continue
to nag.
</P>
<P>
   Bay will essentially remain an independent operation,
potentially making it more difficult for Northern Telecom to
capitalize on Bay's technological expertise.
</P>
<P>
   House, who will become Northern Telecom's president, will remain
with his company in Santa Clara, Calif. Roth will remain at
Northern Telecom's headquarters in Brampton, Ontario. Meanwhile,
Northern Telecom's data networking group, which is meant to work
with Bay, will remain mostly in Ottawa and in Richardson, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Telecom is North America's No. 2 maker of equipment for
big telecommunications systems, while Bay mostly sells local
networking gear to individual companies and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Were Northern Telecom's plan simply to expand into the local
networking business, leaving Bay alone in Santa Clara might strike
investors as a great plan. But the main strategy behind the
acquisition is to incorporate, even integrate, Bay's data
networking technology into Northern Telecom's equipment for big
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are likely to be aggravated by two factors. Many
investors would like Bay to be more like Northern Telecom in the
first place, with solid financial controls and product development
and relatively steady earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Northern Telecom announced a net loss of $69
million, or 13 cents a share, for the second quarter. But before
one-time charges and gains, the company earned 41 cents a share, a
penny higher than analysts had expected and up from 30 cents a
share in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose almost 10 percent, to $4.16 billion, from $3.79
billion in the comparable period of 1997. Northern Telecom's stock
rose $1.75 a share Tuesday, to $61.3125, on the New York Stock
Exchange. Before announcing the deal with Bay last month, it was
trading at around $64.
</P>
<P>
   Bay's earnings, on the other hand, have been erratic in recent
years. Investors' concerns about Northern Telecom's intentions for
Bay could also be exacerbated by the fact that Bay itself suffered
from a difficult integration of its two predecessors, Synoptics
Communications, based in Santa Clara, and Wellfleet Communications,
based in Billerica, Mass., which merged in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for Roth is that if he tries to bring Bay
completely into Northern Telecom's fold, Bay's most important
asset, its engineers, might walk right out the door and into the
arms of a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   How Roth manages that balancing act will determine the fate of
his ambitious deal.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the embarrassing remnant of another era, caught on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1992, and Michael Stamenson is Merrill Lynch's No. 1
salesman worldwide. His client, Orange County, Calif., is by far
Merrill's biggest account, snapping up billions of dollars in
exotic securities.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-marine with a seven-figure income, Stamenson is the
featured star in a training tape that exhorts young Merrill brokers
to become a ``master of the universe,'' just like him.
</P>
<P>
   To become a successful Merrill broker, Stamenson tells the
recruits, they need the ``tenacity of a rattlesnake, the heart of a
black widow spider and the hide of an alligator.''
</P>
<P>
   That tape, now under court seal, was a prominent exhibit in a
lawsuit brought by Orange County that resulted last month in an
agreement in which Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. paid $400 million to settle
claims it helped push the county into bankruptcy with reckless
investment advice. Giving that advice, and selling those high-risk
securities was Stamenson, then on top of the world, at the top of
his game.
</P>
<P>
   Stamenson, 58, may no longer be a master of the universe. But,
considering the wreckage left behind, he has survived relatively
unscathed. He remains on Merrill's payroll at $750,000 a year _ a
$250,000 base and a $500,000 bonus. He is not working at his
regular job, but spends his days as a prime witness in the waves of
litigation flowing from Orange County's $1.6 billion investment
losses and December 1994 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, which is trying to disentangle itself from this fiasco,
has paid dearly in dollars and in public image. In addition to the
$400 million settlement, Merrill reached a $30 million settlement
with the county to end a grand jury investigation; paid $37 million
more in settlements with smaller municipalities in Orange County,
and is about to pay $3 million to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stamenson, the man at the center, is likely to escape any
legal punishment and remains well protected by his organization.
Merrill said Tuesday, as it has in the past, that it ``acted
properly and professionally in its dealings with Orange County''
as, it says, did Stamenson. Stamenson retains his Merrill stock
options and deferred compensation. By contrast, Orange County's
former treasurer and deputy treasurer pleaded guilty to criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   By the accounts of former colleagues and customers, Stamenson
was an aggressive salesman who knew how to manipulate clients'
weaknesses and made soothing reassurances if they balked at risky
investments. And there is ample evidence both he and his superiors
ignored danger signals as things began spinning out of control in
Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 memo from Edson Mitchell and William Broeksmit, two
Merrill executives no longer with the firm, for example, warned
Merrill management of ``potential adverse consequences for Orange
County in the event of a substantial increase in interest rates and
the flight of hot money'' from the county's investment pool.
</P>
<P>
   That memo, circulated among Merrill top managers, including
David Komansky, Merrill's current chief executive and then
Stamenson's boss, recommended halting sales of risky securities to
Orange County. But the firm never did so.
</P>
<P>
   The circling of the wagons around Stamenson began just five days
after the Orange County bankruptcy, when Komansky voiced support:
``I would say that Stamenson is exceptional as far as understanding
the investment philosophies and goals of the clients he works
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in an internal Merrill document given to Merrill
brokers in case clients should ask about the $400 million
settlement _ ``Q&AMP;As for Orange County Settlement'' _ a canned
answer was prepared concerning Stamenson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stamenson remains an employee in good standing. As we've
indicated previously, Mr. Stamenson has been spending most of his
time in legal preparations. Now that the litigation has ended, his
next assignment will be determined in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTER BANKRUPTCY, A MERRILL EMBRACE
</P>
<P>
   Stamenson is the man who knows too much. Because his actions and
his close relationship to the Orange County treasurer, Robert
Citron, were fully known to his Merrill superiors, it would be
difficult for Merrill to contend he was a rogue broker and cut him
loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon in corporate defense cases to worry about
cutting off the guy who's at the center of it,'' said a lawyer for
an Orange County municipality that sued Merrill. Like most people
interviewed, he spoke only on condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``You frequently see the person at the center of the storm
continue to be well compensated by the corporate entity, while they
are denying all wrongdoing,'' the lawyer added. ``The company can
cut someone off or embrace them. In the mix, they have to think
about: `What are the risks if I cut this person off? What happens
if he starts saying things to others?'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stamenson, who did not respond to requests to be
interviewed, is a recluse from his friends. He has no client
responsibilities. He spends his days in an endless series of
depositions. He has gained and lost so much weight on his
5-foot-8-inch frame that one lawyer said his videotaped depositions
``look like ads for a weight-loss program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what the future holds for him,'' said
Richard Marmaro, Stamenson's lawyer. ``I don't think he knows.''
Marmaro added there had ``never been any finding of wrongdoing''
against his client.
</P>
<P>
   Stamenson no longer enjoys an income that once came to around $3
million a year, but he is still paid more than most Americans. He
has a young and attractive second wife whom he married just before
the county's bankruptcy filing. He has his real estate: a $1.2
million, 5,200-square-foot, 13-room house on a street, called,
coincidentally, Merrill Circle, in suburban San Francisco; a
$755,000 town house in the Sierra Nevada foothills, and a $600,000
weekend getaway condo in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   While he no longer gives the lavish parties he once did _
complete with valet parking for his guests and a tour of his
library filed with lucite tombstone mementos of his Merrill deals _
his life is a far cry from his humble beginnings as the son of a
Greek immigrant on a California farm.
</P>
<P>
   Stamenson worked his way through college, graduating from
California State University at Fullerton, majoring in business
administration, before joining Merrill in 1971 as a retail broker
in Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the best salesmen I ever met,'' said a former
Merrill co-worker of Stamenson, who asked not to be identified.
``He knew how to manipulate and control customers. He could
penetrate an account deeply and then tell them what to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A KNACK FOR WOOING COUNTY TREASURERS
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is a tale of a salesman who smelled
opportunity in the sleepy backwater of municipal finance and struck
a mother lode. When California enacted Proposition 13, which cut
property taxes, in 1978, municipalities sought new sources of
income, and Stamenson found them in exotic investments like
derivatives, which carried much higher commissions than, say,
plain-vanilla Treasury debt. (Derivatives gain their value from
other securities to which they are linked.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He always came to conferences and was really good at making
presentations to county treasurers,'' said Don Merz, the Sonoma
County treasurer. ``He was good at describing what securities
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Chriss Street, an Orange County businessman and former broker,
said Stamenson ``picked a nobody client in the county treasurers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in their wildest imagination could foresee how much
money could eventually be made from county treasurers,'' Street
said. ``He positioned himself with the right customer as the
customer grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Stamenson was Merrill's salesman on its San Jose
account, which lost $60 million by using many of the same risky
strategies that were later used in Orange County. But his role in
that debacle did nothing to hinder his close relationship with
Citron, nor derail his career with Merrill. The brokerage house
played a relatively small role and settled for $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many transcripts relating to Merrill's Orange County
settlement are still under seal, there is evidence Merrill put
profits above caution and allowed a hard-driving sales culture,
from the bottom to the top, to prevail over warnings of a potential
financial disaster from cooler heads within.
</P>
<P>
   Even Merrill's current chief executive, Komansky, who was then
the head of its debt and equity group, was listed as a recipient of
memos raising red flags about Orange County, but did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County's investment strategy was risky by anyone's
standards; more so, since it involved public money. Starting in
1992, a series of Merrill executives urged caution, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Under Stamenson's tutelage, Merrill helped arrange for Orange
County to borrow billions of dollars short-term, in the form of
so-called reverse repurchase agreements, which were then used to
buy long-term interest-sensitive securities from Merrill, primarily
government agency debt and a type of derivative called an inverse
floater.
</P>
<P>
   Should interest rates fall, Orange County would reap enormous
gains from this strategy. But, if rates rose, as they did in 1994
when the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy, the value of
the interest-sensitive securities would plummet, as they did,
causing the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   BIG TRADES BROUGHT HIGH FIVES AT OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   For years, Orange County was Merrill's biggest client. In two
years alone, 1993 and 1994, it bought more than $6.3 billion in
interest-sensitive securities from Merrill. Lawyers who have seen
the numbers say that Merrill made more than $100 million from
Orange County between July 1991 and December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stamenson, whose ``gross production credits'' (a commission
formula based on securities sales) were $50 million to $70 million
a year in an organization where big producers were doing $5 million
to $10 million a year, was rewarded with an ever-increasing salary
and a shining Steuben star to show his rising status in the Merrill
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill knew exactly what Mike Stamenson was doing,'' added
the former Merrill co-worker. ``They were going along with it
because he was making them a ton of dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamenson was Citron's No. 1 adviser, and Citron was his No. 1
client _ a client whose elephantine trades were often greeted with
``high fives'' by employees at Merrill's San Francisco office. The
relationship was so close that Stamenson would write ``Bullet
Points'' for Citron to tell the Orange County Board of Supervisors.
Stamenson, along with other Merrill executives, gave $4,000 to
Citron's re-election campaign, 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   And when Citron became concerned that rising interest rates
would undermine his investments, Stamenson produced a Merrill
economist to quell his fears _ wrongly as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamenson was almost as arrogant as Citron himself,'' said
Zane Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a
newsletter. ``They made a good pair. It was always known that
Merrill would stand by Stamenson. Merrill had plenty of time to
censure him before that.''
</P>
<P>
   BOTH SIDES SAW POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1992, when Stamenson was picked to star in the
training videotape, evidence submitted in the trial shows that
Merrill was already concerned about potential legal liability in
Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone conversation between Stamenson and Citron, recorded
Nov. 9, 1992, and obtained by the Orange County district attorney,
shows both men and Merrill were fully aware of the high potential
for a financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In that conversation, Stamenson tells Citron how he was hastily
summoned to New York on a moment's notice to answer questions about
an article in the trade publication Derivatives Week that ``went
through Merrill Lynch like an ICBM,'' questioning the Orange County
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York meeting were ``very senior'' people, according
to Stamenson, including ``everybody from, what appeared to me, just
quite flippantly I'm putting this, from the janitor to the chairman
of the board.'' So worried were Merrill's top managers that they
called Stamenson back for a second meeting days later, flying him
from a London vacation on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `What the hell's going on?''' Stamenson recounted
on the phone to Citron. He said Merrill executives feared Citron
had ``too many of your eggs in one basket'' and that Merrill might
be facing ``a bailout phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Citron, in the taped conversation, says he had already been
called by a Merrill executive ``saying, `Hey, we've got a legal
problem here that Merrill Lynch has this great liability if
something happens like, uh, San Jose or West Virginia, and we want
to protect ourselves, OK?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm saying, I'm saying to Merrill Lynch, `Yeah, that's
fine,''' Citron continued, ```but where were you, you know, for the
year and a half that you were, you know, selling me this stuff?'''
</P>
<P>
   To which, Stamenson replied, ``Uh, we are not uh, we are not
embarrassed or, or uh, or uh, by any of the things that we have
sold you so far or any of the guidance that we have given you.'' &QL;

DEL MAR IS WHERE PARTYING MEETS PACIFIC _ AND PONIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ It's New Year's Eve in shorts and sandals,
also known as opening day at Del Mar racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few sure things on opening day: Traffic will snarl.
The timer will malfunction. The 2 p.m. first race, a mile starting
yards from the railbirds, will draw the big loudest cheer of the
summer. And a seven-week beach party will break out, featuring
shameless displays of suntanned skin.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's looser at Del Mar, to the occasional frustration
and ultimate delight of the racing community, which frankly gets a
little tired of Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and the L.A. freeways.
Here, the regulars book condos and hotels near the track, never
more than walking distance from a good restaurant and bar, and the
intense six-days-a-week schedule makes for an endless cycle of
gambling and parties.
</P>
<P>
   And the racing, during San Diego County's annual fling, is as
good as any on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   A track-record $18 million in purses is promised, $1 million of
that for the Pacific Classic on Aug. 15. The eighth running of Del
Mar's signature event won't have top-ranked Skip Away, but local
favorites Silver Charm and Gentlemen are scheduled to run.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm will use Saturday's San Diego Handicap to prep for
the Pacific Classic, further shifting the focus to the early part
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The West's major turf races of the summer, the Ramona Handicap
for fillies and mares and the Eddie Read for males, will be run
Aug. 1 and 2. After that, everything builds to Labor Day weekend,
culminating with the Sept. 7 Del Mar Derby for 3-year-olds on turf,
and closing day, Sept. 9, with the Del Mar Futurity for budding
Silver Charms.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for the Del Mar Derby will start the season today in
two $75,000 divisions of the Oceanside Stakes, marking the 10th
straight year and the 15th of 18 that the opening-day feature has
been split. Among the contenders: Dog Watch, Scooter Brown and
Outsourcing in division one, and Lady's Din and Kraal in division
two.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-race card includes the $84,000 Fantastic Girl sprint,
in which Tiffany Diamond will defend her title against seven
fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning defense of their Del Mar championships are jockey Kent
Desormeaux, who has six mounts today, and trainer Bob Baffert, who
saddles first-time starter Box Buster in the third race and the
claimer Thatsaknife in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay begins the meeting needing three victories to
surpass Bill Shoemaker's record (889) for Del Mar victories by a
jockey. Ron McAnally needs eight to beat Farrell Jones (374) out of
the equivalent record for a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have no trouble getting a celebration together down
here.

 &HT;    Trying to state their claim: Residents rush to Indiana's 125
million powerball
 &HT;    By Kelli Wynn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- They were all lined up in the center aisle with
money in their hands and anxious looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Their anticipation grew with each step towards the cash
register. And they all had one thing in common _ they all hoped to
win the $125 million Powerball jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   As the line grew inside Big Red Liquors in Richmond, Ind. on
Tuesday afternoon, outside Bob Cloyd sat excitedly in his truck
waiting for his wife and son to return with their ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third or fourth time playing it,'' said Cloyd, 65,
an Englewood, resident.
</P>
<P>
   He said his family spent $20 on tickets on Tuesday. If they win,
Cloyd said, he plans to donate money to charity and help his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be money well spent if I win,'' Cloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   To play Powerball, players must match the correct number on five
white balls out of 49 and one red ball out of 42.
</P>
<P>
   Because Powerball tickets are not sold in Ohio, local residents
often flock to Indiana or Kentucky _ the closest states that offer
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Leary, owner of Big Red Liquors, 4740 National Road East,
said Tuesday he had numerous customersfrom Ohio. He said the line
was especially long between 4 and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't mind the traffic one bit. He said his business has
benefited from all the Powerball hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they are here, they will also pick up other things,''
O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Often he gets customers who come in to buy a large number of
tickets. Most of those large purchases are made by groups of people
who collaborate in hopes of increasing their chances of buying a
winning ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the larger ticket purchases come from groups of people
who have collaborated to get the winning ticket. Since Big Red has
been selling tickets, O'Leary said, the most he has seen anyone
plunk down at once was $2,200.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Moe Benoit of Clayton had been dispatched to pick up
tickets. He bought $130 worth of tickets for a group at Good
Samaritan Hospital; his contribution was $5.
</P>
<P>
   While he would like to win the jackpot, Benoit said he plays the
game for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Hundred and twenty-five million, that's a lot of money.
You got one chance to win,'' Benoit said.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Weglage of Brookville also was sent by a group of
co-workers to buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times we just pick some numbers over and over again,''
Weglage said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorinda Criddell, a resident of Huber Heights has a system when
it comes to picking her numbers. Criddell prefers to use the jersey
numbers of her favorite athletes Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and
Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Ohioians know winning is a long shot, they all had a
sense of humor about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she would do if she won the jackpot, Weglage, 49,
said with a smile: ``I would retire with a capital 'R'.''

ADVERTISING: NEW JERSEY AS PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paradise has been portrayed in myriad ways in books, paintings,
films and plays. But rarely has it been suggested that paradise may
be found in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   That unlikely assertion is, however, the premise of a campaign
for Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. in Newark, parent of the
state's dominant utility, Public Service Electric and Gas. Because
the goal is to instill an emotional brand image in present and
potential customers, the campaign is centered on whimsical images
set to upbeat music that are meant to illustrate the concept of
paradise on earth, which _ surprise! _ just happens to closely
resemble the PSEG service area.
</P>
<P>
   The PSEG campaign, carrying the theme ``We make things work for
you,'' is by Merkley Newman Harty, a creatively focused New York
agency that works for clients including BellSouth Corp. and the
M&AMP;M/Mars division of Mars Inc. The commercials are intended to
ready PSEG for a deregulated world in which consumers choose their
energy suppliers from among a panoply of competitors, much as they
do now for such products as soft drinks, sneakers and soaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``In industries where consumers don't have choice, they don't
think about brands,'' said Stephen Bowen, business development
director at Merkley Newman, which is owned by Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   After the agency was awarded the PSEG account in January,
executives began considering how to bring the utility to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Merkley held a focus group to ask people what they think
about energy,'' recalled Jay Jacobs, corporate advertising director
for the PSEG Marketing unit in Edison, N.J., ``one participant
asked, `Are we going to talk about this for two hours?'''
</P>
<P>
   And the agency wanted to avoid what Marty Cooke, chief creative
officer, described as the cliches of the utility category:
``chairmen talking, empty nostalgia, high-tech imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was decided that the campaign ought to ``get people to
appreciate the company for what it does,'' Cooke said, ``which is
to supply the energy for a vibrant, high-functioning community _
and that's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, he added, ``The only way to do cool advertising
is to be ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this may be a chance for some optimism and
positivism, to show good feelings without the inner lining of
irony,'' Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the campaign's imagery is so, well, optimistic,
presenting a vision of paradise on earth that, according to one
television commercial, ``is just like the place you already live,
but better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scenes of a family running up a hill with PSEG
employees, evoking the vistas of ``The Sound of Music''; a
small-town parade reminiscent of ``The Music Man,'' and idyllic
suburban homesteads right out of ``Leave It to Beaver.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in one spot, an announcer declares: ``If you ask us,
paradise isn't behind a white puffy cloud. It's behind a white
picket fence.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a commercial aimed at businesses, featuring visits to a
clean carwash and a pleasant bottling plant, the announcer intones:
``Welcome to paradise, a place where everything works. A place
where there are no unexpected slowdowns, letdowns or shutdowns. A
place where all the things that should work do work, so everyone
can concentrate on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the cheerful tone makes it seem as if the ads were
created by Merkley Newman Pollyanna, Cooke replied: ``The
commercials make you feel good about life a little bit and about
the company that's the engine that helps things run. It's a little
fanciful, but true. You couldn't run this for LILCO, because it
wouldn't be true.'' His reference was to the former Long Island
Lighting Co., which was continuously castigated by its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The happy attitude of the campaign, Jacobs said, was intended to
help PSEG ``capture the emotional high ground before the fight
starts'' with utilities based outside New Jersey that will seek to
sell electricity and gas in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the campaign, he added, is $3 million through
November. Radio commercials began running last Wednesday and
television spots started on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of a utility to build a brand image was demonstrated
by Bowen, who sang an old jingle for a bus line that PSEG once
owned. The jingle, which ran on New Jersey-area radio stations,
urged listeners to ``take a Public Service bus'' to Palisades
Amusement Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public Service sure is great,'' Bowen warbled. ``It takes you
right up to the gate.''

TRYING TO SAVE AN OLD WAY OF LIFE FROM PROGRESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old Order Amish families hold church services in their homes.
They rarely invite outsiders to attend. But you can't drive more
than a mile through Lancaster County's rolling farmland without
thinking you've already entered one of the world's great sacred
spaces, a landscape consecrated over the centuries to a peaceful
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   If this view is no more than a day-tripper's idle projection, it
is not alien to a place that was settled in the 17th century in
William Penn's spirit of religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctuary is getting smaller, thanks in part to the car
that conveys you into a part of the world that retained its
serenity until the postwar years. In the last three years, more
than 1,000 acres of farmland in Lancaster County have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The car culture has gulped down big chunks of a landscape long
associated with the horse-drawn carriage. Open land has been turned
into sites for suburban subdivisions, big-box discount outlets and
strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   So what else is new? This is a story that has been repeated,
again and again, in urban and rural sites across America since the
end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is that for good reasons, people no longer believe,
as they did in 1945, in global progress. Progress now has
credibility only on the local level: the curing of a disease, the
healing of a family, the advance of a particular subculture or form
of art within the turbulence of cultural and economic
globalization. Progress often consists of redefining earlier forms
of progress as contemporary forces of retrogression.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the pressures of suburban development, last year
the entire county was placed on the World Monument Fund's annual
list of 100 Most Endangered Sites. Dairy cows and corn and tobacco
fields thus took their place with the domes of Hagia Sofia, the
temple sculptures of the Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the Monuments Fund has explicitly
designated a way of life, not just a building or historic district,
and it makes for a challenging problem.
</P>
<P>
   Action plans for endangered sites typically call for work like
restoring decaying mosaics, erecting a new roof or building a new
road to divert trucks. For Lancaster County, the action plan is
pitched well above the material plane. It acknowledges that
Pennsylvania and Lancaster County already have some of the best
land-use plans in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But quoting the anthropologist John A. Hostetler, the plan
advises: ``Nothing except a catastrophic intervention or spiritual
reversal can restrain the corrosive greed which spawns affluence
and insatiable growth. The key to preserving Lancaster lies in a
return to the very ideals that created it.''
</P>
<P>
   I won't hold my breath for that one. But I do hope for the
emergence of others like Randy Harris and Karen Weiss, two local
heroes who have been driving efforts to preserve the county's
historic way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, executive director of the Historic Preservation Trust of
Landcaster, has worked mainly to preserve buildings in the city of
Lancaster, the county's historic urban core. (This is the first
time an entire American city has been on the Monuments Fund's list,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weiss, land preservation director of the Lancaster Farmland
Trust, has worked tirelessly to convince farmers to accept property
easements, a deed restriction that, in exchange for payment by
donors, limits the use of their land to agricultural purposes. The
easements secured by the Farmland Trust in the past 10 years have
not quite kept pace with the forces of commercial development, yet
they represent far more than a respectable show of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster used to be a frontier town. This is where pioneers
purchased their Conestoga wagons and filled them with provisions
before heading west. Later, it was the site of F.W. Woolworth's
first five and ten. Today, it has many beautifully restored old
buildings, including an opera house, several former market halls
and the Hamilton Watch factory, now converted to apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The city's most recent preservation success is the scheduled
renovation of the old Watt &AMP; Shand building, an old department
store on Penn Square, an iconically grand civic center in the heart
of town.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a sad, familiar story, the store closed shortly after its
owners opened a branch as the anchor tenant in a shopping mall on
the city's outskirts. In addition to restoring the four-story
building, the plan calls for a mixed-use office and retail tenants.
</P>
<P>
   What can never be restored is the simple binary relationship
between town and country _ distinct but mutually supportive _ that
Ms. Weiss and Harris themselves personify. Much of Lancaster county
has been irretrievably splintered into what Peter Rowe calls the
``middle landscape,'' the car culture's decentralized realm. This
fragmentation lies beyond the repair of any action plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is another binary concept that might prove useful
in managing change: the cultural and economic shift from production
to consumption that is driving the transformation of urban and
rural environments nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   J.B. Jackson, the great landscape writer, once wrote that he
didn't favor historical preservation on what he called the ``small
town, middle-class scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he have made an exception for the Amish? They don't look
like the middle-class people you see at the shopping mall just
outside downtown Lancaster. They're not big consumers. They're
producers. This marks them off from us as much as their religious
belief.
</P>
<P>
   Production and consumption are not just economic terms. They are
cultural terms as well. Indeed, the shift from one to the other is
momentous, rivaling the car as the century's most powerful force
for cultural change.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to exchange one set of connotations for another.
Production evokes work, the work ethic, work as a form of prayer;
work on the land seems especially divine given its association with
the New Golden Land, the new Eden, where paradise might be
regained. Consumption, on the other hand, is inevitably tainted
with Veblenesque associations. The word conspicuous need not be
spoken to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   On the moral scale, the difference between production and
consumption is the difference between need and desire. And what is
going on in Lancaster County is essentially a reclassification from
one category to the next. It's a painful transition, precisely
because Lancaster County has lagged so far behind other parts of
the country in making it, and because throughout American history
the Amish have represented the continuity of some of our earliest
ideals. Much of the drive for development has come from within the
local community.
</P>
<P>
   The ugliest blot on the landscape is a gigantic theater that
will be used for biblical spectaculars. The second ugliest blot on
the landscape is an unfinished section of a highway, the Route 23
corridor, which, if completed, would run through several miles of
farmland, disrupting the Amish way of life even more.
</P>
<P>
   They got as far as building some earth rampways before running
out of funds, and the project is undergoing what I hope will be a
lengthy and ultimately futile process of environmental review.
Unattractive as it is, I halfway hope that this piece of cultural
distortion can itself be designated a landmark, included on tours
as a monument to the value of turning things around.

EX-BOND TRADER PENALIZED FOR FAKING PROFITS AT KIDDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An administrative law judge has ordered Joseph Jett,
the former star bond trader at Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co. who was
accused of manufacturing huge phantom trading profits, to repay
$8.2 million that he received in bonuses. The judge also fined Jett
$200,000, and barred him from the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   In a 54-page ruling that portrayed Jett as a Wall Street
scoundrel, Carol Fox Foelak, an administrative law judge at the
Securities and Exchange Commission in New York, said Tuesday that
Jett violated the Exchange Act by keeping false books and records,
in a fraudulent scheme that lasted more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Jett knew that Kidder did not understand the source of his
bond-trading profits, the judge said, and when his fraud was
finally discovered, he ``denied wrongdoing and gave misleading and
conflicting explanations.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not, however, find Jett guilty of securities
fraud, ruling that his reported securities transactions were phony
and therefore did not involve the actual trading of real securities
and so could not constitute a securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling is the first extensive review by a judge of the
case, which stunned Wall Street in 1994. The ruling, which comes
two years after a 20-day administrative court hearing, does not
become final for 21 days during which both Jett, and the SEC, which
brought the action, may appeal: first to the SEC's commissioners,
and then to the circuit court. Jett's lawyer said Tuesday that his
client would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came after Jett, 40, had won a few skirmishes against
his former employer and the SEC. In 1996, an industry arbitration
panel ruled that Kidder had not proven that Jett committed fraud
and he secured access to $1 million of $5 million of previously
awarded bonus money that the firm still held. But Jett, saddled
with legal costs, probably does not have the money to repay his
bonuses or to pay his fine, said two people close to Jett.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder, Peabody, once a Wall Street powerhouse, dismissed Jett
in April 1994, accusing him of manufacturing $339 million in
fictitious profits to hide trading losses and earn large bonuses.
Shaken by the scandal, Kidder's parent company, General Electric
Co., took a $350 million charge to its earnings that month. General
Electric soon decided to abandon Wall Street, and sold most of
Kidder at a loss to Paine Webber later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Since his dismissal, Jett has argued that he was a scapegoat for
a poorly managed firm. He has contended that his superiors at
Kidder knew about his trading strategies, and that _ unknown to him
_ a computer accounting glitch was responsible for his profits,
which he thought were legitimate. The glitch occurred in the way
that the firm's computers processed the stripping and
reconstituting of bonds. Traders often strip bonds, removing the
interest coupon, and may then later reconstitute them in an attempt
to benefit their trading strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's ruling, the judge said Kidder did not ``knowingly
encourage'' the scheme, or the booking of ``illusory profits.'' But
she faulted Kidder for its failure to understand and investigate
what Jett was doing in his bond trading. ``Kidder's inaction
increased the amount of ill-gotten gains'' that Jett recorded.
``Even after being alerted by red flags, Kidder's attempts to
understand and investigate'' Jett's trading ``were incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Jett's bosses at Kidder settled SEC charges in 1996 that
they had failed to supervise the star trader. Edward Cerullo, who
ran Kidder's bond business, paid a $50,000 fine and was suspended
from the industry for a year, while Melvin Mullin settled for
$25,000 and a three month suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Jett's lawyer, Kenneth Warner, said Tuesday in a statement that
``the decision correctly clears Jett of fraud charges,'' because it
found him guilty of record-keeping violations and not of securities
fraud as the SEC had charged.
</P>
<P>
   But, Warner added, ``it is illogical and wrong to sanction him
for a books and records violation when he scrupulously followed all
of Kidder's record-keeping procedures and Kidder itself was never
even charged with a books and records violation. We will definitely
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jett could not be reached for comment Tuesday. George Sard, a
spokesman who has worked with Jett, said he did not have further
comment from Jett to add to his lawyer's statement.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling was was hailed by SEC officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part we are pleased with the judge's decision,''
said Carmen Lawrence, the SEC's New York regional director, who
added that she and her staff would now review the judge's ruling.
``It's a very complicated case involving thousands of documents,''
Ms. Lawrence said, explaining the two year wait for the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Lawrence faulted the judge for ``failing to appreciate
the connection between the bogus transactions and the real
trading'' that Jett was doing. That connection, Ms. Lawrence
argued, justified the charge of securities fraud, as the phony
transactions _ while not themselves real securities trades _
disguised Jett's real loss-making trading. ``The judge says that's
not enough to make the make connection under the law. We think it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lynch, a former SEC official and a partner at Davis Polk &AMP;
Wardell who represented Kidder against Jett: ``It's a major victory
for the commission staff. With the exception of this one issue _
that while it was a fraud, the fraud was not in connection with the
purchase or sale of securities _it's a complete rejection of the
Jett defense.''

SCIENTISTS PROTEST DELAY IN U.S. VISA FOR INDIAN NUCLEAR
PHYSICIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prominent Indian scientist who had planned to take part in a
scientific conference in Virginia this week was not granted a U.S.
visa, prompting charges by American physicists that Washington is
breaking precedent by imposing political restraints on the free
exchange of scientific information.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist at the center of the controversy is Dr. Rajagopal
Chidambaram, the chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission, who
is also the vice chairman of the International Union of
Crystallographers.
</P>
<P>
   He was to have attended a meeting of the American
Crystallographic Association in that capacity. The meeting is being
held in Arlington, Va., but the Indian scientist had to cancel his
travel plans when he was informed that his visa would be delayed
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Chidambaram is one of a number of Indian and Pakistani nuclear
physicists whose requests for American visas have been placed under
indefinite ``review'' by the State Department in response to the
nuclear bomb tests carried out by those two countries in May.
</P>
<P>
   Another was Dr. Srinath Chellavaraja, an expert in theoretical
particle physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in
Bombay, who sought in vain to attend a meeting in Boulder, Colo.,
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Chidambaram has aroused the administration's ire for several
reasons, not the least of which was his recent role in India's
purchase of two Russian nuclear reactors capable of producing
plutonium that could be reprocessed to make bomb fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the 41,000-member American Physical Society, a
leading professional society of physicists, have protested and
warned that the State Department's action may set a dangerous
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irving Lerch, director of the society's international
affairs department, said in an interview that even during the
height of the Cold War, Soviet scientists were granted visas to the
United States. Not only did this preserve some freedom to exchange
scientific information, but ``it served as a confidence-building
mechanism that helped to defuse crises in relations.''
</P>
<P>
   To deny a foreign scientist a visa to attend a legitimate
scientific meeting is ``a direct violation of the charter of the
International Council of Scientific Unions,'' he said, which had
been respected by the State Department since the international body
was founded in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Lerch said, the State Department accedes to visa
requests underwritten by the American Physical Society. ``We get
Cuban scientists, Libyans and other nationalities,'' he said,
adding that the society wants the scientific exchanges even though
it does not approve of the recent nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin denied in an interview
that granting visas to Indian and Pakistani scientists would be
analogous to the issuance of visas to Soviet scientists during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a full-fledged, broad and largely friendly
relationship with both India and Pakistan, which was not the case
during the Cold War with the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``At that
time, scientific and technical exchanges often had a value above
and beyond the technical information that was being discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal Nature reported that the Canadian government has
informed the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna that it,
too, ``would not welcome participation of nuclear experts from
India in meetings in Canada until further notice.'' Nature also
said that Britain has cut off contact with nuclear researchers in
India and Pakistan. &QL;

BESIDE BALANCHINE, OTHER AMERICAN PIONEERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Ballet is 50 years old this year.
So let's rejoice. The company and its affiliated School of American
Ballet are remarkable institutions, and George Balanchine and
Lincoln Kirstein, their founders, are heroic figures. Nevertheless,
justifiable euphoria should not lead to myth making.
</P>
<P>
   Some dancegoers with hazy notions of history now seem to assume
that when Kirstein brought Balanchine to New York in 1933, America
was a balletic wilderness. Such a view was expressed by Nicholas
Jenkins in ``The Great Impresario,'' a tribute to Kirstein in the
April 13 issue of the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins declares, ``Kirstein and Balanchine labored to create
and then perpetuate a basis for classical dance in a country where
none had really existed before they arrived on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nonsense. And calling it so does not belittle either man.
A basis for American ballet did indeed exist in the 1930s, and
Balanchine and Kirstein built upon it, as did other architects of
balletic visions.
</P>
<P>
   Several opera companies, the Metropolitan among them, had ballet
troupes with schools, often headed by Italian ballet masters. There
were also teachers from other backgrounds, including American-born
and Russian teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Two famous Russians opened successful New York schools in the
early 20s: Michel Fokine, the choreographic reformer who created
masterpieces like ``Les Sylphides'' and ``Petrouchka,'' and Mikhail
Mordkin, a dancer noted for his magnetic presence. Both formed
companies. But financial difficulties prevented their groups from
becoming permanent. (Balanchine and Kirstein would experience
comparable problems.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, however, Mordkin made a fresh attempt to start a
company, organizing the Mordkin Ballet, whose dancers three years
later became the nucleus for the first season of Ballet Theater
(now American Ballet Theater).
</P>
<P>
   Anyone surveying American dance may find surprises. Chicago was
a balletic boom town in the 20s and 30s. The Chicago Opera employed
dancers, and there were ambitious, if short-lived, independent
troupes, some of them headed by Adolph Bolm, a former member of
Sergei Diaghilev's innovative Ballets Russes. Because of his labors
as choreographer, teacher and director in Chicago and California,
Bolm was a real pioneer. His Chicago creations ranged from ``The
Birthday of the Infanta,'' based on an Oscar Wilde fairy tale, to
``Krazy Kat,'' inspired by the comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   For a special Washington performance in 1928, Bolm choreographed
the world premiere of Stravinsky's ``Apollo,'' more than a month
before Diaghilev presented Balanchine's version of that work in
Paris. The three Muses in Bolm's production made their own
contributions to American ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Reiman taught for many years at the School of American
Ballet. Berenice Holmes stayed on in Chicago as a prominent
teacher. Chicago also remained the home of Ruth Page, who organized
several companies there, sometimes in association with the American
dancers and teachers Bentley Stone and Walter Camryn.
</P>
<P>
   Bolm went west in the 30s, becoming the San Francisco Ballet's
first director in 1933. His productions included ``Ballet
Mecanique,'' an Expressionist evocation of a factory, and
``Lament'' and ``Consecration,'' two heroic pieces set to Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Bolm had settled in Los Angeles, the San Francisco
Ballet began its long and happy association with Willam, Harold and
Lew Christensen, brothers from Utah whose early training was
largely Italian. Harold and Lew then studied at the School of
American Ballet, and Lew danced with the American Ballet,
Balanchine's first American company.
</P>
<P>
   But, although benefiting immeasurably from Balanchine's
guidance, he was already a trained dancer at the time. Willam
directed the San Francisco Ballet from 1938 until 1951, when he was
succeeded by Lew. Both Willam and Lew were versatile
choreographers, and Harold supervised the San Francisco Ballet
School.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ballet flourished in unexpected places. Our oldest surviving
regional company is the Atlanta Ballet, which Dorothy Alexander
founded in 1929. Another hardy perennial is the Dayton Ballet,
established in 1937 by Josephine and Hermene Schwarz, two
determined sisters. Both studied with many teachers, and Josephine
had danced with Bolm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A video documentary tracing their remarkable careers, ``How Can
We Know the Dancer From the Dance?,'' has just been released by
Global Village Communications of Bellbrook, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   And what was the first American ballet company to tour Europe?
Not one from New York. The Philadelphia Ballet existed from 1935 to
1941 and went abroad in 1937. It was founded by another pair of
sisters, Catherine and Dorothie Littlefield, whose mother had
opened a ballet school in Philadelphia back in 1908. Dorothie, a
respected teacher, was among the first faculty members of the
School of American Ballet, but she soon returned to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine choreographed such works as ``Terminal,'' which
depicted a busy railroad station; ``Ladies Better Dresses,'' a
satire on the fashion industry, and the rousing ``Barn Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Ballet, like most early balletic ventures
(except for those in Atlanta, Dayton and San Francisco), did not
last long. But neither did the Kirstein-Balanchine companies. The
American Ballet, founded in 1934, collapsed in 1938, then was
briefly revived for Latin American performances in 1941. Ballet
Caravan, a touring group organized in 1936, disbanded in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   One constant in this unsettled time was the School of American
Ballet, which continued to produce dancers. But, as a glance at
dance publications of the time will reveal, it was never New York's
only important ballet school. Then, in 1946, Balanchine and
Kirstein established Ballet Society, which initially presented
works for subscription-only audiences. After opening its
performances to the general public, it became the New York City
Ballet in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   By then ballet was successful in America. Balanchine and
Kirstein were major factors in bringing this about. And there were
other important influences from abroad: Col. W. de Basil's Ballets
Russes, which embarked on its first American tour in 1933, spurred
great interest in ballet, as did that company's rival, the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo, which arrived here in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The incessant coast-to-coast touring of the Ballet Russe and
Ballet Theater made Americans ballet conscious during the 40s.
Balanchine, among others, choreographed for these groups. Yet, at
the time, he and Kirstein probably did more to train dancers at
their school than to promote their choreographic conceptions, for
the simple reason that they did not have their own company for much
of that decade.
</P>
<P>
   However, thanks to various choreographic and directorial forces,
a ballet audience was formed, one that came to support the City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, then, served as architects of American ballet. Some
of their schemes were castles in the air; some proved sturdy. But
even the evanescent projects may have contributed to the art.
Balanchine and Kirstein were among the idealists whose dreams
eventually became realities.

A MAVERICK INJECTS PASSION INTO JAPANESE LEADERSHIP RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHANIES STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Making trouble has not been the best way to become the
prime minister of Japan, a role traditionally conferred on the
member of the governing party who has caused the least offense over
time.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the upstart minister of health and welfare, Junichiro
Koizumi, whose stock in trade is trouble-making, campaigning to
become president of the Liberal Democratic Party and thus Japan's
next prime minister?
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi has long advocated the privatization of the country's
vast postal savings system, the source of financing for many of the
pork barrel projects his colleagues use to insure their
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   He has often stood up to prime ministers under whom he was
serving, and last year he embarrassed the party by saying he could
not accept his monthly parliamentary stipend when the national
deficit was so high.
</P>
<P>
   And he is now proposing paring Parliament from 512 to 300
members in the Lower House and from 250 to 150 in the Upper House.
</P>
<P>
   That in-your-face style is both his biggest liability and his
most precious asset in the current contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koizumi is too radical, many party members think,'' he said in
an interview on Tuesday in his office, conducted _ atypically for a
Japanese politician _ in English. ``Too idealistic, they say.
Become more realistic, they say. But realistic can't change the
current situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Koizumi is in the race at all is that he neither
looks nor sounds like the two other candidates _ Keizo Obuchi, the
foreign minister who is widely regarded as the front-runner, and
Seiroku Kajiyama, the 72-year-old party veteran seeking a mandate
to repair the nation's shaky financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation is desperately seeking a new, more
vigorous image for the party after the drubbing the Liberal
Democrats received in the Upper House elections on June 12. ``They
are worried about their jobs,'' Koizumi said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the younger generation that forced the party elders to
revert to an open system of electing the party president.
</P>
<P>
   And it was some of those younger members who finally persuaded
Koizumi to challenge the others even though he had said he would
not run unless he was assured of winning. ``I am very ashamed of
what I said before, that I wouldn't run if I was going to lose,''
Koizumi said. ``I am still asking myself why did I say such a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger members' exhortations reduced Koizumi to tears last
Friday and on Saturday he announced his candidacy, which
immediately gave rise to rumors that it was an effort by the party
puppet masters to split the opposition vote and thus hand the prime
minister's post to Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, according to the speculation, Koizumi would get a
plum position and forgiveness for some past transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Koizumi rejected such suggestions, saying he thinks he can rise
above the factional alliances that typically determine who becomes
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a possibility for me to win,'' he said, almost
incredulously. ``Something beyond my calculation is happening.
Something is changing in Japanese politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He is advocating many of the same things as his two opponents _
tax cuts, financial system reform, an end to fiscal austerity. But
unlike them, he strongly favors small government, which is
manifested in his calls to cut the bureaucracy and privatize the
postal savings system. And, unlike them, he said unequivocally on
Tuesday that ``bad banks will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he could muster the legislative support to push such
programs through as prime minister, particularly if his election
caused a backlash among the party elders, is uncertain. He is
confident, though, that he has what it takes to effect his
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the power and prestige of the prime minister is much
stronger than people think,'' he said. ``Past prime ministers
didn't use the proper power; I would.''
</P>
<P>
   But one has only to look back at the current prime minister,
Ryutaro Hashimoto, to see how bold plans for administrative and
fiscal reform can be blocked by the powerful vested interests that
shape much of Japanese policy. ``His direction was right, but the
will, the passion to promote what he wanted to do, was lacking,''
Koizumi said.
</P>
<P>
   Passion? That's a word rarely used in Japanese politics. But
Koizumi used it several times, often lifting a fist to pummel the
air or the nearby table to emphasize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say Koizumi is Don Quixote,'' he said, mischievously
referring to an article in The New York Times last year that
compared his efforts to privatize the postal savings system to the
vain ramblings of Cervantes' hero. ``But sometimes, strong passion
to reach the ideal is necessary, the spirit to fight opposition'' _
he pounded the table _ ``the spirit to fight the people who want to
keep their vested interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He pounded the table again.

 &HT;    Wohlers may get second farm trip
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- What's the next step for Mark Wohlers?
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Braves are getting close to strongly urging the
beleaguered reliever to return to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz hasn't made this move
yet, but said, ``Ideally for Mark and the good of the team, the
opportunity for him to pitch on a regular basis somewhere would be
the optimum thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had spoken to Wohlers about returning to the minors,
Schuerholz said, ``We have not discussed that with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he?
</P>
<P>
   ``We may,'' Schuerholz went on to add, ``but I am not going to
discuss anything publicly until I discuss it with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers could refuse an assignment and then the Braves would
either have to keep him on the club or release him, meaning they
still would be liable for his contract. The deal has one more year
on it plus a team option in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Wohlers is not improving here. Wohlers has
pitched in three games since returning from the minors. He has
thrown 56 pitches, 32 of them for balls, including missing the
strike zone 19 of 24 times in his last game, coming Monday night
against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he may be going backwards, and even on team that is in
such command of its division his presence appears to be an
uncomfortable one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Wohlers spent as little time as possible at his
locker and when a reporter approached him for an interview, he
turned his back on her and started talking to Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if Wohlers can't be used in anything but a blowout, it
could begin to place a burden on the bullpen, especially
considering that veteran Dennis Martinez hasn't been very
dependable and has been relegated to long relief duties. This
leaves just four relievers for close games, not a practical number.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is sort of the Catch-22,'' Schuerholz said. ``In order
for Mark to get better, he's going to have to throw. And in order
for us to win games, he's probably not going to be able to throw as
often as he needs to get on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The man on turf
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Tom Glavine, who will open the series tonight in
Philadelphia, seems to benefit from pitching on turf, and that's
what he will be doing at Veterans Stadium. On the fake stuff,
Glavine is 3-0 and has not allowed a run in 22 innings. Meanwhile,
his opponents are hitting .260 against him overall but just .238 on
the road, where he is 7-1 with a 1.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Around the clubhouse
</P>
<P>
   In the locker of Wohlers hangs a photograph of him when the
Braves won the World Series in 1995. It has Wohlers, who got the
final out, with his arms high above his head. How times have
changed. ... Cubs manager Jim Riggleman can sympathize with Wohlers
better than most. Riggleman said he used to throw batting practice
when he was a manager in the minors, even saying, ``I could throw
it right over the plate almost every time.'' But one day Riggleman
took the mound and couldn't throw anywhere near the plate. ``I just
lost it,'' he said. ``I can't tell you why, but it was gone. So I
sort of know what Mark is going through. It's that Steve Blass
thing.'' ... Anyone interested in Denny Neagle as a television
personality can see him on MediaOne Channel 33. His show is Tuesday
at 6 p.m. and repeats Thursday at 5:30 p.m. and again Saturday at 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tools of the trade
</P>
<P>
   Baseball America came out with their best tools list, voted on
by the managers, and it was no surprise that Maddux was splattered
across it, being called the best pitcher in the National League and
also having the best control and best changeup. Bobby Cox is called
best manager while Walt Weiss is the third-best bunter and
hit-and-run batter. John Smoltz has the best slider while Tom
Glavine is second in changeup and control. Andres Galarraga is the
third best power hitter and Andruw Jones the second best defensive
outfielder. In their minor league picks, George Lombard was named
the most exciting player in Class AA and Bruce Chen the best
pitcher. Both play for Greenville.

 &HT;    Winning helps Sosa's season come together
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Pitchers generally drop their heads in disgust or
spit out an expletive _ or both _ when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   The gallop, to boast of his prowess. The wild flapping of the
arms, as if the weight of the Sears Tower has been lifted from his
shoulders. It's the exclamation mark following a blast by Chicago
Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   In June, it was seen about as often as Puff Daddy on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sosa, 29, hit a major-league record 20 home runs. To
put that in perspective, if Sosa had done that in April and May as
well, Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs would already be
obliterated by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a player hit for power and average for the
total month of June,'' said Cubs dugout coach Billy Williams, who
smacked 426 homers in his Hall of Fame career, most of which was
spent in Chicago. ``It seemed like every time he hit the ball, he
hit it hard. He stayed in the zone for 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   His 30-day total of 21 homers between May 25 and June 23, is
also the most in big league history. The pace has slowed. He's hit
only three this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never thinking about it,'' Sosa said of his 36 home runs.
``I'm never going to get them if I think about it. I just have to
take care of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   And this year he's doing it like never before. Of course, the
power has always been there. He's hit more than 30 homers in five
of his six full seasons with the Cubs. In 1996, he lauched 40,
despite missing the last month of the season with a fractured right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to forget, he's had big years already. He's a
30-30 man; drove in 100 runs three years in a row,'' Chicago
manager Jim Riggleman said. ``It's not like he's a so-so player.''
</P>
<P>
   But batting over .300? A notorious free swinger known to take a
hack at anything resembling a baseball, Sosa entered Tuesday's game
at .311. In '94, he finished right at .300, but his career average
is just .257.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, 29, has shown much more patience and ``this year, he's one
of the most relaxed players I've seen,'' said Williams, who served
as the Cubs' hitting coach when Sosa arrived in a trade with the
White Sox in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There's no secret why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning means a lot,'' Sosa said of his team, which was
leading the wild-card race entering Tuesday's game. ``The situation
has been a little different this year. Everything is just coming
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it add up to him surpassing Maris?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somebody's going to do it,'' Riggleman said. ``You've
got (Mark) McGwire, (Ken) Griffey, Sosa and (Greg) Vaughn. With
four guys on pace, one or more is going to get in the 60s. Sammy
may be the guy who does it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does or doesn't, Sosa said no one should take offense to
his signature statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get around the bases as fast as I can,'' Sosa said.
``But you have to enjoy the game.''

SENATE PANEL APPROVES FAST-TRACK AUTHORITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
and JENALIA MORENO 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate panel has resuscitated legislation to
grant the president greater authority to negotiate trade
agreements, a notion all but left for dead in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee, by an 11-1 vote, Tuesday approved
a measure originally designed to promote trade between the United
States and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled committee replaced that legislation
with a multilayered trade bill that, among other things, would give
the president ``fast track'' authority.
</P>
<P>
   Fast track authority enables the administration to negotiate a
free trade agreement without fear lawmakers will later try to
tinker with the trade pact's terms.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lobbied Congress hard last fall to win fast
track authority and jump-start negotiations aimed at creating a
Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed, in large part because of opposition from
organized labor and members of Clinton's own party. Last year's
debate became a national referendum of sorts on the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which many union members and Democratic
lawmakers deem to have been a dramatic failure.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of NAFTA _ a trade pact between the United States,
Mexico and Canada _ argue it has eliminated thousands of U.S. jobs
while generating few benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to cause a rift in the Democratic Party over the
issue just months before the November election, the Clinton
administration has not asked Congress to take up the fast-track
issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, sensing an opportunity to sever Democratic
opponents from a primary contribution source, have opted to make
the fast track issue a priority in the waning days of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Besides fast-track authority, the bill still would encourage
trade with Africa, extend a program to aid workers displaced by
NAFTA, grant additional trade preferences to the Caribbean nations,
and establish normal trade relations with Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   It would reduce import duties on some wool fabrics, implement a
shipping agreement and extend a trade program for developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has in the past emphasized its commitment
to almost every one of these measures,'' Senate Finance Chairman
William Roth, R-Del. said in a statement. ``I hope and expect we
will have the administration's support for each of these measures
now.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry called the effort to revive
the fast track debate at this point ``more political mischief than
commitment to free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's
office, expressed concerns that another defeat for fast-track on
Capitol Hill would have repercussions on the country's ability to
negotiate abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a no-risk proposition,'' Ziegler said. ``You don't
just throw fast-track out there for sport and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Democratic supporters were distressed to see
fast-track linked to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bill with something for everybody,'' said Edith
Wilson, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute and a
trade expert with close ties to the administration. ``Classic trade
votes are complex bills with something for everyone. ... You have
to have things for people to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill must now be approved by the full Senate, and Democratic
staffers in the Senate are already talking about ways to kill it.
If approved, it would go to a conference committee with House
members.
</P>
<P>
   Thea Lee, a trade expert for the AFL-CIO, which opposes both
fast-track and the Africa trade bill, said she thought the bill
could pass the Senate, which has supported fast track and many of
these other issues previously.
</P>
<P>
   But fast-track ``certainly gives it a lot of trouble in the
House.''

AMONG SOPRANOS HAUNTED BY HISTORY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: See related article JENKINS-SEATTLE-OPERA) 
(af) 
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Singers are forever trying to create inventive programs,
balancing art songs with arias, serious material with lighter fare,
the familiar with the novel. On records, the challenge is perhaps
even greater than in the concert hall, for the choices must stand
the tests of time and repeated listening.
</P>
<P>
   How gratifying, then, to encounter two new cleverly assembled
vocal disks. Ostensibly these albums are similar, each featuring a
rising soprano singing music by Mozart and Richard Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   But Jane Eaglen, who hails from England and will sing her first
Isolde in the Seattle Opera's new production of ``Tristan und
Isolde'' on Saturday, and Christine Schafer, who is from Germany,
have prepared contrasting programs, and their voices sound nothing
alike. Neither singer, unfortunately, displaces or even challenges
several sopranos who have preceded them in this familiar repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eaglen's record (Sony Classical SK 60042) is strictly
operatic and evenly divided between Mozart and Strauss. In a bold
move, she begins her program with the lurid final scene from
Strauss' ``Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   This tortured music is more often used to end an album, and Ms.
Eaglen's unusual choice commands instant attention. Perhaps, since
she is unlikely to sing the role of the sultry 16-year-old Judean
princess on stage, Ms. Eaglen and her producer assumed that
listeners would opt to hear this track first in any case.
</P>
<P>
   But this searing music opens with a cry from the heart, and Ms.
Eaglen's approach, plush rather than intense, seems misguided. She
lacks the piercing opulence of Ljuba Welitsch or Inge Borkh, who
defined the role of Salome in the 1940s and 50s. And she ultimately
fails to communicate the music's inherent drama.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mein Elemer'' from Strauss' ``Arabella,'' Ms. Eaglen sings
as if sleepwalking, and this for a young woman musing about various
suitors and her future. By contrast, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's famous
1954 recording of the aria for EMI is rightly suffused with
emotions, now pensive, now giddy. And of course there is Lisa Della
Casa's near-definitive account of the role under Georg Solti's
baton for Decca/London.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eaglen's ample, velvety voice should suit ``Es gibt ein
Reich'' (``There Is a Realm'') from ``Ariadne auf Naxos,'' yet
despite a rich tone, her account lacks passion. Ms. Schwarzkopf's
classic 1954 performance of this lament (in Herbert von Karajan's
recording of the opera on EMI), on the other hand, delves deeply
into the heart of the spurned Ariadne.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eaglen's Mozart selections fare no better. She nobly states
Donna Anna's ``Crudele? ... Non mi dir'' (``Cruel? ... Do Not Tell
Me'') from ``Don Giovanni'' but makes nothing of the character's
conflicted feelings. On Ferenc Fricsay's recording of the opera
from 1958 on Deutsche Grammophon, Sena Jurinac sings the aria
beautifully but also as if torn apart. What's more, Ms. Eaglen's
Italian sounds mushy in comparison with Ms. Jurinac's crisp
diction.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``D'Oreste, d'Ajace'' from ``Idomeneo,'' in which the
scorned princess Elettra rages, Ms. Eaglen seems perturbed rather
than unhinged. In Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt's 1971 recording of the
opera on EMI, Edda Moser sends chills down one's spine with her
shrieks, a feat that eludes Ms. Eaglen.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, Ms. Eaglen is supported unassumingly by Zubin
Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Mehta, an experienced
opera conductor, brings welcome expansiveness and striking colors
to the Strauss, and poise to the Mozart, but neither he nor the
orchestra has any effect on the soprano's seeming indifference to
the music.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schafer, for her part, offers no arias by Strauss, choosing
instead five of the composer's songs. And nearly all her Mozart
selections are concert, rather than opera, arias. In contrast to
Ms. Eaglen's program, which alternates between the composers, Ms.
Schafer's record (Deutsche Grammophon 289 457 582-2) is divided in
half: first Mozart, then Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schafer also opens her CD with an unconventional choice,
Mozart's ``Nehmt meinen Dank, ihr Holden'' (``Accept My Thanks,
Kind Patrons''), an aria often used to end programs. Here, it
serves to welcome listeners to a relatively unknown artist making
her major-label debut.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schafer's voice has an unforced attractiveness, in the
German tradition of singers like Irmgard Seefried. And her diction
is idiomatic and clean, even when she sings in Italian. Yet despite
her agility in works like Mozart's ``Exsultate, Jubilate,'' she
lets her naturally attractive instrument curtail emotion. Compared
with Maria Stader's ``Exsultate'' from 1960, on Deutsche
Grammophon, Ms. Schafer's sounds unaccountably restrained. And in
``Mia speranza adorata'' (``My Adored Hope''), Ms. Schafer lacks
the vibrancy Rita Streich provides in a 1958 recording, also on
Deutsche Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   Why Ms. Schafer takes the love song ``Ruhe sanft, mein holdes
Leben'' (``Gently Rest, My Dearest Love'') from ``Zaide'' at such a
fast clip is unclear, but she shouldn't, as Seefried's far more
affecting 1953 recording on EMI proves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Schafer's is an alluring voice, and the heart she
brings to ``Ch'io mi scordi di te?'' (``I Forget You?''), an aria
from a revision of ``Idomeneo,'' is among this disk's highlights.
The piece also benefits from the fluid piano obbligato of Maria
Joao Pires.
</P>
<P>
   The five Strauss songs are a good match for Ms. Schafer's
soprano, and in four of them her interpretations merit praise. She
not only clearly appreciates these miniatures but also connects
with their gentle messages. In the famous ``Wiegenlied''
(``Lullaby''), for instance, she finds erotic possibilities, and
she makes ``Liebeshymnus'' (``Hymn of Love'') a credible
affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The disk concludes fittingly, if not particularly originally,
with ``Morgen'' (``Tomorrow''), Strauss' best-known song. But
almost perversely, Ms. Schafer allows it to emerge unaffectingly.
The melodic line is self-indulgently elongated, almost to the point
of parody, and suddenly Ms. Schafer's timbre sounds dry. Ecstasy,
or even a generic ethereal quality, is entirely absent.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic are Ms. Schafer's
capable partners throughout. And though they make sure the
limelight remains focused on her, their reticence cannot entirely
disguise playing of such a high order.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eaglen's and Ms. Schafer's CDs send mixed messages. On one
hand, music lovers should be grateful for intelligently programmed
albums, which are infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   But if well-planned records are unsuccessfully realized, what's
the point? Producers need to understand a given singer's strengths
and weaknesses, and artists should embrace lessons of their
distinguished predecessors. Then we will have new records worth
buying.

New York City owns 750 of them, including the George Washington
Bridge. ``My father was the manager of my uncle's dry-cleaning
business,'' says Frieder, 44. ``To get to the city meant crossing
the great GWB. Back then, there was no lower roadway. I looked at

inflation remains more of a risk than recession, despite the sharp

financial crisis. Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee,
Greenspan signaled that the central bank was unlikely to raise
interest rates anytime soon. But he said the economy retained
considerable momentum despite the drop in exports induced by Asia's
woes. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE PICKED SEVENTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ As far as Cal State Northridge football coach
Ron Ponciano is concerned, seven is heaven for the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were picked to finish seventh in the Big Sky
Conference in the coaches' and media preseason polls at the
league's Football Kickoff on Tuesday. Montana was selected first in
both polls and was followed by Weber State in the coaches' voting
and by Montana State in the media's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I care about that (poll)?'' said the first-year
coach. ``I guarantee you that I will be ready and my kids will show
up to play. I actually like it and I'm tickled to death about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where I am hoping we'd be. We're not comfortable being
picked (high). We're comfortable at overachieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge was picked fourth in the 1997 preseason and finished
4-4 in conference, tied for fourth with Weber State and Northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Matadors were picked so low this year is because
of the team's quarterback situation. Junior Josh Fiske _ or one of
the other four candidates _ will replace Aaron Flowers, the
school's all-time leading passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most critical thing at Northridge is who replaces the
Flowers kid,'' said Montana coach Mick Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   Griz attack: Montana owns three Big Sky titles in the '90s and
is expected to reclaim the crown from Eastern Washington this
season. The Grizzlies are also looking for their second Division
I-AA national championship of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay completely healthy, we have as good of a chance as
anybody,'' said Dennehy, whose Grizzlies won the I-AA title in
1995. ``We still have guys around who have tasted (a championship)
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Washington coach Mike Kramer said, ``Montana is on a
mission to prove they are the best in the West, the Big Sky and the
nation. (Dennehy) has his jaws set.'
</P>
<P>
   Three's company: Ponciano, Northern Arizona coach Jerome Souers
and Weber State coach Jerry Graybeal are first-year coaches, but
since they all have Big Sky experience, it may not be that tough of
a transition.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano is a former CSUN defensive coordinator (1995-96).
Souers held positions as Montana's defensive coordinator and
secondary coach (1986-1997), and Graybeal was Eastern Washington's
defensive coordinator, defensive backs and linebackers coach
(1982-1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Jerome, Ron or myself will be surprised,''
Kramer said. ``The surprise may come in playing nonconference
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, however, said, ``I like to see fresh meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrifty Ponciano: Instead of whining about budget restraints
left by former coach Jim Fenwick, Ponciano and his staff
surprisingly signed an impressive recruiting class that included
many Division I-A prospects after spending around just $2,000. That
is a far cry from Montana State, which spent around $50,000, and
Montana, which spent even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with that,'' said CSUN athletic director Paul
Bubb. ``But I don't expect him to spend $2,000 in the future.''

SEAGATE FIRES ITS CEO, CO-FOUNDER, ALAN SHUGART  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SEAGATE   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Struggling disk-drive maker Seagate Technology unceremoniously
fired Alan Shugart, ending the reign of one of Silicon Valley's
most outspoken and longest-lasting chief executives.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt press release yesterday, the Scotts Valley
company said its board of directors ``requested Mr. Shugart's
retirement from the company,'' saying that the time had come to
make a change in leadership. The board consists of six nonemployee
directors plus Shugart.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart, 67, who has been Seagate's CEO since co-founding the
company in 1979, will be replaced by Stephen Luczo, Seagate's
president and chief operating officer. Luczo, a former investment
banker at Bear Stearns who joined Seagate in 1993, has been groomed
as Shugart's successor.
</P>
<P>
   The board offered no explanation for sacking Shugart, although
board member Larry Perlman offered a brief eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Al's total dedication and contribution to all aspects of
Seagate's success, it is difficult to adequately and appropriately
articulate our appreciation for his efforts,'' Perlman said in the
press release.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove Shugart comes as Seagate and the rest of
the disk-drive industry grapple with a downturn blamed on slowing
computer sales and an oversupply of disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate, the largest independent maker of disk drives, just
ended its worst fiscal year ever, losing $530 million. Its revenues
of $6.8 billion were the lowest in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in its most recent quarter Seagate posted a profit of $22
million, suggesting that a management restructuring last September
may be starting to pay off. At that time, Luczo was elevated to
president and put in charge of all disk-drive and component
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate's stock, which hit a two-year low of $19.56 last month,
had climbed back to more than $26 in the past week. It closed up 6
cents yesterday at $24.19.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts were stunned by the abrupt ouster of Shugart,
who is considered to be the father of the disk drive. So was
Shugart himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked. I thought I was doing a good job,'' he said
yesterday during a telephone interview from his office at Seagate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart said an emissary from Seagate's board delivered the bad
news to him Saturday at his other office in Carmel. Shugart asked
to confront the board members, who repeated their decision in a
conference call with him on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked them why they were firing me, I couldn't get them
to tell me anything other than it's time for a change, and we want
you to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have loved me to resign, but I wouldn't,'' Shugart
said. He said he is in the process of cleaning out his office, but
that he won't leave until he and the board come to terms on a
severance package. Unlike most CEOs, Shugart had no written
employment agreement with the company he has run for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Shugart earned $750,000 in salary. Bonuses and other
compensation brought his pay to $1,937,484.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart was also ousted as chairman, but Luczo was not awarded
that title although he was named to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any adequate reason as to why the board found it
necessary to remove Al,'' said Jim Porter, who runs the DiskTrend
market research firm in Mountain View. ``He wasn't interfering with
Luczo's mission to get new products out earlier and more
efficiently. In fact, he was enhancing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiter Tony Scott also was taken back by the way in
which Shugart was blindsided. ``The bluntness of the language in
the press release is surprising because of the signal it sends to
the outside world and to employees,'' said Scott, who is executive
vice president of A.T. Kearney in Redwood Shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who have been at Seagate for a long
time because of Al Shugart, and in a lot of ways he's seen as the
embodiment of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shugart is a main fixture in the history of the personal
computer. He developed the first disk drive for IBM in 1956. In
1969 he moved to Memorex, and in 1972 started his own disk-drive
maker, Shugart Associates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Shugart left that company, having burned through his
venture capital without introducing a product. He did some
consulting, tended bar for awhile and had a fishing boat off of
Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 he teamed with another Silicon Valley pioneer, Finis
Connor, to form Shugart Technology, which later changed its name to
Seagate Technology. Seagate became the first company to introduce a
51/2-inch hard-disk drive, which changed the face of personal
computing by letting users for the first time store data on their
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate went on to become a leader in developing faster, smaller
disk drives that held more and more information. Today's
high-capacity drives can store 16 gigabytes _ thousands of times
more than the first hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Luczo expressed confidence in Seagate's ability to weather the
current storm, and analysts believe he'll make a strong CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luczo and his team are excellent, and they'll get the results
they need at Seagate,'' said DiskTrends' Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only criticism is the way they treated Al,'' he said.
``They should have given him a dinner and a 21-gun salute.''

 REAL MARKETING CLOUT: McGWIRE DRAWS FANS  
(th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In St. Louis, Cardinals fans are snapping up blocks of tickets
for mid- and late September, preparing for the moment they believe
Mark McGwire will clout his 62nd home run. And, hoping to touch
what the Bunyanesque slugger has bashed, fans are clamoring for
faraway seats in the outer reaches of left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had post-season frenzies, but this has been going on
since April,'' said Kevin Wade, the Cardinals' group director of
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris' home run mark has turned the
Cardinals into a hot attraction, despite their 46-52 record. St.
Louis' 38,377 average home attendance trails only four National
League teams; its 33,254 road average is sixth. There have been
seven home sellouts, but tickets are still available for the 14
September dates.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are expecting McGwire's cachet to lure an additional
15,000 fans Wednesday night and Thursday afternoon to 3Com Park in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire's impact is pretty dramatic,'' said Bob Rose, a Giants
spokesman. ``You've got a lot of McGwire fans from his days in
Oakland, but we've already had some remarkable games against him
with the Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   His attraction was evident at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium,
where the Padres average 18,000 on Monday nights. This time, 32,139
fans turned out to watch McGwire stroke his 43rd home run. They
hooted when he was removed for a pinch-hitter with bases loaded in
the ninth inning of a 13-1 Cards' victory. ``People come out hoping
he'll hit a home run and hoping that he'll lose,'' said Glenn
Geffner, a Padres spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets' next home encounters with McGwire are not
until Aug. 20 and 21. Both nights are doubleheaders. But already,
Mark Bingham, a Met senior vice president, senses that McGwire's
drawing power is partly responsible for the 30,000-seat advance
sale for the second night, a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham said he expected a tide of excitement to swell beyond
the outfield, in the Pepsi Center pavilion and picnic area, where
the first 600 fans presenting Pepsi cans or bottles can enter the
area free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's prime home run territory, and McGwire will be on pace to
hit 55 that night,'' he said. Bingham hasn't measured McGwire's
effect on sales of left-field loge and mezzanine seats at Shea _
where he deposited the 400th homer of his career on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   And just picture the delirium at Busch Stadium next month when
Pittsburgh comes to town. Not much of a competitive draw, but few
seats will be empty for Beanie Baby Night on Aug. 14. Some fans
might even show up to see McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine it is Sept. 27 in St. Louis, the final day of the
regular season: the Cardinals against Montreal. Then visualize that
McGwire has 61 home runs and needs the final one to pass Maris, as
Maris needed Oct. 1, 1961, to surpass Babe Ruth. Finally, envision
20,000 fans in Busch Stadium, which fits 49,625.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost inconceivable that so few fans would show up for
such a momentous occasion. But that's just what happened when Maris
drew closer to Ruth; the fans stopped coming. And Maris wasn't the
only reason to show up. The Yankees were playing phenomenally. They
would win 109 games and finish eight games ahead of the American
League pack.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, 1961, the Yankees drew 57,824 for a doubleheader,
the day after Maris hit his 56th home run. Maris hit three more
home runs on the road, two in Detroit, before crowds of 35,820 and
44,219, and one in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yankees' first game back in the Bronx against Baltimore,
Maris struck No. 60, before 19,401 fans. The next game, he sat out,
and only 7,594 showed up. The season-ending series against Boston
continued the mystery: the first game drew 21,485 and the second
29,182 (including 10,000 free). When Maris ripped no. 61 to right
field off Tracy Stallard, there were but 23,154 witnesses, most of
them apparently in the right-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember hearing people say they would go to the game only
if they could get a seat in the right-field stands,'' said Marty
Appel, a former Yankees publicist and producer of their television
games. ``But there might have been 11,000 there if a restaurateur
hadn't offered $5,000 for the home run ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the attendance was a backlash against the less admired
Maris overtaking the legendary Ruth. Maybe fans lost interest when
baseball's commissioner, Ford Frick, ordained that Maris would be
the home run record-holder only if he topped Ruth in 154 games.
Maris did not, in the first 162-game season of the expansion era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frick ruled on July 18 and Maris' 154th game in Baltimore
became the deadline,'' said Steve Hirdt, executive vice president
of the Elias Sports Bureau. By then, Maris had 59.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Frick's ruling dampened the fans' fervor in Maris'
pursuit of Ruth, it does not fully explain Yankee Stadium
attendance in 1961. The Yankees were one of baseball's best teams
ever, yet averaged 24,481 in August and 32,766 in September and
October. Only 1.7 million fans attended games that season, even
without a National League competitor in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the real embarrassments in Yankee history,''
Appel said.
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire the nexus of nationwide hopes and hype, St. Louis
is unlikely to generate such apathy, having already drawn 1.8
million fans this season, up 17 percent from last year. The
Cardinals' Wade said, ``That won't happen here.'' &QL;

SILICON VALLEY MOVES EAST TO BISHOP RANCH  
 BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BISHOP   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Companies that can't find reasonably priced office space in the
booming Silicon Valley rental market have been swarming to the
enormous Bishop Ranch Business Park in San Ramon like so many
war-torn refugees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Because San Ramon is off the beaten track, top-grade space at
the 585-acre Bishop Ranch site _ which is situated just east of
Interstate 680 at Bollinger Canyon Road _ rents for only $23 to $30
per square foot per year.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, renters typically pay as much as $40 per
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 companies and 25,000 workers who occupy Bishop Ranch are
drawn from many industries, but the tenant roster in the past year
has been looking more and more like Silicon Valley East.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more prominent high-technology firms that have found
extra elbow room at Bishop Ranch are Amdahl, Cambridge Technology,
Cisco Systems, Cnet, IBM, Silicon Graphics and Tandem Computers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellnet Data Systems, a maker of wireless equipment based in San
Carlos, moved 50 new hires _ mostly engineers _ into 15,000 square
feet at Bishop Ranch during a recent expansion program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bishop Ranch lease rates were very competitive,'' says
Cellnet spokesman Alex Tsigdinos.
</P>
<P>
   The steady influx of new tenants has driven the park's vacancy
rate down to an all-time low of less than 2 percent. Bishop Ranch
has 9 million square feet of space all told _ the equivalent of
nearly eight Bank of America towers. That makes it the largest
office park in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The park's owner, Sunset Development Corp., has been scrambling
to put up more buildings to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   It recently completed a four-building, 800,000-square-foot
project along the park's eastern flank at Norris Canyon Road and
Alcosta Boulevard. And last month it broke ground at Camino Ramon
and Bollinger Canyon Road for four more buildings with more than
900,000 square feet, slated for occupancy in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This project, known as Bishop Ranch 3 and occupying 29 acres,
will be the last in the park. Bishop Ranch has run out of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you may think of Bill Gates, he changed the world,''
says Alex Mehran, 47, Sunset's suave, semi-reclusive,
Harvard-educated president and chief executive. ``If it weren't for
America's technological revolution, we wouldn't be building more
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   With its immaculately maintained structures and landscaping, and
its blue-chip tenant list, Bishop Ranch has gained a lofty
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very positive feeling about Sunset Development,''
says real-estate pro Larry Knapp, head of Western operations for
NRT Inc., parent of the Coldwell Banker brokerage. His company
moved into 25,000 square feet in a new building at Bishop Ranch in
1987, and ``when you look at our building it's hard to believe that
it's already 11 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two decades ago, the Bishop Ranch property was occupied
almost entirely by pear and walnut trees and Shropshire sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Into this landscape strode Masud and Alex Mehran, father and son
owners of Sunset Development, which until then had confined itself
to the construction of houses in and around Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   They bought the Bishop property in 1978 for $20 million _ about
$35,000 per acre _ from Western Electric Co., which had abandoned
plans to build a factory there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful piece of ground, flat, and in a market we
knew,'' Alex Mehran recalls. ``It had freeway frontage and all the
necessary links for sewer, water and drainage.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, real-estate sources estimate that the Bishop Ranch
property is worth about $1 million per acre, or around $600 million
all told.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sunset no longer owns it all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 it got its entire purchase price back by selling 143
acres for $23.5 million to Chevron Corp. Chevron spent $370 million
to develop a dozen red buildings on the site and moved 3,000
employees there from its San Francisco headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Chevron ``really put Bishop Ranch on the map,'' Alex
Mehran says.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Sunset sold 100 acres for $42.2 million to
another giant San Francisco firm, Pacific Bell, which moved 7,500
employees into a gleaming-white, cross-shaped complex designed by
Skidmore Owings &AMP; Merrill and built at a cost of $228 million.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with funds from the property sales, Sunset began putting
up buildings on speculation _ 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000 square
feet at a crack. The nearby presence of Chevron and Pac Bell served
as a tacit endorsement, and Sunset had little difficulty drawing
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   But like other Bay Area office developers, Bishop Ranch suffered
during the steep recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The
vacancy rate soared as tenants downsized, and the rent for vacant
space plummeted to $12 or $13 per square foot from $20.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mehrans, knowing that the real-estate business is highly
cyclical, never stopped building. ``They were building speculative
office space when most other developers were sitting on their
hands, waiting for the market to come back,'' says Jeff Weil, a
senior vice president of Grubb &AMP; Ellis. ``They're very, very
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Ranch's rents have since soared above their prerecession
levels. Alex Mehran says Sunset gets more than $60 million in
annual rents from the 2.7 million square feet it owns.
</P>
<P>
   He says he expects the rents to top out in the low $30s per
square foot in the next year or so. ``At some point there will be
enough people putting up enough buildings to accommodate the
increased demand,'' he says.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The residents of San Ramon have mixed emotions about Bishop
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it is San Ramon's chief sugar daddy, accounting
for more than half the city's $14 million in annual tax revenues.
It has kept the city consistently in the black, allowing it to
build much-needed schools and parks and expand community services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to do a lot of neat things for the citizens of
San Ramon that other cities long ago stopped doing,'' exults Mayor
Herman Welm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, with 25,000 workers driving in and out each
day, Bishop Ranch has created serious traffic congestion in the
area, and has attracted fast-food joints and other retail
establishments that cheapen the city's image in the eyes of many
residents.
</P>
<P>
   A bucolic community of 20,000 in the days before the office park
was built, San Ramon now has more than 40,000 residents and a heavy
commercial presence.
</P>
<P>
   Although zoning laws have limited Bishop Ranch's buildings to a
maximum five stories, that qualifies as a skyscraper by San Ramon
standards. People who live on the fringes of the development gripe
that a ``wall of concrete and glass'' casts a blighting shadow on
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a company town _ an old-fashioned, classic company
town,'' laments Jim Monroe, a resident of the Vista San Ramon
housing development.
</P>
<P>
   When Sunset originally gave the city a plan for Bishop Ranch 3
that asked permission to build seven-story buildings, it was hooted
down by hundreds of residents at a City Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunset settled for five-story buildings after the residents
threatened to delay the project for several months by putting the
issue on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Although the last undeveloped scrap of Bishop Ranch land has now
been chewed by bulldozers, the sun hasn't set on Sunset's
ambitions. The firm plans to repeat the Bishop Ranch blueprint
somewhere else, perhaps adding a smattering of houses as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like mixed-use projects,'' Alex Mehran says. ``We will be
looking for quality land in the Bay Area big enough for a major,
planned development.''

SENATE PASSES ACCESS LIMITS FOR CHILDREN ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ind.)  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday approved two proposals for
controlling children's access to pornography on the Internet,
endorsing without debate one measure that would make it illegal for
commercial Web sites to distribute adult material to minors and
another that would require software filters on computers in
libraries and schools that receive federal Internet subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, which had been introduced as separate bills, were
added by voice votes to the $33 billion appropriations bill for the
Commerce, Justice and State departments. Civil liberties groups
vowed to fight the measures, saying they infringed on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering proposal, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, would require schools
and libraries to install filtering technology on computers used by
students if they receive financing for discounted Internet hookups
from the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children should not be allowed to enter school or a public
library and gain access to material that their parents would never
allow them to see,'' McCain said, ``and that most in society
believe is inappropriate for those who are not yet adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The other amendment, sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., would
make it a crime for commercial Web site operators to distribute
material harmful to minors. Last year the Supreme Court struck down
the Communications Decency Act, which would have made it a felony
to send ``indecent'' material to children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Violators would be subject to fines of up to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups said they would fight the proposals in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free speech on the Internet was ambushed today,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, said he thought both bills raised significant
constitutional questions. But because they are intended to protect
children, he said, they will ``be hard for members to vote
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups say they have opposed filtering mandates
because many filters block access to more than just inappropriate
sites, preventing computer users from getting information on
subjects like breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain bill, while well-intentioned,'' Steinhardt said,
``is based on the mistaken premise that you can create filtering
software that will work with enough precision to block out material
on the Internet based on community notions of inappropriateness or
indecency.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bills were before the Commerce Committee, the privacy
information center, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
Center for Democracy and Technology argued that the Coats bill's
standard of regulating material ``harmful to minors'' would
unconstitutionally restrict free speech on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt said the bill would apply to any commercial
distribution of information on the Internet, including books sold
on sites like amazon.com, or even information on free speech
displayed on other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to act on its version of the spending bill,
which an appropriations committee approved last week. Senate and
House versions would have to be reconciled before final action.
</P>
<P>
   A provision similar to McCain's filtering proposal has been
added to the Houses appropriations bill for education, labor and
health and human services.

   ``The naming of cats is a difficult matter, it isn't just one of
your holiday games.'' T.S. Eliot might have said the same of
companies, had he been a corporate image consultant; but he lived
in benighted times, before civilization developed that fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sentiment is appropriate in these merger-mad days.
What, for instance, should British Airways and American Airlines,
who hope this autumn to clear regulatory obstacles to an alliance,
call their offspring?
</P>
<P>
   Eliot would have advised caution: he favored ``sensible,
everyday names.'' Sadly, there are fewer and fewer of these about.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago a name was a simple way of distinguishing a thing, a
person, or a company from other things, people or companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before companies had grasped such fashionable
notions as corporate identity; and before they had cottoned on to
the trick of handing large checks to people who could teach them to
be cool or hot _ or both at once.
</P>
<P>
   These days, real names such as W.H. Smith or Walt Disney are
out; they are not only old-fashioned but also redolent of the
egocentricity that business must pretend to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fashion-conscious company has two tempting trends to
choose between. One leans on classicism which, according to the
image consultants, is laden with values _ and values, as everybody
knows, are very 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Diageo, for the merged Guinness-Grand Met, which combines
the Latin for day with the Greek for world and means nothing in any
language.
</P>
<P>
   The drug business is thick with fake classical: Novartis (the
Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz merger), Zeneca (the pharmaceutical spin-off
from ICI) and a whole biotechnology family of little Cygnuses,
Cephalons and Sequuses.
</P>
<P>
   The other trend, which has its origins in unhappy compromises,
is to do interesting things with capitals. SmithKline Beecham was a
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers (which seems, confusingly, to call itself
PCw for short) is the longest recent example of such corporate
breathlessness: Mr. Lybrand, one feels, is well out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop at just two capital letters? Bolder companies, such
as OXiGENE, a biotech company, and NeXT, a software firm, are
pushing at the frontiers of typography.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as idealab!, an Internet company in which the
indisputably fashionable Steven Spielberg has a stake, consider
capitals an outdated convention and prefer to play with
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who succumb to temptation should remember that
fashions in names suffer from the same problem as fashions in
clothes or decor: they change. And it is a lot more expensive to
retool your corporate identity than to throw out your flared
trousers or avocado bathroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the more successful a company, the harder it is to get
rid of an embarrassing moniker. The managers of Toys ``R'' Us must
cringe at their name today; but it is too late to change.
</P>
<P>
   Still, trends are hard to buck and trendsetters hard to ignore.
If BA and AA decide to go with the vogue, there is a name just
waiting that is in tune with the spirit both of the age and of
their enterprise: icarus! &QL;

indisputably fashionable Steven Spielberg has a stake, consider
capitals an outdated convention and prefer to play with
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who succumb to temptation should remember that
fashions in names suffer from the same problem as fashions in
clothes or decor: they change. And it is a lot more expensive to
retool your corporate identity than to throw out your flared
trousers or avocado bathroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the more successful a company, the harder it is to get
rid of an embarrassing moniker. The managers of Toys ``R'' Us must
cringe at their name today; but it is too late to change.
</P>
<P>
   Still, trends are hard to buck and trendsetters hard to ignore.
If BA and AA decide to go with the vogue, there is a name just
waiting that is in tune with the spirit both of the age and of
their enterprise: icarus! &QL;

   BOSTON _ How can you get good teachers in the public schools?
Over the past few farcical months, Massachusetts has been
wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, demand for new teachers is expected to reach
2 million over the next decade, and states are in fierce
competition to get the best of the crop. So first Massachusetts has
tried tests, and now it is trying bribes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that either will work; but in a state that
prides itself on a long history of quality education, the debate is
raging red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in April, when, following the lead of 43 other
states who already require such exams, Massachusetts held its first
statewide test for nearly 1,800 candidates aspiring to teach in the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   To its astonishment, almost 60 percent of the candidates failed.
Around 30 percent failed a basic reading and writing test, with
questions along the lines of ``What is a preposition?'' and
``Define the word `abolish.'' Some 63 percent failed the maths
paper.
</P>
<P>
   In one section of the reading and writing test, a paragraph from
``The Federalist Papers'' was read aloud three times as dictation.
Among the interesting words thereby introduced to the lexicon were
``improbally,'' ``integraty,'' ``bodyes'' and ``relif.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with such results, the state Board of Education did
what any other self-preserving body would do: it voted to lower the
pass mark. Roughly 260 more of the candidates thereby slid through.
</P>
<P>
   Then the board reinstated the original, higher, pass mark,
prompting the interim education commissioner to blame the switch on
``political forces'' and immediately resign.
</P>
<P>
   After the test debacle, state officials had a better idea. After
all, Massachusetts has a $1 billion budget surplus waiting to be
spent: and what better cause could there be than education?
</P>
<P>
   A number of school systems in other states have already turned
to such incentives to attract qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore offers housing bonuses of $5,000 to new teachers, with
a bigger bonus if they are willing to work in rough areas.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit offers bonuses of $3,000, and Los Angeles provides a
$5,000 salary differential to teachers who are bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is recruiting (with the lure of generous starting
salaries) from as far away as Austria, which has a surplus of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Massachusetts may cap the lot by offering teachers the
biggest bonus in the country: $20,000 merely for signing the
contract. If the law passes, 250 aspiring teachers could receive
such a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   To put the sum in context, it is not far off the average
starting salary for a teacher in the Massachusetts public schools
($26,540), and $5,000 more than the median signing bonus received
by all graduates from Harvard Business School who accepted job
offers last year.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is the brainchild of Thomas Birmingham, the president
of the state Senate, who unashamedly describes it as ``elitist.''
There are several more around.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the state attorney-general and the leading
Democratic contender for the governor's seat, has proposed $5,000
bonuses for 200 teachers who accept jobs in the state's worst
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cellucci, the acting governor and the leading Republican
contender, would rather use the surplus for tax cuts, but he has
also suggested full college scholarships for top high-school
students willing to teach for four years in Massachusetts public
schools. He has also suggested that all current teachers take the
famous test.
</P>
<P>
   Although international studies have shown no connection between
education spending and achievement, the states like to think that
extra money is at least the key to teacher satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   One national study, by Harvard University's Graduate School of
Education, has shown that low salaries often deter public school
teachers from staying longer than a year in the profession, while
others show that up to half America's teachers leave before their
fifth year of service.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses could either be awarded in one lump sum, or spread out
over several years to ensure that new teachers stay in their jobs.
They could also be targeted and varied to attract teachers with
particularly valued expertise _ in maths, say, or foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Silber, the chancellor of Boston University
and chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education, bonuses
``certainly can't hurt, and I suspect they can help a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe a more systematic attempt is needed to
improve teacher salaries, working conditions and retirement
policies. ``Attracting teachers is certainly important,'' says
Kathy Kelley, president of the Massachusetts Federation of
Teachers, one of the state's two main teachers' unions. ``Retaining
them is even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   To all those familiar with the intransigence of unionized
teachers, those remarks would seem to spell trouble. &QL;

<P>
   MA'ALULA, SYRIA _ At the tomb of Saint Thecla in Ma'alula in
Syria, Christians leave symbolic reminders of the blessings they
pray for from the woman who brought Christianity to the area 17
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murmuring in their native Aramaic, the language Jesus is said to
have spoken, they deposit glass eyes or the crutches they hope they
will no longer need. But the tokens most often left are cardboard
cut-outs of the babies they long for.
</P>
<P>
   For years now the Christians of Ma'alula have had fewer children
than their Muslim compatriots. They are also more prone to
emigrate. Already several mosques have sprung up in the once purely
Christian town.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Fertile Crescent, where Christianity first began,
the same story repeats itself. In the Syrian Orthodox monastery of
Mar Mitta, in northern Iraq, which once housed 7,000 monks, only
two remain.
</P>
<P>
   Madaba, a former Christian stronghold in Jordan, is now half
Muslim. Even in Lebanon, once the only country in the Middle East
with more Christians than Muslims, abandoned villages bear witness
to a precipitous exodus.
</P>
<P>
   All the countries of the region have Christian minorities. The
numbers are unreliable but Christians are thought, very roughly, to
make up 2-4 percent of the population of Jordan, the West Bank and
Gaza, and Iraq; 10 percent of Syria; and 30-40 percent of Lebanon.
East Jerusalem, nearly 50 percent Christian in 1948, is now less
than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, the proportion of Jordanians professing Christianity
has fallen by half. And, by one Iraqi clergyman's reckoning, the
number of Christians in Iraq has fallen from 750,000 in 1990 to
500,000 today _ even as the Muslim population has grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often blame the decline on persecution by the Muslim
majority. America's Congress is currently deliberating a law to
impose sanctions on countries that mistreat their religious
minorities, with the Middle East as one of the intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials recently claimed that the Palestinian
Authority systematically discriminated against its Christian
population. And the Lebanese government's neglect of displaced
Christians has provoked much criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the whole, governments in the region treat Christians
remarkably well. Even as the population dwindles, churches are
thriving, with congregations spilling out on to the streets. No one
feels the need to hide his faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian, Jordanian and Lebanese parliaments,
Christians occupy a disproportionate share of the seats. A few
ministers or senior officials in all the regimes of the Fertile
Crescent are Christian: witness Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, and Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian Authority's education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few laws do draw a distinction between Christians and
Muslims, they often do so in the Christians' favor. In Iraq, for
example, only Christians may sell alcohol, a lucrative trade in
these trying times.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, half the jobs in the cabinet and the senior civil
service are reserved for Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christians gripe about Muslim family laws, which force
outsiders to convert if they wish to marry a Muslim, they too enjoy
the right to apply their own family laws within their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination tends to be low-level, reflecting public
prejudices, rather than an orchestrated policy. Israeli claims of
Palestinian persecution rest on the harassment of a few Muslim
converts to Christianity by minor officials.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, priests complain about over-zealous
bureaucrats who order the building of mosques in Christian
villages. And in Syria, curious peasants ride in to take a look at
the Christians in the Bab Touma part of Damascus (where St. Paul
was smuggled out in a basket).
</P>
<P>
   Such annoyances can hardly explain the hemorrhage of Christians
from the Fertile Crescent. The issue is demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Since colonial times, when French and British administrators
gave preference to minorities in the civil service and the army,
Christians have been moving from the countryside to the cities.
Church schools provide better education, especially for girls, than
state schools. Urbanization and education have, together, led to a
decline in the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those places where the Christian population is growing
in absolute terms, it is shrinking in relation to the Muslims
around it.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, Christians find it easier to emigrate.
Their relative wealth puts air fares and fees within reach, and
their professional qualifications help them obtain visas. Their
long history of emigration has left many with relations abroad who
can press their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders are desperate to preserve their congregations.
In a recent tract, the pope urged Lebanon's Catholics not to give
in to the temptation to seek a better life in another country.
</P>
<P>
   On this matter, at least, the 20 or so different Christian
denominations in the area can agree. They have held two ecumenical
conferences this year, in Cyprus and Baghdad, to search for ways to
staunch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the priestly exhortations, ordinary Christians say
they cannot afford to stay. While expressing regret at
Christianity's demise, they nonetheless insist they would leap at
any opportunity to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At Mar Mitta, Father Adda, staring out over the empty monastery
courtyard, speaks with pride of the burgeoning Syrian Orthodox
dioceses in America, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he hopes, the situation in Iraq will have improved
enough to lure his flock back from Detroit and Sydney. By then,
there may be nothing to return to. &QL;

thriving, with congregations spilling out on to the streets. No one
feels the need to hide his faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian, Jordanian and Lebanese parliaments,
Christians occupy a disproportionate share of the seats. A few
ministers or senior officials in all the regimes of the Fertile
Crescent are Christian: witness Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, and Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian Authority's education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few laws do draw a distinction between Christians and
Muslims, they often do so in the Christians' favor. In Iraq, for
example, only Christians may sell alcohol, a lucrative trade in
these trying times.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, half the jobs in the cabinet and the senior civil
service are reserved for Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christians gripe about Muslim family laws, which force
outsiders to convert if they wish to marry a Muslim, they too enjoy
the right to apply their own family laws within their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination tends to be low-level, reflecting public
prejudices, rather than an orchestrated policy. Israeli claims of
Palestinian persecution rest on the harassment of a few Muslim
converts to Christianity by minor officials.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, priests complain about over-zealous
bureaucrats who order the building of mosques in Christian
villages. And in Syria, curious peasants ride in to take a look at
the Christians in the Bab Touma part of Damascus (where St. Paul
was smuggled out in a basket).
</P>
<P>
   Such annoyances can hardly explain the hemorrhage of Christians
from the Fertile Crescent. The issue is demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Since colonial times, when French and British administrators
gave preference to minorities in the civil service and the army,
Christians have been moving from the countryside to the cities.
Church schools provide better education, especially for girls, than
state schools. Urbanization and education have, together, led to a
decline in the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those places where the Christian population is growing
in absolute terms, it is shrinking in relation to the Muslims
around it.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, Christians find it easier to emigrate.
Their relative wealth puts air fares and fees within reach, and
their professional qualifications help them obtain visas. Their
long history of emigration has left many with relations abroad who
can press their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders are desperate to preserve their congregations.
In a recent tract, the pope urged Lebanon's Catholics not to give
in to the temptation to seek a better life in another country.
</P>
<P>
   On this matter, at least, the 20 or so different Christian
denominations in the area can agree. They have held two ecumenical
conferences this year, in Cyprus and Baghdad, to search for ways to
staunch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the priestly exhortations, ordinary Christians say
they cannot afford to stay. While expressing regret at
Christianity's demise, they nonetheless insist they would leap at
any opportunity to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At Mar Mitta, Father Adda, staring out over the empty monastery
courtyard, speaks with pride of the burgeoning Syrian Orthodox
dioceses in America, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he hopes, the situation in Iraq will have improved
enough to lure his flock back from Detroit and Sydney. By then,
there may be nothing to return to. &QL;

   MA'ALULA, SYRIA _ At the tomb of Saint Thecla in Ma'alula in
Syria, Christians leave symbolic reminders of the blessings they
pray for from the woman who brought Christianity to the area 17
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murmuring in their native Aramaic, the language Jesus is said to
have spoken, they deposit glass eyes or the crutches they hope they
will no longer need. But the tokens most often left are cardboard
cut-outs of the babies they long for.
</P>
<P>
   For years now the Christians of Ma'alula have had fewer children
than their Muslim compatriots. They are also more prone to
emigrate. Already several mosques have sprung up in the once purely
Christian town.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Fertile Crescent, where Christianity first began,
the same story repeats itself. In the Syrian Orthodox monastery of
Mar Mitta, in northern Iraq, which once housed 7,000 monks, only
two remain.
</P>
<P>
   Madaba, a former Christian stronghold in Jordan, is now half
Muslim. Even in Lebanon, once the only country in the Middle East
with more Christians than Muslims, abandoned villages bear witness
to a precipitous exodus.
</P>
<P>
   All the countries of the region have Christian minorities. The
numbers are unreliable but Christians are thought, very roughly, to
make up 2-4 percent of the population of Jordan, the West Bank and
Gaza, and Iraq; 10 percent of Syria; and 30-40 percent of Lebanon.
East Jerusalem, nearly 50 percent Christian in 1948, is now less
than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, the proportion of Jordanians professing Christianity
has fallen by half. And, by one Iraqi clergyman's reckoning, the
number of Christians in Iraq has fallen from 750,000 in 1990 to
500,000 today _ even as the Muslim population has grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often blame the decline on persecution by the Muslim
majority. America's Congress is currently deliberating a law to
impose sanctions on countries that mistreat their religious
minorities, with the Middle East as one of the intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials recently claimed that the Palestinian
Authority systematically discriminated against its Christian
population. And the Lebanese government's neglect of displaced
Christians has provoked much criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the whole, governments in the region treat Christians
remarkably well. Even as the population dwindles, churches are
thriving, with congregations spilling out on to the streets. No one
feels the need to hide his faith.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It has been nearly a decade since America's
``white-collar recession'' introduced managers to the hazards of
corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of those managers eventually landed on their feet,
they have spent that decade adapting to a world which offers less
prestige, less security, and fewer nooks and crannies in which
underperformers can hide.
</P>
<P>
   Those managers have had it easy, however, compared with what is
about to happen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic problems are only part of the story. The real
reason that Japan's managers are in trouble is the need for
long-term restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In America, this was underlined by a shift from smokestack
industries and into high-tech ones, and by firms' efforts to adapt
themselves to new information technology and more assertive
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese firms must also respond to these forces _ and at the
same time unravel several mutually reinforcing habits. A decade ago
those habits were the envy of the West. Now, they spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar is long-term employment. When capital was
cheap, and Japanese companies were expanding rapidly, it was easy
to promise young salarymen a job for life. Once the economy
matured, those bright young corporate assets became aging
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a decade, for example, since Mitsubishi
started an early-retirement plan to unload middle-aged managers:
anyone over 48 years old receives a topped-up pension if he leaves.
Several other big firms have since offered similar schemes.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is knowing just what to do with all those men idling
by the window. Harder still is to adapt the way in which Japanese
middle managers are trained.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and
rapid growth has encouraged firms to invest in wasteful training.
Early in their careers managers are rotated among jobs and
locations, asking few questions when they are transferred, since
they know their careers are in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of this training is different from that in western
firms. Because they move around so much, Japanese managers rarely
develop special expertise in, say, marketing or corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   And because they expect a one-company career, they invest most
heavily in the skill they know they will need: office politics. A
salaryman takes great pains to become a better Mitsubishi man,
Mitsui man or whatever company man is required.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of following these practices, Japan's corporate
infantry has become a battalion of generalists _ middle managers
with no transferable skills, and untrained for anything other than
being loyal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies need to change how they recruit, train and
promote their managers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese managers still deny there is a problem. Nobuyuki
Idei, president of Sony, says he is not worried about the shifting
nature of Japanese careers. When pressed, however, he explains that
many of the firm's divisions are now based overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Kurisaka, Tokyo managing partner of Egon Zehnder
International, a headhunting firm, does not believe that Japanese
companies have grasped the size of their task. ``People all talk
about what they have to do,'' he laments, ``but...they don't really
want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the promise of a long, secure career rings hollow,
recruiters must offer a new bargain: that young managers will
acquire the skills they need to be valuable to other companies. Yet
once a company provides managers with the training they need, they
risk losing them to someone else _ a problem familiar to western
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus many companies now recognize the need to send their young
managers to foreign business schools. But whereas American
companies require their employees to refund tuition money if they
leave, this is still illegal in Japan. Instead, companies try to
require their employees to stay for five years or so after they
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies must also inject fresh ideas into their
organizations. Despite their glut of managers, many banks have been
busy calling headhunters in search of anybody with a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just those with financial expertise they are
looking for; they also need people from marketing and IT if they
are to compete with the likes of Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   That is why western companies are benefiting most from the new
market for Japanese managers. For years, IBM was the only foreign
company in the top 50 on surveys of graduates' most-desired
employers. Now, names such as Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and
Microsoft appear.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because their treatment of workers no longer
seems quite so brutal: when Yamaichi Securities went bankrupt last
year, Merrill Lynch stepped in and gave jobs to a third of its
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover western firms can offer an aspiring young manager a
career in whatever speciality he chooses. If he picks Goldman
Sachs, a graduate can become a specialist in mergers and
acquisitions, or bonds. If he joins a Japanese bank, he may start
in one of its local branches.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just graduates of the best colleges who will benefit
from these changes. When only top-flight firms counted, a degree
from a top college was vital. But creativity, enterprise and
business acumen are not necessarily fostered at such places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is full of competent dropouts,'' says Yasuyuki Nambu,
president of Pasona, a company that recruits and trains young
professionals. Although a few Japanese firms have sought Pasona's
services, foreign affiliates can often make better use of Japan's
diversity of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign firms also make more attractive employers for those
middle-aged managers who do have useful expertise.
</P>
<P>
   When Sakie Fukushima, a headhunter at Korn/Ferry International,
interviews a candidate, she explains that foreign affiliates expect
their managers to supply ideas and take responsibility for profits
and losses _ a pitch sure to appeal only to the adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a decade of Japanese firms' talk about an overhaul,
foreign affiliates still account for more than 90 percent of all
executive searches at both headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flaws, the Japanese system of job rotation and
company-specific training provided its firms with some advantages
over western rivals. Unfortunately, it cannot survive in a world
where capital is dearer and the future is more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a few innovative Japanese firms will combine the best of
both systems. But many in the West also seek an elusive third way.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to all those western management articles applauding
Japanese business methods, the foreigners have a decade-long lead
in finding a compromise between the two systems. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It has been nearly a decade since America's
``white-collar recession'' introduced managers to the hazards of
corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of those managers eventually landed on their feet,
they have spent that decade adapting to a world which offers less
prestige, less security, and fewer nooks and crannies in which
underperformers can hide.
</P>
<P>
   Those managers have had it easy, however, compared with what is
about to happen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic problems are only part of the story. The real
reason that Japan's managers are in trouble is the need for
long-term restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In America, this was underlined by a shift from smokestack
industries and into high-tech ones, and by firms' efforts to adapt
themselves to new information technology and more assertive
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese firms must also respond to these forces _ and at the
same time unravel several mutually reinforcing habits. A decade ago
those habits were the envy of the West. Now, they spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar is long-term employment. When capital was
cheap, and Japanese companies were expanding rapidly, it was easy
to promise young salarymen a job for life. Once the economy
matured, those bright young corporate assets became aging
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a decade, for example, since Mitsubishi
started an early-retirement plan to unload middle-aged managers:
anyone over 48 years old receives a topped-up pension if he leaves.
Several other big firms have since offered similar schemes.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is knowing just what to do with all those men idling
by the window. Harder still is to adapt the way in which Japanese
middle managers are trained.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and
rapid growth has encouraged firms to invest in wasteful training.
Early in their careers managers are rotated among jobs and
locations, asking few questions when they are transferred, since
they know their careers are in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of this training is different from that in western
firms. Because they move around so much, Japanese managers rarely
develop special expertise in, say, marketing or corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   And because they expect a one-company career, they invest most
heavily in the skill they know they will need: office politics. A
salaryman takes great pains to become a better Mitsubishi man,
Mitsui man or whatever company man is required.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of following these practices, Japan's corporate
infantry has become a battalion of generalists _ middle managers
with no transferable skills, and untrained for anything other than
being loyal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies need to change how they recruit, train and
promote their managers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese managers still deny there is a problem. Nobuyuki
Idei, president of Sony, says he is not worried about the shifting
nature of Japanese careers. When pressed, however, he explains that
many of the firm's divisions are now based overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Kurisaka, Tokyo managing partner of Egon Zehnder
International, a headhunting firm, does not believe that Japanese
companies have grasped the size of their task. ``People all talk
about what they have to do,'' he laments, ``but...they don't really
want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the promise of a long, secure career rings hollow,
recruiters must offer a new bargain: that young managers will
acquire the skills they need to be valuable to other companies. Yet
once a company provides managers with the training they need, they
risk losing them to someone else _ a problem familiar to western
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus many companies now recognize the need to send their young
managers to foreign business schools. But whereas American
companies require their employees to refund tuition money if they
leave, this is still illegal in Japan. Instead, companies try to
require their employees to stay for five years or so after they
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies must also inject fresh ideas into their
organizations. Despite their glut of managers, many banks have been
busy calling headhunters in search of anybody with a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just those with financial expertise they are
looking for; they also need people from marketing and IT if they
are to compete with the likes of Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   That is why western companies are benefiting most from the new
market for Japanese managers. For years, IBM was the only foreign
company in the top 50 on surveys of graduates' most-desired
employers. Now, names such as Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and
Microsoft appear.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because their treatment of workers no longer
seems quite so brutal: when Yamaichi Securities went bankrupt last
year, Merrill Lynch stepped in and gave jobs to a third of its
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover western firms can offer an aspiring young manager a
career in whatever speciality he chooses. If he picks Goldman
Sachs, a graduate can become a specialist in mergers and
acquisitions, or bonds. If he joins a Japanese bank, he may start
in one of its local branches.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just graduates of the best colleges who will benefit
from these changes. When only top-flight firms counted, a degree
from a top college was vital. But creativity, enterprise and
business acumen are not necessarily fostered at such places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is full of competent dropouts,'' says Yasuyuki Nambu,
president of Pasona, a company that recruits and trains young
professionals. Although a few Japanese firms have sought Pasona's
services, foreign affiliates can often make better use of Japan's
diversity of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign firms also make more attractive employers for those
middle-aged managers who do have useful expertise.
</P>
<P>
   When Sakie Fukushima, a headhunter at Korn/Ferry International,
interviews a candidate, she explains that foreign affiliates expect
their managers to supply ideas and take responsibility for profits
and losses _ a pitch sure to appeal only to the adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a decade of Japanese firms' talk about an overhaul,
foreign affiliates still account for more than 90 percent of all
executive searches at both headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flaws, the Japanese system of job rotation and
company-specific training provided its firms with some advantages
over western rivals. Unfortunately, it cannot survive in a world
where capital is dearer and the future is more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a few innovative Japanese firms will combine the best of
both systems. But many in the West also seek an elusive third way.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to all those western management articles applauding
Japanese business methods, the foreigners have a decade-long lead
in finding a compromise between the two systems. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Lincoln Mercury, Ford's most lackluster division,
is hardly known for its foresight. The joke used to be that the
company's cars were driven exclusively by people's fathers. Now
they are driven exclusively by their grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in moving its headquarters from Detroit to the Irvine
Spectrum _ a decision that was implemented on July 14 _ Lincoln may
have backed something with more of a future.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-acre Spectrum, which sits in the heart of Orange
County, Calif., at the intersection of two freeways, is one of
America's most successful business parks, outdoing such rivals as
North Carolina's Research Triangle in everything from office space
to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum boasts 20 million square feet of commercial space,
more than the whole of downtown San Francisco. It is home to 44,000
employees and 2,200 companies, most of them high-tech start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Creating successful business clusters is the philosopher's stone
of developers. Why has the Spectrum succeeded where so many others
have failed? Locals thank the weather. But the same weather has
hardly turned South-Central Los Angeles into a business Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   They are also full of praise for the University of California's
Irvine campus. But UCI is hardly Stanford or Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Transport has a lot to do with it. From the roof of the AT&AMP;T
building in the Spectrum you can see 26 lanes of freeway and 22
lanes of arterial roads. But what matters more than roads is
something that has fallen into disrepute: planning.
</P>
<P>
   In the Irvine Spectrum the planning is so meticulous that it
conjures up images of the ``Stepford Wives,'' a film about suburban
America in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The business park is but a small part of a gigantic ``Master
Plan'' that was drawn up in 1966 by the Irvine Company, a private
developer that owns a fifth of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The company could have made a killing when Los Angeles began to
sprawl southwards into its land. But instead it decided to create
something as different from L.A. as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It studied urban developments around the world _ particularly
Britain's garden cities _ and came up with a detailed plan for what
it calls ``orderly growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Bren, a billionaire who took control of the Irvine
Company in 1983, is second to none in his enthusiasm for the Master
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum is one of the company's three successful business
parks. (A fourth is being built next to the university.) But the
company is just as keen on planning housing, schooling, shopping
and recreation, and it does so with an attention to detail that
makes Singapore's Senior Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, look sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   The local houses are built around village greens; there are
shops within walking distance. In L.A. Tudor manor houses jostle
with mock Byzantine temples; in Irvine you can find yourself in the
wrong house unless you check the number first.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum's streets (which rejoice in names such as
``Enterprise,'' ``Fortune'' and ``Technology'') are lined with
mature palm trees that Bren personally selected.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who puts up a neon sign bearing his company's name, or
paints his building anything other than white, is reminded of the
Irvine company's ``rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Business people are usually disdainful of bureaucracy and you
might expect that they would chafe at such restrictions. Instead
they seem to love them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spectrum opened in the early 1980s it found its first
customers among the Japanese, precisely because it offered such an
orderly environment.
</P>
<P>
   The then-head of Toshiba told the Irvine Company that one of the
things that led him to invest $100 million in the Spectrum was the
certainty that nobody would build a monstrosity opposite his
building. Another 32 Japanese companies have come to the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans seem equally enthusiastic about micro-management.
Henry Nicholas, the boss of Broadcom Corporation, a chip maker that
has just had a successful public flotation, gives several reasons
why Irvine's obsession with planning is good for business, reasons
that are echoed by others around the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   One is that it helps in recruiting people from abroad, now a
condition of survival in the high-tech world. Foreigners who
associate Southern California with strip malls and drive-by
shootings are comforted by Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The villages look almost European. The schools have the highest
SAT scores in California. The place is so orderly that the police
break up teenage parties in private houses at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it makes the future less uncertain. So far the
company has put the pieces of the Master Plan in place with an
almost eerie smoothness, even continuing its orderly growth during
the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The company has long promised shops and cinemas as soon as there
was enough demand; sure enough, in 1995 the Spectrum got a shopping
mall complete with a 21-screen multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley companies are continually whining about
gridlocked roads and sky-high property prices. The Spectrum is set
to double its size before it is finished; and the Irvine company is
determined to keep a balance between business and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas welcomes planning because it leaves him with less to
worry about. He wants to concentrate on running Broadcom _ and the
Irvine Company removes distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest public-relations problem is that people
are forever bringing up George Orwell's ``1984.'' ``The Truman
Show,'' a film that features a squeaky clean town that turns out to
be the plaything of a megalomaniacal television producer, has not
helped.
</P>
<P>
   Locals point out that Orange County has other landlords, and
that local towns had their own characters long before the Master
Plan. But for all its success, the Spectrum remains rather spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Mercury suffered because it insisted on making cars for
aging Midwesterners. The danger now is that it will start making
cars for the Stepford wives. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lincoln Mercury, Ford's most lackluster division,
is hardly known for its foresight. The joke used to be that the
company's cars were driven exclusively by people's fathers. Now
they are driven exclusively by their grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in moving its headquarters from Detroit to the Irvine
Spectrum _ a decision that was implemented on July 14 _ Lincoln may
have backed something with more of a future.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-acre Spectrum, which sits in the heart of Orange
County, Calif., at the intersection of two freeways, is one of
America's most successful business parks, outdoing such rivals as
North Carolina's Research Triangle in everything from office space
to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum boasts 20 million square feet of commercial space,
more than the whole of downtown San Francisco. It is home to 44,000
employees and 2,200 companies, most of them high-tech start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Creating successful business clusters is the philosopher's stone
of developers. Why has the Spectrum succeeded where so many others
have failed? Locals thank the weather. But the same weather has
hardly turned South-Central Los Angeles into a business Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   They are also full of praise for the University of California's
Irvine campus. But UCI is hardly Stanford or Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Transport has a lot to do with it. From the roof of the AT&AMP;T
building in the Spectrum you can see 26 lanes of freeway and 22
lanes of arterial roads. But what matters more than roads is
something that has fallen into disrepute: planning.
</P>
<P>
   In the Irvine Spectrum the planning is so meticulous that it
conjures up images of the ``Stepford Wives,'' a film about suburban
America in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The business park is but a small part of a gigantic ``Master
Plan'' that was drawn up in 1966 by the Irvine Company, a private
developer that owns a fifth of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The company could have made a killing when Los Angeles began to
sprawl southwards into its land. But instead it decided to create
something as different from L.A. as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It studied urban developments around the world _ particularly
Britain's garden cities _ and came up with a detailed plan for what
it calls ``orderly growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Bren, a billionaire who took control of the Irvine
Company in 1983, is second to none in his enthusiasm for the Master
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum is one of the company's three successful business
parks. (A fourth is being built next to the university.) But the
company is just as keen on planning housing, schooling, shopping
and recreation, and it does so with an attention to detail that
makes Singapore's Senior Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, look sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   The local houses are built around village greens; there are
shops within walking distance. In L.A. Tudor manor houses jostle
with mock Byzantine temples; in Irvine you can find yourself in the
wrong house unless you check the number first.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum's streets (which rejoice in names such as
``Enterprise,'' ``Fortune'' and ``Technology'') are lined with
mature palm trees that Bren personally selected.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who puts up a neon sign bearing his company's name, or
paints his building anything other than white, is reminded of the
Irvine company's ``rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Business people are usually disdainful of bureaucracy and you
might expect that they would chafe at such restrictions. Instead
they seem to love them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spectrum opened in the early 1980s it found its first
customers among the Japanese, precisely because it offered such an
orderly environment.
</P>
<P>
   The then-head of Toshiba told the Irvine Company that one of the
things that led him to invest $100 million in the Spectrum was the
certainty that nobody would build a monstrosity opposite his
building. Another 32 Japanese companies have come to the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans seem equally enthusiastic about micro-management.
Henry Nicholas, the boss of Broadcom Corporation, a chip maker that
has just had a successful public flotation, gives several reasons
why Irvine's obsession with planning is good for business, reasons
that are echoed by others around the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   One is that it helps in recruiting people from abroad, now a
condition of survival in the high-tech world. Foreigners who
associate Southern California with strip malls and drive-by
shootings are comforted by Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The villages look almost European. The schools have the highest
SAT scores in California. The place is so orderly that the police
break up teenage parties in private houses at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it makes the future less uncertain. So far the
company has put the pieces of the Master Plan in place with an
almost eerie smoothness, even continuing its orderly growth during
the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The company has long promised shops and cinemas as soon as there
was enough demand; sure enough, in 1995 the Spectrum got a shopping
mall complete with a 21-screen multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley companies are continually whining about
gridlocked roads and sky-high property prices. The Spectrum is set
to double its size before it is finished; and the Irvine company is
determined to keep a balance between business and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas welcomes planning because it leaves him with less to
worry about. He wants to concentrate on running Broadcom _ and the
Irvine Company removes distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest public-relations problem is that people
are forever bringing up George Orwell's ``1984.'' ``The Truman
Show,'' a film that features a squeaky clean town that turns out to
be the plaything of a megalomaniacal television producer, has not
helped.
</P>
<P>
   Locals point out that Orange County has other landlords, and
that local towns had their own characters long before the Master
Plan. But for all its success, the Spectrum remains rather spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Mercury suffered because it insisted on making cars for
aging Midwesterners. The danger now is that it will start making
cars for the Stepford wives. &QL;

A VOTE FOR THE HIRED GUNS OF ROCK-AND-ROLL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
 PALMER-ROCK-FAME-2TAKES-$ADV26-NYT  (af) 
Tony Scherman is the author of a biography of the musician Earl
Palmer, to be published next March. 
 
 By TONY SCHERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame gave itself the
ticklish job of anointing a rock `n' roll pantheon, one of its
stated goals has been to salute not only rock's celebrities but the
genre's lesser-known heroes too. But when the Hall of Fame
announces its 14th annual class of inductees this fall _ the
selection process began earlier this month _ it's a sure bet that
Earl Palmer won't be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Who? Though few people have heard of Palmer, this 73-year-old
has had a greater impact on rock than many a Hall of Fame shoo-in.
He knows it, too. A few years ago, an unusually well-informed Hall
of Fame researcher went hunting for memorabilia to fill the
organization's new Cleveland museum. Tracking Palmer down in
Southern California, he telephoned him. Did he have any artifacts
around the house that belonged in the Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' came the reply. ``Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, a drummer, is one of the greatest members of an unsung
fellowship, rock `n' roll's great recording-session musicians. At
least four session players deserve immediate induction into the
Hall of Fame: Palmer, the drummer Hal Blaine, the tenor saxophonist
King Curtis and the bassist James Jamerson. A handful more are only
slightly less worthy: the drummers Bernard Purdie, Benny Benjamin,
Roger Hawkins and Steve Gadd, the guitarists Tommy Tedesco and
James Burton and the bassist Carol Kaye (no doubt I'm inviting
strenuous dissent from others' adherents).
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame's failure to induct any of these trailblazers
calls into question the organization's seriousness about giving
credit where it is due.
</P>
<P>
   The session player toils in anonymity, a hired gun paid to turn
a sketch into a living, breathing, hopefully million-selling song.
The best are far more than mere accompanists; they can be de facto
arrangers whose savvy and virtuosity can be the difference between
oblivion and the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   What sticks in your memory about Nancy Sinatra's 1966 hit
``These Boots Are Made for Walkin' '': the characterless vocal, or
the insinuating bass lick that ends each chorus, an inspired fillip
by the sessionman Chuck Berghofer?
</P>
<P>
   Though I have a keen interest in Earl Palmer (I recently
finished writing a book about him), I am by no means alone in
asserting his importance. ``If any single musician can be credited
with defining rock `n' roll as a rhythmic idiom distinct from the
jump, rhythm `n' blues and all else that preceded it,'' wrote the
critic Robert Palmer in Rolling Stone in 1990, ``that musician is
surely Earl Palmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of New Orleans' legendary Studio Band (rock's first
great studio ensemble and the prototype for such later house bands
as Motown's), Palmer turned rhythm `n' blues' lope into the
full-tilt thrust of rock. His jackhammer backbeat propelled almost
all of Little Richard's hits and many of Fats Domino's.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Los Angeles in 1957, he became (italics)the(end
italics) drummer in that town's burgeoning rock `n' roll industry.
From 1957 to 1966, he played on 50 top-10 pop hits, from Johnny
Otis' ``Willie and the Hand Jive'' to Sam Cooke's ``Shake'' to the
Righteous Brothers' ``You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Blaine (Palmer's successor as the top drummer in Los
Angeles' studios) has an even fatter resume. From 1960 to 1980, he
played on an astounding 149 top-10 pop hits, 40 of which went to
No. 1: the Crystals' ``He's a Rebel,'' the Beach Boys' ``Good
Vibrations'' and Simon and Garfunkel's ``Bridge Over Troubled
Water,'' to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   James Jamerson, who died in 1983, played on almost every Motown
hit from 1963 to 1968, the label's glory years. He sparked a number
of non-Motown hits, too _ try imagining Jackie Wilson's ``Higher
and Higher'' without Jamerson's galvanizing bass line.
</P>
<P>
   Worshiped by countless rock and pop bassists, Jamerson
revolutionized rock `n' roll bass-playing. King Curtis was rock's
premier saxophonist from the mid-'50s until his murder in 1971;
though he played on countless records, he could almost be inducted
for 40 seconds of pure, abrasive genius: the saxophone solos on the
Coasters' ``Yakety Yak'' and Aretha Franklin's ``Respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The session musician's heroic era was brief (though some, like
Gadd, are still busy). By the late '50s, rock had become too
valuable a commodity for its manufacture to be entrusted to the
inspired amateurs who spawned it: Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck
Berry and their ragtag backup groups. A new species was born: the
rock `n' roll session player, hip enough to relate to rock yet
sufficiently disciplined to crank out an album a day.

 UNDATED: a day.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His heyday lasted only through the mid-'60s, when the Beatles
popularized the self-contained rock band. At first, few of the new
long-haired groups were allowed anywhere near a recording studio,
except to sing. Session pros played almost every note of the
biggest hits of at least two Hall of Fame groups, the Byrds and the
Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   But as the counterculture kids learned to play, more and more
studio players found themselves gigging in cocktail lounges. The
coup de grace was applied in the early '80s by digital technology.
Now that a single musician could impersonate an orchestra, who
needed humans?
</P>
<P>
   While writing this article, I telephoned Jon Landau, Bruce
Springsteen's manager and co-chairman of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of
Fame's nominating committee, which is made up of several dozen rock
cognoscenti who oversee the annual induction process. Instead of
trying to justify the organization's neglect of some of rock's
greatest contributors, Landau took me by surprise: he agreed with
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal Blaine should definitely be in the Hall of Fame,'' he
said. ``There can't be any doubt about that. Others, too: I've got
my own little list. It's something that's slipped through the
cracks, mostly through lack of imagination. And I'd imagine that in
the relatively near future, we're going to find the right device
for remedying it.''
</P>
<P>
   But no new ``device'' is needed. There is already a place for
Palmer, Blaine and their session-playing peers: the Hall of Fame's
so-called Nonperformers category, created for behind-the-scenes
figures. Palmer's mentor and onetime boss, the producer Dave
Bartholomew, is there (never mind the anomaly of calling
Bartholomew, one of New Orleans' great trumpet players and
bandleaders, a ``nonperformer'').
</P>
<P>
   So is the record-company founder Ahmet Ertegun, the Billboard
editor Paul Ackerman, the songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and
Mike Stoller and 20 or so others.
</P>
<P>
   Nonperformers are chosen directly by the nominating committee.
``Artists,'' on the other hand, are picked by a body of 800
journalists and record-industry insiders. Since a vote by such a
large group amounts to a popularity contest, Artists is obviously
not the category for session musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Faceless by definition, how could they compete with Led
Zeppelin, Eric Clapton or the Supremes? King Curtis has been
nominated as an Artist six times, and lost six times; clearly he's
in the wrong category. Booker T. and the MG's, the great Stax
Records house band, (italics)were(end italics) elected as artists,
the Hall of Fame's sole session-playing inductees. But they were
recording stars in their own right (few baby-boomers don't remember
``Green Onions''), famous enough to siphon off votes from Johnny
Cash, Jimi Hendrix and their other 1992 co-inductees.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave Hal Blaine, whose best-known record is an
instructional album called ``Have Fun, Play Drums''?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a matter of tinkering with the Hall of Fame's
structure. It's a matter of finding the courage to recognize a
group of people who were not record-company moguls or influential
journalists, or ``industry heavyweights'' in any sense, but only _
only! _ musicians.

PHOENIX GETS BIG MONET SHOW AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix is finally getting its big Monet show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet At Giverny: Masterpieces from the Musee Marmottan'' will
open at the Phoenix Art Museum on Sept. 18, 1999. The exhibit
features 22 paintings by the Impressionist master from late in his
career, most painted after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we enlarged the museum, we promised to bring Phoenix the
big Egyptian show and the big Impressionist show,'' said Museum
Director Jim Ballinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Splendors of Ancient Egypt'' opens Oct. 4 and fulfills the
first part of the promise.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet paintings are on a U.S. tour. They can be seen at the
San Diego Museum of Art through Aug. 30. The show will then travel
to Portland, Ore.; Montreal; and Buffalo, N.Y., before settling in
Phoenix for the turn of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next year we'll finally see just what the new wing was
built for,'' Ballinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Monet was one of the original group of artists called
Impressionists. Beginning in the 1860s, they redefined what art was
to be. The tended to work outdoors instead of in studios, and they
painted everyday scenes instead of ``important'' historical scenes
that critics favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet stands out among them all as one of the great artists of
his time and one of the great European artists of all times,'' said
Michael Komanecky, curator of European painting for the Phoenix Art
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``His output was enormous and diverse. And he continued to
develop his vision over a career that extended some 60 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings from the Musee Marmottan in Paris highlight one of
the lesser known periods of the artist's work, his late paintings
from Giverny, his home 40 miles from Paris. As Monet got older, his
style became looser and more abstract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pushing the edge,'' Komanecky said. ``He emphasized all
the more painterly qualities of a picture. The world he creates
with a brush is extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Komanecky emphasized that until the final years of his life,
Monet remained in the avant garde, as modern as anyone of his time,
``until his vision became supplanted by the young avant garde of
Picasso and Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was still one of the most adventurous artists of his time,
a quality he maintained into his 80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the later paintings are in general less well-known,
they include among them some of his best-known work, including his
water lilies. The artist spent most of his later years at his home
and in the garden he built. The gardens are the subject for most of
his late paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix show will include large blow-ups of color
photographs of the gardens, to provide background.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other things we are contemplating,'' Ballinger said.
``We want to provide a context for these big pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   And the paintings are large. As he got older, Monet frequently
worked on larger canvases. The largest in the show is almost 10
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   After the First World War, he also began to have eye problems.
That resulted in larger images on larger canvases but also in a
looser, more sketchy style.
</P>
<P>
   ``They verge on abstraction,'' Komanecky said, ``although they
are not abstract in the true sense of the word. But the impact, the
seduction of the paint surface and its color is so overwhelming,
that sometimes they make the subject matter itself recede, if not
disappear. That's particularly true of some of the water lily
pictures.'
</P>
<P>
   The enlarged museum provides Phoenix with the chance of seeing
exhibits such as the Monet show that it wouldn't have had before.
The older galleries were smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the old museum we had low ceilings,'' Ballinger said,
pointing out the largeness of the canvases, some 6 feet by 8 feet.
``And the huge audience a show like Monet would bring would have
taxed the museum physically.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is expecting attendance ``in the six figures,''
according to Ballinger.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, where the exhibit opened June 16, it has already
drawn 116,000 and is expected to wind up somewhere between 150,000
and 160,000, according to the San Diego Museum of Art's deputy
director, Bob Trettin.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend alone, 10,000 people marched through the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response from the public has been incredible,'' Trettin
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the show will be up through the Thanksgiving and
Christmas seasons and will share space with the Cowboy Artist of
America show and one on the Taos School of American painting, so
attendance should be especially strong, Ballinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is a city the world is looking toward in (the) 21st
century,'' Ballinger said. ``We should be able to bring any
exhibition here that any other city could.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we can.'' &QL;

U.S. WON'T BAR MOVE TO SAVE PAKISTAN'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two months after declaring that Pakistan
would suffer harsh economic sanctions for its nuclear test, the
Clinton administration said Tuesday that it would not oppose
efforts by the International Monetary Fund to head off the
country's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   State and Treasury Department officials said that the
administration decided to act on the Pakistan issue because of
``the financial fragility of the country today.'' Even before
Pakistan conducted the nuclear tests, which were in response to
tests by India, the country's economy had been devastated by years
of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement of sanctions by the United States and some
of its allies appears to have pushed Pakistan over the brink, with
investors fleeing, banks collapsing, currency reserves dropping to
a scant $600 million, and government officials warning that the
country could default on its national debt of more than $30
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement came as Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary
of state, arrived in Islamabad on a trip to urge both India and
Pakistan to abandon plans to deploy nuclear weapons. The decision
to pave the way for economic aid to the country is part of a
strategy to give Pakistan some negotiating room, especially at a
moment when Pakistani officials have warned that the sanctions are
triggering financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But it also represents a further retreat from the use of the
sanctions that President Clinton signed into law four years ago.
The administration has allowed the World Bank to proceed with most
of its loans to India, declaring that they are for humane purposes
and thus exempt from sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, far poorer than India and more dependent on foreign
aid, was going to suffer more than its neighbor if aid was cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Tuesday's announcement, officials said that
technically, the United States would not stand in the way of
negotiations between the IMF and Pakistan, and that it would
abstain from votes to approve any agreement that emerges from those
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The officials insisted that a vote of abstention complies with
the provisions of the Glenn Amendment to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Act. That amendment requires the administration
to oppose all assistance to any country that detonates a nuclear
device, except food, medicine and related aid.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, argued Tuesday
that this was not a reversal of position, or an evasion of the
sanctions law. ``We have not softened or somehow waived the
sanctions,'' he said. Their intent, he added, was ``never to punish
Pakistan or its people or precipitate an economic collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has an economic reform program under way in Pakistan,
though it was suspended after the nuclear tests. Now the country's
collapse is so severe that the IMF appears likely to negotiate a
far larger rescue package for the country than it has ever had in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting point for that renegotiation may well be the
suspended program, but it has to be updated to take into account
changed circumstances,'' a senior administration official said at a
State Department briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any new agreement would require Pakistan to agree to stringent
economic reforms. Presumably, America's allies would vote to
approve the package with the informal assent of the United States,

CLINTON VETOES EXPANSION OF EDUCATION TAX BREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DAVID STOUT c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday vetoed as promised a
Republican-backed bill that would have provided tax breaks for
parents who saved for education costs, including private-school
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sending me this bill, the Congress has instead chosen to
weaken public education and shortchange our children,'' Clinton
said in his veto message, which echoed his comments of four weeks
ago after the Senate had passed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have expanded a program that promotes
saving for college, allowing relatives and others to contribute up
to $2,000 a year to special savings accounts for individual
students in elementary or secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has been a centerpiece of the Republican education
agenda, and will most likely become an issue in the fall elections.
While the Republicans argue that the proposal would give families
options on schooling, the President and many other Democrats have
argued that the bill would have disproportionately benefited
wealthy families, and that the tax breaks would have made it harder
for the federal government to find money to help public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways and Means
Committee, expressed disappointment Tuesday night. ``Today is a sad
day for America's schools and schoolchildren,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and House versions of the bill passed by less
than the two-thirds majority required to override a Presidential
veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version was co-sponsored by Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
and Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, one of the few Democrats to
support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed to time his veto to mute reaction to it: The
announcement came Tuesday evening, and he said nothing about the
bill on Monday when he addressed the American Federation of
Teachers convention in New Orleans.

U.S., BRITAIN MAY SEEK SPECIAL COURT TO TRY PAN AM BOMB SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (inserts Clinton quote after 2nd graf)   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that the
United States and Britain would seriously consider the creation of
a special court in the Netherlands to try two Libyans suspected of
planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am jetliner that exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marked a turnaround for the administration,
which said in the past that the Libyans would have to be tried in
the United States or Britain for the December 1988 bombing, which
killed 259 people aboard the 747 jet and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton expressed some uncertainty that such an
arrangement would work out. ``We're looking at it, but I don't know
that it can be done,'' Clinton said. ``We've tried to find some way
that has real integrity that will work, but there are all kinds of
practical difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department said many details were still under
discussion, the proposal is similar in many respects to one offered
by the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, and reflected a growing
sense within the administration that there may be no other way to
bring the Libyans to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for the lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Libya
because of its refusal to hand the suspects over for trial in the
United States or Britain, Gadhafi has proposed that the two men be
tried under Scottish law and by Scottish judges, but not in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal outlined Tuesday by the administration drew a mixed
response from family members of the American victims, who took part
in a conference call with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that this might be the only way to see justice
done, given Libya's refusal to extradite the suspects for trial in
the United States or Britain. Others, however, described the plan
as a collapse by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Colonel Gadhafi just what he says he wants, a trial
in a third country,'' said Stephanie Bernstein, a clinical social
worker from Bethesda, Md., whose 36-year-old husband, Michael, died
in the attack. ``Sanctions are not perfect, but they are working.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah,
have been identified by U.S. investigators as Libyan intelligence
agents. They are accused of planting a suitcase packed with
explosives aboard the Pan Am 747.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have been working very hard to see whether there is a way
in which it is practicable to hold a Scottish court outside the
United Kingdom, and what steps would be necessary to make this
possible,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Tuesday's announcement might be
considered ``a tactical reversal'' given the administration's
earlier insistence that the trial take place on U.S. or British
soil, Rubin said the proposal was a ``win-win'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a creative alternative,'' he said. ``Either we achieve
our fundamental objective, which is a trial under a Scottish or
American court system, or we call Gadhafi's bluff and demonstrate
the value of the sanctions to nations that have been less than
supportive of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that under the proposal three
Scottish judges appointed by Britain would hear the case in the
Hague, which is also home to the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the United States and Britain agreed that
Scottish judges and legal procedures would be used in such a trial
_ rather than U.S. judges and procedures _ because the crime
occurred in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that ``many questions have
to be resolved if there is to be a trial,'' including the issue of
where the suspects would be jailed if convicted. ``Really, nothing
has been decided at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been under pressure from some
of the families of the victims to consider Gadhafi's proposal, or
something like it, because the international sanctions against
Libya seem to be fraying and because there seems no other way to
hold a trial and to air the evidence publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay on the present course, with the present policy,
there will never be a trial,'' said Bert Ammerman of River Vale,
N.J., whose brother, Tom, died on the flight. ``This new proposal
is a pragmatic, realistic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But other family members said they violently opposed the
proposal. ``I'm absolutely devastated by what's happening,'' said
Susan Cohen of Cape May Courthouse, N.J., whose daughter, Theodora,
20, died in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total shift in the administration's policy,'' said
Ms. Cohen, who took part in the conference call. ``We've blinked.
We're letting Gadhafi dictate the conditions for a trial.''

SECRET SERVICE AGENTS APPEAR BEFORE LEWINSKY JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 3rd graf for clarification regarding fears)  (See also CLINTON-STARR-LEAKS) 
(bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors summoned several uniformed Secret
Service officers before the grand jury here Tuesday as Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr tries to piece together what they knew about
Monica Lewinsky's visits to the White House last December before
her relationship with President Clinton was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's questions go beyond whether Ms. Lewinsky, a
24-year-old former White House intern, and the president had met
alone in the Oval Office or elsewhere in the White House, lawyers
familiar with the inquiry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is focusing on events in December and January, when the
employees closest to the president _ Secret Service officers and
agents _ might have seen, or more importantly, overheard matters
involving Ms. Lewinsky. At the time, she faced the prospect of
testifying in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against
Clinton. Ms. Lewinsky had expressed her fears about testifying to
her friend, Linda Tripp, and to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutors are generally interested in very specific
things _ the people present at certain meetings on certain dates,''
said Michael Leibig, a lawyer for four of the uniformed officers
subpoenaed to testify. Those four were at the courthouse Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the specifics sought would be used to try to corroborate
what other witnesses have told the grand jury; the Secret Service
has insisted that its employees saw nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing his focus to one particular date, Starr wants to know
what uniformed officers might have heard on Dec. 28, the last day
that records show Ms. Lewinsky had visited the White House, lawyers
said. According to those familiar with the inquiry, Ms. Lewinsky
saw Clinton and his personal secretary, Betty Currie, on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe the meeting is a critical event in their
investigation into whether Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky or others
obstructed justice, committed perjury or tampered with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky arrived at the White House that day, she
briefly chatted with Mrs. Currie just outside the Oval Office
before talking with Clinton, possibly within earshot of a uniformed
officer, according to lawyers familiar with the questions asked of
the Secret Service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In statements given to Starr's office, Ms. Lewinsky said she
returned several gifts in December that the president had given her
after lawyers for Mrs. Jones had subpoenaed them. In that proffer
of what she was willing to tell the Starr legal team, Ms. Lewinsky
said that Clinton told her that she would not have to produce any
gifts he had given her if they were not in her possession,
according to those familiar with the language of the proffer. One
of the key questions that Starr's prosecutors are trying to answer
is whether Mrs. Currie accepted the gifts on her own, at the
request of Ms. Lewinsky or under orders from the president or
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse Tuesday, Leibig, the lawyer for the four
uniformed officers, told reporters that several officers were on
duty Dec. 28 and that ``some of them knew about'' the meeting
between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr has a set of facts that he has from other witnesses
and he's trying to confirm those facts,'' Leibig said Tuesday. But
he added: ``I don't think any of them have seen any evidence of a
crime. I don't think they saw the president in an embarrassing,
compromising or off-color situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky have testified under oath that
they did not have a sexual relationship. The president has also
said that he did not encourage anyone to lie. In his deposition in
the Jones case, Clinton acknowledged having several meetings with
Ms. Lewinsky at the White House. But he said he was not alone with
her, except perhaps for brief moments when she delivered some
papers.
</P>
<P>
   But one lawyer familiar with the inquiry said that he believes
two Secret Service officers have told investigators that they had
seen the president and Ms. Lewinsky enter a room together alone. It
is not known whether the officers said they saw them enter the Oval
Office or the president's private study, a small room adjacent to
the Oval Office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the same time that uniformed officers filed out of a minivan
outside the courthouse Tuesday morning and went to the third floor
grand jury room, lawyers for the president, Ms. Lewinsky and the
independent counsel's office gathered on the federal courthouse's
fifth floor to argue before a federal appeals court. The issue was
related to a February complaint by the president's lawyers that
Starr had illegally leaked sensitive grand jury information to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's whirlwind day of activity signaled that the six-month
inquiry's pace has dramatically escalated since Supreme Court Chief
Justice William Rehnquist refused to block Secret Service agents
from testifying before the grand jury last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven current and former officers are under subpoena to testify
this week. Instead of meeting just two days this week, the grand
jury is scheduled to meet three days, adding a full-day session
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cockell, the chief of the president's security detail who
asked to be reassigned last week, did not testify Tuesday, nor did
Ms. Tripp or Mrs. Currie, both of whom are expected to return to
the grand jury room for further testimony. Cockell is expected to
testify for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers familiar with interviews conducted with
some of the agents and officers, Starr's prosecutors are most
interested in corroborating some details given to them by other
witnesses. But they are also hopeful that the officers and agents
will fill in key details about important events.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have also asked questions about White House
meetings in January when the president's close friend, Vernon
Jordan, was working to find Ms. Lewinsky a job. And, lawyers said,
they have asked officers about meetings held at the White House in
the days after Ms. Lewinsky signed an affidavit swearing that she
had not had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll by The New York Times/CBS News shows that a
majority of the American public say it is inappropriate for Starr
to force Secret Service personnel to testify about what they have
seen or heard while protecting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Only 36 percent in the nationwide telephone poll said making the
agents testify was appropriate, while 58 percent said it was
inappropriate. The poll, conducted Sunday and Monday with 567
adults, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The public was split on whether Secret Service agents actually
know anything that could be used against against Clinton. Forty-two
percent said they thought the agents do have such knowledge, 31
percent said they do not, and another 27 percent said they did not
know.

POPOV CONTINUES TO DOMINATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aleksandr Popov, the Russian swimmer, is not living
as fast as he used to. Instead of speeding in expensive sports
cars, he now drives Volvos. Last October, he and his wife, Darya
Shmelyova, had their first child, Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   Popov, however, has not slowed down in the pool as he continues
to dominate the 50- and 100-meter freestyle field nearly two years
after a near-fatal stabbing in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Popov has lost only once at a major meet since 1991, in the
50-meter freestyle at the world championships in Perth, Australia,
last January. He will headline the Goodwill Games swimming
competition at the Nassau County Swimming and Diving Center,
starting next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Popov, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, continues to train in
Canberra, Australia, under his fellow Russian Gennadi Touretsky,
the director of swimming at the Australian Institute of Sport.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Popov has said that he has no intention of becoming
an Australian citizen, but Tuesday he left open the possibility of
changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might get it later on, maybe even before I'm done competing,
just for travel purposes,'' he said. He did not speculate on
whether he would try to become an Australian citizen in time for
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Before Popov fielded some questions from about 100 youngsters at
the Shorefront YM-YWHA in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn
Tuesday afternoon, he was asked whether he would continue to swim
after the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may go for another year to slow down and quit,'' said Popov,
who is 27. ``It depends on a lot of things. I had an accident in
'96, and I don't know what can happen the next day. I'm not
planning anything.''

FOES OF GRAND CANYON TOURIST VILLAGE PROPOSAL SEEK INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Opponents of a proposed tourist village at the main
entrance to Grand Canyon National Park say that federal agencies
colluded with the developer over plans for the village and that
their actions should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   But spokespeople for the U.S. Forest Service and the
Scottsdale-based developers of Canyon Forest Village denied the
allegations and said they would welcome any federal oversight into
efforts to plan for the increasing number of tourists at Arizona's
namesake landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Mayor Jim Hoffman of the opposition group, No on Canyon
Forest Village, said Tuesday that information he recently obtained
through a federal Freedom of Information Act request shows ``a
disturbing trend of collusion'' between the developers and federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he released a 1994 letter from Canyon Forest
Village marketers to the Park Service. The letter suggests that the
federal agencies and developers exchange position papers and
resources to ``aid in the development of strategies to counter
opposition and respond to critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff City Councilman Rick Lopez, chairman of the village
opponents, called the letter a ``smoking gun'' that showed
``extraordinary collaboration'' among the Forest Service, Park
Service and Canyon Forest Village.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez called for investigations and reviews by the U.S.
Attorney's Office, the General Accounting Office and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lopez called for the release of more federal
documents and the immediate release of all land appraisals for a
proposed land swap that would be required before Canyon Forest
Village could be built.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village proposes to trade 2,184 acres of private
property, mostly old ranches scattered throughout the nearby
forest, for about 270 acres of Forest Service land along Arizona 64
between the park's main entrance and the existing tourist town of
Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lund, real-estate land manager for the Kaibab National
Forest, said agency policy prohibits the distribution of appraisals
until a final decision is made. It is expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lund added that the agency is preparing to make public more
documents and that dozens of public meetings have been held on the
proposal over nine years in what he described as the most open
Environmental Impact Study ever conducted by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   A final public meeting on the proposal is to be held in Phoenix
from 3 to 8 p.m. Thursday at Embassy Suites, Interstate 17 and
Greenway Road.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only such land-swap review that required detailed
land-use plans to be submitted in advance, Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were really trying to hide any information, we would
have never, ever, done it this way. We have insisted on a very open
process so we could really reflect what the environmental, social
and economic impacts would be,'' Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom De Paolo, managing partner of Canyon Forest Village, laughed
when he heard about the opponents' calls for investigations and
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's collusion? We don't even support the alternative they
(Forest Service) approved,'' De Paolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Forest Service announced its
``preferred'' plan for the land exchange and development from among
eight alternatives. The Forest Service wants alternative ``G,''
which would allow Canyon Forest Village to develop up to 900 hotel
rooms and 200,000 square feet of retail space.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village favors alternative ``H,'' which would
allow it to build 1,220 hotel rooms and 270,000 square feet of
retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   Nine national environmental groups also support alternative
``H'' because it would allow the developers enough profits to
construct a water system that would protect the springs and
waterfalls inside the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of drawing water from deep wells, as is done in Tusayan
and would be done under alternative ``G,'' alternative ``H'' would
have water shipped from 220 miles away. Water from the Colorado
River would be drawn at Topock, along the Arizona-California line,
shipped by rail to near Williams and piped from there to Canyon
Forest Village.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest environmental group, the Sierra Club,
opposes Canyon Forest Village and all other developments near the
Canyon, and it instead has called for limits to be placed on
visitation at the park. &QL;

JUDGE SAYS BRAWLEY CAN TESTIFY, AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Raising the possibility of an extraordinary
courtroom drama, the judge in the Tawana Brawley defamation case
reversed himself Tuesday and ruled that one of the defendants could
call Miss Brawley to testify this week during the damages phase of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley's taking the stand would subject her to
cross-examination for the first time since she became nationally
known as the black teen-ager who said she was kidnapped and raped
by a group of white men in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to be here,'' said Stephen Jackson, the lawyer for
C. Vernon Mason, who is fighting the case with the two other
Brawley advisers, Alton Maddox and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer for the plaintiff, Steven Pagones, flatly
predicted that the advisers would never permit Miss Brawley to
testify. The lawyer, William Stanton, said Jackson had expected the
judge to bar Miss Brawley and had said he would call her only so
that he could complain publicly that she was being silenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing poker,'' Stanton said. ``Their hand is being
called.''
</P>
<P>
   First in a grand jury investigation of her claims a decade ago
and more recently during the initial phase of the defamation trial,
Miss Brawley's advisers have said she could not participate in a
racist legal system.
</P>
<P>
   For doubters of Miss Brawley's account, ``Where's Tawana?'' has
long been the central question hurled at the advisers, with the
suggestion that her testimony would expose a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's move revealed an apparent division among the advisers,
with Maddox distancing himself from Jackson's efforts. But Jackson
said that Miss Brawley would testify Thursday about what happened
to her in 1987 and what she told her advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state Supreme Court, has issued
at least three conflicting rulings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared that, if Miss Brawley testified, he would tell
the jurors that they could use her statements only to assess
damages, not to reopen their decision of July 13 holding that the
advisers made false and defamatory statements about Pagones, a
white former prosecutor who, they said, raped Miss Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would call Miss Brawley ``so she can testify
about the facts of November 1987,'' when she said she was attacked
over four days.
</P>
<P>
   He said she would also describe what she told the advisers to
show that they lacked ill will when they made their accusations
against Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson persuaded the judge that even though a statement had
been found to be false and defamatory, evidence ``that tends to
prove the truth'' of the same statement can be considered by a jury
to limit damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's move put Maddox, the adviser with the closest ties to
the Brawley family, in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   During the first phase of the case, the judge told jurors they
could infer from the fact that Maddox had not called Miss Brawley
that her testimony would not have supported his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in court, Maddox said, ``My position and my interests
are quite different from Mason and Reverend Sharpton'' on the
question of whether to call Miss Brawley. Outside court, he denied
that there was any division among the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones said he was thrilled at the prospect that Miss Brawley
might appear as a witness. ``I want the truth to come out,'' he
said. ``She'll either take the stand and admit the whole thing was
a lie and they knew it'' or she will be forced to make that
admission under cross-examination, Pagones said.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley, who now lives in Temple Hills, Md., just southeast
of Washington, was not at home when a reporter visited.
</P>
<P>
   For Hickman, Jackson's move created a legal tangle. Miss Brawley
was originally sued along with her advisers. She never answered
Pagones' complaint and he obtained a judgment by default against
her.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman is to set the damages against her, and he has repeatedly
said she was invited to appear as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   But he ruled last week that Jackson's effort to call her created
different legal issues. In a letter to Jackson on July 15, he said
``the jury has determined the falsity of the allegation that she
was raped'' by Pagones ``and she cannot appear at this stage of the
trial on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the issue of liability for false and defamatory
statements was settled by the jury in its civil verdict July 13.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence at the current phase of the trial is to concern the
limited questions of Pagones' losses and whether to assess damages
to punish the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Hickman said he was altering his original
ruling barring Miss Brawley from testifying by scheduling a hearing
on Jackson's request.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman also said this morning that there were a series of legal
problems with permitting Miss Brawley to testify, including the
possibility that her testimony would amount to an impermissible
attack by the advisers on the jury's verdict.

   STOCKS DECLINE ON CONCERNS OF SLOW EARNINGS GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that corporate earnings will slow later this year,
and cautionary words about inflation from Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve chairman, sent stocks falling. The Dow Jones industrial
average declined 105.56 points, to 9,190.19. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index closed down 19.03 points, to 1,165.07, while the
Nasdaq composite index fell 35.11 points, to 1,979.14.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Merck fell 7 percent, or $9.8125, to $128.5625 a
share, after the drug maker warned that profits in the second half
of this year would be a disappointment. Investors focused on this
news, sending shares of other drug stocks, including American Home
Products, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough lower even
though some reported second-quarter earnings that were near Wall
Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 5.66 percent, from 5.71
percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   WORKER FRUSTRATION GROWS AT SATURN
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other General Motors divisions, Saturn has kept producing
cars during a crippling parts strike, thanks partly to outside
suppliers. But Saturn auto workers are furious because GM plans to
use many parts from elsewhere for future Saturn vehicles. That is
an important reason why they decided to authorize a strike if
negotiations fail to resolve their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS INCREASE AT BIG BANKS
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, the nation's biggest banks,
reported surprisingly high second-quarter earnings on gains in
investment banking and currency trading. Banc One and Wells Fargo
also reported stronger-than-expected results. But their shares fell
sharply in a broad retreat in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP MORRIS RESULTS IMPROVE
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris reported an 8.9 percent increase in second-quarter
operating earnings on increased sales of the Marlboro brand
overseas, which helped offset the effects of a decline in smoking
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS INSTRUMENTS' EARNINGS DROP
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor maker Texas Instruments reported a
greater-than-expected decline in second-quarter profit, attributing
it to weak prices for memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   HOME BUILDING RATE ROSE IN JUNE
</P>
<P>
   Housing starts rose 5.6 percent in June, the first increase in
four months. Analysts said the increase to an annual rate of 1.615
million units was unexpectedly large and reflected a combination of
low mortgage rates, consumer optimism and a stable job market.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT NAMES NO.2 TO GATES
</P>
<P>
   Steven Ballmer is promoted to president of Microsoft, as
expected. This means that Bill Gates, the 42-year-old chairman,
will hand over some of his day-to-day management chores. He
emphasized that the management change was mainly intended to allow
him to spend more time on long-term technology and product issues.
</P>
<P>
   SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY OUSTS CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Seagate Technology has asked its chief executive, Alan Shugart,
a pioneer in the invention of the computer disk drive, to retire.
It named Stephen Luczo, the company's president, to turn the
financially ailing company around.
</P>
<P>
   STYRENE BUSINESS ACQUIRED BY NOVA
</P>
<P>
   Nova Corporation of Canada will acquire most of the styrene
operations of the Huntsman Corporation for $860 million in cash and
preferred stock.

<P>
   GOING AGAINST CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Integration is often held to be essential to a successful
merger. But Northern Telecom of Canada, which has an agreement to
acquire Bay Networks for $9.1 billion, plans to operate Bay
independently, instead of integrating it.

AIR FORCE NOMINEE FACES CRITICAL SENATE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to clean up throughout, adds 10 new grafs at end.)   (ATTN: Miss., Ariz., Fla.)  
(th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a Senate committee's crucial
confirmation vote, President Clinton's choice to be the next
secretary of the Air Force still faced an attack on his
truthfulness and integrity Tuesday. That attack has imperiled the
secretary-designate's prospects for confirmation to a job whose
nominees generally breeze to Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee, state Sen. Daryl Jones of Florida, is a lawyer, an
Air Force Academy graduate and a former fighter pilot who is a
lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve. In Senate hearings on
his selection in the last month, former squadron mates, including a
former commander, accused him of lying about his flying record and
pressuring enlisted airmen to buy Amway household products that he
and his wife sold.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary nine-hour hearing last Thursday, Republicans
on the Senate Armed Services Committee confronted Jones, voicing
concerns about his judgment and discrepancies in his statements
concerning his flying record. He defended himself, saying that he
had been falsely accused in some instances, that he had made honest
mistakes in others, and that he and his accusers had differing
recollections in still others.
</P>
<P>
   But his testimony failed to persuade many of the Republicans on
the committee, which met privately Tuesday afternoon to debate the
nomination. Senators and White House officials said Tuesday night
that the committee's vote, set for Wednesday, was too close to
call.
</P>
<P>
   Not since a Democratic-controlled Senate rejected President
George Bush's choice of former Sen. John Tower to be Defense
secretary in 1989 have senators been so riven by a Pentagon
nomination. And at the Defense Department on Tuesday, nobody could
recall an instance in which the Senate had rejected a president's
pick to head a branch of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaning against him,'' said one committee Republican, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. McCain said he was especially troubled that
Jones had collected flight pay _ $88 a month _ for nearly four
years after he stopped flying F-16s and took a desk job.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a Democrat who is considered a rising political star in
Florida, has initiated a counterattack along with his supporters.
The nominee defended himself on Monday on the ABC television
program ``Good Morning America'' and has met with a number of
senators this week. Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen
have called wavering senators on Jones' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's been tough on me, I do believe the process
has been open and fair,'' Jones said this week. He declined to
comment Tuesday, citing the imminent vote.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Jones, who would become the first black Air
Force secretary, has also stirred accusations of racism and
political favoritism, and offered a glimpse into what his
supporters describe as a good ol' boy network pervading Air Force
Reserve units in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The service secretaries are civilians responsible for budgets,
recruiting and training, but not combat operations. Over the years,
administrations have awarded the jobs as political perquisites, but
the Clinton administration has also used them to expand
opportunities for women and minorities in the upper echelons of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 43, would succeed Sheila Widnall, the first woman to be
an armed services secretary, who resigned last fall. The job pays
an annual salary of $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have criticized the administration, saying it
did not fully review Jones' record before nominating him. But
administration officials say most of the accusations against him
were publicly known beforehand and have been exaggerated or
otherwise misstated by critics.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Jones had a sterling career at the Air
Force Academy and as an active-duty F-4 Phantom pilot. Most of the
criticism regards his record after he left active duty and, in
1990, joined the 93rd Fighter Squadron, an F-16 Reserve unit based
at Homestead Air Force Base, Fla. He was the first black pilot in
the unit's history.
</P>
<P>
   Former members of the squadron told the committee last week that
other pilots _ many of them, unlike Jones, Vietnam veterans who had
known each other for years _ had resented him from the start,
suspecting that he had won a coveted slot in the unit because he is
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those individuals felt that race was very much a factor in his
being selected as a pilot for the 93rd,'' Lt. Col. William Vrastil
told the senators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The year he joined the squadron, Jones was also starting his
political career in the Florida House. But his duties as an
officeholder took time away from his flying, and it began to show,
officials said. At least twice he scraped the tail of his $20
million F-16 on landing.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from his superiors, Jones agreed to stop flying
and take an administrative job. His commander at the time, Col.
Thomas Dyches, has said he effectively grounded Jones. But Jones
remembers the incident differently, saying that he stepped down
voluntarily and that Dyches did not have the authority on his own
to ground him.
</P>
<P>
   The two men repeated their differing versions last Thursday, to
the bewilderment of the committee. ``The question is, who's telling
the truth?'' said Sen. Daniel Coats, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has had other troubles as well. He told the senators at a
hearing in June that he had flown a career total of 2,000 hours.
When an aide later pointed out that the total was actually about
1,400 hours, he had to quickly correct the record, and some
senators remained suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's said so many things that have proven to be false,'' said
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Amway products, Jones has dismissed accusations that
he forced subordinates to buy them. It may be, he says, that he
solicited such buyers unwittingly, in civilian settings.
</P>
<P>
   The flight-pay error? Pentagon officials blame Air Force
bookkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, has told the
committee that an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission
into campaign contributions that Jones made while he was a lobbyist
for an investment bank has assigned no blame to him.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jones wins Senate confirmation, some of his supporters
wonder aloud whether he will be able to shed the taint of the
accusations and gain the respect of the 380,000 uniformed personnel
and 115,000 civilians he will lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would weigh heavily in my final judgment,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, like Jones a native Mississippian.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jones may still squeak through, because of strong
support from some Senate Republicans, including Sen. Thad Cochran
of Mississippi, who, as a member of the House, appointed Jones to
the Air Force Academy in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daryl Jones,'' Cochran said Tuesday, ``would be an excellent
secretary of the Air Force.'' &QL;

CLASSICS MUCH PRAISED, LITTLE READ; LIST MAY SPUR INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CLANCY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _In a world of little time and immediate gratification,
the only thing apparently keeping classic literature alive is the
college reading list.
</P>
<P>
   But a list of the top 100 English-language novels of this
century published Monday by Modern Library might go a long way
toward stimulating interest, according to librarians and
booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott LeRoy, manager of a Bookstar in central Phoenix, said few
of the books on the list, which has James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' at
No. 1, are asked for unless they are needed for a high school or
college literature course.
</P>
<P>
   Those that still sell for pleasure reading include perennial
favorite ``The'' ``Catcher in the Rye'' by J.D. Salinger (No. 64),
``Go Tell It on the Mountain'' by James Baldwin (No. 39) and
``Catch-22'' by Joseph Heller (No. 7).
</P>
<P>
   Even after working 21 years in bookstores, LeRoy failed to
recognize some of the titles on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 59, I never heard of,'' he said of Max Beerbohm's
``Zuleika Dobson''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard of John Cheever, but not that title,'' he said
about No. 63 on the list, ``The Wapshot Chronicles''.
</P>
<P>
   ````Deliverance'' (by James Dickey, No. 42) we haven't sold in a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodeane Widom, head librarian at the Glendale Public Library,
said not many of the books are regularly checked out, even though
she believes there is something of a renaissance in reading.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 100, she said, ``These are things you really need to
take time with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture has changed so much that we're used to clicking on
things and getting immediate response,'' she said. ``So when faced
with a book that takes time to read and cultivate characters and
follow a comprehensive kind of plot, it causes people to turn away.
If they can't get into it in first 10 pages, they don't try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at myself,'' she said. ``Out of the top 10, I had
read five of them. But not recently _ it was while I was in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Widom said many fine books continue to be published, but they
don't get the ``same kind of attention as a new movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Hamilton-Selway, collection development coordinator at
the Scottsdale Library, said talk at the office Tuesday was about
what was not on the list _ many women authors, for instance, and
many favorite books. She also noted the scarcity of current
authors, pointing out that many writers now considered the cream of
the crop of the 19th century were the Stephen Kings and John
Grishams of their day.
</P>
<P>
   As far as interest in the list, she said no one had asked about
it by midafternoon Tuesday, although she plans to update the
collection because many of the books on the list are worn out. She
acknowledged not having heard of Arthur Koestler's ``Darkness at
Noon ''(No. 8), but she did read ``Zuleika Dobson''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it, and it's obscure. I'm so proud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Roberts, deputy director of the Maricopa County Library,
said the list also excludes children's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to say is that these are not what people are
asking for, unless they are in school,'' she said. ``But there is
no question that these are exceptionally well written.''
</P>
<P>
   She said times have changed, with the advent of television and
computer as popular mediums, and the language has, too. Slang
didn't figure into good writing early in the century, and the
language that was used earlier in the century appears quaint or
even arrogant to the modern reader, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that some of the books still circulate reasonably
well, including ``Lord of the Flies'' by William Golding (No. 41).
</P>
<P>
   As for increasing interest in the classics, she said, ``I hope
it does. There are wonderful things on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Nelson, director of Phoenix's Burton Barr Central
Library, wasn't holding her breath, though. ``I'm sure people are
just pouring in today,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   She added, more seriously, that possibly the list would give
people who want to try a serious book some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they choose, it will be well written, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain there is not a book on the list that ends a
single sentence with a preposition.'' &QL;

HOUSE APPROVES CONTINUED FINANCING FOR NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE
ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 8th graf to insert new information; inserts new 12th graf,

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharp election-year conversion, the House on
Tuesday overwhelmingly approved money for the National Endowment
for the Arts, long the scourge of conservatives and a prime target
of Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 253-173 virtually guarantees that one way or
another, the arts agency will continue to receive the $98 million
it received this fiscal year, even though the money is attached to
a more controversial bill financing the Interior Department. The
Senate has indicated support for the arts money and President
Clinton has said he wants it too.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote _ supported by 58 Republicans, 194 Democrats and
one Independent _ was foreshadowed by a committee vote last month
that approved the money and rejected the Republican doctrine
against using taxpayer money for the arts. Still, arts
organizations were relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old debate over the existence of the NEA finally has given
way to a more thoughtful dialogue about the appropriate level of
federal arts funding in America,'' William Ivey, the new chairman
of the endowment, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote for the popular arts subsidy reflects the
moderating influence of a pending election. Republicans had also
provided themselves political cover by approving a number of
changes last year that they said would reduce concerns they had
previously.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions include broadening the distribution of grants
to more than just a few urban areas and building in safeguards
against the financing of artistic works that many conservatives
deemed obscene.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also reflects a certain anti-New York sentiment. The
state has long been the endowment's largest beneficiary, breeding
resentment among rural lawmakers who felt that their artistic
institutions could not compete with the Lincoln Center and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Moreover, many conservatives perceived
New York City as a hotbed of left-wing art that offended mainstream
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes, which Congress passed last year but which
have yet to be fully implemented, no state can receive more than 15
percent of the $81 million that goes directly for grants. (The rest
of the $98 million is for administration.) New York is the only
state that receives more than the 15 percent limit. Of the $22
million total given this year to all states for exhibits and shows
that travel across state lines, New York received 25 percent, or
$5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the grants that went for arts that stayed within the state,
New York received only a fraction more than 15 percent _ 15.47
percent _ of the total money given to all states during the fiscal
year that ends Sept. 30. Still, New York fared far better than any
other state, receiving $12.5 million in fiscal 1998 compared with
second-place California, which was given $6.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was clearly legislation targeted at New York state,''
said Cherie Simon, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for the
Arts. ``Everyone understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has repeatedly trimmed the agency's budget, from a peak
of $176 million in 1992. Ms. Simon of the endowment said the agency
had undergone substantial internal restructuring in response to
congressional concerns. For one thing, she said, the agency was
spreading its money around more evenly to other states,
acknowledging that 20 states had been ``underserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are intended to tighten the rules to try to avoid
financing controversial projects. Congress prohibited financing of
grants to individual artists, except in literature. And it
prohibited arts organizations from giving part of their grants to
third parties.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans first took control of Congress in 1995, they
planned to eliminate the endowment. They slashed its financing by
40 percent for the 1996 fiscal year and prepared to phase it out
altogether by this year. Each year, the Senate stepped in to rescue
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as May, Republican leaders had promised the
Christian right that they would de-finance the agency, and
conservatives had made its elimination a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition,
recently criticized the agency for financing several projects he
called blasphemous. He cited financing for the Manhattan Theater
Club to stage ``Corpus Christi,'' in which Christ is portrayed as a
homosexual (although the theater subsequently used the money for
other plays); ``Watermelon Woman,'' a film by a New York-based
group depicting lesbian sex; ``Piss Christ,'' a 1987 photograph of
a crucifix in a jar of urine.
</P>
<P>
   With moderate Republicans reasserting themselves as they face
re-election, House leaders went through a number of procedural
contortions on Tuesday to let both wings of their party score the
political points that each needed. They removed the financing but
then allowed one of their own _ Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. _ to
reinstate it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a public debate among Republicans, highlighting
the philosophical differences that divide the party.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans acknowledged privately that they were
supporting the agency because of two important constituencies:
wealthy patrons of the arts, who also contribute to their
campaigns, and local businesses like restaurants and hotels, which
benefit from art exhibits and theater productions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., who identified himself during Tuesday's
floor debate as one of the most conservative members of the House,
said that the endowment had made mistakes in the past but that the
duty of Congress was to correct the mistakes, not abolish the
agency.

OPEC'S OIL REVENUE DOWN A THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Oil revenue of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has fallen by a third this year because of the severe
decline in prices, industry trade data show.
</P>
<P>
   Petrostrategies, a Paris-based weekly publication, said on
Monday that the collective revenue of OPEC's 11 members fell to
$60.7 billion in the first six months of 1998, compared with $89.6
billion in the first six months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every OPEC member suffered a decline in oil export
revenue. The exception was Iraq, where revenue has risen about 20
percent this year. The United Nations is permitting the Iraqis to
sell more oil under amended terms of the trade sanctions imposed
after the Persian Gulf war of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's production, and its sales of crude oil and products, have
risen to nearly 2.2 million barrels a day. While that is still
below its production level of 3.5 million barrels a day before the
gulf war, it is considerably more than the 500,000 barrel-a-day
limit imposed in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices remaining depressed, near 10-year lows at $12 to
$14 a barrel, it is likely that OPEC nations' revenue will fall
further.
</P>
<P>
   Oil analysts predict that for all of 1998, the combined revenue
of OPEC nations from petroleum exports will fall 30 percent from
1997 to $121.5 billion, the lowest since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal of belt-tightening for everybody and big
cuts in budgets,'' Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, said
Tuesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Terzian and other analysts said the actual decline in OPEC
revenue is far bigger than the figure suggests. In 1989, the
combined revenue came on production of 21 million barrels a day.
Today, OPEC countries are pumping 27 million barrels a day and
getting less.
</P>
<P>
   The Petrostrategies report added to an emerging picture of
intensified economic problems among OPEC members. Last month, Saudi
Arabia, the largest exporter of oil, announced measures that for
the first time suggested big reductions in the military budget.
Although no figures were made public, the Saudis have ranked as one
of the largest buyers of warplanes and weapons for more than a
decade, concluding multibillion-dollar deals with the United
States, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has also begun a quiet campaign to raise taxes on
services at ports and airports, and reduce public employment. Iran,
Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria and other OPEC members are also reducing
budgets, which could lead to higher prices for food, energy and
public services that have been partly subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to cut subsidies and energize their economies to
adjust to this crisis,'' said Mehdi Verzi, an oil analyst here with
the investment firm of Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   He forecast more pain ahead for OPEC nations as the Asian
economic crisis worsened, reducing a key regional source of demand.

2 SECURITIES FIRMS WILL PAY ORANGE COUNTY $117 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ORANGECOUNTY-BANKRUPTCY) 
(th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Nomura
Securities International agreed Tuesday to pay a total of $117.5
million to Orange County, Calif., the latest in a flurry of
settlements related to the largest municipal bankruptcy in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $69.6 million to end lawsuits filed
by the county against both Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. and Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., which merged in 1997. Nomura, a division of Japan's
largest securities company, will pay $47.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement brings Orange County's total recovery from
lawsuits to $739 million, more than half of it from a $400 million
settlement last month with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the brokerage most
heavily involved in the county's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The county, just south of Los Angeles, filed for bankruptcy in
December 1994 after losing more than $1.6 billion on investments in
risky securities. It sued nearly 20 brokers for their role in
selling securities to the county and in lending the county money to
buy those securities. It also sued some law and accounting firms
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's credit rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   Both Morgan and Nomura said in statements that the settlements
would not hurt their financial condition. Both said they had done
nothing wrong and that they settled to avoid the costs and
disruption of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our actions were just and proper at all times during the
period we did business with Orange County,'' Nomura said. Morgan
said it had conducted itself in ``an exemplary manner in all our
dealings with the county.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and Nomura negotiated together, apparently because they
believed they could get a better deal. James Mercer, an attorney
representing Orange County, said there had been attempts by many of
the defendants to jointly negotiate a global settlement but that
such efforts have apparently fallen apart for now. However, he
said, Orange County is now involved in settlement talks with other
companies he would not identify.
</P>
<P>
   The new settlements seem to be roughly in line with the previous
ones. Credit Suisse First Boston settled in May for $52.5 million,
KPMG Peat Marwick, accountants for the county, agreed that same
month to pay $75 million and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Green &AMP; MacRae, a law
firm, agreed in April to pay $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercer, who is with the Los Angeles firm Hennigan, Mercer &AMP;
Bennett, said that based on their degree of involvement in the
county's finances, Morgan and Nomura were paying relatively more
than First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively speaking, the price of settling is rising,'' Mercer
said. With the Merrill Lynch case having been settled last month,
Morgan Stanley's case was expected to be the next one to go to
trial. With that one now settled, the other active cases, which are
in the evidence-gathering stage but have not yet been scheduled for
trial, are against Fuji Securities, Standard &AMP; Poor's and Rauscher
Pierce Refsnes Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Cases against 14 other brokerage firms had been delayed by a
federal court pending the outcome of the suits against Merrill,
Morgan and Fuji. Mercer said Orange County would now ask the court
to allow the cases to proceed, an action that could prod other
companies to settle. &QL;

GIULIANI'S DRIVE AGAINST METHADONE CALLED UNLIKELY TO PREVAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began a second day of
attacks on methadone treatment, many experts and government
officials said that he could, in reality, do very little to force a
retreat from the synthetic drug that has been widely prescribed for
30 years to blunt heroin cravings.
</P>
<P>
   While roughly 40,000 heroin addicts receive methadone in New
York City, the mayor has no control _ financial or regulatory _
over the programs that serve the vast majority of those addicts,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals
Corp., said the city was re-evaluating its drug treatment programs
in the few places where it has direct authority, in the city jails
and public hospitals. And even if the mayor's ability to act was
limited, he seemed to relish repeating his condemnation of
methadone, which he first expressed Monday in apparently impromptu
remarks, saying its use simply replaced one addictive drug with
another.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed aside criticism from many experts on addiction and
fears from former heroin addicts themselves and said abstinence was
a more ``moral'' and ``decent'' way to cure heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get offended any longer when people call me crazy,''
Giuliani said at a news conference, responding to the attack from
one doctor. ``But I wonder about a doctor running a methadone
program who, when a mayor raises the idea that we should end
methadone, which is a way of keeping people dependent, describes my
idea as crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the broad attacks on methadone, its cost and its
supporters, the mayor and other city officials did not elaborate on
what exactly he might do.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, who runs the public hospital system, said that his
department has already started to adjust the goals of its drug
treatment programs, and that abstinence would become the city's new
measure for success in treating heroin addiction, just as it is for
treating alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if not enough former heroin addicts were also able
to quit taking methadone, the city could stop offering it in drug
programs in public hospitals and jails, where the treatment is
partly paid for by the state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that one day we decide to stop offering methadone
because we consider we are not helping people and it is not ethical
to provide a service just because we are getting reimbursed,''
Marcos said.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers of people in these city programs underscored
just how little control Giuliani has over most methadone programs
around the city. The city pays directly for just one methadone
program, which serves 4,300 prisoners a year in the city jail
system, accounting for a scant 10 percent of those taking methadone
in New York City. The city could withhold methadone from those
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The city also serves 2,000 more people in 5 drug treatment
programs in public hospitals, and could stop providing methadone
there. But those patients are paid for mostly with federal and
state dollars and would be free to join other private programs.
</P>
<P>
   About 34,000 more people receive methadone in 122 private
programs licensed and regulated by the state, not the city. This
year, all the programs, except the one in the jails, were paid for
largely by a combination of $30.6 million in direct state money,
and another $103.2 million in Medicaid money, which is paid for
from federal, state and local governments, according to the state
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York City contributed $25.8 million in local
Medicaid money, state health officials said the mayor could not
stop paying for methadone because Medicaid regulations require that
it be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The city does not ``have the option to tailor Medicaid
benefits,'' said Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the state
Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Several drug addiction experts accused the mayor of playing
politics with the issue of methadone and overlooking what they
contend are the benefits of the drug: people on methadone, they
say, are less likely to commit crimes or contract HIV and more
likely to be employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extraordinarily surprised to find that any public
high-ranking official of either party does not know of the 30 years
of scientific and clinical research documenting the safety and
effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment,'' Dr. Mary Jean
Kreek, who helped develop methadone in the 1960s, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``To deny treatment would be turn people who are able to work
back into potential street criminals,'' added Dr. Kreek, who heads
the Laboratory of the Biology of Addictive Diseases at Rockefeller
University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Joycelyn Woods, executive vice president of the National
Alliance of Methadone Advocates, who has been taking methadone for
25 years, said she was afraid the mayor's comments might make it
harder to get the drug she says helped to rebuild her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifesaving medicine,'' said Ms. Woods, who has
earned a master's degree since overcoming heroin addiction. ``To
have it taken from you like this, and to see somebody like the
mayor say it, is like a knife in your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if many addiction experts condemned Giuliani, several
did not, saying that methadone treatment does indeed cost too much,
and that many people stay on it for years and remain addicted to
other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mayor, even though he may not have meant to get
into this area quite this way, is really on the right track in the
sense of wanting to get at that large number of people who are
really stuck and not making progress,'' said Dr. Mitchell
Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, a network of treatment
facilities that do not use methadone. ``In that sense, I think he
may be making a real contribution to rethinking this aspect of
public policy.''

POLICE SEEK LINK BETWEEN RAPES, SEX OFFENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police are investigating a convicted sex offender, who served 3
1/2 years of a 6- to 15-year sentence, in connection with three
rapes within the last two weeks in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Police are trying to determine whether Steven Gordon of Nashua,
a convicted sex offender who allegedly raped and brutally beat two
Irish women in Hampton Beach last weekend, may have raped a Nashua
realty agent at gunpoint two weeks ago. Gordon is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the agent picked out Gordon's picture from photographs
provided by police. The two Hampton Beach victims had earlier
identified Gordon from photos as the man who allegedly raped them.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, was paroled and put on probation 13 months ago from
New Hampshire State prison after serving 3 1/2 years for the 1993
rape of a teacher at New Hampshire Technical College, which he once
attended.
</P>
<P>
   A source said State Police and the FBI are investigating tips
Gordon may have fled to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Russ, commander in charge of the Portsmouth police
detective division, confirmed that police believe Gordon has left
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Gordon is suspected of raping the two women visiting
from Ireland at Hampton Beach on Saturday. He allegedly drove up to
the women, showed a gun, and ordered them into his car. He then
drove the women to a cemetery in Portsmouth and raped them, police
say. A source said &UR;  &LR; the women, who have been hospitalized, also
were pistol-whipped.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a man resembling Gordon allegedly raped the
Nashua realty agent at gunpoint while she was showing him a home in
Manchester, N.H. The victim, who asked to be identified only as
Maria, said the rapist told her he picked her out of a glossy real
estate booklet that featured her photograph alongside some of her
listings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 rape, he was sentenced to 6 to 15 years at New
Hampshire State Prison in Concord. However, he was released on
probation after a Hillsborough County judge deferred the balance of
his sentence. As part of his probation, he was ordered to attend a
treatment program for sex offenders in Tyngsboro, Mass., according
to Stuart Hurowitz, a New Hampshire public defender who represented
Gordon. Hurowitz said he did not know whether Gordon attended the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever he was, the man who raped Maria carefully chose his
victim, employing a brazen modus operandi, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapist, who called himself ``Barry,'' telephoned Maria the
afternoon of July 7, saying he wanted to look at a property in the
South Hudson, N.H., area listed for $135,000. In the background,
Maria could hear the chatter of a small child and the intonations
of a woman whom she presumed to be his wife or girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Though the properties in which he expressed interest were not
available, Maria agreed to show him some others in the same price
range later that day, about 6:30. He was instructed to meet her at
the Re/Max Properties 1 real estate office in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes sheathed by sunglasses never removed, ``Barry'' was tanned
with a medium build and muscular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat in our office for 15 to 20 minutes because I had a
problem with a (home) closing,'' Maria recalled. ``He was talking
to our secretaries and our agents in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria said she initially thought the man was like any one of
hundreds of home buyers she has worked for, saying he had been
preapproved for a mortgage and seemed to be eager to locate the
perfect home for his family.
</P>
<P>
   She said her eyes now &UR;  &LR; furtively dart toward the left cheek of
men she sees on the street, in the supermarket, at the gas station.
She searches for two moles, the only distinguishing features she
can recall on the face of a man who promised that if she spoke to
anyone of the things he had done to her, he would be back. He said
he knew where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep on thinking, am I going to wake up and this is (going
to be) the most horrible nightmare I've ever had?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A gun now sits on Maria's nightstand; another rests with her
husband, who finds himself compelled to watch through the night.
</P>
<P>
   Said Maria: ``I just want to end it, catch the guy, get this
over with.''

BALLMER NAMED PRESIDENT OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Ballmer, the combative chief salesman of
Microsoft Corp., was named the company's president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion is a formal acknowledgment of what has long been
an accepted fact within the company _ that Ballmer is Microsoft's
second in command and that he is the natural successor to Bill
Gates, 42, the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   With Ballmer becoming president, Gates will hand over some of
his day-to-day management chores, spending less time on operations
and having fewer executives report to him.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with journalists, Gates emphasized that the
management change was mainly intended to allow him to spend more
time on long-term technology and product issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not backing off at all in terms of my commitment to
Microsoft,'' Gates said. ``I want to get in there and work with our
software developers. I want to spend more time to help drive our
breakthroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail memo to Microsoft workers, Gates explained the
management shift as a move to bolster the company as it works to
defend its lucrative franchise and sets out to conquer new markets
in Internet software and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, electronic devices like intelligent
telephones and televisions, all connected to the Internet, will
outnumber personal computers. Many personal computers, he
predicted, will become ``tablet-sized'' machines, while Microsoft's
desktop software will be able to tackle computing challenges that
are now the bailiwick of the most powerful mainframe systems. When
people use the Internet to pay bills, buy cars and plan vacations,
Microsoft wants a slice of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Its new-product goals, Gates wrote, ``require breakthrough
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' e-mail is an ambitious call to arms to Microsoft's 25,000
workers, admonishing them to prepare for a ``new phase _ one that
finds us with greater opportunities and challenges than ever
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal e-mail, posted on the Microsoft Web site later in
the day, was also intended to send a message to the larger audience
in the computer industry and among investors. To some degree, it
was meant to deter the inevitable speculation that Gates was easing
up. Because Microsoft's success is so closely associated with
Gates, any shift in his duties is a subject of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mail, Gates did not mention the government's antitrust
pursuit of the company as being among the challenges faced by
Microsoft. By contrast, in a February message to Microsoft
employees and shareholders, Gates wrote, ``We have dealt with many
challenges in Microsoft's short history, but few as important as
the issues we're facing in Washington, D.C., today.''
</P>
<P>
   After a federal appeals court last month struck down a temporary
injunction against the company, Microsoft seems to have more
confidence that it will prevail against the Justice Department,
industry analysts say. A trial is scheduled to begin in September
in the government's major antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, 42, has been the company's most unqualified critic of
the Justice Department's antitrust scrutiny. Ballmer's appointment
as president is ``certainly not an effort to make Microsoft a
kinder, gentler company in response to the Justice Department
suit,'' said Richard Sherlund, analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Ballmer is famous in the computer industry for his
animated style and his aggressive business tactics. He gets so
excited praising Microsoft or excoriating its rivals that he has
been known to cut himself, when an errant hand gesture hits his
face.
</P>
<P>
   He has, according to one industry executives, sent Christmas
cards to the children of Microsoft competitors, just to unnerve
them about how much he knows about his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   As the executive vice president in charge of sales and support,
Ballmer has taken the lead in convincing corporate customers to buy
Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballmer is a hard-line, take-no-prisoners competitor,'' said
David Coursey, editor of Coursey.com, an industry newsletter. ``He
has probably been more important to the day-to-day success of the
company over the last couple of years than Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Naming Ballmer president also conveys the message, well-known in
the industry, that ``Microsoft is far more than Bill Gates,'' noted
Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a technology newsletter. ``But
this move is not surprising, given how long and closely these two
have worked together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates and Ballmer played poker together at Harvard University,
where Ballmer stayed on to graduate while Gates dropped out to
start Microsoft. Ballmer went to work for Procter &AMP; Gamble and
earned an MBA from Stanford University, before joining Microsoft in
1980 to make his fortune. Today, he owns 4.9 percent of Microsoft,
worth about $13 billion.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent Tuesday, July 14,
about the funeral of three Roman Catholic boys killed in a
firebombing in Northern Ireland referred incorrectly to John
Dillon, a pallbearer. He lived with the boys' mother, Chrissie
Quinn, for five years and helped rear the children, but he was not
the biological father of any of them, according to family members.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Children's museums, founded as the stepchildren of natural
history museums, are exploding both in number and in scope as
baby-boom parents nationwide demand more content from their
Saturday outings.
</P>
<P>
   Annual attendance has doubled, and new museums are being built
in Austin, Texas; Baltimore; Richmond, Va., and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   No longer consisting of butterfly collections or night-sky
dioramas, the new museums may include social and regional history,
theater and an exploration of the creative process. In some cases,
they have been built around enticing themes, like Discovery Creek
in Washington, which focuses on nature and uses Maryland's Glen
Echo National Park as a setting, and the Lefferts Homestead in
Prospect Park, Brooklyn, which focuses on colonial life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneers of children's museums is Michael Spock, son
of late pediatrician Benjamin Spock. In the 1960's, Michael Spock
worked at the venerable Boston Children's Museum, one of the
nation's first such museums. A consultant to Port Discovery, which
is to open in Baltimore later this year, Spock attributes the
museums' growth to the demands of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many kids these days have very heavily managed lives,'' he
said. ``They're from families that organize the pants off them. So,
a very rich educational environment, a place of free exploration
and learning, becomes very important to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the growth of children's museums is happening in
parallel with education reform, rather than being deeply embedded
in it. Parents are smarter about how their kids learn today, and
part of that's been how educators look at children's museums. In
turn, children's-museum people are looking at schools and what's
happening in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Youth Museums, a Washington lobbying
organization, said that attendance at children's museums has more
than doubled in two years. This year's projected attendance is 22
million visitors, up from 9.3 million in 1996. Since 1991, 62 new
children's museums have opened, bringing the total nationwide to
156.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent scenes from children's museums show their range.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded amphitheater of the Brooklyn Children's Museum,
Brian Grech, 6, was chinning himself on a railing instead of paying
attention to the performance. But he suddenly became still,
enchanted by a haunting tune played by Cliff Mathias on a Cherokee
flute hand-carved by the performer. ``I love that flute,'' Brian
announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the Garden State Discovery Museum in Cherry Hill, N.J., at a
replica of a classic New Jersey diner, youngsters pretended to cook
for their parents, serving fake food, tallying the tills and, in
the process, learning a bit of nutrition and math.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hudson Valley Children's Museum in Nyack, N.Y., children
learn to read by equating quilt patterns with word patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``School education is not enough anymore,'' said Cheryl
Bartholow, director of programs and education for the Brooklyn
Children's Museum. ``Parents want their kids to be more savvy in
how they spend their leisure time. They're very interested in their
children's education outside formal structures, so they're seeking
out alternative education sources like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Seligmann, director of Washington's Discovery Creek, sees
a link between the museums' growth and changes in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that smaller children's museums are growing because
communities want these resources for their families,'' Seligmann
said. ``They want to provide rich learning opportunities that
didn't exist before. Parents are more deeply interested in
education then they had been in past years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Dwyer Southern, president of Port Discovery in Baltimore,
said, ``I think as we look at education reform, the synergy between
formal and informal learning becomes more and more important. The
fabric of the education communities is broadened, so that all of us
embrace our responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's-museum directors are leading several trends. Lou
Casagrande, director of the Boston Children's Museum, said,
``Today, there is a sense that children's museums need to make
connections with other institutions. While we were mavericks in the
'60s, we have to be strategic allies into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his museum has expanded contacts with theater. ``Ours is
called Kidstage, and it's been a huge hit. We've always been good
with science for young kids, multiculturalism and early childhood
development. But we've added this theater program where every kid
gets to be a star. For me, personally, that's been satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of children's museums may be most clear in Port
Discovery, which will open this year in Baltimore's historic harbor
district. Mayor Kurt Schmoke recruited Douglas Becker, president of
Sylvan Learning Systems, the for-profit tutoring service, in the
early days of the project. They then persuaded Michael Spock to
serve as a consultant and the Disney Corp.'s ``Imagineering'' unit
to design the exhibits, including a three-story treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Helping children realize their dreams is the foundation of the
Port Discovery museum, which will tap schools, the Enoch Pratt
Library and the Walters Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Port Discovery is how to service kids' dreams, how to figure
out ways to acquire the skills, the insights, the strategies to
begin to make them happen,'' Spock said. ``A lot of it has to do
with issues like heroes _ popular and home-grown, like your parents
_ and how they got to where they are. It also has to do with ideas,
excitement, enthusiasms, like pets or sports, things that turn you
on _ finding out how to use them in the world, particularly in your
own community, in your family, in schools, libraries and on the
Internet.
</P>

 $45 MILLION FOR ACADEMY THAT FOSTERS WORLD PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A $45 million gift to an international school that promotes
world peace and understanding was announced Tuesday by the money
manager Shelby M.C. Davis and his wife, Gale.
</P>
<P>
   The school, the United World College, was founded in the early
1960s, at the height of the Cold War. The school seeks to foster
international understanding and world peace by bringing together
16- to 19-year-olds for a program of academics, service and
cross-cultural learning.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 campuses around the world, the school offers an unusual
two-year program leading to a pre-college degree used in over 600
schools throughout the world. The program is comparable to an
advanced version of 11th and 12th grades in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the school was dreamed up by the philosopher Kurt
Hahn, the founder of Outward Bound, and developed with the support
of Lord Louis Mountbatten and other members of the British royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 students attend each of the 10 campuses in these
countries: Canada, China (Hong Kong), India, Italy, Norway,
Singapore, Swaziland, Venezuela, Britain and the United States. The
Davis gift will be used primarily for scholarships for Americans,
who are to be chosen in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contribution is intended to prepare a growing cadre of
young Americans for global opportunities,'' said Davis, founder,
majority owner and chief executive of Davis Selected Advisers, a
mutual fund and money management firm in Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The gift includes $3 million to begin a campaign to assist the
U.S. campus, near Sante Fe, in repairing the structure of a Queen
Anne-style building that was built in the late 1800s as a resort
hotel. Last year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation
designated the building, the Montezuma Castle, as one of the most
endangered historic places in the United States. The New Mexico
campus was founded by the industrialist and philanthropist Armand
Hammer.

CLINTON ORDERS CRACKDOWN ON SUBSTANDARD NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to clarify refences to government report, add 2 grafs at end.
No pickup.)  (th) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday ordered a crackdown on
nursing homes that abuse patients or repeatedly violate health and
safety standards established by Congress 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that inspections were too predictable, Clinton told state
officials to inspect nursing homes at night and on weekends ``so
there is no time to hide neglect and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the government said in a report, a nursing home has
``near certainty that it will never be surveyed on weekends or
during evening hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton said, ``Whenever we find evidence that a
nursing home is failing to provide its residents with proper care
or even mistreating them, we will fine that facility on the spot.''
In the past, nursing homes were often given many opportunities to
correct problems before being fined.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed federal officials to focus their enforcement
efforts on nursing home chains with a history of poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Government data show that two-thirds of nursing homes in the
United States are not fully complying with federal standards. And
in four states, federal officials said, virtually no nursing homes
were cited for serious deficiencies last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's actions followed prodding by Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
Grassley plans to hold hearings on the subject next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Tuesday was the latest twist in a 17-year
struggle over the regulation of nursing homes. Efforts by President
Ronald Reagan to relax the rules died in a storm of bipartisan
protest.
</P>
<P>
   After a study by the National Academy of Sciences, Congress set
stringent, detailed standards for nursing homes in a 1987 law. The
Clinton administration issued rules to carry out the law in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala sent
Congress the report, which evaluated compliance and enforcement in
the three years since the rules were issued.
</P>
<P>
   The average number of violations found in nursing home surveys
``has declined steadily for the last few years, for reasons that
remain unknown,'' the report said. While the overall quality of
care may have improved, it said, states vary in their willingness
or ability to detect serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced several other initiatives to improve the
quality of care in nursing homes and to reduce the number of
patients with bedsores, dehydration and nutrition problems.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will significantly increase the number of nursing
homes identified as ``poor performers,'' officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About $80 billion a year is spent on the care of 1.6 million
people in more than 17,000 nursing homes. The federal government
helps finance care for two-thirds of the patients, through Medicaid
and Medicare. Most inspections are conducted by state employees,
under formal agreements with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked Congress to increase the budget for
inspections by $13 million, to $167 million next year. To help pay
for some of the new initiatives, Clinton wants authority to collect
``user fees'' from nursing homes that care for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now writing an appropriations bill to provide money
for federal health programs. Clinton appears likely to get at least
some of the extra money he requested for nursing home inspections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In adopting a tougher stance, Clinton defied the advice of
nursing home executives who urged the administration to relax
enforcement of federal standards even as they gave hundreds of
thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Just 19 months ago some administration officials proposed to
scale back inspections of nursing homes that care for elderly
people under Medicaid and Medicare. The White House spurned those
ideas soon after they were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In its report to Congress, the administration Tuesday
emphatically rejected proposals to let a private organization
inspect nursing homes for compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it found ``overwhelming evidence'' that
inspectors from the private body, the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, ``often miss serious
deficiencies,'' including the deaths of some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said, ``We have concluded that private accreditation
organizations would actually put nursing home residents in
jeopardy. They are not tough enough, they miss a lot of things, and
we are telling Congress formally now that we will not allow private
accreditation agencies to substitute for state reviews of nursing
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis O'Leary, president of the joint accreditation
commission, said he could not comment on the report because he had
not read it. But in an interview, he said, ``We believe we can do
at least as good a job as the federal government and the states in
the evaluation of nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that nursing homes, at their best, ``can be a
godsend for older Americans.'' But, he added, ``at their worst,
they can actually endanger their residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton instructed states to increase inspections of repeat
offenders, and to impose civil fines for each instance of serious
or chronic violations. Until now, penalties were based on the
number of days a nursing home was out of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection reports will be posted on the Internet, so the public
can find out exactly how well a specific nursing home complies with
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked Congress to establish a national register of
nursing home employees convicted of abusing patients. Cases of
physical abuse and assault are surprisingly common.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton asked Congress to require nursing homes to
conduct criminal background checks of all potential employees. And
he told the Justice Department to step up prosecutions in cases
where patients suffer harm because of ``egregious violations'' of
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Data in the report show that New York state cited two nursing
homes for ``substandard quality of care'' last year, while
Connecticut and New Jersey cited eight each.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, Delaware, South Dakota and Utah had no nursing homes
cited for substandard care, the report said. But, the data show,
Kansas issued 70 such citations, California issued 65 and Texas
issued 52.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health
Department, said: ``We feel the quality of care in nursing homes is
very high in New York. We are about 10 years ahead of other states
in having a rigorous enforcement program. As a result, our homes
consistently meet high standards.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Greene Burger, executive director of the National
Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, a consumer group,
welcomed Clinton's announcement. ``These steps will improve care if
they are actually carried out,'' Ms. Burger said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health
Care Association, which represents over 11,000 nursing homes,
disagreed with Clinton's approach. ``The president professes to be
concerned about the quality of care,'' Willging said. ``But last
year he supported legislation that allows states to pay less than
it costs to provide such care to Medicaid recipients.'' &QL;

2 PALESTINIANS ON TRIAL FOR PLOTTING TO EXPLODE PIPE BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOSPEH P. FREID    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal prosecutor urged a jury Tuesday to convict
two Palestinian immigrants of plotting to explode a powerful pipe
bomb in the New York City subway in a scheme that he said had been
motivated by a ``warped view of Palestinian nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final argument in a case charging a terrorist plot to
wreak carnage on New Yorkers, the prosecutor, John Curran,
contended to jurors in federal district court in Brooklyn that the
men ``were ready, willing and able to commit the most heinous acts
imaginable, to kill innocent people for their own goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers for the two defendants, Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar
and Lafi Khalil, insisted that the prosecution had not proved its
case against either man.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Padden, a lawyer for Abu Maizar, took this position even
though his client testified Monday that he had indeed planned to
set off the bomb in a suicide attack in which he hoped to kill as
many Jews as possible, though he insisted he had not planned to do
so in the subway. Abu Maizar testified against the advice of his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Padden held that the admission by Abu Maizar, 24, was not
reliable because it had resulted from ``his adoption of a notion''
_ after his arrest in the case _ that he was ``a hero of the
Palestinian cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrest last July, the lawyer told the jury, Abu
Maizar had not adopted that persona, and his real intention in
building the pipe bomb, as the defense outlined in its opening
argument, was to use it as a prop in a scheme to defraud a
government antiterrorism program of reward money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened yesterday,'' Padden said of Abu Maizar's
admission on the witness stand Monday, ``changes in no way, for one
minute, the position we took several weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As Curran spoke Tuesday, Abu Maizar angrily interrupted when he
told the jury that Abu Maizar held the United States responsible
for hunger in Iraq. From his seat at the defense table, Abu Maizar,
apparently referring to the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, exclaimed: ``They're killing two
million Iraqi people, children! No medication. That's what.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reena Raggi warned Abu Maizar that he would be removed
from the courtroom if he continued his outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Khalil, 23, maintained in his closing argument
that there was no physical evidence connecting Khalil to the bomb.
The lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, added, ``And saying he was friends with
Abu Maizar doesn't change that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it because he's from Palestine that he's supposed to be
guilty?'' McIntyre said of Khalil, who like Abu Maizar is a
Palestinian native of the West Bank who arrived in the United
States several months before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil, who listened to an Arabic translation of the
proceedings, sat characteristically slumped in his seat Tuesday,
but he appeared to be looking around more attentively than he had
for most of the two-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil and Abu Maizar were arrested in a police raid on Abu
Maizar's apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, shortly before dawn
last July 31, after another immigrant from the Middle East living
in the apartment told police that Abu Maizar was planning to
explode the bomb soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the raid, police found what they have described as a powerful
pipe bomb that was ready to be detonated, and a note threatening
attacks against American and Jewish interests if various demands
were not met, including the release of jailed Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is scheduled to begin its deliberations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges the defendants face is conspiring to use a
weapon of mass destruction, which is punishable upon conviction by
up to life in prison. &QL;

   Wagner's appearance eases fear
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 was back in the Astros' bullpen Tuesday night, and never
before has the number represented such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after being struck in the head by a line drive, Billy
Wagner was back in an Astros uniform, if only for one night.
Wagner, who is on the 15-day disabled list, stopped by the
Astrodome on Tuesday to attend a news conference and give his
teammates a send-off on a five-game road trip that begins today in
Los Angeles and concludes in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner thought about watching Tuesday's game from the dugout,
but the idea didn't seem quite right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen is where I belong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the near tragedy he escaped in Phoenix, Wagner
realized he was blessed to be anywhere on a baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fortunate that it wasn't worse,'' Wagner said. ``I
know I was surrounded by angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who suffered a concussion and a soft-tissue injury to
his left ear, appeared strong and alert in his first public
appearance since the incident. Perhaps the best sign of Wagner's
improving health was his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get hit in the head in order for people to know who I
am,'' he said jokingly. ``I was 22-for-24 in saves and couldn't get
on that show (ESPN's Up Close). I get hit in the head, and now I'm
in there. Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch Wagner back in his natural element, one could hardly
tell he was less than a week removed from being carted off the
field and rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting pretty much back to normal,'' he said. ``Before, I
had no balance, and I wasn't always able to walk around; I had a
stiff neck. But things are starting to turn around for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to his first appearance, Wagner pondered
the questions he might be asked regarding the ugly incident, which
he has seen several times on replays. He had no doubt what the
first question would be.
</P>
<P>
   Were you scared?
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast, I didn't have time to get scared,''
Wagner said. ``I wasn't scared for myself at all. The thing that
scared me was knowing my wife (Sarah, who is eight months pregnant)
was at home watching. I wanted to make sure she knew I was all
right and that I knew her and that baby were all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people expected me to be horrified by what happened,
but to be honest, my head never hurt. I guess it just hit me on the
hardest part of my head. Of course I was dizzy at first, and I
thought I was going to get sick. But I was never out of it. I knew
I was at a baseball game, and I knew my wife was at home
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, 26, will be eligible to come off the disabled list Aug.
1 at Pittsburgh, but he isn't putting pressure on himself to return
on a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to put myself on timetables,'' he said. ``It just
depends on whenever I feel normal again. With this type of injury,
you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner will begin light workouts this week and could do some
light tossing by the end of the week. It's likely he will pitch in
a couple of minor-league games before rejoining the Astros. Now
that Wagner has cleared most of the physical hurdles related to his
traumatic experience, his next step is knocking over the mental
blocks that often accompany such an occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of thing happens in baseball at least once a year,''
Wagner said. ``But I can't go out there and pitch scared. I've got
to be able to know that I can go out there and throw my pitches;
and if they hit it back up the middle, I've got to be able to knock
it down or I'm going to get hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to flinch. Those hitters have to worry about
me just as much as I have to worry about them. I'm not going to be
out there worrying about balls getting hit back at me. If you're
pitching scared, that's when you get hurt. I trust in the Lord, and
I trust my ability. I don't see any reason to climb on the mound
and say, `Oh, Lord, please don't let me get hit.' Like I said,
everyone expects me to be horrified, but I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's teammates and peers have been supportive throughout his
recovery. Diamondbacks pitcher Willie Blair, who was hit in the
face last season as a member of the Tigers, attempted to visit
Wagner at St. Joseph's hospital in Phoenix last week. Some of
Wagner's teammates convened at his Pearland home for a cookout
after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a lot of support during this time, and that's one
of the things that has helped me get through all of this,'' Wagner
said. ``I'm very thankful and very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, he was back where he belongs.

War II, Holub was celebrated for his surreal mixture of scientific
exactitude and absurdist humor. Poet Ted Hughes has called him
``one of the half dozen most important poets writing anywhere.'' In
a book titled ``The Government of the Tongue'' (1988), Seamus
Heaney praised Holub as a poet who could lay things bare, ``not so
much the skull beneath the skin, more the brain beneath the
skull.'' Holub's poetry, he wrote, is ``too compassionate to be
vindictive, too skeptical to be entranced, a poetry in which
intelligence and irony make their presence felt without displacing
delight and the less acerbic wisdoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Holub was born in Pilsen, Western Bohemia, on Sept. 23, 1923.
His father was a lawyer who worked for the railways and his mother
was a language teacher. After World War II, he studied medicine at
Charles University in Prague and worked in a psychiatric ward
there.
</P>
<P>
   He supported himself as an editor of Vesmir, a science magazine.
In 1953, Holub earned an M.D. degree and went on to work as an
immunologist at the Microbiological Institute of the Czechoslovak
Academy of Science. In 1958, he received a Ph.D. He later developed
a strain of nude, or hairless, mice that were used to study various
diseases. He wrote more than 150 scientific papers and a monograph,
``Immunology of Nude Mice.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was for his poetry that Holub was celebrated. His first
book of poems, ``Day Duty,'' was published in 1958. And he became
known in Europe and the United States when his ``Selected Poems''
was published in 1967 as part of Penguin's series on modern
European poets.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never called himself a political dissident and was
never jailed as one, he often poked fun at totalitarianism in
oblique references in his poetry. ``The Corporal Who Killed
Archimedes'' was a protest against communism's inanities masked as
a verse about the death of ``the circle, tangent and point of
intersection in infinity.'' Shortly after the Prague Spring of
1968, Holub became a ``nonperson'' in Czechoslovakia. Any mention
of his work was forbidden. And none of his poetry was published
there between 1970 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, Holub continued to work as an immunologist
in Prague, but he also wrote poetry ``to the table,'' a Russian
phrase meaning for an underground audience. In the 1970s his poetry
was published in English and in 37 other languages. But in
Czechoslovakia, his poems were not published until the fall of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Although Holub was sometimes compared with John Donne and the
metaphysical poets of the 17th century, he saw himself as closer to
other Eastern European writers, particularly Milan Kundera,
Zbigniew Herbert and Wislawa Szymborska. He shared with some of
those writers what Heaney called a tough, ``truth-telling urge''
and a ``compulsion to identify with the oppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Holub's books include ``Although'' and ``Notes From a Clay
Pigeon,'' a book that punned on the poet's name (Holub means pigeon
in Czech). Although he was better known in Europe, he also had an
American following. He was a visiting poet at Oberlin College in
Ohio and published four books with the Oberlin College Press,
``Sagittal Section,'' ``Interferon, or On Theater,'' ``Vanishing
Lung Syndrome'' and ``Intensive Care.'' He also translated some
essays by Lewis Thomas and Stephen Jay Gould from English into
Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Holub included many scientific and medical references in his
poems. One titled ``The Festival,'' from the book ``Vanishing Lung
Syndrome,'' begins: ``At the festival of the patients/with all the
known diseases/the crutch choir sings/for the pacemakers./The
double astigmatic landscape/gratefully swallows the murmurs of the
mitral valve.'' A poem titled ``Spacetime'' employs the physicist
Theodor F.E. Kaluza's theory of spacetime in which ``the fifth
dimension/is represented as a circle/associated with every point/in
spacetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also an unforgiving rationalist in prose. Holub's
``Shedding Life: Disease, Politics and Other Human Conditions,'' a
book of essays published by Milkweed Press earlier this year,
showed him to be ``a wraith of reason deriding all Dark Age flights
of fancy,'' Richard Shweder said in The New York Times Book Review.
He was ``against Marxism, parapsychology, Zen, yoga, animal rights
advocates, alternative medicine, Hindu gods, J.R.R. Tolkien,
postgraduate mystics, California philosophers and anyone or
anything either premodern or postmodern,'' Shweder wrote.
</P>
<P>
   David Young, Holub's friend and translator at Oberlin College,
said: ``He viewed science and reason as antidotes to Communism. He
put his faith in facts and was critical of all expressions of
irrationality.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did not find his poetic sensibility at odds with his love
of science. ``I have a single goal but two ways to reach it,''
Holub once said. ``I apply them both in turn. Poetry and science
form the basis of my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If something went wrong, Holub would say, ``It's a very poetic
situation,'' Young recalled. His view of life was sardonic, ironic
and grimly witty. In one of his essays in ``Shedding Life,'' he
wrote about a muskrat that had been shot in a swimming pool by a
neighbor. As Holub was cleaning it up, ``he was thinking that the
blood doesn't know about the muskrat's death,'' said Young. ``The
blood just does what it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Holub, who was married three times, is survived by his wife,
Jitka, and three children.
</P>
<P>
   A restless man with a surreal sense of humor, Holub did not like
to talk about his personal life. He noted that his favorite poet
was Homer, whose biography is obscure. He admired science because
of its anonymity. ``There is no personal background given: no age,
no numbers of girlfriends or wives or children,'' he once said.
``Nothing.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Entertainment giant Walt Disney Co., hobbled by
weak performance from its movies and home videos, has reported its
first quarterly earnings decline in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The results, released after the market closed Tuesday, did not
meet Wall Street estimates and could lead to a sell-off today.
Profits of $415 million, or 20 cents a share, for the company's
third quarter, which ended June 30, were off 2 percent from the
same period in 1997 and a penny per share short of analysts'
consensus estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With valuations so high, a company missing estimates gets
punished,'' said Linda Bannister of Edward Jones. ``I would expect
it to lose a dollar or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell 87.5 cents to $37.75 Tuesday, but has gained 50
percent in the past 12 months because of enthusiasm about new
ventures, such as Animal Kingdom and a cruise line, and strong
performances from theme parks and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, second in size only to Time Warner among the world
entertainment giants, reported a 6 percent decline in operating
income to $923 million while revenues rose 5 percent to $5.25
billion. The key profit decline came in the creative content as
operating income fell 57 percent to $111 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney cited weakness in overseas ticket sales, where its slate
included ``Starship Troopers''; slower domestic video sales, with
``Flubber'' as its lead title; weakness in Asian economies; and
tough comparisons with the 1997 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister also said lukewarm domestic results from ``The Horse
Whisperer'' and ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' held down earnings, but
noted that ``Mulan'' and ``Armageddon'' have performed well at the
box office during the new quarter and are likely to post strong
numbers overseas, particularly now that World Cup soccer matches,
which riveted international audiences, are over until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit from broadcasting topped forecasts by rising 14
percent to $384 million because of strong ESPN results and cuts in
program costs at ABC. Start-up cable ventures, such as Toon Disney,
cut profits, but Bannister said results were impressive in light of
ABC's weak ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Theme park operating profit increased 10 percent to $428
million, in line with forecasts. Disney cited record attendance,
helped by Animal Kingdom's opening in April; higher guest spending
and higher occupancy at resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister said theme parks should continue to pace growth in
coming quarters because of Animal Kingdom, the cruise line and a
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Disney last posted a year-to-year decline for a quarter in 1996,
when it lost $25 million in the second quarter because of costs of
buying Capital Cities/ABC and taking write-offs on theme parks.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A temporary elevator tower at a problem-plagued
construction site in midtown Manhattan collapsed Tuesday morning,
raining tons of steel on streets below, killing an 85-year-old
woman and creating a day of widening chaos as officials ordered the
evacuation of nearby buildings and closed much of Times Square to
traffic and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-story tower, which carried construction workers up the
side of the gleaming Conde Nast building, began peeling away from
the structure about 8:25 a.m. and a long skeleton of steel broke
off, plunging through the roof of the Woodstock Hotel across 43rd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said construction workers on the tower frantically
waved away pedestrians and drivers as an approximately 25-story
section of the elevator tower collapsed. But their efforts could
not help Thereza Feliconio, a resident of the Woodstock Hotel, who
was killed by the steel that fell into her building. Twelve other
people suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A piece of tower broke off and started gaining momentum as it
fell,'' said Edward Young, a Fleet Bank official who watched the
accident from his 39th-floor office at 1133 Avenue of the Americas,
at 43rd Street. ``It pierced through the roof of the Woodstock. It
went like a spear through a piece of cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident created an eerie mix of chaos and calm in an area
normally buzzing with activity, giving the streets the strange
quiet of Belfast or Beirut after a bombing. Immediately after the
collapse, city officials closed off 43rd Street between Avenue of
the Americas and Seventh Avenue, and then extended the closing to
Broadway and Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, after city officials had surveyed the scene
from nearby rooftops, they began evacuating many more buildings and
closing more streets, because they feared that more debris might
fall and that an adjoining scaffold damaged in the accident might
also crash down. By nightfall, as theatergoers streamed into the
area, the part of Broadway north of Times Square resembled one big
pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the third major one at the site since
construction began, and involved the second fatality. On June 26, a
carpenter on the Conde Nast project was crushed to death by an
elevator as he was working in the elevator shart. Police
investigators termed the death an accident and building inspectors
said the elevator had been working properly. In January a crane's
40-foot boom, along with several tons of granite it was carrying,
crashed into 1500 Broadway, a building just across 43rd Street from
the site. Nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
   City officials indicated that most of the affected streets would
probably remain closed Wednesday and perhaps several days more.
</P>
<P>
   The accident and the closings had a damaging ripple effect
throughout midtown, disrupting traffic as far as away as Central
Park well into the evening. And hundreds of businesses in the Times
Square area essentially shut down for the day, leaving many
restaurants, theaters and shops to complain about the loss of tens
of thousands of dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to understand the danger of this,'' said
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at an afternoon news conference a block away
from the Conde Nast Building, which is at the southeast corner of
43rd Street and Broadway. ``The immediate area is closed because as
you start the process of securing buildings, we don't know what
could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   City Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva suggested two possible
causes: either bolts were missing that were needed to secure the
elevator tower to the building or a load being carried by a giant
crane had mistakenly struck the elevator tower and fatally weakened
it.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the city and the contractor, Tishman Construction
Corp., would begin securing the scaffolding by tying cables to it
and wrapping netting around it to prevent wooden planks, toolboxes
and other material from falling to the streets below.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said it would take three to five days to secure the
scaffolding and dismantle what is left of the elevator tower.
Slightly more than half the 700-foot elevator tower crashed down,
including all the temporary tower above the 22nd floor.
</P>
<P>
   Showing uncertainty about how fast the city could deal with the
situation, Giuliani said the evacuations and closings could end as
soon as Wednesday, but indicated they might last until this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to be very cautious in closing off as much area as we
thought necessary,'' he said. ``No one really knows how secure
everything is up there. There's a difference of opinion on that. We
have to assume it isn't safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disruptions, officials said the the situation could
have been worse, since additional injuries or even deaths were
prevented by quick-thinking construction workers. Pedestrians and
drivers on 43rd Street who witnessed the accident told how the
scaffolding suddenly let loose with a loud screech as it started to
tear, and workers began shooing people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several stories worth of this torn tracking just started to
separate from the structure, and the construction workers began
herding people out of the way,'' said Andrew Mullen, who works for
a technology company at 1133 Avenue of the Americas. ``It was like
Godzilla coming. Everyone was scattering and I ran for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Joan Leibowitz, who works in the advertising department of The
New York Times, across Times Square on 43rd Street, said she was
driving to work at 8:20 a.m. and was caught behind a taxi in front
of the Conde Nast site. Suddenly, several construction workers
burst into the street and urged all the stopped traffic to somehow
back away from the site. After several minutes of urgent pleas and
maneuvering, she said, the workers got her car and others to go in
reverse, and immediately after, the elevator tower crashed down,
leaving a pile of red-orange metal on 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had it not been for the workers, cars could have been under
there, people could have been under there,'' she said. ``It was
because of them we were able to move back. We would have been
caught literally underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to several construction workers and Tishman officials,
the accident occurred after an elevator operator abruptly let
several workers off at the 22nd floor when he grew alarmed about
strange vibrations. About that time, several construction workers
said, they heard several bolts pop out, and began to hear a
screeching sound.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator operator and other workers radioed to construction
workers below to clear the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept yelling, `Oh my God, Oh my God,'' said Robert
Garratt, a 35-year-old sheet metal worker who was in the building
when the elevator tower collapsed. ``You know when this thing hits
the ground, there are a lot of people down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers at another construction site at 44th and Broadway said
the accident sounded like a jet crash, adding that planks and other
debris landed at their site, close to 100 yards from the elevator
tower.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gonzalez, who was on the 32nd floor of the Conde Nast
building when the elevator tower collapsed, said he had never
before seen so many accidents at one construction site in his 18
years as a sheet metal worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's a bad-luck job,'' he said. ``It felt like
an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, senior vice president at Tishman Construction,
said: ``Everyone connected with the project is very upset with the
accident. Our sympathy goes out to the family of the victim. It is
much too early to speculate on the cause of the failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva gave Tishman high marks. ``This is a very well-run site,''
he said. ``In any large-scale construction process, it's going to
be dangerous.''

ANALYSTS EXPECT RISE IN AMGEN EARNINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Biotechnology giant Amgen is expected to report a
slight increase in second-quarter earnings on steady sales of its
two mainstay drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of Wall Street analysts by the financial tracking service
IBES puts Amgen's likely second-quarter earnings at 74 cents a
share, up 2 cents, or 2.7 percent, from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have bid up the issue in the last week, sending Amgen
shares up $1.50 on Tuesday to a 52-week and all-time high of
$74.1875. Optimism in the stock stems from both the company's
steady earnings and events in the last quarter that have helped
assure the company's near-term future.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the federal Health Care Financing Administration, which
oversees Medicare, announced changes to guidelines for prescribing
Amgen's anti-anemia drug Epogen, making it available to more
patients. Epogen accounted for about half of Amgen's revenues last
year, generating more than $1 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter also saw intense speculation that an outside
pharmaceutical firm would make a bid to acquire Amgen.

   The best things come in small packages: apart from breasts, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how slender and toned the rest of a woman's body may
be, a huge pair of bazongas stuck on the front is still the ideal:
witness Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Anna Nicole Smith, Jane Fonda
etc.
</P>
<P>
   And while slim hips and voluptuous bosoms tend not to coincide
in nature, a couple of bagfuls of silicone do the job _ these days
for less than the cost of a secondhand car.
</P>
<P>
   What the novelist Jay McInerny has elegantly dubbed ``party
tits'' have become so widespread as to not raise an eyebrow in the
States over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, the number of people who approved of plastic surgery
increased by 50 percent between 1982 and 1992, while the number who
disapproved fell by 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For women in the public eye it is not so much a question of
whether or not to be ``enhanced'' as when to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The natural bosom seems to have few allies. Last week, an
official British government enquiry into silicone breast implants
(banned in the U.S. since 1992) concluded that they are safe and
that surgeons can be allowed to continue using them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Britain's Great Page Three Silicone Debate, Sun
newspaper readers voted overwhelmingly to ban fake breasts on Page
Three; but the enhanced are still more than welcome on all the
other pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar spirit, American publisher Norm Zadeh launched a
glamor magazine called Perfect Ten, which only features
flesh-and-blood chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want readers to know what real breasts look like, because
they've forgotten,'' explained the helpful Norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think when a woman lies down, her breasts are supposed to
stand straight up, like rockets ready for launch.'' The magazine,
however, has not been a huge money-spinner.
</P>
<P>
   Now a rearguard action is being fought. Millions of pounds worth
of compensation has already been paid out to British women who
allege that leaking implants have damaged their health and consumer
groups such as Survivors of Silicone continue to lobby against
``party tits.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Haiken, author of ``Venus Envy,'' a history of
cosmetic surgery, argues spiritedly against using the surgeon's
knife as a beauty aid; novelist Joanna Briscoe also comes down hard
on surgery in her latest novel, ``Skin,'' which gives graphic
accounts of an aging beauty's lifetime under the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have breast implants to please themselves may not find
that it is as life-changing a step as they hoped. Dr. Gillian
Butler, consultant clinical psychologist and co-author of ``Manage
Your Mind,'' warns about ``overvalued ideas about body shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's role models for women, she says, ``are all a particular
weight and shape. This has a very poor effect on self-esteem. Women
fall into the trap of thinking, `If my body is right, everything
will be right,' and of course it simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   And women who have implants to please men may likewise be
wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are far less discerning than women take them for,'' says
Phil Hilton, editor of Men's Health magazine. ``Men think all
breasts are good and are delighted to have access to any at all.
The idea that they are connoisseurs is inaccurate. There's no need
for operations and scars and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the British government enquiry that has cleared
silicone implants recommends that stringent guidelines should be
laid down for practitioners; Professor David Sharpe, president of
the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, observed
that some clinics' sales techniques ``were more attuned to double
glazing than surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sharpe himself has expressed doubts about breast
implants _ not on safety grounds, but on cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who have small breasts are somehow seen as less
attractive,'' he observes. ``That is an indictment of society.'' &QL;

   The best things come in small packages: apart from breasts, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how slender and toned the rest of a woman's body may
be, a huge pair of bazongas stuck on the front is still the ideal:
witness Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Anna Nicole Smith, Jane Fonda
etc.
</P>
<P>
   And while slim hips and voluptuous bosoms tend not to coincide
in nature, a couple of bagfuls of silicone do the job _ these days
for less than the cost of a secondhand car.
</P>
<P>
   What the novelist Jay McInerny has elegantly dubbed ``party
tits'' have become so widespread as to not raise an eyebrow in the
States over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, the number of people who approved of plastic surgery
increased by 50 percent between 1982 and 1992, while the number who
disapproved fell by 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For women in the public eye it is not so much a question of
whether or not to be ``enhanced'' as when to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The natural bosom seems to have few allies. Last week, an
official British government enquiry into silicone breast implants
(banned in the U.S. since 1992) concluded that they are safe and
that surgeons can be allowed to continue using them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Britain's Great Page Three Silicone Debate, Sun
newspaper readers voted overwhelmingly to ban fake breasts on Page
Three; but the enhanced are still more than welcome on all the
other pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar spirit, American publisher Norm Zadeh launched a
glamor magazine called Perfect Ten, which only features
flesh-and-blood chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want readers to know what real breasts look like, because
they've forgotten,'' explained the helpful Norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think when a woman lies down, her breasts are supposed to
stand straight up, like rockets ready for launch.'' The magazine,
however, has not been a huge money-spinner.
</P>
<P>
   Now a rearguard action is being fought. Millions of pounds worth
of compensation has already been paid out to British women who
allege that leaking implants have damaged their health and consumer
groups such as Survivors of Silicone continue to lobby against
``party tits.''

A LONG, CONFUSING DAY IN AND AROUND TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NY-SCAFFOLD-CRASH, NY-SCAFFOLD-VICTIM,
NY-SCAFFOLD-HOTEL, NY-SCAFFOLD-BUILDERS)

 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hollywood has been threatening all summer to destroy
Manhattan with asteroids or tidal waves or dinosaurs. In real life,
prosaic pieces of machinery _ a faulty section of scaffolding and
an elevator shaft from the rising Conde Nast building _ was more
than menacing enough to close down its best-known intersection,
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists stood on Broadway _ not the sidewalk, but in the middle
of the street _ and posed for the usual photographs, except that
the usual riot of honking taxis and delivery trucks had been
replaced by a weird, dull quiet. Harried messengers arrived at
midtown skyscrapers to deliver packages but found evacuated
buildings. Thousands of office workers, on orders from police, had
been sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll survive this,'' said David Rothenberg of his Off
Broadway play, ``Smoke on the Mountain,'' which canceled its show
Tuesday night at the Lambs Theater at 130 W. 44th St. ``This drama
is on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was a mixture of whimsy and fear, of insouciance and
irritation and annoyance. The danger of the accident was not in
doubt; a woman died when she was struck by a piece of the elevator
shaft that tore into the Woodstock Hotel, across 43rd Street from
the accident. The scaffolding, bent and tenuously tethered to the
building, remained unsecured. Subway lines beneath Times Square
were ordered to reduce speeds to 5 miles per hour to prevent
unnecessary vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit shaken up, and I don't know whether to cry,''
said Tom Minoux, 39, a plumber who was working in the building when
the accident happened. ``I was on the 27th floor and felt the floor
move beneath me. The elevators dropped about a foot and we heard a
loud bang. We went to a window and started screaming to people on
the street to get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Minoux said he watched debris slam into the Woodstock Hotel and
a nearby parking garage. Of the scaffolding still attached to the
building, he said, ``It looks to me now that it's just hanging
there on a wing and a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sense of crisis diminished on the streets below as the
day wore on and police evacuated nearby buildings, to the pleasure
and consternation of office workers. For the hundreds of people who
stood behind police barricades gawking up at the mangled
scaffolding, the accident made for good theater on an unexpected
day off. For others, particularly office workers, it transformed
midtown into an indecipherable maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very angry,'' said Maddy Tarnofsky, 50, a lawyer who was
turned away from her office at West 44th Street and Avenue of the
Americas. ``Obviously, something terrible happened, but the problem
is they are not telling people the right information. This is block
No. 3 that I've gone down. I'm in the middle of rush hour, it's hot
beyond belief, and this is just real unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, with a downpour not exactly lifting the civic
mood, Gibson Othello, 36, an accountant who works on Avenue of the
Americas between 45th and 46th Streets, began screaming after
police refused to let him into his office. He said his office was
in danger only if the scaffolding collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous!'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   For police officers, the day made for one headache after another
as annoyed New Yorkers lashed out with questions: Is the Port
Authority closed? How do I get there from here? Where is the
nearest subway station? An officer standing at West 45th Street and
Seventh Avenue observed that people in midtown Manhattan, many of
them well-paid professionals, do not respond well to unexpected
changes in their routines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``People here go where they want, when they want,'' he said.
``It's the part of town we're in.'' Another officer at 44th Street
and Avenue of the Americas ran out of patience with a woman who
insisted that she needed to attend a dinner meeting at a restaurant
in a cordoned-off area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, it's closed,'' the officer shouted. ``Everyone has been
evacuated. There are no living beings in that building.'' The woman
huffed and stormed off.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the businesses that feed off Times Square, the
shutdown meant lost business. George Vasques of Grayline
Sightseeing Tours said he had only five or six customers instead of
the usual 100. ``I hope it is not like this tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mesiti, manager of Virgil's on 44th Street near Seventh
Avenue, estimated that his restaurant, which serves about 600 meals
a day, lost $30,000. Police shut the restaurant down in the morning
because, as Mesiti said, ``if that scaffolding decides to fall,
it's going to land right on my roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Mesiti sat at the bar in Carmine's, the
sister restaurant of Virgil's, after spending the day calling his
50 employees about the closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he said, ``right now has been a real pain in the
neck. But from here on out, it's a free ride. Whatever I've got to
do is done. I'm having a gin and tonic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Armed Forces building in the center of Times Square,
recruiters stood outside, watching for potential recruits arriving
for appointments. Those who made it were driven elsewhere to take
scheduled tests.
</P>
<P>
   Messengers like Hector Rodriguez found midtown had become a
nightmare. After parking his scooter three blocks away, then
weaving through barricades, Rodriguez arrived at 1501 Broadway to
discover it was closed. He had to return the package and earned
only half his $4.25 delivery fee.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis meant that Broadway theaters near the Conde Nast
building had to close or improvise. When police closed 43rd Street
in front of the Ford Center for Performing Arts, theater officials
hustled their computers and telephones to the 42nd Street entrance,
insuring that ``Ragtime'' would go on.
</P>
<P>
   On 43rd Street, Tuesday night's sold-out performance of
``Cabaret'' was canceled by police order.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tuesday morning began like any other, with the 275
elderly residents of the Woodstock Hotel set to continue quietly
living out the final chapter of their lives 200 yards away from the
Crossroads of the World.
</P>
<P>
   But around 8:25 a.m., several tons of steel slammed into the
roof of their 12-story single-room-occupancy hotel, which caters to
one of the city's most vulnerable populations _ the elderly
homeless and mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Confined to a wheelchair in his sixth floor room, Pedro Rama,
75, said he rushed to get out of the building after it began to
shake. ``It was like the building moved,'' he said. ``We heard
boom, boom, boom. I got out of there real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Jones, who lives on the top floor of the building, said
the steel crashing into the building ``felt like an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away from Ms. Jones' room, 85-year-old Thereza
Feliciono lay mortally wounded beneath a slab of concrete. And
throughout the building's 12 floors, hundreds of terrified and
confused residents tried to grasp what had just happened to them,
while the elderly residents who sit outside each morning observing
the spectacle of rush hour in Times Square stared in disbelief at
the scene before them Tuesday: a partially collapsed 48-story
elevator tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just utter chaos,'' said Cynthia Dial, the executive
director of Project Find, the nonprofit group that has run the
hotel since 1975. ``The residents who were outside were in complete
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dial said that about 45 residents of the hotel had left the
building early Tuesday morning prior to the accident to spend the
day on the streets alone, as was their custom. As of 10 p.m.
Tuesday night, 25 residents had not been located and were believed
to still be wandering the streets of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   With the area cordoned off by police, Ms. Dial said she feared
residents would not know where to go when they tried to return home
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the hotel, the American Red Cross and various
city agencies also struggled with how to care for roughly 200 of
the hotel's residents who had been evacuated to the top floor of
the Times Square Hotel, from which the crumpled construction
elevator tower could be seen a block away.
</P>
<P>
   During the evacuation Tuesday morning, many left their rooms
without taking the medicines they need to get through the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenants left without their medications,'' Ms. Dial said.
``Some of them don't have their eyeglasses. Some of them don't have
their teeth. It's been a very difficult day.''
</P>
<P>
   As of 10 p.m., medication was being delivered to the residents
and preparations were being made to move most of them to new
accommodations. The Times Square Hotel had agreed to house 24 hotel
residents; the McBurney YMCA said it would house 85 of them, while
rest would be housed at the Veterans Administration Hospital in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dial said that while local nonprofit groups contacted her to
offer their help, the developer of the Conde Nast building, the
Durst Organization, offered to pay for a number of hotel rooms only
after she contacted them and demanded help. The Durst Organization
did not respond to a call Tuesday night requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dial said that she had made the same request of Tishman
Realty &AMP; Construction, the construction manager for the Conde Nast
building.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman, said Tuesday night that
his firm was considering what it could do for the hotel residents.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Tuesday's accident had rendered the top
three floors of the hotel structurally unsound, and Ms. Dial said
the hotel would not reopen for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Stupp, commissioner of the city Department for the
Aging, said his agency runs a center in the hotel which serves
lunches and provides services for seniors. Stupp said the Woodstock
is one of 19 nonprofit single-room occupancy hotel's in the city
that serve primarily elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dial said that the Woodstock was built as a luxury hotel
between 1902 and 1906. At one point, baby alligators filled pools
in its second-floor ballroom, and Woodrow Wilson is said to have
had tea there. The building is so named, she said, because its
builder was from Woodstock, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   But the hotel declined as the Times Square area declined around
it. In 1975, the Find Group began to operate it, and it bought the
building for $1.1 million in 1979. The hotel underwent a $405,000
renovation in 1993, and, Ms. Dial says, with property values in the
area soaring, she now gets regular calls from real estate agents.
She said that she was not interested in selling and that her
primary concern was returning the residents to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this will hit them until tomorrow,'' she said.
``Many of them have lived there for years, and they're going to
lose that communal sense when they arrive in new places tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones, one of the survivors from the building's top floor,
said she was anxious to return home. ``I'm praying I'll be able to
go back soon,'' Ms. Jones said. ``I have no house besides where

TAXES SETTLED, FROST SIGNS WITH JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Wyo.)  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life is simpler in Wyoming, Scott Frost has discovered. In
Wyoming, for example, there is no state income tax. But there is in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' contract talks with Frost, their last unsigned draft
pick, had stalled over taxes and incentives. But the team came to
terms with him Tuesday night, and he will be on hand Wednesday when
training camp opens at Hofstra University.
</P>
<P>
   Frost is only a third-round pick, the 67th player drafted
overall, but he is one of the intriguing stories of the summer. The
Jets are trying to convert the former Nebraska quarterback to
strong safety, a position he last played four years ago, when he
was at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, players in the third round are simply slotted for
their salary, meaning they get a little less than the player
drafted before them and a little more than the one taken after.
</P>
<P>
   But Frost's agent, Craig Domann, had been trying to structure
the deal to minimize Frost's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What Domann discovered recently, he said Tuesday from his
offices outside Chicago, is that this year the Jets have changed
their policy in treating bonuses so that all their players pay New
York state taxes on bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Frost could not minimize state taxes on his six-figure
signing bonus, which he could have done if the Jets had allowed him
to declare it in Wyoming, where he lives. Instead, he will pay
about 7 percent in New York state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are believed to have changed their policy because they
regard a bonus as part of the overall compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   Domann said Frost had agreed to a three-year deal worth $1.1
million. He would not specify the signing bonus, but it is probably
in the $300,000 range. Thus, Frost will pay at least $21,000 in New
York state taxes on the bonus alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a little less in bonus to get more incentives,''
Domann said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the Jets changed their policy because of
the huge inordinate advance they gave Neil O'Donnell earlier this
year. He received more than $3.5 million as an advance on his 1998
salary, which was to be $4.25 million. Even though he has to return
that money, since the Jets cut him, he has earned about $500 a day
on the advance in a money-market account.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Frost wound up agreeing on the eve of camp opening,
closing the books on this year's rookie crop for the team's
contract negotiator, Mike Tannenbaum. He signed a league-high 12
draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   A Redesigned Offense
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have seven new starters on offense, but it will not be
especially difficult to integrate all the key elements at the start
of training camp, coach Bill Parcells says.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a new No. 1 quarterback in Glenn Foley, new
runners at halfback (Curtis Martin) and fullback (either Jerald
Sowell or Keith Byars), a newly designated full-time receiver in
Wayne Chrebet, and three new players on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offense shouldn't be a problem,'' Parcells said. ``Glenn Foley
knows what we're doing. I had Curtis Martin at New England, and I
had Keith Byars at New England. Wayne Chrebet was with us last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have more to do on defense. The new linemen are
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley contends he has been immediately comfortable with the new
center, Kevin Mawae, who was a significant off-season addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been great,'' Foley said. ``I think you'll find the
protection will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley Muscles Up
</P>
<P>
   Foley looks like the slender high school lad one has not seen
for a year, who then shows up looking like a weight lifter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put on 15 pounds,'' Foley said. ``I think it shows in the
muscle I get on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who weighs 225 pounds, came in at that weight last year.
But Bill Parcells then told him to lose 15 pounds. His latest
change was an important part of the off-season plans Parcells had
for him. Parcells is not reluctant to admit that he is worried that
Foley's two major injuries could signal that the quarterback's
durability is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both freak hits that just shouldn't have happened,
and that no one would have recovered from quickly,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   He sustained a shoulder separation in game 10 of the 1995 season
when he was tackled and fell awkwardly. It required surgery. Last
year, in game 11, after Foley had won the starter's job from Neil
O'Donnell, his cleat caught in a defender's jersey, he twisted his
knee and that injury ended his season.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the window of her room on the top floor of the
12-story Woodstock Hotel on 43rd St., Thereza Feliconio could look
out onto Bryant Park, the news zipper around 1 Times Square and the
dense collection of high-rise buildings east of Broadway. As
someone who had furnished her single room with care and kept it
immaculately clean, she must have appreciated the striking view.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a lovely, quiet woman who had decorated her room
herself with lots of nice furniture and knickknacks,'' said Cynthia
Dial, executive director of Project Find, which owns and operates
the 285-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning at 8:30, one of the many chunks of steel that
broke free from a construction site across the street crashed into
her room, No. 1202, burying Ms. Feliconio, 85, and all that she had
accumulated in her pink-accented room over the years in a shower of
plaster and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ground zero was the room Thereza Feliconio was in,'' Dial
said. ``Her room was reduced to rubble.'' It took rescue workers 20
minutes to dig through the rubble to recover her body, police said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Feliconio did not socialize with other
hotel residents _ none of the two dozen of the hotel's residents
questioned about her Tuesday could place her. Employees described
her as quiet and gracious, a woman of medium height who was careful
about her appearance but rarely left her room. ``Sometimes she'd go
out late at night,'' said an employee. ``But in the mornings she
always stayed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feliconio was from Brazil, said a hotel manager, who spoke
on the condition that his name not be used. It was not clear how
long she had been in the United States, but she applied for a
Social Security card in 1969. She had lived at the Woodstock, which
caters to the elderly poor, for about 10 years, according to
Department of Motor Vehicles records.
</P>
<P>
   Her sole visitor was a nephew who came at least three times a
month, said a social worker who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come on Sundays,'' the social worker said. ``He would
take her out to dinner and to movies and the theater. He was very
good to her.'' The nephew apparently was Ms. Feliconio's only
relative in the area, and he was distraught when he learned of her
death, the social worker said.

 &HT;    Maddux takes first loss to his former team
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- And to think the Cubs could have had both Greg Maddux
and Kerry Wood in the same rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Tuesday, at least for one night, the Cubs could
forget about their grievous error of letting Maddux go and watch
Wood put a headlock on the 'ol master.
</P>
<P>
   The result from the much anticipated matchup was all Wood and
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won 3-0 before 47,933 at Turner Field including 2,529
that paid to stand, sweeping the series as the Braves head on the
road for the next nine.
</P>
<P>
   But while Maddux and Wood were the story going in, what will be
remembered most is Braves manager Bobby Cox pulling center fielder
Andruw Jones with one out in the eighth inning. Jones had a
terrible night, running through a stop sign and watching a third
strike with the bases loaded. But what upset Cox the most came in
the eighth when Jones didn't hustle to catch a Lance Johnson soft
fly ball which dropped at his feet. Cox sent Gerald Williams in for
Jones, who then walked into the tunnel. Cox followed him.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, meanwhile, was awesome. He struck out 11 in 7 2/3 innings,
including eight of 10 in a stretch that started with two outs in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that inning that Wood showed why he may be the next
Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and Andruw Jones at the plate, the count
went to 3-2. Wood went to his out pitch and Jones had no chance,
watching a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jones hurt the Braves much worse the inning before
when with one out, he took off from second on a short Ozzie Guillen
single to center. Jones was given the stop sign by third base coach
Bobby Dews. But Jones ignored it as Johnson picked up the ball and
threw to the plate. Jones was out.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, meanwhile, wasn't at his best but wasn't bad either.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, he made a rare mistake by walking Scott Servais to
lead off the inning. Wood pushed Servias to second on a bunt and he
came home on a two-out single by Mickey Morandini. It was Maddux's
21st walk of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored two more in the fourth. Henry Rodriguez opened
with a second and former Brave Tyler Houston followed with a
double, leaving runners at second and third. Jose Hernandez then
ripped a ball to first, which Andres Galarraga was able to smother.
He got the out but Rodriguez scored and Houston would come home on
a safety squeeze by Jeff Blauser.
</P>
<P>
   It was Maddux's first loss to his former club.

BROOKS SHOOTING FOR BETTER SHOWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Brooks is headed back to the U.S. Senior Open
this week, and the 56-year-old Simi Valley golfer believes he is
better prepared this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm probably just more accurate now,'' said Brooks,
who qualified for the senior national championship at Colorado's
Cherry Hills Country Club in 1993, the first year he tried.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who started playing golf 36 years ago when he left the
Navy, has been trying to return to the Senior Open every summer
since '93.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded three weeks ago by shooting even-par 70 at Redlands
Country Club and then surviving a three-man playoff with two pros
to advance as an amateur to this week's 156-man final at Riviera
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief,'' said Brooks, who needed to make an 8-foot
putt to avoid elimination on the first of two playoff holes.
</P>
<P>
   A six-time club champion at Simi Hills Golf Club, the retired
Los Angeles policeman has been honing his game in recent years at
difficult Wood Ranch _ one of the most demanding courses in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known as the guy who can hit it in the fairways there,''
said Brooks, who has a best of 5-under-par 67 on that 6,972-yard
links-style layout.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small accomplishment at punishing Wood Ranch, which is
rated 2.4 strokes higher than its par of 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing here most definitely will help,'' said Wood Ranch
teaching pro Ron Lad. ``This course is set up pretty tough. We have
open-type conditions out here _ heavy rough, a lot of water, a lot
of the holes play into out-of-bounds. This is a good tuneup for any
major.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Brooks has two goals. He wants to last a little
longer than he did at Cherry Hills, where he shot 76-76 and missed
the cut by one stroke. And he wants to be sure to make the most of
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Brooks said. ``I met some really nice people
there last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Brooks shot 75 instead of 76 in the second round, he not
only would have made the cut but been paired with Arnold Palmer in
the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks might feel fortunate he came that close to making the cut
after what he went though on opening day _ when he was the first
player to tee off in the national senior championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous I was shaking,'' he said. ``I'm not used to
playing in front of a lot of people. I told my partner, `Just give
me the 3-wood and I'll bunt it out there.' I hit the fairway dead
center and I wasn't nervous the rest of the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who came from a baseball and tennis background, shot 94
with borrowed clubs and tennis shoes the first time he played in
1963 and has shot over 100 just twice in nearly four decades since.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable moments include winning the L.A. Senior Open the first
year he was eligible, winning this year's Ventura Senior
Championship and twice shooting 63 _ one shy of the course record _
at Simi Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just so consistent,'' said Simi Hills teaching pro Brian
Mahoney. ``He's not the kind of guy who's going to take a huge
chance and get himself in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of course management could serve Brooks well this
week, when the U.S. Golf Association will have Riviera set up as
tough as possible for its national senior championship.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will show up with a game sharpened on a similarly tough
course, with plenty of film and family and with some valuable
experience gained at Cherry Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that I know these are great players, but I think I
can compete with them,'' he said.

COURT HOLDS MAN WHO WON'T TESTIFY ON HAMAS FUNDRAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After an unusual closed court hearing, a federal
appeals panel in Manhattan has refused to release a man who has
been jailed for five months for declining to testify before a grand
jury investigating fund-raising in the United States by the
militant Islamic group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Abdelhaleem Ashqar, 39, said by telephone Tuesday from
a prison ward in Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla,
N.Y., that despite the court's decision, he would not testify, nor
would he end a hunger strike that has dropped his weight 50 pounds,
to 126, in five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not change my mind,'' Ashqar said. ``I thought it was
clear to the court from the first day, the 23rd of February, that
I'd rather die than testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashqar, who was living in Alexandria, Va., and is in the United
States on a student visa, was ruled in contempt by Judge Denise
Cote of federal district court in Manhattan for refusing to answer
federal prosecutors' questions about several Palestinians in the
United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Palestinians is Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, the Hamas
political leader who was jailed in New York during an extradition
battle with Israel before he was turned over to Jordan last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ashqar said he believed that the attempt to force him to testify
was simply governmental harassment directed at him and at
Palestinians in general because of religious and political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation of Islamic groups' financing and their
relationship to Middle East terrorism a second man has been jailed
for contempt. Ismail Elbarasse was jailed in April by a different
federal district judge, Michael Mukasey, for refusing to testify in
the case. Elbarasse's lawyer, Stanley Cohen, said his client had
not sought his release but would do so later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ashqar's lawyers asked Judge Cote to release him last month,
asserting that continued imprisonment would not change his mind
about testifying. They also cited his health.
</P>
<P>
   After a doctor reported that Ashqar's health had deteriorated
significantly as a result of his hunger strike, Judge Cote held an
emergency hearing in June and ordered that Ashqar be force fed.
Most recently, he has been fed with a tube inserted through his
nasal passage.
</P>
<P>
   The feeding decision was also upheld in the closed hearing by
the three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-page opinion made public Thursday, the judges, Jose
Cabranes, Barbara Jones and Thomas Reavley, held that Judge Cote
had weighed the matter ``in a careful and balanced way.''
</P>
<P>
   The contempt findings against Ashqar and Elbarasse are civil
charges, which courts traditionally use to compel testimony from
reluctant witnesses. Under the law, Judge Cote had to determine
whether there remained ``a realistic possibility that continued
confinement'' might cause Ashqar to testify, the appeals court
panel said. The legal burden was on Ashqar to prove that no such
possibility existed, it added.
</P>
<P>
   The panel asked that Judge Cote ``remain in close contact with
the developing situation'' and continue to assess the likelihood
that ``continued confinement might cause him to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashqar is referred to as John Doe in the panel's opinion because
of the secrecy of grand jury matters. In addition to holding a
closed session, the panel also sealed the legal papers filed by
each side. Only the court's final opinion was released.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan had no
comment on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ashqar was considering his options, said his lawyer, Michael
Kennedy, including whether to make another request that Judge Cote
release him.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Judge Cote and the appeals panel showed ``a
disturbing lack of humanity and appreciation of the resolve and
commitment'' in Ashqar's refusal to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Ashqar has received support in the case from a coalition of
legal and political advocacy groups that have filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on his behalf. A lawyer for the
coalition, Nancy Chang of the Center for Constitutional Rights,
said that on humanitarian grounds alone, he should be released.

SENIOR OPEN A TOUGH SELL IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oh, to be in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Senior PGA Tour claims it is in the picture
of health, it nervously prepares to stage its premier championship
in Los Angeles, a region legendary for its indifference to major
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling in corporate money for the U.S. Senior Open, which
begins Thursday at Riviera Country Club, ``definitely was a
challenge in this market,'' admitted championship director Bill
Knight. ``But we're happy where we ended up. I think it will allow
us to have a good showing financially, but we need a good showing
at the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks before the first drives were teed up, ticket
sales were sluggish, ``a little over halfway to where we need to be
(to be profitable),'' Knight said. He added: ``But we know this is
a late-buying market. We expect a lot of walk-up sales. If we were
in any other market, I would be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Another market like . . . Iowa?
</P>
<P>
   Next year's U.S. Senior Open will be held in Des Moines and the
anticipation there is so acute that nearly 60 hospitality tents
have been reserved at $60,000 per, said Tim Crosby, vice president
of tournament business affairs for the PGA Tour. By contrast, said
Knight, there will be 15 tents this year at Riviera, accommodating
22 corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will argue it is struggling in Los Angeles, and I think
it might be,'' said Crosby. ``L.A. is a difficult market. There's a
lot of stuff to do. . . . My fear is some people are going to draw
inferences if the tournament is not a tremendous success.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior tour probably shouldn't take it personally. More
likely, it's just another example of sports fans being blase in
L.A.

JURY HEARS FORMER CADET'S CONFESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS _ The fathers of Adrianne Jones and David Graham
leaned forward simultaneously Tuesday morning _ elbows on their
knees _ as a military investigator read Graham's confession
describing Jones' beating and shooting death.
</P>
<P>
   The 41/2-page typed statement recounts in detail how the former
Air Force Academy cadet and his one-time fiancee, Diane Zamora,
plotted and carried out Jones' slaying on Dec. 4, 1995. The reason:
Graham had ``tainted'' their ``perfect and pure'' love by claiming
to have had sex with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request of Adrianne's life was not for a second taken
lightly by me,'' Graham wrote in the confession. ``I couldn't even
believe she would ask that of me. ... I didn't have any harsh
feelings for Adrianne, but no one could stand between me and
Diane.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Zamora are expected to see each other for the first
time in about a year during a hearing Wednesday on whether Zamora _
already serving a life sentence for her role in the slaying _ can
be forced to testify as a defense witness. The couple, who at one
time had planned to marry after each graduated from prestigious
military academies, last saw each other during a hearing to sever
their criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a request for immunity by prosecutors, Zamora's
attorney, John Linebarger, said he will argue that Zamora should
not be required to testify because of a constitutional amendment
that protects against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's testimony has been requested by Graham's attorney Dan
Cogdell, who said he wants to point out discrepancies between
Zamora's written statements about the slaying and her testimony in
her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Separated by six spectators on the courtroom's front row, the
fathers of the victim and the defendant looked ahead and showed no
visible reaction as the confession was read by Air Force special
agent Roy Stalvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that short instant, I knew I couldn't leave the key witness
to our crime alive,'' Graham wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stalvey also testified that Graham played ``guessing games''
with investigators seeking information about what was used to
strike Jones on the head before she was killed. Stalvey said Graham
initially refused to reveal the type of object used because he
thought it was the only evidence linking him to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Stalvey said Graham rocked in a chair with his hands behind his
head as the investigators guessed, ``chuckling'' when they guessed
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say `You'll never guess it, it's really dumb,'' Stalvey
said, adding that Graham later told the officers that the object
was a dumbbell weight.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's attorneys have argued that Zamora alone killed Jones in
a jealous rage and that Graham only helped cover up for Zamora.
Under cross-examination for nearly four hours, Cogdell questioned
Stalvey about differences between Graham's statement and accounts
by investigators about how Jones was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although a forensic investigator testified earlier that Jones
was shot twice in the head from distances of less than 18 inches,
Graham wrote in his statement that he was running around like a
``headless chicken'' and ``just pointed and shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell argued that investigators informed Graham of his rights
after he had typed the confession. The Houston attorney also
shouted in the courtroom, trying to demonstrate how an Air Force
investigator threatened to have a Grand Prairie detective thrown
off the Air Force base after the detective threatened Graham with
the death penalty unless he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 20, faces life in prison if convicted of capital murder.
His trial was moved out of Tarrant County because of concern that
publicity from Zamora's trial in February would hinder jury
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish said he could wrap up
his case against Graham by the end of Wednesday. At least one more
witness _ a friend of Graham _ is expected to testify that Graham
and Zamora visited his Burleson home after the slaying and Graham
swore him to secrecy before the couple cleaned up and borrowed
clothing. Over five days of testimony, prosecutors have presented
26 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If Tarrant County District Judge Don Leonard rules that Zamora
must testify, Cogdell said the Crowley High School graduate will be
his first defense witness.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is intended to be a towering symbol of the rebirth
of Times Square, but the mirrored Conde Nast building under
construction at Broadway and 42nd Street has so far drawn attention
mostly because of its spectacular accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of an elevator support tower Tuesday, which killed
an elderly woman, was the third major incident at the site, and it
came less than a month after a carpenter working near the support
tower was crushed to death by a construction elevator cab. In
January, a crane arm six stories above the street buckled and fell
onto a building across 43rd Street, shattering part of that
building's glass facade.
</P>
<P>
   But while city officials called the accident Tuesday the most
serious in more than a decade in the New York construction
industry, they said that the contractors working on the Conde Nast
building have had a comparatively good safety record since
excavation for the 48-story tower began a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Construction, the company that oversees the project, has
been cited for two construction-related violations by the city's
Building Department, neither of which concerned the elevator system
or appeared to be major. Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the
Buildings Department, said a separate inspection team that
concentrates on work-site safety procedures had given the company
one violation, for ``poor housekeeping,'' which means that objects
that could be swept off high floors by wind were not properly
secured.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the contractor responsible for building
the elevator tower and scaffold, Universal Builders Supply of Mount
Vernon, N.Y., had been issued no violations on the project. The
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has
also inspected the site, is investigating the June 26 death of the
carpenter, who worked for Universal.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials emphasized that Universal had performed well
on high-profile jobs. In the early 1980s, the company won the
contract for the scaffolding that encased the Statue of Liberty for
two years during its facelift, and more recently, it erected the
scaffolding for the interior restoration of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this many accidents at one building is unusual,'' said
Gaston Silva, the buildings commissioner. ``On the other hand
they're not connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are first-class builders,'' he added. ``They're not
fly-by-night.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurances gave little comfort to shaken workers in the
office buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Valencia, a textiles salesman who works at 1500
Broadway, on the northeast corner of 43rd Street, witnessed both
the collapsing crane and Tuesday's accident from his 14th floor
office window. And last week, he said he was also nearly struck by
10-foot lengths of wood that blew off the building site.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were accidents waiting to happen,'' he said angrily
Tuesday. ``They're all trying to get ready for the year 2000, and
they want to finish the building as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, skyscrapers do go up faster in New York than anywhere
else in the world, according to construction executives. And
overall, it is also one of the most dangerous industries in which
to work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 23 workers
were killed at construction sites in New York City in 1996, the
most recent year available. Recently, OSHA has focused particular
attention in New York City on safety violations relating to falls
of workers and construction materials plummeting from buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past, both Tishman and Universal Builders have been cited
by OSHA for what it considers serious worker-safety violations,
though the agency's assistant regional administrator, Gill Gillen,
said the companies are ``not really out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   During a project at the Atlantic City convention center in 1996,
Universal was given two violations and assessed $1,800 in fines.
Two years earlier, Tishman was cited for five violations at a
project on Washington Street in the West Village and fined $10,750.
The nature of the violations for both companies was unclear
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition for the 48-story Conde Nast building at 4 Times
Square began in August 1996, and construction moved along faster
than anyone expected; at one point during the building of the steel
skeleton, workers added one floor a week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the construction managers have to turn to the daunting task
of dismantling the damaged scaffolding. Officials said that taking
apart the structure will be more complicated than originally
thought, with one official saying it could take three weeks or
longer.

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Under a hot midday sun Tuesday, Brooks Johnson
watched intently as Chryste Gaines and Angela Vaughn practiced
their exchange for the 4x100-meter relay. The first time Vaughn
left too early; the second time they hit the exchange just right,
and Johnson shouted: ``Perfect! Perfect!'' They tried it again,
they hit it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' said Johnson, coach of the U.S. women's relay team
in the Goodwill Games. ``I can live with that, ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion on the scene of Marion Jones, as well as the
presence of Vaughn, Gaines and others, women's sprinting is strong
and deep in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who coached at Stanford, was a two-time Olympic coach
and now works at Disney sports complex in Orlando, Fla., was more
defensive when the conversation swung to American men. In the 1996
Atlanta Olympics, in an event the United States has dominated like
few others, the 4x100-meter relay team had the audacity to win just
a silver medal, losing to Canada. And the 100-meter gold medal
winner and world-record holder, Donovan Bailey, is from Canada. But
nothing is wrong with United States sprinting, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this country still producing the best American sprinters?''
he asked. ``The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they home-grown? The answer is no. The U.S. coaching system
still attracts and trains some of the world's best sprinters;
increasing numbers of those sprinters are not born in the United
States. Ato Boldon, the bronze medalist at 100 and 200 meters in
Atlanta, is from Trinidad, though he attended high school and
college in the United States. Bailey has trained at the University
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There are some up-and-coming home-grown sprinters; the foremost
among them, Maurice Greene, won the Goodwill Games 100 meters
Tuesday night in 9.96 seconds, ahead of Boldon and another United
States runner, Brian Lewis. And Greene noted that United States
runners also finished first and third at the world championships
last year. ``They say American sprinters are not stepping up to the
plate,'' Greene said. ``This shows that we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson conceded that there has been a decline in the number
of native-born U.S. sprinters. ``Some are doing rap, some are doing
time, some are playing other sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sprinting in general _ whether the runners train here and go
back home, or are born here _ is vibrant. The real blind spot in
American track and field, the reason for worry, is not that runners
aren't running fast _ it's that American runners aren't running
long.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hand-wringing over the relay silver and the retirement
of Carl Lewis, distance running has quietly been conceded to the
rest of the world. American distance running is a wilderness filled
with apologies and no demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have 10 percent of the population being counted on to
win 90 percent of the track and field medals,'' Johnson said of the
overburdened sprinters. ``We get second place in the relay and it's
a disaster. Meanwhile, no one notices that from 800 meters up,
we're not winning anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10,000 meters Tuesday, one U.S. runner, Daniel Browne,
finished fifth; Kenyan runners won gold, silver and bronze. In some
quarters, the reaction to the demise of American distance running,
and the African rise, has been to place quotas on foreign runners
in some road races, though those efforts were mostly abandoned in
the face of protests. Johnson said the result has been continued
great expectations for world-class United States sprinters, and low
expectations and plenty of excuses for distance runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put some demands on middle- and long-distance
runners,'' he said. ``We expect a 17-year-old gymnast who injured
her foot to jump and win a gold medal. We don't demand that a
1,500-meter runner finish a race because he has an ingrown
toenail.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sighed, gathered his attache case and prepared to leave.
He repeated that sprinting is neither the problem nor the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American system of sprinting is better, whoever wins the
medal,'' he said. He also scoffed at the notion that track and
field in this nation is dying, saying there are 1.1 million high
schools athletes and 2.2 million junior high athletes participating
in the sport. And there were more than 9,700 people in attendance
Tuesday night. ``What's dead?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to raise the level of the bar across the board.
The sport's illness is its great imbalance: a great emphasis on the
swift and fast, no so much on the long haul.''

   NEW YORK _ ``I crawl over these things like a spider,'' David
Frieder was saying in his Gatling-gun staccato.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a perfect self-description. Know any eight-leggers
who lug along a $3,000 camera, a $4,000 gyroscope stabilizer and
the dream of being remembered as the Ansel Adams of New York City
bridges?
</P>
<P>
   For the things Frieder crawls over are cables and piers that
have unobstructed views of just about everything. Of course,
Frieder is more likely to talk about the beauty of the rust on the
main floor beams than the beauty of the larger cityscape. He is a
bridge guy. He does not see the urban forest for the big steel
trees planted in the water.
</P>
<P>
   To New Yorkers who pigeonhole bridges into the same
headache-tainted category as lost time, long lines and driver's
seat contortions _ all that fumbling for toll money _ Adams'
bridge-free landscapes of the wide open West may seem calming.
Frieder is anything but. He is a person of missionary intensity and
odd facts. He has climbed 12 bridges so far. He still has a few to
go: New York City owns 750 bridges, from the Brooklyn and the
Williamsburg to the 96th Street overpass on the West Side Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Odd Fact No. 1: Every city bridge has a bridge identification
number. Odd Fact No. 2: Though he has immersed himself in bridge
facts _ bridge trivia to some _ Frieder does not remember the
identification numbers of the bridges he has photographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can rattle off statistics,'' Frieder said with
uncharacteristic understatement. ``The Verrazano is 60 feet longer
than the Golden Gate and the longest suspension bridge in the
United States,'' he said. ``Some people will start arguing, that's
between towers; the Mackinac Bridge, in Michigan, has the longest
distance of span, which includes the side spans.''
</P>
<P>
   He segues into a pronunciation lesson (it's MACK-uh-naw), and
then on to history. ``The man who built the Mackinac, David
Steinman, built the Henry Hudson Bridge. It was originally built
with one roadway. A year and a half later, he built the upper
roadway. He was also responsible for the Brooklyn Bridge in 1948,
the year they removed the trolley tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Frieder takes it for granted that anyone who has ever heard a
radio traffic report will know that the GWB, a k a ``the George,''
is the George Washington Bridge. ``I still call it the Hudson River
Bridge,'' he said. ``It was supposed to be encased in stone and
masonry by Cass Gilbert, who did the Woolworth Building. But it was
the Depression. They left the stone work off and saved a million
dollars. And I like the beauty of the steelwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Frieder, 44, has loved it most of his life. He lived in Queens
until he was 7, then moved to New Jersey. ``My father was the
manager of my uncle's dry-cleaning business,'' he said. ``To get to
the city meant crossing the great GWB. Back then, there was no
lower roadway. I looked at the suspender ropes. They look like X's.
I was in awe. Then they started building the lower roadway. I was
in awe again. They raised it from the river and hooked it in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but he is off on engineering. The GWB is a
``stiffened bridge,'' while the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has a
flexible tower. ``On the Verrazano, the center of the roadway
changes 12 feet from winter to summer,'' he said. ``Each three-foot
cable on the GW can withstand the pull of 180 million pounds. Each
one contains 26,474 wires, each 5 millimeters in diameter, divided
into 61 strands of 434 each.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused to double-check the numbers. ``I stink in math,'' he
said. ``That's why I could never be an engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not a full-time photographer, either; he repairs medical
X-ray machines for a living, though his photographs have been
exhibited in Manhattan and at the Transit Museum in Brooklyn.
Bridges are a relatively recent calling. Until 1992, he was a true
Adams disciple, focusing, literally, on trees in New Jersey
forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then John Sexton, who was Ansel Adams' personal assistant,
went up on top of the Golden Gate Bridge,'' Frieder said. ``Then
Ron Wisner, who makes big wooden cameras, went up there. Then the
light bulb turned on in my head. Where are there more bridges than
anywhere? Right here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He started with a sheet-film camera on a tripod, Weegee style,
looking at backward images under a little curtain. But there was a
problem. ``Bridges vibrate, and the vibrations are transmitted
right through the tripod,'' he said. He switched to a Hasselblad
that takes two-and-a-quarter-inch film. The gyroscope came next.
That got rid of the shakes, rattles and rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he won over the bridges' guardians: the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority and the New York City Department of
Transportation. ``The red tape, the begging, the pleading, the
letters, the phone calls.'' The city turned out to be the most
demanding: besides insurance and a waiver, it required a permit.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves it to lawsuit-wary bureaucrats to worry about the
possibility of his falling off. ``Heights don't mean anything,'' he
said, launching into an explanation of how he walks along bars on
the Queensboro that are only one and a half inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to straddle them,'' he said. ``I did gymnastics for
20 years. I got second places in high school. Fate preparing me.''

   Road not taken &QL; 
bedeviling to Kile
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REGRETS. Life's ifs-and-buts, squirrels-and-nuts department.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know regret, don't we? Rarely do we make any decision
that's fully hindsight-proof, whether it involves selecting a shirt
or a spouse. The second-guess is inherently human, an inalienable
right of our wretched existence.
</P>
<P>
   Paper or plastic? Cripes, like how are we supposed to know, I
mean really know? We can't.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile had a number of reasons for wanting to leave the
Astros for the Rockies. More money. Bigger crowds. Cool stadium.
Cooler nights. Sunsets over the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Good reasons, those. But in picking Denver over Houston, he made
a mistake, and surely realizes as much today, his lack of candor on
the subject notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio had the opportunity to make the same choice a
couple years earlier. But he picked Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet of the two, Biggio is the one who should have gone. When he
was trying to make up his mind, the Astros hadn't yet won anything
behind him, fan interest was an oxymoron, there was no guarantee of
a stadium gracing the downtown skyline and Drayton McLane's new
best friends all lived in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Coors Field is a pretty good place for a man whose job it
is to hit baseballs where they ain't. And the Rockies seemed a
young team on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions, decisions
</P>
<P>
   But something told Biggio he must stay.
</P>
<P>
   Just as something told Kile he should go.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, money entered into all of this. The Rockies didn't
open the vault all the way for Biggio, wrongly assuming he had a
manic desire to flee the dead zone of the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the Astros didn't go as far as they could have with
Kile, wrongly assuming he wouldn't be foolhardy enough to test his
sink-or-swim curveball in the Rockies' pitcher-unfriendly environs.
Gerry Hunsicker, the GM, starts spitting and sputtering when you
suggest that to him, but who among us can say for certain exactly
what was offered or, more important, when it was offered?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter anymore. Kile accepted the Rockies' largess of
$24 million over three seasons, numbers that are impossible to
regret. He didn't give the Astros a chance to respond, and off he
went into the thin air, a 19-game winner abandoning a division
champion's locker room in pursuit of what logically figured to be
an elusive Rocky Mountain high.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been forthcoming. He's 6-12 with a 5.26 ERA for a team
that's 16 games under .500. His wife is very happy, and his
accountant is deliriously happy, but can Darryl truly be satisfied
en route to, feasibly, a 20-defeat season? While he has pitched
better than his numbers imply, and his new fans have shown unusual
patience with his travails, it's generally results that put a
smile, or a frown, on a man's mug.
</P>
<P>
   Were D.K. still an Astro, imagine where the Astros might be.
They've been shockingly good without him, although Derek Bell
(.332, 70 RBIs) has contributed much to the maintaining of a
four-game lead over the Cubs, and he couldn't have stayed if Kile
had. McLane's pockets weren't deep enough for the both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Busting the budget
</P>
<P>
   As it is, McLane breaks into a cold sweat when somebody mentions
the Astros' almost $40 million payroll. With Kile and Bell, they
would be in the shadow of $50 million, a number that causes McLane
to lose the color in his face and start to shake.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to say what kind of clout the Astros' lineup
would pack without Bell, who tends to produce in wildly erratic
fits and spurts. It's safe to say, however, that without Biggio at
the top, lighting the home fires, the Astros would be more smoke
than heat.
</P>
<P>
   Not that much burned Tuesday night. Mark Brownson, having a
night Kile would have killed for back here in his old haunts,
delivered a memorable major-league debut, no-hitting the Astros for
five innings on the way to a 5-0, four-hit shutout.
</P>
<P>
   But such punchless games have been few and far between for
Biggio, who has participated in 423 of a possible 423 since he
reupped with the Astros on his 30th birthday. He's also 3-for-3
starting All-Star Games _ for four in a row total _ and he has
scored 337 runs while batting .303.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he could have done even more damage in Denver, but
you wonder how. And as a Rockie, Biggio would now be approaching
two seasons removed from the postseason, instead of being hellbent
upon making a regular habit of winning the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Once a rat embracing a sinking ship, he appeared almost
magnanimous in his decision to stay, but today it just looks as
smart and farsighted as Kile's looks, regrettably, dumb and
shortsighted.

   NEW YORK _ A few weeks ago, a group of Hasidic rabbis issued a
press release announcing plans to ``invoke a biblical curse on any
city official'' who dared to support a bill that benefited gay and
lesbian couples in New York City. The time: noon. The place: where
else but on the steps of City Hall?
</P>
<P>
   True to their word, several rabbis arrived a few minutes before
the appointed hour, their leader toting his shofar and Bible in a
plastic bag. They took their positions on the steps, performed
their ceremony, then fielded reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder of the moment was not so much the rabbis' novel
concept of government reform as it was the prevailing sense that
this was merely a run-of-the-mill protest on the steps of City
Hall. In New York, if you want to demonstrate, announce your
candidacy or merely invoke a biblical curse _ and be assured of
being noticed _ there truly is no other place to go.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two centuries, these 11 steps have served
as the American equivalent of London's Hyde Park or the agoras of
ancient Greece, a place where all can go to exercise their
constitutional right to vent. And when that is challenged, the
response is visceral and relentless _ as the Giuliani
administration has recently learned.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took office in January
1994, his Police Department issued guidelines that limited to 25
the number of people allowed to gather on City Hall's steps. A
departmental memorandum cited security reasons, and claimed it was
formalizing a 20-year-old practice. If so, it was a practice often
ignored _ indeed mostly unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of politicians and advocates _ united, perhaps, only
in being perceived by the administration as enemies _ began to
challenge the arbitrarily chosen number of 25, and to say they had
detected uneven enforcement. Why was it all right for Young
Republicans to gather, but not the supporters of state Comptroller
H. Carl McCall (a Democrat)? Why were people promoting something
called National Smile Week allowed to assemble, but not advocates
for people with AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   A sense of common ownership, rooted in history, helped to spur
their outrage. Riots have taken place here, including one between
the city's two competing police departments in 1857. People have
come here to mourn; tens of thousands waited on these steps for the
chance to walk past the body of the just-assassinated president,
Abraham Lincoln, under the rotunda inside. And just about every
day, someone has come to the steps to tout a success or bemoan a
wrong _ from the mayor promising a new era on Inauguration Day to
the man protesting taxes by carrying a live monkey on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those steps are America,'' said George Arzt, who as a reporter
and publicist has spent most of his adulthood in and around City
Hall. ``It's advocacy, it's protest, it's great events, and it's
death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Civil Liberties Union and Housing Works, an
AIDS advocacy group, harbor a more practical perception of City
Hall as the place where city officials are most likely to witness
the wrath of angry constituents. After being denied a permit for a
gathering of 50 people, Housing Works challenged the 25-person rule
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Judge Harold Baer Jr. was pondering the case,
Giuliani was publicly defending the 25-person limit. ``The fact is,
City Hall could, like most other major buildings, be cut off to all
forms of gathering on the steps,'' he said, not acknowledging the
symbolic weight of those 11 steps outside his office.
</P>
<P>
   But when Baer ruled this week that 50 Housing Works supporters
could protest on the steps _ because the city's policy was unclear
and open to abuse _ the mayor agreed that clarification was needed.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have promised to refine the policy, but they
should not dally. Tuesday night, a group called the Keep the
Yankees in the Bronx Committee announced intentions to gather
Wednesday at _ where else?
