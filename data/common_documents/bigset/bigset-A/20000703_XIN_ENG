JERUSALEM -- Israel is considering transferring about 1,000
former Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen and their
family members to other countries, a Interior Ministry official
disclosed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of such ex-SLA militiamen wanting to move abroad
will be flown to Germany next week if all bureaucratic procedures
are smooth as expected, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also conducting intensive talks with other countries,
mostly in North and South America, to persuade them to absorb some
SLA refugees.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 SLA militiamen and their family members have been
taking shelter in Israel since May after their army collapsed under
pressure of Lebanese resistance guerrillas, and Israel withdrew
from the so-called security zone in south Lebanon later. (Israel-

<HEADLINE> France Takes Title of Euro 2000 with Golden Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ROTTERDAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- David Trezeguet scored the "
golden goal" to gave France a strong comback victory over Italy on
Sunday when the world champion also won the European championship.
</P>
<P>
France's Sylvain Wiltord grabbed a dramatic last minute
equalizer for France in the the fourth minute of injury time,
another substitute David Trezeguet volleyed the winner home in the
103rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Italy went ahead in the 56th minute when Gianluca Pessotto
curled a low cross into the area and Delvecchio stabbed it home
with the inside of his left foot high into the nets and outside
Fabien Barthez' reach.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 European Championship was also decided on a golden
goal when Germany beat the Czech Republic 2-1.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in a row that France came back from a
goal down. It also beat Spain and Portugal by the same score in
the quarter- and semifinals.
</P>
<P>
When all seemed lost, Wiltord finally found a hole in the
ironclad Italian defense and beat Francesco Toldo with a low
angled shot.
</P>
<P>
With France pushing ever harder, Robert Pires broke on the
left and passed low into the path of Trezeguet, who volleyed high
into the net from 10 meters out.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought we were dead," said Thierry Henry. "With
the French team, it is never over."
</P>
<P>
France thus became the first nation to win a European
championship title as a world champion.
</P>
<P>
Didier Deschamps, in his 101st international appearance held
the trophy aloft wildly cheered on by some 10,000 French fans,
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
in the sellout crowd of 48,000 at De Kuip.
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Dino Zoff had been a minute away from becoming
the first man to win the European championship both as coach and
player when Wiltord equalized.
</P>
<P>
With Italy leading in regulation time, substitute Alessandro
Del Piero should have put the game away twice but first he was off
target and in the 84th minute, Barthez did well to cover the shot.
</P>
<P>
From the first minute, the final was spectacular. Thierry
Henry already showed off his speed, outpacing Mark Iuliano and
sending a dangerous cross into the center, where no Frenchman was
able to pick it up. Henry would trouble the Italian defense with
his pace all through the final.
</P>
<P>
Italy responded, sending Delvecchio deep and forcing Barthez
to scurry out of his box and clear.
</P>
<P>
In the 5th minute, Henry surprised everyone hooking a volley
from a narrow angle from 14 meters out and Toldo was lucky to see
it bounce off the near post.
</P>
<P>
The seesaw battle continued and three minutes later, Stefano
Fiore exposed the flank of Bixente Lizarazu and floated a cross
into the middle but Delvecchio came centimeters short to connect
and volley from close range.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Henry continued to dumbfound the Italian
defense with his lightning speed. From the left side, he rolled up
the defense in the 50th minute but unfortunately no one was there
when his pass rolled unchallenged into the goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
Zoff brought in Del Piero in the 53rd minute and suddenly
Italy three players on the pitch with a nose for goal, together
with Francesco Totti and Delvecchio.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came only minutes later.
</P>
<P>
From then on, Italians could rely on the counter and they
relished it.
</P>
<P>
At the back, the defense proved as fullproof as expected with
Alessandro Nesta and Cannavaro giving true leadership.
</P>
<P>
After the goal, things got rougher and Lilian Thuram got
France's first yellow card for a tackle on Totti.
</P>
<P>
Wiltord shot straight at Toldo in the 62nd minute when an
unmarked Djorkaeff shoot begging for the ball in front of goal.
Wiltord was luckier in the 93rd minute.
</P>
<P>
In extra time, France took the early initiative and when
Robert Pires drilled a ball straight at Toldo and when David
Trezeguet followed up for the rebound, he kicked the Italian
goalie a bloody noze.
</P>
<P>
"The French were stronger tonight. I feel very bad. We had a
lot of opportunities to score and you can't say we didn't put up a
fight," Italian coach Dino Zoff said. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Paris Celebrates France's Victory in Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Paris exploded with a chorus of
hollers, honks and whoops Sunday night as the French took to the
streets in a frenzied celebration after the 2-1 triumph of their
team over Italy in the Euro 2000 soccer final, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight on the Champs-Elysees, where the crowds of
joyous revelers brought to mind the massive national pride that
turned Paris into a giant street party two years ago, when France
beat Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of ecstatic fans, some waving French flags,
instantly crowded onto Paris' most famous avenue to mark the
victory, made possible only by a last-minute goal to tie the game
1-1 and put it into overtime when the French finally came out in
front 2-1.
</P>
<P>
All along the Champs-Elysees, people crowded at apartment
windows and on balconies to watch the show below.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't watch the game because I was too afraid,"
Stephanie Rey, a 25-year-old Parisian who was wearing a World Cup
t-shirt from 1998, was quoted as saying. "We just walked through
the streets. Now my heart is beating very fast."
</P>
<P>
Jean-Jacques Jemba-Lobe stopped jumping up and down for a
moment to hold up a photograph of his 4-year-old son and grin with
pride.
</P>
<P>
During the game, riot police kept coming over to people with a
radio to listen. When a bus of Welsh children passed through the
Champs, a boy gestured at passersby, asking the score. People
crowded up to the bus to wave and convey the good news: France had
just scored.
</P>
<P>
North of the Arc de Triomphe, a car sped through an
intersection with two Algerian flags sticking out of the window in
honor of French superstar Zinedine Zidane, who is of Algerian
origin. Traffic had been banned on the Champs Elysees itself as a
security precaution.
</P>
<P>
Before the match, most French had confidence that their adored
team, "les Bleus," or the Blues, would come away victorious.
Ninety percent of French people were expecting victory, according
to a poll by the Ifop agency, published in Sunday Le Journal du
Dimanche newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Both French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin attended the match in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, I am proud for France and I am proud for the French,
" Chirac said on live television on France's TF1 channel after the
game. "The French team has kept its genius."
</P>
<P>
Jospin called the victory a great "joy" following the World
Cup victory. "This team deserved to win," Jospin said.

<HEADLINE> Lemerre Says His Team's Win on Attacking Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ROTTERDAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Roger Lemerre, coach of France,
said his team's 2-1 triumph over Italy in the Euro 2000 final on
Sunday was a victory for attacking soccer.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a victory for attacking football. I am not going
to hide that," Lemerre said. "We have young players who are
quality players ... I picked them and I am happy that they won the
title for us.
</P>
<P>
"But Italy, offering another kind of football, went very close
to being successful. They also played attacking football."
</P>
<P>
Substitute David Trezeguet clinched the victory with the "
Golden Goal" after the French had scored a dramatic equaliser from
another substitute Sylvain Wiltord just seconds from the end of
normal time.
</P>
<P>
"The miracle happened. We managed to bring it about," Lemerre
said.
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Dino Zoff was philosophical in defeat, saying "I
feel very bad. This is an important event in my life and it's a
defeat," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The French were stronger tonight. We also had quite a lot of
opportunities to score. We lost in extra time but you can't say we
didn't put up a fight."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Italians were the moral champions, the former
Italian goalkeeper said: "It's the reality that counts. Some
matches can go the full 120 minutes and be affected by a small
matter of luck. It's the nature of the game.
</P>
<P>
"It was great that the Italians could put up a fight against
anyone."

<HEADLINE> Next Five-Year Economic Blueprint Vital for Turkey: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Develet

Bahceli said on Monday that the eighth five-year development plan "
is vital" for Turkey to display its economic growth potential in
the coming years, Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bahceli said at a press briefing that the plan, which was
approved by the parliament last week, aims to reach an average 7
percent economic growth over 2001 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
Through the long-term strategy, Turkey plans to increase its
gross national product to 1.9 trillion dollars by 2023, and thereby
rank among the top ten economies of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will swiftly put in effect a national program that will
accelerate its membership for the EU," Bahceli said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey's exports are projected to reach 48.8
billion dollars and imports 77.4 billion by 2005 under the plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan gives priorities to structural reforms in
agriculture, social security, public finance management and banking
as well as macro-economic stability, namely, dropping inflation
that will be in chime with the EU criteria.
</P>
<P>
If these policies and reforms foreseen in the plan are carried
out, macro-economic stability, imperative for the long-term
development targets, will be sustained, Bahceli said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country will increase investments in education,
health, technology, infrastructure, energy, irrigation as well as
regional development.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Cease-Fire Must Be Multilateral: Attorney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's General Attorney Jaime
Bernal said Monday cease-fire must be multilateral so that in this
way, guerrillas as well as the government understand it's a
question of serious commitment.
</P>
<P>
According to the general attorney, proposals to arrive at an
end to hostilities, in the midst of the country's general
expectation, "must be daring even if they will cause controversy."
</P>
<P>
The attorney's statements came at a time when the government
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) begin
discussions concerning a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Both parties' statements will be presented at the negotiation
table in San Vicente del Caguan town, in dissension area of
national territory's south.
</P>
<P>
With the debate on a possible accord to cease hostilities, a
new phase of peace talks between the government and the FARC, the
country's most important and oldest guerrilla group, is being
established.
</P>
<P>
The FARC and the government are scheduled to swap proposals
Monday for the first bilateral cease-fire in 16 years in Colombia'
s long-running war.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is likely to make its cease-fire offer hinge on
demands that the government drops a U.S.-backed plan to unleash an
offensive against drug crops and long-standing rebel strongholds
in southern Colombia. rebel sources said. The U.S. Congress last
week agreed to 1.3 billion dollars for mostly military aid to this
war-torn Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
The government proposal will almost certainly include demands
that the FARC not only halts military actions but also "ceases
hostilities" against civilian and suspends kidnappings and
extortion, which together with "taxes" on the drug trade are the
main sources of rebel financing.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks with the FARC were formally launched in January
last year but until now both sides insisted there could be no lull
in the conflict that has cost more than 35,000 lives in the last
years.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Criticizes U.S. Proposals to Cut Funds for U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
held talks with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan Monday
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In the talks Schroeder criticized indirectly the United States
' proposals to cut its contributions to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that no state had the right to reduce
unilaterally its material support for the U.N.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Republican majority in the
U.S. Senate had come to agreement about that the U.S. would cut
its 926 million dollars in back dues to the U.N. on the condition
that the American share of the U.N.'s regular budget be reduced
from 25 percent to 20 percent and peacekeeping budget be dropped
to 25 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that other U.N. member states must pay more
contributions because of a reduction in U.S. contribution, but he
will not let other states, for example Germany, to bear more
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Germany would play a more and more important
role in the affairs in the U.N. and take up more responsibilities
for the U.N. About the permanent seat of the Security Council of
the U.N., Schroeder said that Germany would not act with undue
haste and Germany will consult with partners of the European Union
about it. The strengthening of the United Nations is still one of
the nucleus of the German foreign and security policy and Germany
will also actively participate in the peacekeeping measures of the
U.N., he added.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told Annan about the opening ceremony of the
International City Construction Conference in which Annan will
take part Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Hanover last Saturday to begin his visit to
Germany and he visited the Expo 2000 World Fair there Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, Annan met with German President Johannes Rau,
Parliament President Wolfgang Thierse, Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German important
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Annan will end his visit here and leave for Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Gore Woos U.S. Seniors with Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Monday courted senior citizens with what he called a "real,
comprehensive" prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
"We'll put the power of medical science back in the medicine
cabinets of our mothers and fathers," Gore said in a speech at a
suburban high school in St. Louis, Missouri. "It's the right thing
to do."
</P>
<P>
According to Gore's drug proposal, the government would pay
half of the annual costs up to 5,000 dollars under the Medicare
program. It would extend coverage to 40 million people at a cost
of 255 billion dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
His plan also would limit out-of-pocket costs to consumers to 4,
000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that many senior citizens have to choose between buying
drugs or going without other necessities. "We just should not be
putting our seniors in that position."
</P>
<P>
His plan is in sharp contrast with that of George W. Bush,
presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Gore said, adding
that it would cover far more people than a more modest plan backed
in Congress by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic presidential candidate claimed that his plan is
best because it includes coverage under Medicare, while
Republicans rely on insurance companies to provide the coverage.
</P>
<P>
Gore was accompanied by House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt
during his campaign trip to Missouri.

<HEADLINE> S. African Presidential Office Rejects Durban Declaration on AIDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African Presidential
Office Monday dismissed the Durban Declaration on AIDS as
something "belonging in the dustbin".
</P>
<P>
The declaration, signed by 5,000 scientists ahead of next
week's international AIDS Conference in Durban, asserts that HIV
is the sole cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
It condemns what the scientists regard as revisionist theories
on the cause of AIDS, which they believe has President Thabo
Mbeki's support after he reportedly questioned whether HIV caused
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said, "If the drafters
of the declaration expect to give it to the president, or the
government, it will find its comfortable place among the dustbins
of the office."
</P>
<P>
The declaration was an attempt to divert attention from the
real issues, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"People can't, under the pretext of meeting in Durban to
discuss questions of HIV/AIDS, circulate a petition all over the
world condemning the president," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has come under fire in recent months for reportedly
saying that he was not convinced that HIV was the only virus
causing AIDS or death attributed to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has an estimated 4.5 million HIV/AIDS sufferers --
the highest in the world.

<HEADLINE> GCC Welcomes Kuwaiti-Saudi Border Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on
Monday welcomed a maritime border demarcation accord between Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, saying it would give impetus to regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the General Secretariat of the
six-nation grouping, GCC Secretary-General Jamil Al-Hujailan termed
the signing of the accord as a landmark in the fraternal ties
between the two countries, hoping it would bring to an end the
border disputes between the two Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The deal would also contribute to understanding and stability in
the region and relieve the GCC of a controversial issue among its
members, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on Sunday
signed the agreement demarcating a maritime border that runs
through an area rich in oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
The deal was inked on the second day of a three-day state visit
to Kuwait by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz which
started Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been engaged for several weeks in
bilateral negotiations in a bid to hammer out an agreement on the
offshore zone where the al-Dorah oilfield is located. The oilfield
is claimed by Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which demarcated their land borders two

years ago, met in the Saudi capital in early June for talks on
their
maritime border but did not reach an agreement at that stage.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the al-Dorah oilfield resurfaced in May when
Riyadh and Kuwait City protested against Iran's drillings in the
field. Tehran, which also claims the area, suspended the activities
later.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Declare July 8 "National Day Against Violence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Students of Tehran University have
decided to observe July 8 as the "National Day Against Violence" to
mark the tragic student dormitory incident last year, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On July 8, 1999, anti-riot police raided a Tehran University
dormitory to crack down on student protests against the closure of
the outspoken Persian daily Salam by the conservative authorities.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked six days of bloody riots in Tehran and
other cities, believed to be the worst of its kind since the 1979
Islamic revolution. Several people were injured in the riots, which
also led to the trial of some police officers.
</P>
<P>
According to the IRNA report, Tehran University students will
offer flowers to the people in the main squares of Tehran on July 8
to mark the anniversary of the police crackdown on students last
year.
</P>
<P>
"We will offer flowers to the people with a smile" to mark the
anniversary of the incident and "will avoid any action which may
lead to violence," a student organization called "the Office to
Foster Unity" told the agency.
</P>
<P>
The organization added it has decided to hold peaceful events to
denounce violence that was used against the students last year.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Hails N.Ireland Peacemaker George Mitchell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
paid tribute Monday to former United States senator George
Mitchell for his role in trying to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of the Tipperary International
Peace Award to Mitchell, held in Tipperary, southern Ireland,
Ahern hailed Mitchell's efforts to build trust among the rival
parties in Northern Ireland, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the people of Ireland, I would like to thank
George Mitchell once again for his enormous contribution to peace,
an achievement of which both he and President (Bill) Clinton can
be truly proud," the report quoted Ahern as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who took part in the talks acquired huge respect for
George Mitchell, who encouraged everyone to contribute but who was
also determined to build brick by brick a consensus that would
result in agreement," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Clinton, retired U.S. Senator Mitchell played a
key role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland, helping broker the
landmark 1998 peace agreement that paved the way for a home rule
government including rival Catholic and Protestant parties.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Mitchell said he was optimistic a lasting peace
could be achieved in the province of Northern Ireland. But he also
warned it would be a long haul.
</P>
<P>
"I commend all participants for their perseverance. But there
will be setbacks and no one should think it will be free of
difficulty. But there is a feeling of hope, of optimism, of
accomplishment now the Northern Ireland government is up and
running," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to rebuild a building destroyed in a conflict but
to change hearts and minds is the most difficult thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's patient, no-nonsense approach was widely credited
as a key factor in keeping rival parties at the negotiating table
and taking the gun out of Irish politics.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Stresses Ties With Luxembourg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Chinese premier
stressed Monday that China will attach great importance to forging
strong bilateral relations with Luxembourg which he described as
an active player in both European and global arenas.
</P>
<P>
During his discussion with Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker, Zhu said that the relations between China and
Luxembourg have been very good and the friendly relations between
the two countries have made rapid progress in recent years with
mutual understanding and trust enhanced all the time.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people highly appreciate the one-
China policy cherished by the Luxembourg government and Luxembourg
's push within the European Union to promote relations with China,
" said the Chinese premier who just arrived from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that he is satisfied with the trend of rapid and
comprehensive development in the Sino-Luxembourg relations.
</P>
<P>
He cited as a proof of sound bilateral relations the trade
increase in the first five months of this year when bilateral
trade increased by 21.6 percent as against the corresponding
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg prime minister told the Chinese visitor that his
country attaches great importance to the important position China
holds in the world and the constructive role China plays in the
world and that Luxembourg appreciates the fact that China assumed
great responsibility during the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the progress China has achieved through its
reforms," said Juncker, who added that his country strongly
supports China's accession to the World Trade Organization by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Juncker exchanged views on the prospects of future
cooperation that is tipped to move from metallurgy, finance and
banking service to science, culture, jurisdiction and education.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese premier met with Hereditary Crown Prince
Henri of Luxembourg and Jean Spautz, president of the Luxembourg
Parliament, also Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said while meeting with the crown prince that though small,
Luxembourg has been active in both Europe and the world and
therefore boasts a significant influence upon European and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Henri said that Zhu's visit well embodies the
spirit of equality and mutual benefit despite the size of
countries. "That the EU and China strive to forge stronger ties
benefits both Europe and China."
</P>
<P>
The crown prince is scheduled to take over the governance of
the country in the coming September.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Zhu and Juncker attended the signing ceremony of
two cooperation accords concerning cultural exchanges and beef
production in China's Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier is scheduled to visit a local satellite
company Tuesday before leaving for the Netherlands to continue his
six-nation European tour that took him already to Bulgaria and
Germany and will also take him to Italy and Belgium.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Another 1,000 Eritreans and
Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were repatriated from Ethiopia
Sunday, said the Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry in a statement
available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the "recent deportees were
arbitrarily taken from their homes in Ethiopia and sent to the
border where they arrived in the town of Shambuko."
</P>
<P>
"Neither the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
and the State of Eritrea was informed in advance," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Eritrean government has worked in
 coordination with the ICRC to repatriate voluntarily Ethiopians
residing in Eritrean, saying the Ethiopian government refuses to
accord similar cooperation and respect for the rights of Eritrean
residents.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC-sponsored voluntary repatriation which began in June
this year has resulted in the safe return of 8,000 Ethiopians to
their home country.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, 150 Eritreans were forced out of their homes
and repatriated from Ethiopia. So far, a total of 71,449
Eritreans have been repatriated from Ethiopia since the beginning
of the conflict between the two countries about two years ago,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Begins Debate on Controversial Draft Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament) on
Monday afternoon began a first reading debate over a controversial
draft bill, which will enshrine ultra-Orthodox Jews' mass exemption

from army service.
</P>
<P>
The bill, based on recommendations submitted by a special
committee led by retired Supreme Court Justice Tsvi Tal, was
approved by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's cabinet by a vote
of 12 to 2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bill, which will need two more readings to become
law, allows those yeshiva (ultra-Orthodox) students to defer their
service until age 23, when they will take a year off from their
religious studies and can be enrolled in universities or work.
</P>
<P>
After the "year of decision", they could choose to stay in
yeshiva to keep studying Torah (Jewish Bible) or join Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) for a relatively short period and then enter
the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the IDF traditionally granted these Jewish students'

exemption from service, but they were also forbidden to work.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that the present deferral
system is illegal and urged the government to pass legislation to
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's debate, Barak told Israel Radio that there is a
need to develop a gradual system to deal with the issue and prevent
a serious rift in the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
The bill will allow much more religious students, even tens of
thousands, to defend the Jewish state without violating their ways
of lives, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister's remarks invited severe criticism
from secular Israelis, who argued that the bill only legalize the
current discriminatory system.
</P>
<P>
They also blamed Barak for backing up from his election promises
again under the pressure of ultra-Orthodox parties, whom Barak
dares
not to irritate at the current stage to smooth his efforts to push
forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that in last year's general election, Barak won
many secular votes with a "One Nation, One IDF recruitment" slogan
and Barak's deeds today just betrayed these voters.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli soldiers had set up a protest tent outside
Barak's office in Jerusalem for their hunger strike against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic scene reveals the widening gap between the
ultra-Orthodox Jews, who did not work or join the army and depend
their daily lives upon government funds, and the secular Jews, who
work, pay taxes, and guard the state in the IDF.
</P>
<P>
The secular claim that the ultra-Orthodox are just parasites and

urged them to share the responsibility to build and defend their
country, while the ultra-Orthodox insist their Torah studying are
essential for the continued existence of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with the support of ultra-Orthodox parties,
the bill will win a 61 majority in the 120-member Knesset and pass
its first reading later Monday.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on Monday left here for home after paying a three-day
state visit to Kuwait, during which the two countries signed a
maritime border demarcation accord.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed here by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and his Saudi counterpart Saud Al-Faisal on
Sunday. Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and Abdullah,
also Saudi First Deputy Prime Minister, presided over the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The deal was designed to settle any border disputes between
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over their land boundaries, demarcated
about 80 years ago, and the sea lines including the Persian Gulf-
located al-Dorah oilfield which is disputed between Kuwait and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies on Monday quoted high-ranking sources as saying
that the new Saudi-Kuwaiti sea lines lie one nautical mile deep,
south of the Gulf island of Um-almurdam, instead of the previous 3-
mile-deep offshore lines.
</P>
<P>
The deal also involved demarcating the joint coast and common
sharing of the natural resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the Gulf islands of Karuh and Um-almurdam were
Kuwaiti territories, the sources said, adding that the island of
Felka became completely a Kuwaiti land.
</P>
<P>
On the importance of the agreement, Kuwaiti Assistant Foreign
Minister Khalid al-Garallah told local daily Al-Kabas that the
milestone deal serves the interests of the two peoples, and has "
paved the way for trilateral Kuwaiti, Saudi and Iranian border
negotiations in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah held talks on Saturday with Kuwait Emir Sheikh Jaber on
the ways of developing bilateral relations, and on the regional and
international issues of common concern.

<P>
The council is also discussing further cuts on water for
agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
Water for agriculture has already been cut by 40 percent, but
according to the recommendations being discussed, the cuts will be
raised to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has met strong opposition from the country's
farmers.
</P>
<P>
A serious water shortage facing Israel has sent the related
departments in the country into quick actions. The government
dispatched a high-level "emergency panel" of water experts and
government officials to Turkey in June to examine water sources and
discuss possible timetables for importing water.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is expected to return to Turkey this week to
conclude negotiations on supplying fresh water to Israel amid
concerns about a high price proposed by Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Eli
Suissa has also been formulating proposals to be submitted to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak by the end of July for saving water and
creating new water resources.
</P>
<P>
Experts here view importing fresh water only as an emergency
measure and set the long-term goal on setting up desalination
plants to create sustained water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli infrastructure and environment ministers, together
with the water commissioner, are scheduled to visit a desalination
plant in the southern port city of Eilat next week in an effort to
coordinate the interior ministerial program to build desalination
plants along the coast.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli national water company, Mekorot, warned in June that
by fall, Israel's three central reservoirs will reach "
unprecedented low levels," highlighting the country's water crisis.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Move Precious Antiquities to Safer Museums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Napoleon's fleet and
other treasures will be moved to safer museums within Egypt after a
burglary revealed their current location is not secure, a senior
antiquities official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah Ali Gaballah, secretary general of the Supreme Council
of Antiquities, told the official Middle East News Agency that the
vestiges of the French fleet sunk by Britain's Lord Nelson in the
1798 Battle of the Nile will be moved a short distance away from
the Qayt Bey Museum to the National Maritime Museum in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Pistols, candle-holders and other items belonging to the periods
ruled by the Ottomans, Fatimids, Mamelukes, and the Mohammed Ali
dynasty will be transferred from Qayt Bey to the Islamic Museum in
Cairo, Gaballah said.
</P>
<P>
However, tourists will still be able to visit the old Qayt Bey
fortress.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's decision came Monday following the theft of 500-year-old
coins minted under Sultan Ashraf Qayt Bey, who ruled from 1468 to
1498, from the museum.
</P>
<P>
The fortress also stands on the site of the ancient lighthouse
of Alexandria, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Authorities Arrest Four Colleagues of Detained Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian state security
prosecution ordered Monday the arrest of four colleagues of an
Egyptian-American sociology professor who was detained at the
weekend on charges of trying to undermine the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor's office said the four detainees were
members of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Development Studies, a non-
government organization (NGO), headed by the professor, Saad Eddin
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen who also worked at the
American University in Cairo, was arrested early Saturday. He was
accused of receiving money from abroad without prior permission of
the authorities and writing articles and producing films to tarnish
Egypt's image.
</P>
<P>
Under Egyptian laws, NGOs must get permission from government
agencies in advance for receiving funds from foreign parties.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office said arrest warrants were also issued
for four other members of the center. It did not say what the eight
were being charged with.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's emergency law stipulates that suspects can be detained
without charge for two weeks, which can be renewed indefinitely.

<P>
Among others, a sharp swing in major exchange rates is possible,
when trade imbalances of the major countries become a matter of
concern in financial markets, they said in the World Economic and
Social Survey 2000, released in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
They worry about an "excessively" restrictive monetary stance
by developed nations as almost all of them are simultaneously
tightening monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that a large and sustained drop in assets prices
in major economies especially in the United States may reduce
consumption and investment and send the world economy "to a much
lower rate of growth."
</P>
<P>
The survey said oil prices could remain above 30 U.S. dollars
per barrel for a sustained period, which could prompt further
increases in interest rates in developed economies and slow growth
in these countries and the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Onlooking of Tragic Blast in Chechnya's Argun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Itar-Tass news agency late
Monday reported some spot details of the smashing blast in the
Chechen city of Argun, the most serious one of a series of
terrorist explosions staged by rebels Sunday night, naming it a
shocking tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The event occurred at about 20:00 Moscow time (1700 GMT) Sunday
evening, when scores of Russian policemen were resting after their
supper in their rooms of a military dormitory in the city of Argun,
10 kilometers to the southeast of the republic's capital Grozny. A
heavy "Ural" truck rammed at a high speed suddenly into the gate
of the police hostel and then a powerful explosion went off
immediately, Tass cited witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
Directly after the blast, motor and gunfire were opened at the
building, where an OMON (special police) unit from the region of
Chelyabinsk and a Chechen riot police group were stationed, the
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports by the Russian side, the truck
was carrying about 500 kilograms of explosives, most likely a
mixture of TNT and plastic dynamites. The blast left a hole in the
ground five meters deep and ten meters wide. Parts of the vehicle
were hurled hundreds of meters from the epicenter. The driver was
killed on the spot, and the police building was fully ruined and
civilian houses nearby were badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted the Russian Interior Ministry's interior agency in
the troubled republic as saying that at least 31 men died and
dozens were wounded in the hostel explosion.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers have recovered 26 bodies from the rubble of the police
dormitory by Monday afternoon, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The blast in Argun also killed three civilians who were staying
near the building. Now ruins-clearing work is still underway and
more corpses are expected to be found. Federal forces have begun
combing the city and its environs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the truck stuffed with explosives was being
operated by two kamikaze drivers. The vehicle managed to approach
the dormitory because it was already in town beforehand and did
not have to pass any checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
the press Monday that Argun saw the worst one of all the attacks
overnight due to "no sufficient cordons around the military
buildings."
</P>
<P>
"There was only one Kamaz truck at the entry to the premises,
and there was no concrete wall. The police opened fire for effect
at the Ural truck approaching the dormitory, and the vehicle
exploded. The explosion left a huge crater behind and ruined two
buildings located 40 and 15 meters away," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no complete information as to the death toll available
so far. Rescue work continues, and the picture may become clear by
the end of the day, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's bomb attack in Argun was followed by several
hours of fighting, as "Chechen rebels were attempting to seize the
federal commandant's building," said a representative of the
Russia's Argun military commandant's office, cited by Interfax.

<HEADLINE> Clerides Criticizes Turkish Troops Movement in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Monday slashed Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for the
movement by the Turkish occupation forces to the demilitarized
zone in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis in Athens, Clerides said that the measures taken by
Denktash concerning the peace-keeping force led him to a
confrontation with the U.N. Security Council because it had
decided to extend the presence of the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader blocked this force that had the
authority by the U.N. Security Council to act on the basis of
avoiding tensions, Clerides said, adding that the Turkish side
would not be able to maintain those measures for a long time.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Simitis said that the Turkish side confirmed its
intransigence and defiance of all the existing agreements and U.N.
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side decided to change the status quo in the
region which existed since the cease-fire agreement, Simitis said,
stressing that the Greek side condemned this action and would take
all necessary measures to underline the need for the restoration
of the status quo in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas Monday
described the movement by Turkish forces in Cyprus as "illegal and
unacceptable," saying that it was a trick by Denktash in an
attempt to shift the interest of the international public opinion
away from the essence of the talks on Cyprus that is to be held in
Geneva on July 5.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the U.N. must ask Denktash to comply
not only with older agreements but to be consistent with the
commitment he had undertaken to settle the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974, when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the eastern
Mediterranean island after a Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia
instigated by Greece's military rulers.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between Clerides
and Denktash have already been held in New York and Geneva
respectively to prepare the ground for substantive negotiations
leading to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Greece, has insisted that the island should
be reunited in a federation formula in line with the U.N.
resolutions while northern Cyprus and Turkey demand that a
confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up on the
island.

<HEADLINE> EU Sanctions Against Austria to Stay in Force, Says Chirac </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
Monday that the European Union (EU) sanctions against Austria will
stay in force until the three experts designated by the European
Court of Human Rights submit their report on the situation of
refugees, immigrants and minority groups in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also denied that the EU has fixed a date for the three
experts to submit their report, as was indicated last week by
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who said that the report
should be submitted in September.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a time to fix. It is up to them (experts) to take
the necessary time as was very clearly indicated by Portugal (
former EU presidency state). From now till then, the bilateral
measures of the 14 (EU states) remain in force," said Chirac at a
press conference on the first working day of the French EU
presidency which started on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The 14 other EU states imposed sanctions upon Austria after a
coalition government including the far-right Freedom Party came to
power in January.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include a suspension of bilateral cooperation,
refusal to support Austria's candidacy for international posts,
and minimum relations with Austrian ambassadors.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 penguins
evacuated from Dassen and Robben islands had been released into
the sea at Cape Recife near Port Elizabeth by Monday noon.
</P>
<P>
Oil spill from the bulk oil carrier, Treasure, has endangered
tens of thousands of penguins on Dassen and Robben islands since
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The penguin colony at Dassen Island was fenced to protect the
birds venturing into the oil polluted sea.
</P>
<P>
The chief marine and coastal conservation inspector in Port
Elizabeth Harry Watts said another batch of some 900 penguins were
expected in Port Elizabeth later on Monday night for release.
</P>
<P>
He said the birds were being transported to Port Elizabeth in
trucks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African National Foundation for the
Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANFCCB) has appealed for more
volunteers to help clean more than 20,000 oil covered penguins.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs and

centre, while Cape Metropolitan Council mayor William Bantom
presented a cheque for 50,000 rand (7,300 U.S. dollars) to ease
the financial burden at SANFCCOB.
</P>
<P>
South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) spokesman
Captain Bill Dernier said on Monday afternoon that unseasonable
weather patterns, while helping the collection of penguins as well
as the oil recovery operation at the wreck, continued to keep the
oil slicks at sea.

<HEADLINE> S. African AIDS Panel Urged to Help Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang Monday urged the Presidential AIDS
Advisory Panel to focus on assisting the government to save lives.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the panel's scientists and observers on its final
round of meetings, Tshabalala-Msimang asked the panellists to pay
particular attention to identifying the shortcomings of current
HIV/AIDS programs and advise the government on what prevention
strategies it should take.
</P>
<P>
She said they should study the role that poverty plays in
spreading the disease.
</P>
<P>
She said a more reliable and accurate surveillance system had
to be developed after the United Nations AIDS report raised
concerns that projections based on antenatal surveys may not be
reliable.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "Durban Declaration", signed by 5,000
scientists refuting what they regard as "revisionist" theories on
the cause of AIDS, she said the government respected the
panellists' right to support a particular point of view.
</P>
<P>
She said the declaration was not directly linked to the AIDS
conference to be held in Durban next week.
</P>
<P>
The declaration should be viewed as an independent document
supported by independent scientists, who do not necessarily
represent the AIDS conference, Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus has always been to provide a platform for open
constructive dialog so that we can learn and get ideas on how to
comprehensively respond to the challenge we face," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala-Msimang said the government would not be deterred
from capturing ideas from anyone if it would "enable us to better
serve our people".
</P>
<P>
The panel, set up by President Thabo Mbeki earlier this year to
advise the government on how to fight the disease, comprises more
than 30 scientists who are evenly split between experts
questioning the link between HIV and AIDS and those subscribing
to the conventional view that the HIV causes AIDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's 12 public
sector unions are set to meet for a labor caucus on Tuesday to
formulate a collective approach over the deadlocked wage talks
with the government.
</P>
<P>
The unions rejected the revised 6-percent wage hike offered by
the government, saying it was way off their average 10-percent
demand, the South African Press Association reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said that the government's offer on medical and
housing allowances was amounting to a reduction in benefits.
</P>
<P>
The national leadership of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions (COSATU) will also meet with four of its affiliates on
Tuesday morning to receive feedback on the talks and explore
possible deadlock breaking mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the government imposed an average 6.3-percent increase
for most public servants, and 7 percent for teachers and lowest
paid servants following a deadlock in negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
Democratic Party Monday said it supported the government's
"steadfast approach" to the wage negotiations with public sector
unions.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the party Mannetjies Grobler said in a statement
that the demands by the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU) affiliated unions were unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
It is a positive sign that the government has decided to tackle
the issue head-on by standing firm on a 6-percent increase instead
of the 10 percent demanded by the unions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully the government will not waver now that the limits
have been set," it said.
</P>
<P>
Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine
Fraser-Moleketi said on Sunday that the government's offer was
final. However, she said they were willing to negotiate employee
benefits.
</P>
<P>
"After the latest round of negotiations between ...
Fraser-Moleketi and unions it seems as if the government realizes
that it needs to take decisive action to bring about a smaller and
more cost effective public service in order to improve service
delivery in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Caving in to the make or break demands of militant unions is
not an option. It would be short-sighted indeed to accede to wage
increases above the inflation rate as demanded by the unions," the
statement noted.

the Lusaka meeting, during which a supervising mechanism was
created to monitor the security situation along the
Angolan-Zambian border.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister who attended the meeting held last
weekend in Lusaka, the 17th session of the Angolan-Zambian Joint
Commission of Defense and Security has created a mechanism for
treating, through dialog and constructive forms, possible
incidents or incomprehension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fernando da Piedade said that the principle of common control
of the frontier was adopted by the two sides and both countries
agreed to prevent unsteady actions from happening.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to establish a communication system to improve
contacts and opinion exchange between the regional commanders and
other security officers in the eastern Angolan provinces and the
western Zambian areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the joint commission also decided to set up a
technical committee to investigate previous incidents and inform
their respective governments as soon as conclusive findings are
compiled, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Angola and Zambia have been strained during
the Angolan civil war. The Angolan government has accused the
Zambian government of giving logistic support to the Angolan
rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Bipartisan Talks on Executive Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan ruling People's
Alliance (PA) and the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
will meet later this week to decide if the Executive Presidency
should continue, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said a joint delegation of the PA led by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga and the UNP headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe
will meet on Friday on the issue as a part of the bipartisan talks
on the constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who rode to power in 1994 promising the abolition
of Presidency, failed to do so after her draft constitutional
reform proposals, changing among others the Executive Presidency
to Westminster Democracy, stuck in Parliament for want of two-
thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
The proposed reforms advocated abolition of Presidency and
offered a package of devolution proposals to grant autonomy to the
provinces, especially to the Tamil-dominated north and east as
political solution to end the long-running ethnic civil war with
the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
More recently, the government came up with a new transitional
provisions which included retention of the Presidency for a
further six years as Kumaratunga was reelected for the second term
last December.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, which had introduced the Executive Presidency in the
island 22 years ago, are hoping to abolish the office which lends
excessive powers to the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, committee members of both the PA and UNP will meet
Wednesday to discuss the proposed new constitutional reforms on
finance, law and national security. The conclusions of this
meeting will be handed over to the president and the opposition
leader on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan talks on constitutional reform have made
significant progress during the past month as the two sides have
reached agreement on several matters, including an interim council
to administer the war-torn north and east.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Chief Executive Starts Dialogue With Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's military ruler General
Pervez Musharraf Monday started meetings with the country's key
political leaders in a move to bridge the gulf between the
government and the political parties.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive on Monday met Raja Zafar ul Haq, acting
chief of Pakistan Muslim League (PML) whose leader is the ousted
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is now in prison. This is
Musharraf's first meeting with a PML leader since the military
coup in October last year.
</P>
<P>
"We will look into the chief executive's proposals for
amendment in the constitution and revival of democracy," Haq told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf said last month that he will begin meetings
with what he called "clean politicians" in July.
</P>
<P>
Haq said that his meeting with Musharraf, which lasted for over
two hours, discussed the country's political and economic
situation and other vital national matters.
</P>
<P>
PML sources said cases against Nawaz Sharif figured in the
meeting. General Musharraf reportedly told the PML that the cases
are in the courts and the government respects the judiciary
independence.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has been sentenced to life imprisonment in a hijacking
case, is being tried in a corruption case and also is also charged
with treason.
</P>
<P>
Haq said he will inform the former prime minister of the
meeting. "Our meeting mainly concerned the revival of democracy.
Of course, I cannot tell all."
</P>
<P>
"Politicians associated with various national political parties
visited the chief executive's office in Islamabad on Monday where
they held separate one-to-one meetings" with General Musharraf,
said an official statement.
</P>
<P>
Those politicians were apprised on the government's reform
agenda, the statement said. It described the atmosphere of talks
as "free, candid and cordial."
</P>
<P>
Among the politicians whom General Musharraf met Monday were
also Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Chief of Islamic group "Jamiat Ulema-e-
Islam," and Miaz Mohammad Azhar, a PML dissident and former
governor of Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Terming Musharraf's meetings with the politicians as a good
start, Pakistan's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider Monday said
the process will continue.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good start and the meeting process will continue,"
Haider told a press briefing here. He said the meetings are part
of the government's effort to let others join the reform process.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is not alone the responsibility of the government. It
is a collective responsibility. We want others to join this
process and the meetings are part of it," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Sino-Pak Cooperation in Missile Technology: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar Monday refuted U.S. media reports about cooperation between
Pakistan and China to build long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such cooperation," Sattar told a news conference
here.
</P>
<P>
New York Times on Sunday reported that the American
intelligence agencies have told the Clinton administration and
Congress that China has continued to aid Pakistan's effort to
build long-range missiles that could carry nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said Pakistan had received limited help from China about
short-range missile technology in 1993, which did not violate the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) criteria, to which China
was committed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Pakistan has not received anything
from China which is inconsistent with Beijing's commitment to the
MTCR.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's program is sufficiently advanced, so we can
continue research ourselves," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Economy to Grow 3.5 Percent in 2000: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The upswing is subject to various short-term threats and growth
in most of the poorest countries remains inadequate to meeting
world poverty-fighting goals, said the U.N. World Economic and
Social Survey 2000.
</P>
<P>
Continued strength is expected in North America and improvement
in most other parts of the world, especially South and East Asia,
Latin America and Europe, said the report, adding that the
economies of China and India, which have been growing at 7 or 6
percent in recent years, are expected to continue at a similar
pace at least through 2001.
</P>
<P>
The report said recent developments in the Baltic countries,
Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States have also been positive. Growth for the entire region is
expected to reach 3.75 percent in 2000, up from 2.1 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Output in Africa is forecast to increase by 4.25 percent in
2000, but the growth rate is unevenly spread, with output per
person falling this year in six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
and in at least 14 of the world's 48 least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, the international economy is resuming its pre-
crisis mode," the report claimed. Capital flows to emerging
economies are rising again and international prices of most
commodities have bottomed out, with world trade volume expected to
grow by about 8 percent this year, up from less than 5 percent in
1999 and about 3 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Arrives in Dushanbe for State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang, the first Chinese head of state to visit this central
Asian country, was accorded a red-carpet welcome at the airport.
Accompanied by Rakhmonov, Jiang inspected the guards of honor
after a military band played the national anthems of China and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech distributed at the airport, Jiang highly
appraised the Sino-Tajik friendship particularly after the
establishment of diplomatic ties eight years ago, saying "the
deeply rooted tree of friendship was fruitful." He said that he
believed the visit would inject new impetus to the further
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming "Shanghai Five" summit, Jiang said China was
ready to make continued efforts to push forward the development of
"Shanghai Five" meeting process in a bid to safeguard regional
peace and stability and promote common development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The "Shanghai Five" process, which involves the heads of states
from China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, was
started in Shanghai, China, in April 1996, when the heads of
states from the five countries held their first summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Dushanbe, Jiang will hold formal talks with
Rakhmonov Tuesday morning and the two countries will sign a series
of documents on bilateral cooperation, according to officials of
the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's entourage who arrived here boarding the same special
plane included Vice Premier Qian Qichen, Minister in charge of the
State Development and Planning Commission Zeng Peiyan, Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng, and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan is the first-leg of Jiang's five-day, two-nation
visit. He is scheduled to attend the annual "Shanghai Five" Summit
on July 5. The multilateral summit gained its name from the first
five-nation meeting in Shanghai, China, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Jiang will go to Turkmenistan for a state
visit as the guest of his Turkmenistani counterpart Saparmurad
Niyazov.

<HEADLINE> Wild Giant Panda Population Growing: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The third nationwide survey of the
giant panda population has shown that the number of giant pandas
living in the Wolong Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan
Province is increasing, and their habitat is expanding.
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that measures aimed at improving the
ecological environment of the reserve have taken effect, said
Zhang Quangui, assistant director of the China Giant Panda
Research and Conservation Center.
</P>
<P>
Since 1963, when the reserve was established, the coverage of
forests has been expanding from 53 percent to 70.6 percent. This
was achieved by turning farmland into forested land and greening
mountains, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the air and water quality in the region has reached
the State's top standard, with local residents moved out and
electricity-generated power introduced, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 200,000-ha reserve, not far from this capital of
Sichuan Province, is home to more than 450 wild vertebrates,
including 13 kinds of rare animals under State's top protection,
and 44 kinds under secondary protection.
</P>
<P>
China and the World Wildlife Fund jointly established a giant
panda research center in 1980. So far, the center has bred 37
giant pandas, and 26 of them have survived.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild,
mainly in the hilly areas in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Bans Picking Sand-Fixing Wild Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
in northwest China, has banned the picking and sale of sand-fixing
wild plants, such as wild algae and licorice root.
</P>
<P>
At a live television conference today, the provincial
government announced a series of measures to check such activities,
which have posed a serious threat to the fragile ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in recent years, about 160,000 farmers in
the region had been engaged in the picking of wild algae, licorice
root and other wild plants.
</P>
<P>
All picking, sale, purchase, process and export of these plants
are prohibited, and those breaking the ban will be severely
punished, according to a circular from the government.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government is also taking measures to help
the farmers out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that wild algae and other sand-fixing plants play
an important role in protecting the eco-environment, particularly
grass.
</P>
<P>
But rampant picking and digging of the wild plants in recent
years has resulted in the deterioration and desertification of
grassland, seriously damaging the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Algae, a black hair-like plant, is a popular purchase, as the
Chinese pronunciation of the word is similar to "facai," which
means "making a fortune."

<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police and army have
rounded up 300 persons in the northwestern part of the country who
are suspected to be Tamil Tiger rebels, the state radio said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the 300 persons were detained on Sunday during a
joint search and cordon operation in the Puttalam district, some
140 kilometers north of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted police sources as saying that 160 of those
detained were released after interrogation and that at least five
of those still in detention are senior members of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The surprise raid was ordered by Mahinda Balasuriya, Deputy
Inspector General of Police for the North Western Province, who
believed the rebels are using Puttalam as "a hideout for terrorist
activity."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland
called Eelam for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983. More than 60,000 people have been killed in the
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rubber Export Up in 1st Part of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam exported 105,000 tons of
rubber latex, earning 65 million U.S. dollars in the first six
months of this year, representing a year-on-year increase of 7.1
percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Before 1990, VNA said, Vietnam exported 60 percent of its
rubber latex to the former Soviet Union, 20 percent to Singapore,
and 10 percent to Eastern Europe. But sales to those markets have
gradually dropped in recent years. At present, China is the main
customer of Vietnam's rubber. In the first six months of this year,
China absorbed 30 percent of Vietnam's rubber exports.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam have also expanded the export of rubber to other
outlets including Poland, Spain, Hong Kong, Sweden, Italy and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has about 380,000 hectares of rubber. Its rubber
industry is disposing of low-quality rubber plantations and
introducing new rubber strains into cultivation to raise the
quality of rubber latex and boost domestic sales.

<HEADLINE> 68,000 Displaced Angolans Face Terrible Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 68,000 war-displaced Angolans
sheltered in the central South Kwanza province are facing
"terrible conditions", an official of the ministry of the
assistance and social reintegration said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernardo Martins, Gabela, a city 270 kilometers
southeast of Luanda, has lodged most of the refugees who are in
dire need of all subsistence.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, most of them from the districts of Ebo, Quibala,
Waku Kungo and Mussende, faced shortages of food, clothing,
medicine, tents and other implements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military situation in the South Kwanza province has in
recent months been unstable, especially in the districts of
Quibala, Ebo and Waku Kungo. In addition, the northeastern
district of Mussende is occupied by the rebels of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Dozens of refugees flow from the UNITA-controlled areas into
Gabela every day, Martins said. He urged the aid organizations to
send assistance because the existing stocks are not enough to
sustain the needy.
</P>
<P>
The total number of war refugees in South Kwanza province is
estimated at 150,000, most of them women, children and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are taking steps to remedy the situation, Martins
said.

PRAGUE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Tennis players can cross out the

Tennis Association (CTA) cancelled both ATP and WTA Czech Open
tournaments because of a shortage of sponsors.

<HEADLINE> (More added) Viagra Launched in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Amid great expectations, the anti-
impotence drug Viagra was launched in the world's most populous
country on Monday, with approval from the state drug regulator.
</P>
<P>
China's State Drug Administration (SDA) has approved the
production and sale of Viagra for erectile dysfunction (ED) in the
country, announced U.S. drug giant Pfizer, which makes the best-
selling drug.
</P>
<P>
"Today is an important day in the history of Pfizer," Koenraad
Bostoen, chairman and general manager of Pfizer China, told a
press conference simultaneously held in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Viagra will be available at general hospitals at county level
or above, but only with a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
China is the 101st country to give the green light to the
diamond-shaped blue pill, even though Pfizer applied to the
Chinese authorities for approval to begin clinical research on the
pill in 1996, more than one year earlier than its debut in the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
Viagra will be marketed under the Chinese name "wan ai ke,"
though the pill has long been known throughout the country as "
weige" -- a Chinese phrase literally meaning "Great Brother."
</P>
<P>
The Pharmaceuticals Ltd. plant in northeast China's port city
of Dalian is responsible for manufacturing the drug with imported
materials. The first group of products have been distributed to
hospitals across the country.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer officers declined, however, to give specific sales and
production projections.
</P>
<P>
A 25-mg tablet will cost 71 yuan (about 8.5 U.S. dollars) and a
50-mg tablet 99 yuan. The average monthly income of an urban
employee in 1998 was 450 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The drug will not be covered by health insurance, which is
experiencing a transition from the government-paid one to a
pooling system.
</P>
<P>
About ten percent of Chinese men are estimated to suffer from
impotence, a condition often associated with age, hypertension,
diabetes and unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking, according to
urologist Zhu Jichuan of the People's Hospital here.

"Most ED patients are reluctant to seek medical advice, thus
tending to suffer alone and in silence," said Zhu, who attended
the clinical research project for Viagra in China. "So Viagra is
really good news for those patients."
</P>
<P>
However, Pfizer again stressed that it is unnecessary for non-
ED patients to use Viagra, because it is not an aphrodisiac. "And,
most importantly, Viagra should not be used in conjunction with
nitrates of any kind," warned Koenraad Bostoen.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of using herbal medicines and some
animal parts to treat erectile problems while increasing sexual
potency. But Viagra is the first oral medication that has been
proved by large-scale clinical tests to be safe and effective for
the treatment of ED, Professor Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He and some other Chinese doctors in Beijing, Shanghai and
Wuhan conducted a five-month clinical trial among about 630 ED
patients.
</P>
<P>
With an overall efficacy rate reaching 81 percent, the result
of the Chinese study was similar to those conducted in Western
countries and other Asian countries, in which Viagra proved
effective for the treatment of ED caused by organic, psychological
and mixed conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, more than eight million ED patients had taken
Viagra for treatment by the end of April, 2000, it was learned.

<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The country's armed forces and
armed police have vowed to improve their ideological and political
work in line with the important speech made by Jiang Zemin, the
country's president and chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to a Communist Party of China (CPC) conference on
ideological and political work last week, Jiang, also general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, called for the party to
put more emphasis on socialist ideological and political education
to ensure that the country's modernization drive is a success.
</P>
<P>
Officers and men of the armed forces noted that Jiang's speech
represents a programmatic document for the party to make a
breakthrough in its ideological and political work in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
As a people's army under the CPC's absolute leadership, the
armed forces view effective ideological and political work as its
cherished tradition, which has enabled it to score one victory
after another, they said.
</P>
<P>
In their study of Jiang's speech, the officers and men also
discussed ways and means to further strengthen the ideological and
political work in the armed forces.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council has ordered
local governments and departments concerned to take immediate

<HEADLINE> UAE Hails Saudi-Kuwaiti Maritime Border Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The recently-signed maritime
border demarcation pact between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait scored a
new victory for the citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
said a senior official of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The agreement proved that there are always peaceful options that
stand to be better alternatives to escalation of border disputes
all over the world, said UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Bin Zayed
al-Nahyan in a statement issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It once again proves that historical bonds are the shortest way
to resolve any issue," said the minister in the statement issued by
the Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow Up (ZCCF), which he
also serves as chairman.
</P>
<P>
Sultan also expressed his country's hope that other Arab
countries, which are involved in border disputes, will follow the
example of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia inked on Sunday the pact for the
demarcation of their sea borders, a step which is bound to pave the
way for both sides to seek agreement with Iran on settlement of
border
disputes in northern Gulf, found to be rich in oil and gas
reserves.  There is a long-time dispute between the UAE and Iran
over the three Gulf islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu
Musa.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has called on Iran to settle the issue through either
negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice in
the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, located near the strategic shipping lanes in
the Gulf, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but occupied by the
latter.

<HEADLINE> UAE's Currency to Peg Stably to U.S. Dollar: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s
currency, dirham, pegged to the U.S. dollar, is expected to remain
stable over the next two years due to expected higher oil revenues
and an upturn in foreign reserves and assets, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the dollar will ensure the strength of the
dirham against other main currencies, said the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU), an information provider for companies
establishing and managing operations across national borders, in
its latest report on UAE released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The currency will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar at a
rate of 3.67 dirhams. The strength of UAE's foreign reserves and
international investments serve as a guarantee of the stability of
the dirham, a position that will be boosted by strength of oil
prices over the forecast period," said the 50-year-old London-based
global information provider in its report.
</P>
<P>
"This is significant for the UAE, as the goods which it re-
exports, mainly imports, are dominated in yen," noted the report.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the domestic interest rates will continue to track
U.S. rates and are thus projected to rise in 2000, as U.S. three-
month rates hit 6.3 percent, before slipping back in 2001 in line
with U.S. rates of 6.1 percent," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Higher oil revenue will find its way into greater government
spending by individual emirates, which in turn will enhance private
sector confidence, investment and general activity," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of higher oil prices to neighboring oil producers
will also provide a boost to UAE's re-export trade, particularly
with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran," added the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai said here Monday that the development of the economic-
commercial relations between Vietnam and China has vast vistas.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam
Li Jiazhong.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, Khai said, the friendly and cooperative
relationship between Vietnam and China has been greatly developed
with the exchange of visits by leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After signing the Land Border Treaty last year, the two
countries are now striving to solve the question of demarcating
their border line in the Beibu Wan Gulf by the end of this year,
the Vietnamese prime minister said, adding that this serves the
fundamental interests of the two countries and conforms to the
common aspiration of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Khai, also a member of the Politburo Standing Board of the
Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, noted that Premier
Zhu Rongji's visit to Vietnam last year gave a strong impetus to
the development of the friendly relations between the two
countries, especially in the economic-commercial field.
</P>
<P>
The economic-commercial relations between Vietnam and China,
their bilateral trade and economic cooperation have enormous
potential and vast vistas, he believed.

<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
mourned Monday the death of Armed Forces Western Command Chief Maj.
Gen. Santiago Madrid in a plane crash off Palawan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the 53rd anniversary of the
Philippine Air Force (PAF), the president asked his audience to
join him in a minute of silent prayer for those who died in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
"I condole with the loved ones of those who died in the PAF
plane crash yesterday," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Palawan Governor Salvador Socrates was also feared
dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The president said the tragedy should be a reminder of the
continuing sacrifices made by government personnel in bringing
social services to the people.
</P>

Madrid was killed when the military plane he was flying in
along with 14 others exploded in mid-air and plunged off the
Cagayancillo coast in Palawan.
</P>
<P>
An American, named Bruce Walker, was the only survivor reported
so far. Local fishermen reportedly rescued him from the crash site.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Condemns Adoption of Sharia in Northern States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has condemned
the adoption of Islamic Sharia law in some northern states in
Nigeria as a politically oriented move to derail democracy,
Nigerian press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time when the government made its stand
clear on the issue after Kano became the fourth northern state to
introduce the controversial law last month after Zamfara, Niger
and Sokoto.
</P>
<P>
"We know very well that the real religious leaders are not the
ones promoting this, therefore it is a political strategy to
derail this administration, divert attention and move on to where
we don't want to go," Nigeria's Information Minister Jerry Gana
was quoted as saying in the capital Abuja on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the agreement reached between the
federal government and governors of the 19 northern states to
suspend the implementation of Sharia and return to the existing
penal code still remains valid.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the Council of States requesting all the
governors to revert to the penal code in implementing the aspects
of Sharia is still the guiding decision," he said, stressing "that
is the one the Federal Government is still upholding and
respecting."
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Government is absolutely in control of the
controversy generated by Sharia and we know that if we do not act
wisely, the way we are doing now, we would have played ourselves
into the trap that have been set by those who are promoting this
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to fall into that trap, so we shall just move
on with the issues of development, progress and stability of
Nigeria," he added.

ADDIS ABABA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Agricultural

Agriculture Research Director Kidane Giorgis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said six new agricultural research centers will be built and
two others will get reinforcement with fund from the World Bank

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Trust Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The draft amendment of China's
Trust Law was submitted to the 16th session of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the
country's top law-making body, here today for examination and
approval.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the draft was presented to the 23rd conference
of the Standing Committee of the Eighth NPC for primary
examination, and later major revisions were made to the draft.
</P>
<P>
In a presentation on the revision to the Chinese legislators,
Zhang Xuwu, vice-chairman of the NPC's Law Committee, said that
since the reform of the trust industry is still going on and the
status of trust companies is still uncertain, the conditions for
regulating the trust system are not ripe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the draft only stipulates the basic
relations between trustors and trustees, and has crossed out the
parts related to trust investment companies.
</P>
<P>
The draft has revisions on the rights and duties of trustees
and trustors, covering over 30 articles, mainly as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- The precondition for establishing trusteeship is that the
property in trust is the legitimate property of the trustor, and
trusteeship based on demanding repayment of loans is legally
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
-- Property in trust does not belong to the category of estate
or clearing property when the trustor or trustee is dead,
bankrupted or dissolved. Property in trust is not allowed to be
disposed of except as stipulated by law.
</P>
<P>
-- Quite a few revisions and supplements have been made
concerning the rights and duties of the trustee, the trustor and
the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
-- To promote the development of public welfare undertakings,
the draft stipulates that the trusting of public welfare property
shall be approved by the administrative authorities of public
welfare undertakings instead of the regulatory authorities of the
trust industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also noted that further revisions will be made to the
draft after in-depth investigation and examination.

legal measures against making and selling fake products.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment was submitted to the Standing Committee of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature, today for examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
In a presentation on the draft to the 16th session of the NPC
Standing Committee, Qiao Xiaoyang, vice-chairman of the NPC's Law
Committee, said that the draft basically meets the needs of legal
supervision of product quality, following two sessions of
examination and revision.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that some legislators propose that the producer
indicate clearly in the specifications of the product such items
as production time, sell-by date, ingredients, grade and safety
specifications, so as to let customers know the facts about the
quality of the product.
</P>
<P>
To curb the rampant production and selling of fake products
across the country, the draft stipulates that fines and criminal
charges will be resorted to in fighting against such activities.
</P>
<P>
The draft also stipulates that the quality supervision and
inspection authorities are not allowed to participate in the
making or selling of any kind of product.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Fisheries Law for Better Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee is considering revising the existing fisheries
law by introducing fishing licenses and production ceilings into
the fish stocks protection mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang, elaborated on the draft
revisions to the fisheries law to the Ninth NPC Standing Committee
at its 16th meeting, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many problems have sprung up in the fishing
industry, said Chen, who said that lots of aquatic farms have been
encroached upon, excessive fishing has endangered fish resources,
and some offenders might have escaped punishment.
</P>
<P>
The draft revisions stipulate that local governments above the
county level should strengthen their protection of important
aquatic production farms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state will set quotas for licensed fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The draft also recommends that the state cultivate new aquatic
breeds and spread them with the approval from the state.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the draft revisions stipulate businesses or
individuals who damage the aquatic environment, pollute water or
foreigners fishing illegally in areas of water administered by the
Chinese government, should be punished in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Effective on July 1, 1986, the present fisheries law has helped
to safeguard fishing resources and meet the commercial demand for
fish.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, China has had the largest fisheries industry in the
world. In 1999, the volume of China's aquatic products reached 41.
22 million tons, valued at 252.4 billion yuan (about 30.4 billion
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Official Disciplined for Dereliction of Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading official in Benxi City,
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has been disciplined for
dereliction of duty which caused heavy economic losses to the
state.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhida, former chairman of the Benxi City Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former
general manager of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, has been
deprived of all his posts as a result, central government
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that in his post as the company's
general manager, Li approved on several occasions in 1995 huge
amounts of unpaid sales to a factory where his son was a special
assistant to the factory's director.
</P>
<P>
When the factory declared bankruptcy, several months later, it
still owed the company 49.83 million yuan, according to the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The officials, from the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of
Supervision, said that Li had seriously neglected his duties and
brought about huge economic losses to the company and the state.
</P>
<P>
All Party and government officials should learn a lesson from
Li's case, they noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Party and government departments at all levels
should enhance their supervision of leading officials, and those
neglecting their duties should be strictly disciplined, they said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Israel Responsible for Missing Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi said on Monday that Israel should be responsible
for the fate of four Iranian diplomats who were believed to be
kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Iran holds the "Zionist regime" -- the customary appellation
used by Tehran when referring to Israel -- responsible for the fate
of its missing diplomats, Asefi was quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asefi told reporters that Iran has enough evidence that the
diplomats had been transferred to Israel and are still alive in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the past 18 years since the event, Israel
has been trying to distract international attention from the
kidnapping which is in violation of the international law.
</P>
<P>
All international organizations and governments, especially
Lebanon, should do their utmost to force Israel to release the
Iranians, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sympathy with the families of the kidnapped, Asefi
noted the Iranian Foreign Ministry is seriously following the case
and would spare no efforts to help them return.
</P>
<P>
The four Iranians were believed to be kidnapped on July 4, 1982
by the Phalangist Party, a right-wing Maronite Christian militant
group which fought with Palestinian guerrillas in the civil
violence and civil war in Lebanon in the 1970s and 1980s, and later
transferred to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refused to recognize the legitimacy of Israel since the
1979 Islamic revolution. It also calls for armed struggle to
liberate all the Arab lands under Israeli occupation.

CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Personal computer sales have soured in Turkey this
year due to appealing payment terms and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in Turkey that 180,000 personal computers
were sold in the first three months of the year. Computers that
used to be office equipment in the past are reaching homes and
schools now," said Selami Kaplan, General manager of Vestel
Bilisim, a leading Turkish PC maker.
</P>
<P>
Vestel Bilisim sold 100,000 PCs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Foundations for four power plants tendered in 1997
under build-own-operate (BOO) model will be laid this month.
</P>
<P>
The new power plants will generate approximately 26.6 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The three international consortia that will build the power
plants have settled financing issues.
</P>
<P>
Turkey witnessed a severe power shortage last winter which
resulted in frequent power cuts in homes.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Emirates Airline of the United Arab Emirates
announced Sunday the launch of non-stop flights to Chennai, south
India, starting from September 1.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-Chennai route will have four flights every week, on
Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new service is a major development in the airline's

</P>
<P>
The festival, from July 23 to August 31, will coincide with a
variety of programs depicting the heritage and culture of Oman.
</P>

<HEADLINE> MILF Stronghold in Mindanao Falls to Government Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troopers
captured a stronghold of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
in the southern Philippines on Sunday, a military update said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The military said in a report that 11 rebels were slain in the
military offensive and a government soldier was also killed in the
clash in Barira, Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Barira has reportedly been cleared of MILF rebels since 2:20 p.
m. Sunday before Military warplanes and attack helicopters pounded
the rebel stronghold.
</P>
<P>
MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu said the bomb raid resulted in the
destruction of MILF structures in the southern part of Barira,
near a valley located at the foot of Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the military confirmed that starting from Saturday
evening, the government troopers launched an air attack at the
Camp Abubakar, the MILF's center base located in Maguindanao
province.
</P>
<P>
This was the first wave of military offensive government
troopers staged since the two sides signed a ceasefire accord in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The clash between government soldiers and MILF rebels had
upgraded since January this year when the Philippine government
declared June 30 as the deadline for the peace talks with the MILF.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Capable of Curbing Terrorism: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said Monday
that the Armed Forces of the Philippines remains ready and capable
of thwarting terrorist and criminal acts committed by armed groups
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd anniversary of the Philippine Air Force
PAF), Estrada said ongoing operations prove that the government
remains committed to uphold the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We face today, while we confront the conflict in Mindanao, one
of the most difficult trials in fostering the unity and
preservation of our nation under one flag, one Constitution, one
government... And we shall overcome this...," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is aware of the soldiers' sacrifices to
restore and uphold peace and the rule of law in the country.
</P>
<P>
He added the air support for government troops has shown the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that the government means
business in protecting the country's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Estrada said, the June 30 deadline for a peace
agreement has already lapsed, leaving the government open to take
the needed action to preserve the country's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline already expired. So there will be continued
military operations," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Estrada declared June 30 as the deadline
for the peace talks with the MILF, the biggest Muslim rebel group
in Mindanao, which has been fighting for a separate Islamic state
for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides failed to sign an interim peace accord before
the end of the deadline due to MILF's refusal to accept autonomy
proposed by the government.

develop their professional capabilities to retain their relevance
and effectiveness in the discharge of their role of defending the
territorial integrity of the nation," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chechen Blasts Tolls Rise, Rebels Issue Tough Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels committed five
terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic
Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding
74, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky
announced.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax, Russian federal forces have blocked
roads leading to the city of Argun and prepared for a "mopping up"
operation after a violent apartment bloc explosion by the
terrorists killed at least 25 and wounded 81 there overnight.
</P>
<P>
Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued
Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military,
but Yastrzhembsky said it's "nothing new."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov demands that "airstrikes and artillery attacks be
stopped," and that "the troops subsequently be completely
withdrawn from Chechnya" and "the military commanders, who have
been directing operations in Chechnya, be put on international
trial."
</P>
<P>
The separatist leader also said that if the Russian authorities
present evidence showing that Chechen people have something to do
with the bombings of apartment houses in Moscow, Volgodonsk, and
Buynaksk, he is prepared to hand over the suspects to the courts "
under the control of international organizations."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's address does not contain anything new,
Yastrzhembsky reiterated. "I can only repeat that any negotiations
with Maskhadov are possible only on the issues of surrender and
stopping resistance."

relief from scorching temperatures.
</P>
<P>
A heavy downpour hit the capital at about 3:30 in the afternoon.
According to Beijing meteorological station, the rainfall will
also help ease a drought that has been afflicting North China.
</P>
<P>
The previous Saturday, Beijing's temperature reached 40 degrees
centigrade for the first time this summer.
</P>
<P>
The rain, caused by an eastward depression, will continue until
tomorrow afternoon, and the temperatures in the coming two days
are expected to be below 30 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has seen much less rain this
summer, as the rainfall in June was only some 20mm, much less than
the previous years' average of 70mm.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the continued hot weather has caused
electricity consumption to shoot up and drawn much more people
into air-conditioned shopping malls.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Consumers Enjoy Good Ice-cream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest official random sampling
of ice-cream products in Beijing shows that ice-cream lovers in
this national capital are much luckier than residents of Harbin,
the only other city investigated at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The sampling shows that 85.4 percent of ice-cream sold in
Beijing consists of quality products, while in Harbin, the capital
of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, the figure is merely
41.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision
Administration conducted the surveys in the two major ice-cream
markets in China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 kinds of ice-cream products manufactured by 66
companies were sampled, of which 64.2 were up to standard,
compared with 64 percent and 41.7 percent in 1997 and 1999,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic demand for ice-cream has been increasing
rapidly in recent years, and the growing market has attracted many
foreign investors and manufacturers to set up solely-funded
company or joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Local ice-cream factories have been increasing their outputs
and making new products by expanding capacity and upgrading
equipment.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, the state bureau criticized some local ice-
cream manufacturers for poor management, unhygienic conditions,
and low sense of quality and standardization. It urged local
quality and technical supervision authorities to punish ice-cream
factories that violate the state's hygiene standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Legend Group, China's largest
computer maker, announced today it will work to become among the
world's Top 500, which are selected by the U.S.-based Fortune
magazine every year, in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious plan of the computer company, which was set up by
its president Liu Chuanzhi 15 years ago with a start-up fund of
500,000 yuan (about 60,000 U.S. dollars), will increase its sales
to more than 10 billion U.S. dollars from last year's 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars, a company spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the group sold 1.25 million computers, an increase
of 80 percent over the previous year, ranking itself first in the
Asia-Pacific region, replacing IBM and Compaq, and 13th in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The company's Hong Kong arm, Legend Holdings Ltd., was valued
at 900 million HK dollars when it was first listed nine years ago,
but now it boats a market capitalization of over 66 billion HK
dollars. Last year its sales reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, up
by 98 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the largest stock-holder of
the Legend Group, taking more than half of the group's shares.

<HEADLINE> Circular Issued on Leisure Facilities for Schoolchildren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The general offices of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council
has issued a circular on strengthening the building and management
of facilities for schoolchildren to pass their spare time outside
school hours.
</P>
<P>
China has 240 million schoolchildren, but the existing spare-
time facilities are far short of meeting their needs in terms of
quantity, layout and scale, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
It urges relevant government departments at all levels to
conduct an overall examination of the existing sites to find any
problems and deal with them in time. Financial departments at all
levels should provide necessary assistance for the purpose, it
adds.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of museums and exhibition halls should be open to
young students free of charge or at half price. Meanwhile, all
kinds of public and recreational facilities should extend their
opening hours for schoolchildren, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, schools should try to enrich students' campus life
by opening up teaching facilities like labs and computer rooms
during their leisure hours, it says.
</P>
<P>
It urges government departments concerned to help create an
awareness of patriotism among young students, and enforce relevant
laws to protect their rights and interests. Non-profiteering
facilities for students should be granted favorable taxation
treatment, it says.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on non-governmental groups to join hands with the
government to launch recreational and educational activities of
various kinds for the students.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the circular announces the setting up of a "national
joint conference on the spare-time education of young students."

<HEADLINE> China to Grant More Funds for Human Genome Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology will provide three million yuan (about 360,000 US
dollars) more to support a genome research center at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Liu Qian, director of the Biological
Engineering Development Center of the Ministry of Science and
Technology, at a ceremony held here today to reward Chinese
research staff who participated in the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
The ministry allocated 30 million yuan last September to help
Chinese scientists begin the work of one percent of the
international human genome sequencing project. The Institute of
Genetics of the CAS took the major responsibility for the work,
while two other Chinese human genome research centers shared some
of the work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a laboratory specializing in biological information
science which is jointly sponsored by the Human Genome Center and
the Institute of Computing Technology under the CAS was founded
today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the United States, Britain, Japan, France,
Germany and China announced on June 26 that they had completed a
working draft of the human genome sequence.
</P>
<P>
As the only developing country which took part in the project,
China successfully completed one percent of the human genome
sequencing in April.
</P>
<P>
Through participating in the project, China has built up a
whole set of techniques for large-scale genome sequencing and
trained a group of researchers in this field, which makes the
country the fourth in the world in terms of genome sequencing
capacity.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Life Top Priority: Xinhua Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary points out that the frequent occurrences of such
accidents demonstrate local governments and departments' ignorance
of industrial safety requirements and accident prevention. Some
local governments ignore the regulations and practice lax
supervision of industrial safety.
</P>
<P>
Though economic gains are one goal pursued by the socialist
market economy, a responsible manager should obey production
safety rules, says the commentary, adding that safety should
always be integrated with production and profits. Only industrial
safety can ensure normal economic operations.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the enterprise manager should be the
first person responsible for industrial safety, and a safety
responsibility system should be established in order to curb the
occurrences of severe accidents, and to protect people's lives and
property, as well as help nurture a favorable social environment
for promoting the country's reform and opening up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Industrial safety is closely related to the security of the
people's lives and property, political stability, and the progress
of the reform, says the commentary, urging local officials to take
a responsible attitude in order to strengthen their management
work on industrial safety, and take immediate measures to ensure
the safety of the lives and property of their workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua News Agency released
a commentary today urging local governments to give priority to
the safety of people's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
An explosion on June 30 killed 32 people and injured 17 people
at a fireworks factory in the city of Jiangmen in south China's
Guangdong Province, with 39 other still missing. The commentary
notes that the blind pursuit of profits by some departments caused
them to dare to ignore the central government's regulations on
industrial safety.
</P>
<P>
The article demands that severe punishment be given to the
people responsible for accidents that result in the loss of people
's lives and property according to law.
</P>
<P>
The cental authorities have always shown deep concern over the
issue of industrial safety. President Jiang Zemin has urged
governments at all levels to take measures to ensure industrial
safety, as well as to give top priority to the safety of people's
lives and property, the commentary continues.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have stressed many times that local
governments and departments concerned should pay close attention
to industrial safety, which is very important for economic
development and political stability.
</P>
<P>
After an explosion in Pingxiang City in east China's Jiangxi
Province three months ago, which killed more than 30 people, Jiang
gave instructions to tighten up industrial safety, and so the
Jiangmen explosion came as a particular shock, it says.

<HEADLINE> CSFB Upgrades GDP Forecasts for Asian Nations in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Credit Suisse First Boston (
CSFB) announced Monday that it has revised its year 2000 GDP
forecasts for China, India, Hong Kong and Malaysia to 8 percent, 8
percent, 7 percent and 9 percent, respectively, up from the
previous 7.1 percent, 7.1 percent, 4.9 percent and 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its third quarter report of Asian economies, CSFB, a leading
global investment banking firm, said GDP growth rates in most
Asian economies have peaked in the first quarter of 2000 and will
moderate in the rest of the year as statistical base returns to
the norm.
</P>
<P>
The bank's economists attributed the positive outlook to the
temporary peak of U.S. interest rate cycle, firm electronics
demand and subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
CSFB argues that overheated economy in the U.S. in the first
quarter of 2000 was largely driven by Y2K related excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
As the liquidity deflated, the U.S. economy has already slowed
down to about 3.5 percent, putting an end to the Fed tightening
for this year.
</P>
<P>
For Asian economies that are sensitive to U.S. interest rate
differentials, namely Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines,
the immediate pressure to follow U.S. movements has eased.
</P>
<P>
A soft landing in the U.S. means a smaller correction in Asian
exports to the U.S., which have played a critical role in the
region's rebound in 1999, said the CSFB economists.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cycle is also expected to have a stabilizing
effect on the U.S. stock market, which will in turn increase risk
appetites towards emerging markets, including Asia.
</P>
<P>
Electronic exports, accounting for 30 to 60 percent of total
exports in most Asian countries, except China and Indonesia,
showed solid growth despite some volatility in the fist quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, CSFB economists noted that U.S. electronics inventory
growth is now approaching levels that usually signal inflection
points in the new order cycle, which may imply a slower 2001.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumption in most Asian economies is still on the
recovery path compared with levels in 1997 before the financial
crisis. Rising oil prices pose little threat to inflation as the
weighting of oil in the Consumption Price Index baskets of most
Asian economies is restrained.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Concerned with U.S. Subversive Policy on Iraq by Xing Guoxin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, fearing to see a Kurdish
state in the north of neighboring Iraq, is concerned over a revival
of the U.S. plan to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as the
U.S. presidential race gears up.
</P>
<P>
Due to the upcoming election in November, the Iraq issue again
rebounded to a priority in the U.S. foreign policy amid domestic
criticism of the current Administration concerning the continued
reign of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Al Gore, vice president and Democratic presidential candidate,
met last Monday in Washington with Iraqi oppositions, showing that
the U.S. government has not given up its policy of toppling Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Gore promised the Iraqi oppositions that the United States would
sustain the "no-fly zones" over northern and southern Iraq that the
U.S. and its allies imposed with the claimed aim to prevent Saddam
from threatening the Kurds and Shiite Muslims in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Although Turkish parliament last Tuesday approved the government
request to extend the term of Operation Northern Watch (ONW), the
force composed of U.S. and British warplanes in charge of
patrolling the northern no-fly zone using Turkish base, it is clear
that Ankara is cold to the idea of removing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Turkey favors to secure the stability and territorial integrity
of Iraq rather than toppling Saddam, which might cause aftershocks
in chains, including a possible Kurdish state in northern Iraq
bordering southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara loathes to see a spillover of Kurdish independence
tendency in northern Iraq into its own restive Kurdish-populated
southeast.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's capture of Abdullah Ocalan, chieftain of the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Turkey has made remarkable
gains in suppressing the PKK, which had waged a 15-year armed
campaign for self-rule in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On numerous occasions, Turkey has stated that it would not
permit the founding of an independent Kurdish state in the region
and urged Baghdad to reinforce administration over its Kurdish-
populated area.
</P>
<P>
The shared concern of an independent Kurdish state in northern
Iraq prompted the two countries to edge closer toward cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly considering upgrading of its diplomatic
representation in Baghdad from the level of charge d'affaires to
that of ambassador in order to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Baghdad, Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu called on Iraqi government to adopt
an "all-embracing policy" for its citizens in northern Iraq and
realize reconciliation with the Kurds.

Meanwhile, about 100 people were slightly injured in the
incidents which mainly took place on the Champs-Elysee in central
Paris, said police.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between about 400 troublemakers and police started at
around 1:00 Monday morning on the Champs-Elyees, where 400,000
people were celebrating France's victory.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas to disperse the youths who threw beer
bottles and tins at the law-enforcers. The battle lasted about one
hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
Among the some 20 shops attacked were the Disneyland shop and
some high quality sportswear shops.
</P>
<P>
One security guard of a shop was beaten up by several young men
and a cameraman of the France 3 television channel had his nose
broken when he was pushed by a crowd.
</P>
<P>
Medical rescuers gave emergency treatment to about 200 people
and sent 91 of them to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, reminiscent of that after France won the
soccer World Cup two years ago, broke out seconds after France
beat Italy 2-1 in extra time with a golden ball in the final match
of Euro 2000 held in Rotterdam.

<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian met with Thira Haocharoen, navy commander-in-chief of
Thailand here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor, said that China and Thailand have made great
contribution to the regional peace, stability and development
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With joint efforts, he said, the cooperation between the two
armed forces and defense departments have developed smoothly.
</P>

Chi expressed his appreciation for the efforts of the Thai
government in the development of Sino-Thai relations, saying he is
ready to work with the Thai friends to push forward the friendly
and cooperative ties to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan issue becomes ever more urgent after the
return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, and the key to
resolving the issue is that the Taiwan authorities should abide by
the One-China principle. But the Taiwan authorities has taken an
evasive and vague attitude in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We should listen to their words and watch their deeds," Chi
said. "The Chinese government sticks to the principle of 'peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems", but it will not
renounce the use of force."
</P>
<P>
Thira said that Thailand and China have enjoyed long-term
friendship, and that the frequent exchanges of visits between
senior officers of the two countries have consolidated the
relationship between the two armed forces. He expressed the
willingness to further Sino-Thai relations in all fields.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Prepare for Possible Riots: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops are embracing for
riots and violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the coming
weeks surrounding a Palestinian declaration of statehood, an
Israeli newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Ha'aretz said IDF (Israeli Defense
Forces) is preparing vehicles, helicopters and tanks to confront
possible violent clashes with Palestinians in another popular
uprising, or Intifada.
</P>
<P>
It said the Israeli army has predicted that an imminent
unilateral Palestinian declaration of independence in September may
spark riots in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Army intelligence assessments view clashes with Palestinian
protestors as "inevitable," saying the only unknown factor is the
timing.
</P>
<P>
As the September deadline for the signing of a comprehensive and
permanent peace deal draws near, frustration among Palestinians
over the deadlock in peace negotiations is building up.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has
threatened to leave for Tunis or Cairo to let Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak deal with the angry Palestinians, who have
threatened another Intifada.
</P>
<P>
Intifada was a seven-year Palestinian uprising in the 1980s
against Israeli occupation. In response, Israeli Chief of Staff
Shaul Mofaz warned that his troops are prepared to use helicopters
and tanks to confront violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Central Council of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) convened in Gaza for a two-day
session to discuss possible dates for a unilateral declaration of
the Palestinian state. The Palestinian leaders are expected to make
a decision on the issue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who has repeatedly vowed to declared a Palestinian state
within the 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital, is
under pressure from the people and the PLO leadership to do so in
September.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Arafat would still prefer to reach a permanent
agreement with Israel rather than to unilaterally proclaim
statehood.
</P>
<P>
An Israel Radio report Monday quoted Oded Eran, head of the
Israeli team on final status talks, as saying that the two sides
have begun to discuss water, one of the thorniest issue to be
settled before a permanent peace deal ca be reached.
</P>
<P>
There have also been press leaks of developments in the peace
talks, but none has been officially confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Get Jordan Valley Water Rights: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians are to get water
rights of the Jordan River and Lake Kinneret (Sea of Ghalili) if
Israel transfers the sovereignty of the Jordan Valley to them,
Israel's Ha'aretz daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting experts on water rights and international law, the
report said the handover of sovereignty over the Jordan River bank
will automatically entitle the Palestinians to part of the Jordan
River's water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel is also obliged to provide the Palestinians a
quid pro quo from the water of Lake Kinneret, Israel's major fresh
water reservoir, as some water of the Jordan River flows into the
Lake. Thus, the Palestinians will have indirect access to the
Kinneret in legal terms.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Valley was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
War. It represents some 22 percent of the West Bank territory,
which is to be transferred to the Palestinians in a planned final
peace accord between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In current Israeli-Palestinian talks, negotiators are discussing
the sovereignty transfer over the Jordan Valley. Israeli Deputy
Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh acknowledged last month that the
government is ready to give up part of the Valley, although it
hopes to retain a military presence there to safeguard Israel's
security interests.
</P>
<P>
Another version of rumors speculated that the Valley will be
announced as a security zone for a predetermined period, at the end
of which the two sides will decide on the area's sovereignty
finally.
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, Israel controls all the water sources in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Even after the Palestinian National Authority
was established in the 1990s, Israel continues to control all water
resources on which the Palestinians depend.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinians received
water allocation from Israeli water system. However, Palestinian
and Israeli water authority officials routinely trade accusations
and conflicting data over water allocations every summer.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused that Israel supplied less water than it
is supposed to do, while Israeli officials admitted that "it is
inconceivable that water quantities should be cut in Israel when
they can easily be cut in the West Bank instead."
</P>
<P>
Israelis have an average water supply of 270 liters a day while
the Palestinians have only 70 liters a day.
</P>
<P>
During the dire water shortage in the region this summer, a
senior official of the Palestinian Water Authority had stated that
Israel dropped water supply to Palestinian areas by about 30
percent of what had been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli human rights groups joined local Palestinians
in a protest against Israel's discriminatory water policy, waving
posters reading "Palestinian thirst, (Jewish) Settlers swim."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Introduce mtDNA Technique for Human Identification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will introduce the
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) technique soon to make easier the
solving of criminal cases, Science, Technology and Environment
Minister Law Hieng Ding said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chemistry Department is making initial preparation to
introduce the new forensic DNA profiling technique, he told
reporters in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will be among the earliest countries in this region to
introduce the new mtDNA technique, first discovered in the United
States in 1996 which will help the police, he said.
</P>
<P>
The technique can be used in cases where the quantity of
biological evidence such as skeletal remains or degraded hair is
too small.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government has allocated three million
ringgit (0.78 million U.S. dollars) to enable the Chemistry
Department to send scientists and experts in the relevant fields
to attend short courses abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said the department is actively building up its data bank
for DNA analysis samples known as DNA-STR for Bumiputeras (
aboriginals in Sabah and Sarawak, East Malaysia, to be made into
samples for reference in forensic cases.
</P>
<P>
He said "So far, analysis of samples for the Kadazan-Dusun and
Murut communities in Sabah are completed while samples for the
Iban, Bidayuh and Melanau communities in Sarawak are being
analyzed."
</P>
<P>
The work was expected to be completed by the end of the year
and would be extended to cover samples of other communities
including the Orang Asli and 56 other sub-groups in Sarawak and
other sub-groups in Sabah, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the data bank for the Malay, Chinese
and Indian communities of the country has already been established.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't to Arrest Provocateurs, Rioter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said Monday that the government will immediately arrest
provocateurs and rioters who have made disturbances in various
areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
"I have ordered Chief of the National Police (Polri) and Chief
of the Indonesian Military (TNI) to do so (arrest provocateurs) by
July 15, at the latest," the president said in Medan, capital of
North Sumatra province.
</P>
<P>
"The provocateurs have to be arrested, we can not just let them
free to incite the riots," reports reaching here quoted the
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono said that
there are strong indications that some elite politicians in
Jakarta are involved in communal bloodshed in Ambon, capital of
the country's Maluku province. They provided weapons and money to
the rioters, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The indications of their involvement are strong. But the
Police has not yet had strong evidences to arrest the provocateurs
of the riots. Based on law, it is difficult to be proven," the
minister was quoted by Suara Pembaruan daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said the communal bloodshed in Ambon was triggered by
political conflicts which have been taking place in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ongoing riots in the country have
something to do with the ongoing process of investigation into
former president Soeharto in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak confirmed
here Monday that some members of the House of Representatives (DPR)
and the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) are undergoing
investigation over alleged involvement in the riots in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Simanjuntak said ,"There are reports
from security elements in connection with a possible involvement
of some parties in the riots, including members of the DPR and the
MPR," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier President Wahid also said that he has signed a letter
to allow prosecutors of the Attorney General Office (AGO) to
examine members of the DPR and the MPR who are suspected to be
involved in the riots.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have been killed in communal bloodshed
involving Muslims and Christians in the country's provinces of
Maluku, North Maluku, and Poso (a city in Central Sulawesi
province) since the Maluku violence broke out 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
On June 26, President Wahid announced a civil emergency in
Maluku and North Maluku provinces in a bid to end the clashes
between Muslims and Christians. Reports said the situation in
Maluku has been relatively calm since the imposition of the civil
emergency.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Prime Minister Assumes Presidential Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government on Monday
entrusted Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda with executing
presidential powers at its special meeting based on a medical
report about ailing President Rudolf Schuster, the Czech News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under Slovakia's constitution, in the event that the president
is unable to perform his duties, his power is transferred to the
government and parliament chairman.
</P>
<P>
Schuster, 66, underwent two "life-saving" emergency operations
after he was hospitalized on June 14 with a high fever. Later, due
to his deteriorating condition, Schuster was transferred to
Austria to receive an emergency treatment last Wednesday.
According to the latest information, his life is no longer in
danger, but the condition still remains serious.
</P>
<P>
Schuster was elected president last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Treasuries Slump at Monday Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's treasury bonds slumped with
losses ranging from 0.04 percent to 0.83 percent Monday. The
trading volume on the market contracted by 10 million yuan to 1.23
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 (9.78 percent, due 2007) plummeted 0.83 percent to
142.69 yuan, a record low since February 22. Accordingly, its
yield rose 0.17 percentage point to 4.11 percent. Supported by the
high yield, the bond is expected to rebound soon, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities company.
</P>
<P>
As to the most active performers recently, 000696 (11.83
percent, due 2006) dipped 0.57 to drive the yield up 0.13
percentage points to 3.87 percent; the 10-year 010004 dropped by 0.
22 percent following the big loss last Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are two new stock subscriptions last Friday and there are
four for Monday and Tuesday. The tight money supply for both
stocks and bonds is considered an important factor that has driven
the stock market and bond market down, analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp contrast, impelled by these stock subscriptions,
China's repo market witnessed a sudden boom Monday. The trade
volume on three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day transactions
swelled to 13.8 billion yuan, as against 4.4 billion yuan last
Friday. Meanwhile, the interest rate on the three-day transaction
shot up to 8.02 percent from 0.78 percent, according to Homeway.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights of
Chinese archaeological news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
-- Neolithic Axe Discovered in NW China
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists discovered a stone hand axe believed to
be from the Neolithic Age at a site of the Qijia Culture in
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The artifact, which experts said was probably used as a musical
instrument for special rituals, was of great value to the study of
an early state's origin, according to Professor Xu Xinguo,
director of the Qinghai Provincial Archaeological Research
Institute. The axe weighs 35 kilograms, is 90 centimeters long and
60 cm wide. It produced a rhythmic sound when knocked.

</P>
<P>
China recently unearthed over 20,000 ancient coins during the
dredging of West Lake in the picturesque city of Hangzhou in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The coins belonged to several dynasties, the earliest dating
backing to the Warring States Period (B.C. 475-221).
</P>
<P>
Numismatists and archaeologists from both at home and abroad
have shown great interests in these coins, some of which are rare.
The coins show little signs of rust as they have long been kept in
water without any contact with the air.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Hails Saudi-Kuwaiti Sea Border Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading United Arab Emirates
newspaper on Monday welcomed the signing of a maritime border
demarcation accord between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based Al Bayan said the agreement, signed on Sunday in
Kuwait, has boosted the hope that Arabs can solve their border
problems through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The accord has again proved that fraternal and cordial
solutions between Arab countries are the best way to solve
differences," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The accord is also another landmark in the cooperation among
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the paper added. The Gulf
Arab club groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Bahrain and
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement has also paved the way for holding amicable talks
between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the Dorra gas field, which
Tehran also wants to share," noted the paper.
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf states have been negotiating for years to work
out a demarcation scheme over the continental shelf where the gas
field lies.
</P>
<P>
A row erupted after Iran started drilling for gas in the
disputed area earlier this year, triggering concern and protests
from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Iran stopped the operations in May
and expressed readiness to open talks with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
to reach an understanding on this territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates also hoped the accord could have exemplary impact
on a solution of its territorial dispute with Iran over three
islands near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which one
third of the world's crude oil passes.
</P>
<P>
The islands -- Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa -- are
claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but now under control of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has called on Iran to settle the issue through either
negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice in
the Hague.

<HEADLINE> IASA-SEAPAVAA Conference 2000 Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A conference of the International
Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) and the South
East Asia-Pacific Audio Visual Archives Association (SEAPAVAA)
opened here Monday zeroing in on the theme "A Future for the Past:
AV Archiving in the 3rd Millennium."
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, hosted by the National Archives of
Singapore (NAS) and attended by some 180 participants from 40
countries and areas, is the first joint conference between IASA
and SEAPAVAA and the first time that IASA is holding a conference
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening, Singapore Minister for Information
and the Arts and Minister for the Environment, Lee Yock Suan said
that the task to preserve significant audio-visual records of the
past for posterity is both facilitated and made more challenging
by rapid changes in technology, especially in info-communications
which have multiplied the volume of records generated by a
multitude of competing and complementary sources with their own
perspectives and priorities.
</P>
<P>
He said the audio-visual materials residing in many
repositories across the globe make up a gigantic and priceless
visual record of our human history, culture and heritage.
</P>
<P>
On challenges facing archivists in their work to document and
preserve the past for future generations, he highlighted the need
to build up professionalism in this fairly new area of audio-
visual archives and to see how new technology can be harnessed to
document and preserve important historical events, adding this
technology should also be used to disseminate this information to
as wide an audience as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, participants will discuss a series of
issues covering the latest developments in the profession,
advancements on the technological front -- especially digital
technologies, and the future direction of audiovisual archiving.
</P>
<P>
A host of activities at the conference will complement the main
symposium and poster sessions, including the book launch of "Film
in Southeast Asia: Views from the Region" which presents the
history of film in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
IASA, established in 1969 as a professional organization
specially devoted to sound archives, has about 380 members with
representations from some 50 countries and areas. SEAPAVAA
was founded in 1996 as an international non-governmental
association of organizations and individuals involved in or
interested in the development of audiovisual archiving in
Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the pacific islands.

<HEADLINE> China Demanding Vehicles to Use Clean Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China is demanding vehicles in its
major cities to use a new sort of clean gasoline in an effort to
curb heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to an order issued recently by the government, the
new gasoline will be available this month in Beijing and Tianjin
in the north and Guangzhou in the south.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that China has invested more than ten billion
yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) to upgrade the depurative
techniques and facilities.
</P>
<P>
The new gasoline can reduce car emissions by 50 percent, and
save oil by 3 to 5 percent, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline will be introduced nationwide in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-share Market Down at Monday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market index
dipped 1.20 points, or 2.14 percent, to 54.82 at the close on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover stood at 10.02 million U.S. dollars (about 83.17
million yuan), compared with 8.81 million U.S. dollars last Friday,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities company.
</P>
<P>
The market opened flat today, but lingered in the red
throughout the session, as investors were worried about corporate
earnings ahead of interim reports due from this month.
</P>
<P>
For much of the day, trading was confined to a very narrow
range of one-and-a-half point, and no leading stocks provided
strong support for the market.
</P>
<P>
Declining shares outperformed advancing issues by 45 to 3, with
6 unchanged, Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Huili (900939.SS) rose 6.96 percent to 0.246 U.S.
dollars, while Dahua Chemical (900951.SS) grew 1.33 percent to 0.
152 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sh Refrig Comp (900910.SS) lost 5.45 percent to 0.208 U.S.
dollars, while Erfanji (900902.SS) fell 5.385 percent to 0.176 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earning prospect continues to be the main focus of investors.
On elective buying interest, blue chips may lead any advance on
the market, which will continue to stick to a very tight trading
range.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai A-share Market Down Below 1990 Points At Monday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite index closed
at 1895.64 points on Monday, down 32.47 points or 1.68 percent
compared to the last close.
</P>
<P>
The total trading volume was 11.9 billion yuan (about 1.43
billion U.S. dollars), 5.4 percent less than the previous session'
s 12.58 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the rumor that the State-owned shares and legal
person shares may be listed, the Shanghai composite index dropped
sharply below 1900 points, according to Homeway, China's leading
on-line financial and securities company.
</P>
<P>
Two other factors also led the market to go downwards. One was
market expansion. Since last Friday, five companies issued new A-
shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which have attracted a
large amount of money. The other was investors' concern over
interim reports of listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang Friendship (Group) Co., Ltd. (600778.SS) was the top
gainer today with its price up 10 percent to the ceiling of 14.47
yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
Three companies, including Hainan Hengtai Mango Industries Co.,
Ltd. (600097.SS), Ningbo Zhongbai Co. Ltd (600857.SS) and Shanghai
Dazhong Transport Co., Ltd. (600011.SS) dropped to their floors,
hit by selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts with Homeway predict that the market is
likely to have a small rebound tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> PetroChina Has No Plan for Issuing Additional Shares: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for PetroChina Company
Limited (PetroChina) Cao Zhengyan said here today in a statement
that there were some errors in the reports recently released by
some media about the remarks made by Wu Jinglian, an independent
director of PetroChina, at a seminar held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wu also made a personal statement on the Internet on June 29,
2000, to clarify those errors. In his statement, Wu said that what
he talked about at the seminar was only from the angle of an
economist. He did not refer particularly to PetroChina when he
aired the opinion that the proportion for the government-owned
shares should be cut in deepening reform of the state-owned
enterprises. Wu only suggested that the state's ownership of
PetroChina be reduced in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
PetroChina will strictly keep to its promise that PetroChina
will not issue any new share in the foreign market within 12
months from its issuance of IPO (initial public offering), Cao
said
</P>
<P>
China National Petroleum Corporation also said that it will
strictly honor its promise that it is not selling the shares at
the international market within 12 months from PetroChina's
issuance of IPO.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Down 2.62 Percent at Monday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
dropped 2.99 points, or 2.60 percent, to 111.75 at the close on
Monday, approaching its intraday low at 111.53.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 53.04 million Hong Kong dollars (about 56.22
million yuan), in a sharp contrast to 159. 94 million Kong Kong
dollars last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market opened flat today, but lingered in the red
throughout the session, as investors were worried about corporate
earnings ahead of interim reports due from this month, according
to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities
company.
</P>
<P>
Trading was restrained as investors were pretty cautious. And
as the session progressed, the rising stocks gradually edged out
the positive territory for lack of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Losers overwhelmingly beat gainers by 52 to 0, with 2 unchanged,
Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest percentage losers, Shenbao Ind (2019.SZ) shed
5.71 percent to 3.30 Hong Kong dollars, while Intl Container (2039.
SZ) fell 5.23 percent to 5.62 Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
As investors have been so dependent on earnings profile for
direction, this narrow range trading trend is likely to continue
at least until the next set of data, it said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns U.S., Britain for Blocking Health Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday condemned the United
States and Britain for putting on hold 83 health contracts Iraq
signed with foreign countries over the past seven phases of the
United Nations oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak said the U.S. and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee are continuing the policy
of "fabricating fragile pretexts" to ban Iraq's imports of medicine
and medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that this has dealt a blow to Iraq's plan to import
medicine worth 500 million U.S. dollars to alleviate the acute
shortage of medicine, which is estimated at 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The health minister added that 89 hospitals, 473 health centers
and four medical stores were destroyed in the 1991 Gulf War, which
put an end to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly condemned the U.S. and Britain for impeding
the implementation of the humanitarian oil-for-food program by
blocking its contracts, worsening the humanitarian crisis in Iraq
as a result of the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It claims that over 1.3 million people, mostly children and the
elderly, have died due to the crippling U.N. sanctions, imposed on
Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food program, launched in late 1996 and now in
its eighth phase, allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil under
U.N. supervision to by humanitarian supplies, including food and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has acknowledged the holding
of the contracts has had a direct negative impact on the oil-for-
food program and on the efforts to rehabilitate Iraq's
infrastructure.

<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has expressed welcome
the signing of a maritime border agreement between Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters late Sunday, secretary general of the
Cairo-based Pan-Arab organization Esmat Abdel-Meguid lauded the
agreement as a historic move between the two Arab countries aimed
at resolving disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Such an agreement mirrors the deeply-rooted bilateral relations
binding Kuwait and Saudi Arab," the Arabic-language newspaper
quoted Abdel-Meguid as saying.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation organization called on all the Arab
countries to solve any problems through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia inked on Sunday the pact for the
demarcation of their sea borders. This step will also pave the way
for both sides to seek agreement with Iran on settlement of border
disputes in northern Gulf, found to be rich in oil and gas
reserves.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand FM Describes Fijian Interim Govt as "Unrepresentative" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Foreign Minister
Phil Goff has described the Fijian Interim Civilian Government as
"unrepresentative and lacking a mandate."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it does not include Speight supporters is
welcome. The fact there are no Indo-Fijians on board is of great
concern," Goff said in a government press release.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's position remains that the 1997 Constitution and
the Parliament elected last year should be restored, he said,
adding "There are the only sources of legitimate power in Fiji."
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude to the new government will be determined by its
commitment to return Fiji to constitutional and democratic
processes. We are still waiting to hear their intentions in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
"At the very minimum the administration must set a clear time
table for the restoration of democracy and the fundamental rights
of all Fijians," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand foreign minister said his immediate concern
remains the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Suva, Fiji's military chief Commodore
Frank Bainimarama Monday named indigenous Fijian banker Laisenia
Qarase as interim prime minister, replacing Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry who has been held hostage by Speight and his
supporters following a coup on May 19.
</P>
<P>
He also announced at a news conference that there are no ethnic
Indians in the interim government, which will be appointed on
Tuesday and serve for up to two years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Improve Ties with Australia: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi
Shihab said here Monday that the current political situation is
conducive enough for Indonesia and Australia to improve their
strained diplomatic Ties.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government has been studying an exact time for
the President Abdurrahman Wahid's official visit to Australia,"
the minister said in a hearing with the House of Representatives (
DPR).
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia has showed an initiative to improve its
diplomatic relationship with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has also invited our president as well as other
parties in the country to visit Australia. And geographically,
Australia is our neighbor. It is important for us to live in
harmony. And this is a principle of our foreign policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer paid a visit to
Indonesia on January 24-25 in a bid to clear the way to improve
bilateral relationship with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that President Wahid will pay an
official visit to Australia some time next month despite protest
from some parliamentary members.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Indonesia and Australia have been
deteriorated since the U.N.-sponsored direct ballot held in East
Timor last August during which the territory voted in favor of
independence.
</P>
<P>
The military and trade relations between the two countries were
suspended after the ballot held in East Timor as the Indonesian
government suspected that Austria was fully involved in backing
East Timorese pro-independence camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of white Zimbabweans who
fled the country prior to the parliamentary election on June 24
and 25 started returning home at the weekend, The Herald newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials at Beitbridge border crossing confirmed
the arrival of hundreds of whites and their families who had left
the country in fear of election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
Most of the whites interviewed in Beitbridge said they were
happy to return to Zimbabwe and were willing to work with the
government for the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Political violence had been on the increase since February when
black war veterans began occupying hundreds of white-owned farms
to press for accelerating land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure what to say on the land issue but I feel if it
is not resolved it is a time-bomb. The land is our biggest problem
and not political differences. Blacks have every right to the
land," said a white commercial farmer who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
He said their two-week stay in South Africa was not as
comfortable and his family had not relaxed but constantly watched
proceedings of the election on television.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the opposition of many coalition members, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has a probable majority of the passage on
the first reading Monday of a bill that would turn the Tal
Commission recommendations on army service deferrals for ultra-
orthodox students into law.
</P>
<P>
In a vote of 12-2 with one abstention, the cabinet Sunday
decided after a five-and-a-half-hour debate to adopt the
recommendations of the commission, and bring the bill to the
Knesset (parliament) for a vote.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is intended to grant the ultra-orthodox students
special rights to study in the yeshiva theological colleges, has
drawn strong protests from Israeli students.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- By transferring sovereignty over the Jordan Rift Valley to
the Palestinians, Israel will grant them the right to some water
from the Jordan River and Lake Kinneret (or Sea of Galilee) under
certain conditions, according to analyses by experts on water
rights and international law, and officers on the Israeli Defense
Forces's General Staff, that have been passed on to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The experts hold that the transfer of sovereignty to the
Palestinian National Authority up to the Jordan River bank will
have implications that go far beyond the security aspect of an
agreement.

in 1998 attempting to bug the home of a Hezbollah (or Party of God)

Hezbollah guerrillas, Israel's nemesis during its two-decade
occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel erected a so-called security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985, Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militia backed by Iran and
Syria, had spearheaded the armed resistance in Lebanon which
finally spurred Israel to pull out of Lebanon in May.
</P>
<P>
As the Lebanese government has not sent its troops to the
Israeli-evacuated south, the former security zone is virtually
under the control of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli withdrawal, Nur, the Hezbollah radio station,
had reportedly increased its broadcasting range to 95.9 FM. Israeli
sources said that the signal could be picked up loud and clear
Sunday morning in Israel's central region, despite occasional
slight disruptions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the frequency seemed to have been occupied by a
nearby Hebrew radio station.
</P>
<P>
Through the radio wave, Hezbollah launched a new public relation
war against Israelis. Most of the radio's programs were religious
sermon, news, and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
It also lauds the resistance of Islamic fighters and mourns the
fallen soldiers during the fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the Lebanese still being held in Israeli prisons
were interviewed, saying that they are looking forward to their
family members' return home.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners recently released by Israel also accused Israeli
prison administration with brutal torture.
</P>
<P>
There are still some Lebanese prisoners held by Israeli
government, and Hezbollah had urged Israelis to release them as
soon as possible. Otherwise, the militia said, it will pick up its
weapons again to make Israelis' life difficult.

However, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a spokesman for the
prosecutor's office in Chechnya's city of Gudermes as saying that
at least 50 died in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist act had followed the old Chechen script: an
explosive-stuffed Kamaz truck was parked and blown up near an
Interior Ministry hostel. The employees of the Chelyabinsk
Interior Department were in the building at the time of the blast,
Itar-Tass cited the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said a violent explosion of a truck loaded with
explosives outside a Russian Interior Ministry residence hall in
Argun, Chechnya, at around 5 a.m. on Monday killed 25 people and
injured 81 others. Four others were missing.
</P>
<P>
A team of rescuers airlifted to Chechnya from Nalchik has begun
the search for survivors, and an Emergency Situations Ministry Il-
76 transport airplane ferrying rescuers and special equipment has
left Moscow for Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya's law enforcement agencies said the militants staged
the explosion in revenge for their defeat near the village of
Serzhen-Yurt in the central part of the troubled republic.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry held a
ceremony here today, commending companies and individuals for
their effort to help evacuate Chinese nationals from the south-
pacific country of Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
Following the military conflict in the Solomon Islands on June
5, hundreds of Chinese nationals, including compatriots from Hong
Kong and Taiwan, requested help from the motherland to leave the
country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On June 13, the ocean-going freighter "Yangjianghe" belonging
to the China International Shipping Corporation evacuated the
Chinese nationals to Port Moresby, capital of Papua new Guinea,
and a Boeing 777 plane with the China Southern Airlines brought
them back to Guangzhou city on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said at today's
ceremony that this evacuation action was carried out under the
direct guidance of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
and the State Council, and fully demonstrated the care from the
Party and the government to the overseas Chinese compatriots. The
success of this evacuation is also attributed to the joint efforts
of relevant departments, Chinese embassies in foreign countries,
and overseas representative offices of Chinese companies, he said.

<TEXT>

<P>
 BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China today launched a gene
sequencing project to upgrade breeds of pigs and promote studies
on xeno-transplantation and biological drugs in cooperation with
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
This is a follow-up to Chinese scientists' successful
completion of one percent of the sequencing of the human genome,
said Zhang Meng, a spokesman of the Human Genome Research Center
of the Genetics Institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that though Germany, Denmark and other European
countries have already started similar joint research projects,
Chinese scientists see greater potential in their own undertaking.
</P>
<P>
Pork is the major source of animal protein in the Chinese
diet, and China has the largest pork output in the world.
Scientists hope that with a working draft of the pig genome map,
they will be able to upgrade the breed of pigs and promote the pig
raising industry.
</P>
<P>
The project is also the second project of the China
biological resources genome program. The first was the China
hybrid super paddle genome project, which was launched last month.
</P>
<P>
The pig gene sequencing project has drawn interest from
Danish scientists, entrepreneurs and government officials, who
have suggested that they cooperate with Chinese scientists in the
work.
</P>
<P>
Genetic technology is regarded as one of the most important
advanced scientific technologies in the world. Many scientists
believe that the technology will have an even deeper impact on
humankind than information technology.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Awaits U.S. Ratification of Extradition Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
awaiting the U.S. ratification of a bilateral extradition treaty
which will pave the way for extraditing perpetrators of terrorism,
the official Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The treaty addresses, in particular, serious international
crimes such as acts of terrorism," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, replacing a 1931 treaty signed by Britain as the
colonial power on behalf of Sri Lanka, was signed in Washington on
September 30, 1999, by Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs
Lakshman Kadirgamar and U.S. Acting Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton last Thursday forwarded the much
awaited treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka considers the new treaty a major international
victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
who have been waging a 17-year civil war to carve out a separate
state called Eelam for minority Tamils in the country's north and
east.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been designated by the U.S. State Department as a
terrorist organization and was banned at home as well as in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has a sizable Sri Lankan Tamil
expatriate community, has long been considered one of the more
powerful international bases of the LTTE rebels where they take
refuge to collect funds and negotiate for arms and other supplies
for its war efforts.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will mean that LTTE rebels who try to hide in the
United States after committing a crime could be sent back and
brought to book in Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Centenarians Exceed 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of centenaries in China
had exceeded 10,000 by the end of 1999, according to the latest
statistics released by the China National Committee on the Aging.
</P>
<P>
The statistics shows that the number of the country's
centenarians has nearly tripled that of 1949 when the People's
Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
And the average Chinese life expectancy, which was merely 35 in
1949, now stands above 70.
</P>
<P>
An official with the committee attributed the increasing number
of Chinese centenarians to the improvement in living standard and
health care, as well as economic and scientific advancement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese elder people are now leading an increasingly
colorful life, which has greatly contributed to the nation's
longevity. In 1999 alone, the elderly accounted for 20 percent of
all the Chinese traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plays a key part in this regard, the
official said, adding that some local governments provide the
elderly with subsidy, free milk and regular medical check.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Deliberates Nine Draft Laws (1) EDS-Updates with Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),

enforcement activities.

Further revisions have been made to the amendments to the
patent law to regulate patent handling procedures in line with
international practices, as China is near certain to join the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature prepares to
enact a law on language use nationwide.
</P>
<P>
A law draft on commonly used Chinese language was submitted
today to the 16th meeting of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the draft law to the meeting, Wang Jiaqiu, vice
chairwoman of the NPC Education, Science, Culture and Public
Health Committee, said that a uniform language has an important
bearing on the state's unification, national unity as well as its
social progress.
</P>
<P>
The languages of all nationalities in China should be equally
respected and freely used by the people, and any form of
discrimination against them must be prohibited, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
While popularizing the mandarin Chinese, the central
authorities encourage the people to learn all other languages,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The 56 nationalities in China have a total of 73 languages, 55
of which having written forms.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the draft law, the mandarin Chinese and the
standardized writing characters should be used throughout the
country. Meanwhile, minority languages can be used in the areas
heavily populated by ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Many linguists and languages experts said that various dialects
in localities have made it inconvenient for people to effectively
communicate and the random alternatives of writing characters
sometimes suggest wrong meaning.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Navy is deploying 20
patrol ships in eastern Indonesian waters to save its marine
resources which are susceptible to poaching, a naval officer said
in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya province.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Jayapura Naval Base Commodore Franklin W.
Kayjattu said the 20 ships left the naval base of the Indonesian
eastern fleet in Surabaya, East Java, for the eastern Indonesian
waters on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The warships are the large ones, such as KRI Multa Tuli with a
crew of 190, and the smaller ones such as fast patrol boats with a
crew of 60 to 90.
</P>
<P>
"The waters of Maluku and Irian Jaya which are rich in marine
resources have always become a haven for poachers so that many
ships are needed to patrol the waters," Kayjattu was quoted by the
Antara News Agency Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many Thai-and Philippine-registered fishing vessels have been
detained by the Indonesian Navy in these waters for illegally
catching fish and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a naval patrol boat caught seven foreign fishing
vessels, all flying the Philippine flag, in eastern Indonesian
waters.

<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Seven rebels and a government
trooper were killed Sunday following heavy fighting between the
Philippine army and the rebel group of New People's Army (NPA) in
the country, a TV report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the fighting took place Sunday noon at the
boundary of Trinidad and Danao in the southern province of Bohol.
</P>
<P>
One of the rebel casualties was reportedly an 18-year old
female fighter, the country's leading news channel ABS-CBN said.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Visayas Command spokesperson Michael Manquiquis
was quoted as saying that two Special Forces platoons were
deployed to Danao after receiving reports that the NPA has been
massing in the area.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, about 40 NPA rebels attacked a Japanese
construction firm in Dimiao, Bohol.
</P>
<P>
The insurgents, armed with high-powered automatic weapons,
raided the motor pool of Kanematsu Philippines, Inc.

Manquiquis said the rebels attacked after officers of Kanematsu
reportedly refused to pay so-called "revolutionary taxes".
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, a police officer was also killed and several
others were wounded in a clash between police and alleged NPA
guerrillas.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will try to send as many
Burmese refugees as possible home within next few years, a senior
official was quoted by Monday's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
National Security Council chief Khachadpai Burusapatana stated
that Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai will meet Burmese leaders
to discuss the issue during an informal summit of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) later this year.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the government is also urging The United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to do more than merely
giving assistance to Burmese refugee camps in Thailand, " said
Khachadpai, who had accompanied Chuan to visit the Ban Ma La
refugee camp Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The camp, situated at the Tak Province, 426 kilometers
Northwest of Bangkok, houses 30,711 of over 100,000 Burmese
refugees living in five Thai border provinces.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes the UNHCR to help solve the refugee
problem by opening a dialogue with the Burmese government, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR regional representative for Thailand Jahansha Assadi said
the U.N. agency is already in contact with the Burmese government
about the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Chuan's visit to the camp, saying it showed
Thailand's humanitarian commitment to the refugees and the
importance it attached to it.

<HEADLINE> Czech Agriculture Registers Heavy Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The loss in the agricultural sector
of the Czech Republic was much greater in 1999, rising to 2.1
billion koruna (57 million U.S. dollars) from 440 million koruna (
12 million dollars) in 1998, said the latest report of the
Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the loss to declined farm product prices,
which went down by 11.7 percent in 1999 from the year before. The
price of the cultivated sector dropped by 15 percent and that of
the livestock sector plunged 10.5 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of all farming organizations, agricultural producers'
cooperatives suffered the worst in economic returns, which
registered a surplus of 190 million koruna in 1998, but a deficit
of 768 million koruna (28 million dollars) in 1999, it added.
</P>
<P>
Economists have predicted that with the current unprecedented
drought in the country, the grain sector is set to suffer a big
decline and the loss in the entire agricultural field will be even
heavier.

JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Open clashes erupted again in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, over the weekend,
shattering days of calm since the civil emergency status took
effect on June 27.
</P>
<P>
The incident broke out Saturday noon at the Poka and Rumahtiga
subdistrict, 21 kilometers north of Ambon, and continued until
late on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At least one person died and four others were injured in the
clash. Dozens of houses and government buildings, including the
poly technique building of Pattimura University, the university's
housing complex and a high school were burned during the clash.
</P>
<P>
"Masses from both warring camps came face to face before people
from the neighboring predominantly Muslim Jasirah Leihutu
subdistrict attacked Poka and Rumahtiga area. We immediately
called for help from the Pattimura Military chief because no
troops were available here," Rev. Ferry Nahusona of the Sejahtera
Poka Church crisis center was quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Security forces from the 509th Battalion of the Army's

<HEADLINE> Prodi Urges EU to Push Ahead Enlargement EDS-rpts with corrections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 2 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President Romano
Prodi warned Sunday that the European Union must push ahead with
enlargement or risk seeing the continent split in two again.
</P>
<P>
"We can't take responsibility for the rebirth of a Berlin Wall,
" he told a seminar in the central Italian town of Arezzo, urging
Italy, a founding member of the EU, to play a full role in calling
for enlargement and act as a counter-weight in French and German-
led plans for speedier EU integration.
</P>
<P>
"It's a grandiose and unprecedented design to create the world'
s greatest economic reality with democracy and respect for the
individual countries' diversity," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Quoted in the Milanese daily, Il Sole-24 Ore, Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini supported the Franco-German proposal for a two-speed
Europe, but said it should not be envisaged as revolving around a
"preferential axis" between Paris and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he favors inserting a mechanism into the EU treaties
to allow countries that want to move more quickly towards
integration to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good thing if Germany and France are on the
same wavelength on some fundamental issues on the EU agenda," said
Dini.
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because the Franco-German alliance is on the way,
there is a need for a country with deep European roots which can
use this alliance, knowing that it is indispensable for Europe's
future to stand as a guarantee for those who may feel fear or
anguish before this great design," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
According to Prodi, France and Germany support "strengthened
cooperation" and replacing unanimity with majority voting in EU
decisions on a much broader range of topics, but it remains an "
open question" whether the formula will be an intergovernmental
agreement, or a supranational one, as he would prefer.

LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- World champion Maurice Greene of the
United States suffered another defeat as he finished only fifth in
the 100 meters at the Britain vs US Challenge in Glasgow, Scotland

Darren Campbell came third in 10.52.
</P>
<P>
Greene clocked 10.54 with a slow start and said the poor result
came from too much traveling.

Spain, was fourth in the 100 on Wednesday in Athens, Greece, but

<HEADLINE> Training Course to Fight Maltreatment of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China has opened a training course on
preventing the maltreatment of children, and experts from Britain
have for the first time given lectures.
</P>
<P>
The course, held in this capital of northwestern province of
Shaanxi, was attended by 30 parents, who learned that beating and
cursing are not the proper way to love their children.
</P>
<P>
Ill-treatment of children has been widely reported across the
country, where the entry into a university is seen as the only
boat to carry the youngsters into a bright future.
</P>
<P>
In order to pass the fierce entrance examination, parents
usually force their children to study round the clock, and if the
children refuse to do so, they beat them. Some children have made
suicide for this reason.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Fuyong, with the Shaanxi People's Hospital, said that the
problem has aroused international concern and the training course
echoes the call by the United Nations. His hospital has opened a
hotline to receive children's complaints.

<HEADLINE> Auto Sector Opens Wider: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's fledging auto industry will
open wider to foreign investments over the next five years to help
it survive and grow, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is indispensable for the country's auto
industry, which is short of funds and weak in product development,
said Jia Xingguang, a senior expert with the China National
Automotive Industry Consulting and Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
"The auto sector must use more foreign investment and follow
development technology to sharpen its competitive edge within the
buffer period after the country's WTO accession," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is to reduce tariffs on auto imports from 100 percent to
25 percent by mid-2006. Foreign automakers will be free to choose
models and types when producing automobiles in China, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Jia urged the government to further remove restrictions against
foreign investment instead of "koshering its auto sector."
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Administration of Machine-building
Industry showed that the industry has actually attracted a total
foreign investment of more than 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in more
than 600 joint ventures from 1981 to 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's machine tool industry is
likely to end its loss-making dilemma this year, but obstacles to
achieve this goal still exist, an industry official said.
</P>
<P>
Since January, the industry has witnessed a double-digit growth
in terms of both output value and sales as compared with the same
period last year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth China Machine Tool &AMP; Tools Commodities Fair and the
Fourth China International Machinery &AMP; Equipment Show which ended
Sunday in Beijing also indicate increasing demand for machine
tools.
</P>
<P>
But in the January-May period, the industry as a whole still
suffered a loss of 210 million yuan (25.3 million U.S. dollars),
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the machine tool industry will start making
profits by the end of this year as the industry recovers form its
five-year negative growth, said Yang Xuetong, deputy director of
the industry management department under the State Administration
of Machine-Building Industry.
</P>
<P>
The increasing investment in fixed assets sector, especially
the areas of water conservation, railways, highways and
telecommunications as well as technical upgrading in key State
firms, will create great demand for machine tools.

<HEADLINE> China to Better Enforce Fishery Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China will enhance protection of
its fishery resources and ecological environment by better
enforcing its fishery law, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Vice-Minister of Agriculture Qi Jingfa as
saying in a report to the National People's Congress that China is
trying to keep a sustainable development of the fishery resources
through adjusting the industry's structure.
</P>
<P>
He said the output of farmbred aquatic products account for 58
percent of the total output of the aquatic products, raising from
44 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
China's fishery law, which came into effect in 1986, put top
priority on directing the fishery industry towards increased
breeding instead of fishing to protect and make better use of the
country's fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the ministry has banned fishing between June and
September since 1995 and set up a goal of zero growth in sea
fishing last year.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's military leaders are
finalizing the interim government line-up and said it should be
ready on Wednesday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)
reported Monday.
</P>

The interim government will rule until new elections in about
two years and have a mandate to address longer term issues such as
land ownership and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted military spokesman Filip Tarakinikini as saying
some previous government candidates were reluctant to serve in the
new cabinet because of fears for their safety, so the military
will provide ongoing protection.
</P>
<P>
"We will protect this government when they are sworn in to
ensure that nothing happens to them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed plans for a military exclusion zone around the
country's parliament are still on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a lot of preparations that go into place and
that's just what the military is doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tarakinikini also said he would prefer to let the hostage
crisis drag on than try anything that endangers the captives.
</P>
<P>
The 27 hostages, members of Fiji's elected government, are now
in their seventh week of captivity.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Tom Steels won the second
stage of the Tour de France on Sunday when he sprinted from the
fast finishers.
</P>
<P>
Steels edged Australian Stuart O'Grady as the pair hit the line
side by side. The photo-finish showed Steels' front wheel
centimeters ahead.
</P>
<P>
German Erik Zabel was third in the 194-km leg from the
Futuroscope theme park to Loudun while Britain's David Millar
retained his overall lead.
</P>
<P>
For most of the race Dutchman Erik Dekker, only 36 seconds
behind overnight, threatened that lead as he won three
intermediate sprints to earn time deductions which trimmed 16
seconds from his deficit on Millar.

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000: Blanc Confirms Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France's veteran defender Laurent
Blanc confirmed his retirement from international football Sunday
in Rotterdam after his country's 2-1 Euro 2000 Final victory over
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Blanc had announced earlier in the tournament that he would
end his career at the top level - his announcement means that the
legendary back four of Lilian Thuram, Blanc, Marcel Desailly and
Bixente Lizarazu ends its days together undefeated in 27 matches
since they first played together in the 3-1 victory over Bulgaria
in Euro 96 at Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
"With regret I am leaving the team," said Blanc on TF1 TV
channel. "In modern football you have to know when to quit. I have
always tried to do my job as well as possible."
</P>
<P>
Blanc was a key member of the 1998 World Cup winning squad but
missed the
final with Brazil through suspension.
</P>
<P>
France's skipper Didier Deschamps would not answer questions
about his future.
</P>
<P>
France coach Roger Lemerre wanted Deschamps to continue.

LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan has
checked himself into the Priory Clinic in a bid to kick a drugs
habit.
</P>
<P>
The news that the world number four has been at the
rehabilitation center in Roehampton for just over two weeks was
confirmed by the website TSNsnooker.com, one of O'Sullivan's
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old's manager, Ian Doyle, was stunned by the news,
but vowed that his player would bounce back.
</P>
<P>
Doyle said: "It came as a shock to all of us that Ronnie had
checked into the Priory because those around him were unaware that
he had any kind of problem."
</P>
<P>
"This is not the kind of news you wish to hear about any player,
but at least Ronnie has been man enough to admit he has a serious
problem, and has done something about it for himself," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Wishes to Reinforce Coordination of Euro Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- France wishes to reinforce
coordination of economic and financial policies of the 11 euro
zone countries during its six-month presidency in the European
Union, said French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry
Laurent Fabius Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, Fabius said that of
the priorities for the French EU presidency is to give more ``
visibility'' to euro zone countries on the international monetary
scene.
</P>
<P>
He said that the weakness of euro which has been seen since its
creation in January 1999 is partly caused by a lack of
coordination by its members.
</P>
<P>
A better coordination in the policies of exchange rate, budget,
tax and structural reform by euro countries is needed to
strengthen the single currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fabius is serving from now in six months as the president of
the council of economy and finance ministers of the 15 EU
countries and president of the informal council of the 11 euro
countries called Euro-11.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that from now Euro-11 be called ``Eurogroup'' as
Greece will soon join the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
He said that a strengthening of coordination by euro zone
governments does not mean a weakening of the independence of the
Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB), which runs the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
``The ECB can only be happy with a clearer vision of the
policies carried out in the euro zone,'' he said.

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- France will push for the building of
a planned European rapid reaction force during its six-month
rotating presidency in the European Union (EU) which started this

``Before the end of the year, we wish to obtain the commitment

of technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe is expected to have by 2003 a force which
can fulfil the mission of interfering or reestablishing peace in ``
a European theater or that close to Europe.''

``Our objective is to be able to deploy in 60 days, for a

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Bank customers in Britain are
celebrating victory in the long-running battle over cash machine
fees after three major banks announced abandoning all plans to
charge for the use of ATMs from January 1.
</P>
<P>
Lloyds TSB is the last main High Street bank to drop plans to
charge other banks' customers for using their cash machines.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of an industry-wide charging scheme represents a
victory for consumers, whose anger in the face of higher bank
charges prompted many banks to change their policy.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, UK banks have come under fire from
consumers and regulators alike. A Consumers Association
spokeswoman added: "This is a major victory for consumers."
</P>
<P>
A Nationwide spokesman said: "We welcome Barclays' decision,
and that of HSBC. We have never believed that it was right for
people to have to pay to withdraw their own money from a cash
machine."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientist Suggests New Way of Understanding AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. genome scientist Monday
called for research to focus more on the role of the human genome
in AIDS, saying that the perspective could possibly provide new
methods of controlling AIDS progression.
</P>
<P>
"This new understanding of AIDS could be the first practical
application of the human genome project," said a statement by Dr.
Howard Urnovitz, scientific director of the Chronic Illness
Research Foundation and chief science officer of a California-
based biotech company.
</P>
<P>
Urnovitz's insight into the role of HIV into AIDS targets the
upcoming 13th International AIDS Conference to be held in Durban,
South Africa. One topic the conference will be addressed is the
decade old debate of what role the virus HIV plays in AIDS. More
than 5,000 scientists worldwide have signed a statement called the
Durban Declaration, resounding assertion that HIV causes AIDS and
calling for an immediate end to the debate on the fundamental
causal relationship between AIDS and HIV.
</P>
<P>
Instead of a classic viral disease, Urnovitz suggests AIDS is a
"host vs. genome disease" with an associated virus. The role of
HIV can best be described in computer science terms as a "router,"
he said. A router is a device that chooses the best pathway for
information to travel from one information network to another. HIV
appears to route new genomic code to CD4 T cells, the most common
cell eliminated in the course of AIDS progression.
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom is that HIV directly kills CD4 T cells.
Urnovitz said that research supports another mechanism where the
CD4 T cells are eliminated by the host's own immune cells, a
condition known as "graft vs. host" disease.
</P>
<P>
The missing link in AIDS research is the role the human genome
plays in the disease, according to the genome scientist, who
discovered the role of the human genome in veterans suffering from
Persian Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
He describes the role of "poikilogenic" agents in chronic
diseases like AIDS. Poikilogens, from Greek for "generators of
diversity," have only recently been recognized due primarily to
the mapping of the human genome. Poikilogenic agents are those
toxic entities -- chemicals, radiological or biological -- that
create genetic diversity. The product of these agents is often the
creation of new genetic material reshuffled from the original
blueprint obtained from each parent.
</P>
<P>
According to Urnovitz, the most likely role of HIV in AIDS is
to route information of toxic exposures to CD4 T cells. The body's
own while blood cells attack the CD4 T cells that have been
exposed to these new genetic sequences.

<HEADLINE> WB Program for Danube Delta Ends Successfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) project for
the preservation of bio-diversity in the Danube Delta reached a
successful completion, reported the official Rompres news agency
on Monday, quoting WB officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The non-refundable financial assistance project, worth 4.5
million U.S. dollars, was signed with the World Bank in 1994 and
unfolded over five years in collaboration with the Romanian
Ministry of Woods and Environmental Protection, the Administration
of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reservation and the Danube Delta
National Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives were to increase environmental protection,
the drawing up of a program for the monitoring and inventory of
eco-systems and the restoring of 60,000-ha reed plantation.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Reservation of the Danube Delta encompasses 580,000
hectares, the equivalent of 2.5 percent of Romania's landmass, and
is the third in importance after the Amazon Delta and the Nile
Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Danube Delta area is home to hundreds of bird species and
it is the only sanctuary in the world which 176 of these species
can tolerate for nesting.
</P>
<P>
Rare birds like the red-collar duck, accounting for 90 percent
of the world population, the white egret, 71 percent, and the
Lilliputian cormorant, 61 percent, have found their home in the
Danube Delta area.
</P>
<P>
The waters of the Danube Delta accommodate numberless fishes,
of which some of industrial value, like carp, catfish, pike, and
migratory sturgeons.
</P>
<P>
In December 1990, the Natural Reservation of the River Danube
Delta was included by UNESCO into the world cultural heritage.

<HEADLINE> 25,000 Year-Old Archeological Site Discovered in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of archeologists from
France and Sao Paulo announced Monday, after 17 years of
investigation, the discovery of relics dating 25,000 years in
Brazil's central Mato Grosso state.
</P>
<P>
The archeological site, known as the second oldest in Brazil,
is found at Santa Elina Ranch, 80 kilometers from Cuiaba, capital
of the state.
</P>
<P>
At this place, cave paintings were found with images of men,
animals and other representations. According to archeologists,
cave painting was prehistoric people's way to communicate.
</P>
<P>
Also were discovered at the place local fragments of giant
sloth, extinct for about 10,000 years, and according to the bones,
one of these animals measured 3 meters in length.
</P>
<P>
The finding of the archeological site takes investigators to
the conclusion that the presence of man in Mato Grosso dates, at
least, 25,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The investigation's results, according to archeologists, are
basic for questioning regarding the arrival of man to America.

<HEADLINE> British Minister: Zimbabwe "May Need Emergency Food Aid" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain warned on Monday that
Zimbabwe could need emergency food aid within months.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office minister Peter Hain, who is responsible for
relations with Africa, said that Zimbabwe could soon face food
shortages as a result of the country's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe could need food aid within "a matter of months" unless
President Robert Mugabe's government changes its policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real risk now, in fact a probability, of starvation
in a country that should comfortably be able to feed itself," he
told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Hain said he is concerned that the uncertainty over the farms
is having an impact on agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe, facing its worst economic crisis since
independence from Britain in 1980, was likely to see economic
output drop by 10 percent next year for a second year.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is increasing...to frightening levels," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Hain is scheduled to visit Africa from Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Continued Support For Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday urged the international community to fulfill the
pledges of assistance it made recently to the Central African
Republic.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan noted the
successful transition from the U.N. Mission in the Central African
Republic (MINURCA) to the U.N. Peace-building Support Office (
BONUCA), established last February to support the Government's
efforts to consolidate peace and national reconciliation and begin
national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Government held "high hopes" that the
international support demonstrated at the May 15-16 Special Donors
Meeting in New York can now be translated into concrete action to
help meet the country's most critical needs, including the ongoing
National Program for Demobilization and Reintegration.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the donor community to make every effort to assure
an early fulfillment of the pledge made during the meeting so that
security and development projects can soon commence," the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that the international community should remain
engaged in the Central African Republic and take the "extra steps"
needed to complete the task of consolidating peace and stability
there.
</P>
<P>
"In practical terms, this means strengthening the national
capacity of the country to provide for its own security in the
newly restored democratic order," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sends Reconnaissance Team to Eritrea, Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mission, led by Major-General Timothy Ford of Australia,
included military, political, legal and humanitarian experts, U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement coincided with the release of Annan's June 30
report to the Security Council in which he said the long-awaited
agreement signed on June 18 under the auspices of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) was an extremely vital step towards the
restoration of peace.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the mission will make recommendations on a concept
of operations for a U.N. peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
He is also sending liaison officers to the capitals of Eritrea
and Ethiopia to help plan the operation. Once the peacekeeping
force is approved by the Security Council, the officers would be
followed by military observer teams stationed in each capital.
</P>
<P>
Up to 100 U.N. military observers would gradually be deployed
in each country over the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief urged the two Horn of Africa neighbors to
cooperate fully with the OAU in the envisaged second phase of
proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of war in May 1998 along a border poorly
demarcated after Eritrea's independence in 1993 has reportedly
cost over 100,000 lives. Five days after fighting was renewed on
May 12 this year, the Security Council imposed an arms embargo on
the two countries for 12 months.

<P>
ATHENS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Athens News Agency (ANA)
and Turkey's Anatolian Agency (AA) signed here Monday an agreement
for cooperation in order to give the peoples of the two countries
more direct and fuller information regarding developments and
prospects in the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first of its kind between the two news
agencies, was signed by ANA General Director Andreas
Christodoulides and his Turkish counterpart, Mehmet Guler.
</P>
<P>
The pact calls for the daily exchange of news items and
photographs, the exchange of know-how and experiences and joint
activities.
</P>
<P>
The two general directors stressed at the signing ceremony
that they would help improve relations between the two long-time
rivals and promote a peaceful approach in dealing with the
outstanding problems that continue to exist between them.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 26 years because of their territorial
dispute in the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the
two neighbors have since last June taken steps to better their
strained relations by the holding of several rounds of low-level
talks and the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation
agreements.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said Monday after talks with visiting Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides that relations between Greece and Turkey would never be
fully normalized unless there was a solution to the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Reportedly Quiet After Last Week's Attacks on U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The casualties among U.N. peacekeepers were all caused when the
lead vehicle in the Jordanian patrol took a direct hit from a
rocket-propelled grenade, Silva said.
</P>
<P>
According the spokesman, the Jordanians returned fire in self-
defense and obliterated the house from which the firing was coming,
killing at least 10 attackers.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident later Friday night, Jordanian troops
deployed at Rokel Bridge were fired upon by a small group of
unidentified attackers and returned fire, and there were no
casualties within the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Silva said Sierra Leone rebels had stepped up executions, rape
and recruitment of child fighters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said information from civilians fleeing areas
controlled by the rebel RUF indicated "recent fighting had been
accompanied by a rise in human rights violations".
</P>
<P>
The violations included "summary executions, rape and sexual
abuse, and the recruitment of child soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
There was no change in the 222 Indian peacekeepers and 11
military observers who are surrounded by the RUF in Kailahun, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire faltered earlier this year when U.N. peacekeepers
moved too close to diamond-mining areas the rebels controlled. The
RUF took hostage some 500 U.N. troops, which they have since
released, and besieged 233 others, which they have still not
allowed to leave from their surrounded base.

<HEADLINE> Former IMF Director Calls L. America to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Managing Director of
International Monetary Fund ( IFM) Michael Camdessus called Monday
on Latin America to fight against poverty through excellence in
political measures and a deep restructuring of resource
redistribution criteria.
</P>
<P>
In his dissertation at Argentine-European Union Forum,
Camdessus said that Latin America "holds the world record for
inequality," speaking at the opening of an Argentine-European
Union meeting.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told the some 500 business leaders at the meeting
here that inequality was so high there because "we have failed in
the distribution of resources."
</P>
<P>
The French economist also emphasized the positive effects of
globalization, saying that there is no reversal possible in the
process of world integration.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is the main risk and the most important for the world,
Camdessus said, stressing the necessity to "give social responses"
and at the same time defending openness to the flux of
international capital.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has left behind years of protectionism and paid
an important social cost, Machinea said.
</P>
<P>
Being 13-year IMF director, he admitted that globalizing still
had assignments awaiting that mustn't be forgotten, and countries
have to work on this question to achieve a solid macroeconomic
framework and consolidating of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Without rules, it's imprudent to enter the turbulent waters of
globalization. Governments should assume responsibility to enforce
rules, he added.
