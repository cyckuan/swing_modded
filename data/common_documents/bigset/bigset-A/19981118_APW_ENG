Hercules lands in Antarctic crevasse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An American C-130 Hercules plane landed
in a crevasse in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, this week, causing
unspecified damage to the U.S. dlrs 25 million plane.
	   Simon Stephenson of the United States National Science
Foundation said from Antarctica's McMurdo Base that the Hercules
had completed a reconnaissance flight of the ice before attempting
to land.
	   While it was taxiing, one of the skis dropped into a crevasse.
Crevasses are often covered by thin layers of snow.
	   The accident happened at an ice stream about 2 1/2 hours by
plane from McMurdo. There were seven crew aboard and four other
passengers.
	   They turned off the power and left the aircraft before being
rescued by another plane. No one was hurt in the accident.
	   Stephenson said it was unclear whether the plane would be
removed from the isolated spot this year, but salvagers would
return next year if necessary.
	   ``It's pretty safe where it is,'' said Stephenson. ``Nobody's
going to touch it, and it's not going to move.''
	   The plane was one of five operated by the Air National Guard of
New York.

Co-chairman Schrempp rejects 'platform strategy' at
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler AG apparently won't follow the
approach of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and other
competitors in aggressively designing more models from the same
basic car or truck.
	   To save costs, automakers have been moving toward using fewer
common ``platforms'' _ the chassis, drivetrain and other major
parts _ to produce more models with different sheet metal.
	   ``I generally don't believe in a platform strategy,'' said
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp in an interview
Tuesday.
	   ``I don't think we really should try to fool our customers in
building almost the same car with a different design,'' said
Schrempp, who headed Daimler-Benz before it was merged with
Chrysler Corp. last week. ``That is what we decided and it
definitely has been a very successful policy of Mercedes-Benz.''
	   Schrempp said he wasn't opposed to sharing parts among different
cars, but not to the extent that two models have nearly identical
underpinnings.
	   ``When you go into the componentry, obviously you can use
similar axles or similar steering boxes,'' he said. ``But the
combination of all that is what makes the car. And we will not have
a combination of it, which some people call a platform, where you
have the same basic car and the only thing you change is the design
of the body.''

Indonesian military apologizes for killings in newspaper ads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military took out newspaper
advertisements Wednesday to apologize for the killings of at least
16 people during anti-government protests and riots last week.
	   Eight students were among those who died in the worst unrest
since former President Suharto quit in May and handed power to his
longtime protege, B.J. Habibie.
	   The victims also included civilian security guards and security
personnel. Hundreds of students were injured, many hit by plastic
bullets fired by riot officers.
	   Facing a public outcry and calls for his ouster, military chief
Gen. Wiranto and his commanders expressed their sorrow for the
victims in quarter- and half-page ads in several Jakarta dailies.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
read the advertisement.
	   ``We say prayers for all the injured victims who are still in
the hospital and hope that they get well soon so they can go back
to work and do their usual activities,'' it said.
	   Clashes broke out when thousands of students who want swift
democratic change tried to march to Parliament, where a special
assembly was deliberating on political reforms.
	   Habibie has pledged to hold parliamentary elections next year
and dismantle Suharto's rigid political system, but protesters
suspect he is not sincere about reforms.

Troops guard Parliament as it promises to enact reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Military Ads &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of troops guarded
Indonesia's Parliament Wednesday as its speaker promised it would
enact political reforms opposed by students in deadly clashes with
the military last week.
	   He warned that any delay to the reform process could ``trigger
new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation, now beset
by political and economic turmoil.
	   In a speech that opened a new session of the legislature,
Speaker Harmoko said parliamentary elections in May or early June
1999 would be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct,
open to all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired plastic bullets at protesters. Other people,
including some police, died when rioting broke out in parts of
Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   City authorities said 123 buildings and 97 cars were damaged or
set afire, The Jakarta Post newspaper reported.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto took out advertisements in
several national newspapers expressing his ``sincere condolences''
for last week's deaths.
	   The opposition and students have demanded that Wiranto resign as
armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of the
shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.
	   It was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people in
May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   ``For those who died outside the Parliament we deliver our
condolences and hope that the deaths will prove to be meaningful in
the long term,'' Harmoko said.
	   Police have questioned more than a dozen opposition figures,
including two retired generals, in a sedition inquiry.
	   Suharto's successor and one-time protege President B.J. Habibie
has alleged that the student protests had been orchestrated by
conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted police as saying those questioned were
suspected of subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of
lifetime imprisonment.
	   Despite the heavy military presence around the Parliament,
students said they would stage street protests later Wednesday.
	   Last week's bloodshed erupted after tens of thousands of
students tried to march on the green-domed legislature where the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly approved a range of
political reforms sponsored by Habibie.
	   These reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly but is now sitting in its own
right.
	   The process to make the reforms into law is expected to take
several months, and Harmoko called on Indonesians to give the
Parliament a chance to implement the changes in line with the
constitution and not to be provoked by ``irresponsible parties.''
	   Although the reforms called for new elections and go some way in
dismantling Suharto's authoritarian legacy, the students and other
critics say that they do not represent true democratic reform.
	   They have demanded that the powerful military be banned from
political activity and that Suharto be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Instead the assembly merely approved a decree to reduce the
number of seats the military will have in Parliament from a current
75 to 55.
	   While it also named Suharto in a decree calling for a full
corruption investigation, critics say the move is largely cosmetic.
	   Despite vehement student opposition, Harmoko said the reforms
represent the true aspirations of Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   Once they were made law, Parliament would have a duty to ensure
that Habibie's government would carry them out quickly, he said.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Goals by Luis Hernandez and Oscar Mascorro
lifted Mexico to a 2-0 victory over El Salvador in the opener of a
soccer tournament to raise money to help the Central American
victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Tuesday night's match, the first of Project Soccer Relief '98,
attracted a predominately Hispanic crowd of nearly 35,000 to the
Los Angeles Coliseum. Proceeds will go to CARE, an international
relief agency.
	   Governments of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala
say at least 10,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were left
homeless in their countries when Mitch rampaged across Central
America.
	   CONCACAF, the federation that governs soccer in North America,
organized the tournament in conjunction with CARE.
	   Guatemala played Honduras in Tuesday night's second game. The
winners and losers play Wednesday night to conclude the tournament.

In editorial from jail, Anwar calls for end to corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In an editorial he wrote from
jail, Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim blamed his government's
``corruption and nepotism'' for Asia's economic woes.
	   ``Clearly, many of our problems could have been avoided if there
had been greater commitment to eradicating subsidies, monopolies
and favoritism,'' Anwar wrote in Wednesday's edition of The Asian
Wall Street Journal.
	   Published on the final day of the 21-member Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit here, the editorial outlines his
recommendations for revitalizing the region's economies.
	   The former deputy prime minister was jailed on charges of abuse
of power and sexual misconduct after launching a nationwide,
anti-government reform movement. He contends the charges against
him were fabricated by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
government. Anwar also says he was badly beaten in jail.
	   ``It is not normal to conduct economic discourse from behind
prison walls. But these are not normal times in Malaysia, nor
indeed in much of Asia,'' he wrote.
	   Anwar accused Mahathir and other Asian leaders of using their
power to enrich friends and stamp out true democracy.
	   ``In the case of Malaysia, it is unfortunate that Dr. Mahathir
Mohamad, who in the past has lectured the peasantry about their
`subsidy mentality,' has descended from his pedestal to promote the
worst kind of subsidy mentality among his cronies and the super
rich,'' Anwar said.
	   ``So many vested interests are at stake,'' he wrote. ``Unless
the gale of creative destruction is unleashed on these rent-seeking
and parasitic corporate activities, however, the Asian economy will
never regain its past vigor.''
	   He urged leaders of APEC to broaden the group's focus beyond
economic issues to include questions of human rights, social and
cultural reform, and the independence of courts.
	   ``It has been argued that APEC is an economic organization, not
a political forum. But economics and politics are so intermingled
that any clear-cut separation is an illusion,'' he wrote.
	   Vice President Al Gore infuriated the Malaysian government
Monday night with a speech in which he expressed a similar view and
indirectly communicated support for Anwar.
	   Several politicians attending this week's APEC forum have met
with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, in a show of support for her
campaign to free her husband.
	   Azizah said she was grateful that the meetings focused world
attention on Malaysia and on her husband's case.
	   ``I think at least the world has given due attention to my
husband,'' she said, after a meeting Tuesday with former Australian
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans.
	   Evans, a deputy opposition leader in Australia's parliament, was
in Kuala Lumpur to address a business advisory council meeting
alongside the APEC summit.
	   Azizah also met with U.S., Australian and Canadian Cabinet
ministers during the APEC forum and with Philippine President
Joseph Estrada. All of them sympathized with her and Anwar.

Free-trade summit in Malaysia ends with modest proposals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 7 grafs with statement praising China and Japan for
their efforts
 &UR; AP Photos APEC101-119, APEC150-158
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's worst
economic crisis in decades, following a disappointing summit
overshadowed by conflicts about human rights and free trade.
	   The group's final statement, to be released later Wednesday,
praised signs of recovery in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
It said these hard-hit countries should continue adopting painful
reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also
called for more financial assistance from the international
community, and endorsed a U.S. proposal to speed emergency loans to
the Asian countries at the center of the crisis.
	   Despite the strong anti-free market views promoted by this
year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC
statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign exchange
trading or new controls on the movement of capital in and out of
countries.
	   Offering Mahathir a consolation prize, the statement did call
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that the
agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily,
without proper review.
	   ``We are resolved to work together to support an early and
sustained recovery in the region to contain risk and contagion, and
prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, which was to be read by Mahathir at the conclusion of
the two-day summit by APEC leaders.
	   The statement also praised China for maintaining the value of
its currency, the yuan, and Japan for announcing a new stimulus
package and reform measures to revive its ailing economy.
	   The free-trade forum was overshadowed by a diplomatic furor set
off by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and by a disagreement between
the United States and Japan which forced the group to delay a
landmark free-trade agreement.
	   The pact would have slashed tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in
world trade. But opposition by Japan to opening up two of the nine
proposed sectors _ fishing and forestry products _ forced APEC to
send the plan to the 124-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva
for resolution.
	   But Gore also announced an agreement with Japan on a joint
approach to dealing with the financial crisis, including a dlrs 10
billion support package designed to help struggling Asian nations.
	   Half the money will come from the United States and the other
half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The assistance, although small compared with the magnitude of
the region's debt burdens, should help assure nervous financial
markets that the world's two largest economies have put aside past
bickering over the best approaches to take.
	   Gore's decision to deliver a speech on the eve of the summit
that sympathized with the host country's anti-government reform
movement caused divisions among APEC's leaders.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Gore's
remarks could put the nation's democratic process at risk. And APEC
officials from Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand urged the vice
president to stick to economic issues during the meetings.
	   Nevertheless, Gore defended his speech, saying that nations
fighting off economic crises must work as hard to promote
democracy. Gore was a stand-in for President Bill Clinton, who
stayed in Washington because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   Protests by supporters of Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim have
occurred in the country since the deputy prime minister was fired,
arrested and put on trial after challenging Mahathir's 17-year
rule.
	   During the APEC meetings, top officials from the U.S.,
Philippine, Canadian and Australian delegations met privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to sympathize with his campaign and to
express concern over his treatment and trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   With Asia in its worst financial crisis in decades, the APEC
summit was intended to be a chance for the leaders to recommend
measures that would help revive economic growth and stabilize
currency and stock markets.
	   The crisis, which began in July 1997 in Thailand, has spread to
Russia and is threatening Brazil and other Latin American nations.
The U.S. economy has even felt the effects.
	   As expected, the final statement appeared to hew closely to the
Clinton administration's free-market, pro-IMF handling of the
crisis. The IMF has organized loan packages totaling nearly dlrs
120 billion to Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bolster
their economies. In return, it has demanded the nations adopt
unpopular measures that have sent interest rates soaring and
unemployment rising. Not all Asia's leaders have embraced the IMF
formula.
	   Mahathir has criticized the bailout programs and blamed Asia's
woes on foreign currency speculators. In September, he banned
trading of the national currency outside the country and imposed
controls on foreigners trying to pull money out of Malaysia.
	   Gore said the new dlrs 10 billion support package that he
announced during the APEC meetings would help speed debt
restructuring in the region.
	   It is likely to be used to guarantee bonds issued by Asian
countries, according to U.S. officials. The proceeds of the bonds
would be used to bolster Asian banks, which have some dlrs 2
trillion in problem loans.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Viduka agrees to terms with Scottish club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - Australian soccer international Mark
Viduka has agreed to terms with Scottish champions Celtic and is
awaiting legal approval before moving to the Glasgow club.
	   Croatia Zagreb has agreed to transfer the Australian striker to
Celtic on a four-year, 6 million US dlrs deal. Viduka's agents,
International Management Group (IMG), said Wednesday Viduka had
worked out personal terms with Celtic.
	   Bernie Mandich, IMG's director of football operations, said
there was a good chance Viduka would join Celtic before Saturday's
clash with bitter rivals Rangers.
	   ``Mark and Celtic have come to an official arrangement and they
are now making sure that everything is in place legally,'' Mandich
said. Viduka still has to gain a work permit to play in Scotland.
	   Mandich also played down reports that Manchester United was
looking to buy into an Australian club.
	   A report Wednesday in the Sydney Morning Herald said United
manager Alex Ferguson was committed to the concept of United
investing heavily in Australian soccer, probably through buying a
stake in a national league club.
	   But Mandich said approaches had been made to Manchester United
and Liverpool about becoming involved in Australian soccer about a
month ago.
	   ``The general feeling was that it's in the too-hard basket,
they're certainly not in a hurry to do something,'' Mandich said.

Australians hoping for compensation deal over bridge collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A proposed compensation deal for
Australian victims of a bridge collapse in Israel would save years
of traumatic legal battles, victims' families said Wednesday.
	   But they also said justice would not be done until the group
that organized the ill-fated Maccabiah Games was overhauled and its
bosses had resigned.
	   Four Australians died after a footbridge collapsed at the
opening ceremony of the 1997 Maccabiah Games outside of Tel Aviv.
Jewish athletes participate in the games, which are held every four
years.
	   Micha Goldman, the Knesset (parliamentary) inquiry chairman,
said from Israel that he would propose the Israeli government
negotiate a financial settlement with the Australians, pay the
money, and later recover it from responsible parties.
	   Colin Elterman, whose teenage daughter Sasha spent 10 months in
critical condition in the hospital after she was thrown into the
polluted Yarkon River, said the comments showed the parliamentary
inquiry was ``trying to do the right thing in a sense.''
	   ``We welcome anything that they do that short-circuits the legal
process, providing the compensation is adequate,'' Elterman said
Wednesday.
	   He said the deal would save many Australians from lengthy court
cases that could last for up to six years, and would also mean they
would not have to wait until criminal cases under way were resolved
before compensation was made.
	   Five Israelis, including the chairman of the Maccabiah
organizing committee, are on trial in a Tel Aviv court for criminal
negligence charges in the collapse.
	   However, Elterman said there was no indication from the Israeli
government whether it would accept the compensation proposal, and
it would be about six months before the families saw any of the
money.
	   ``It will probably come out of the recommendation of this
inquiry which is probably going to run until the middle of next
year, but it's a good sign,'' he said.
	   On Tuesday, the Australian Jewish community took the case to the
General Assembly, a conference of about 4,000 North American Jewish
leaders taking place this week in Jerusalem.
	   The Australians are pressing for the resignation of Maccabi
World Union President Ronnie Bakalarz and Executive Director Uzi
Netanel as well as for financial compensation.
	   ``We think that is the proper thing to do. We think that is what
is normally the process that would take place in a western
democratic society,'' said Ron Weiser, president of the Zionist
Federation of Australia and a representative of the Executive
Council for Australian Jewry.

Singapore community leaders: workers should not bear brunt of
</HEADLINE>
cost-cutting

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore community leaders are questioning why
workers should bear the brunt of upcoming cost-cutting measures and
want the government to do more, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   A government-appointed panel recently recommended significant
wage-related cuts as the principal component to a 10 billion
Singapore dollar (dlrs 6 billion) package reducing business costs
to turn around the ailing economy.
	   The pro-business authorities plan to slash labor costs by about
15 percent, through pay cuts of between 5 percent and 8 percent and
a 50 percent reduction in employers' contributions to the mandatory
state-run pension fund.
	   Under the plan, workers will suffer the most, while the
cash-rich government _ with reserves totaling 125 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 76 billion) _ will only bear about 30 percent of the
total cost-cutting, mainly by lowering rentals, tariffs, levies,
utilities and other mild cutbacks.
	   During closed door meetings on Monday and Tuesday involving
grassroots elders, unionists and corporate leaders, many urged the
government to take on a greater share of the burden in cutting
business expenses.
	   They are ``concerned about how the lower-income groups will be
affected by the (pension) and wage cuts,'' Parliament member Ang
Mong Seng, who chaired one of the meetings, was quoted as saying in
The Straits Times newspaper.
	   Community leaders pressed the government to match the proposed 7
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.3 billion) in wage-related
reductions with deeper cuts in government charges.
	   Participants also suggested a lower goods and services tax,
which stands at 3 percent, and exemption from wage cuts for those
earning 1,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 610) or less a month,
reported The Business Times. Supermarket prices could also be
lowered, they said.
	   ``From my discussions with the grassroots people, the concern is
that wage cuts are going to eat into their take-home pay,''
Parliament member Yaacob Ibrahim was quoted as saying in The New
Paper. ``The feeling is that, `Fine, you can cut my pay but can you
make up for it in other ways?'''
	   Singapore's Parliament will meet on Nov. 23-24 to discuss the
proposed measures, though many observers expect the government to
adopt the plan as it stands.

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Soldiers failed to keep scrap dealers
away from a military dump where the army set off two explosions to
destroy old ammunition, and the blasts killed six of the dealers
and injured three, the army said Wednesday.
	   The blasts occurred in rapid succession Tuesday night at the
military dump at Khundroo village, 65 miles (40 miles) south of the
Kashmir state capital of Srinagar. Soldiers posted there were
outnumbered by village scrap dealers who frequent the dump and
failed to keep them out the area of the explosions, army spokesman
Maj. P. Purushottam said.
	   The villagers were trying to salvage copper, lead and iron from
containers and spent ammunition. Across India, villagers scrounging
for scrap metal often are killed in blasts at military ranges.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors resumed their
monitoring of suspected arms sites in Iraq Wednesday after a halt
of more than two weeks.
	   Some six U.N. vehicles accompanied by half a dozen Iraqi cars
set off from U.N. headquarters in the eastern outskirts of Baghdad
to sites which are being monitored.
	   ``The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center has resumed
full-range activities,'' Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for U.N.
inspectors in Iraq, told The Associated Press.
	   The inspectors are looking forward to ``a productive and
professional relationship'' with Iraq, Cross said.

Dollar rises against yen, Japanese stocks finish higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished higher Wednesday on
expectations the government may offer further economic stimulus
measures as a visit to Japan by President Bill Clinton approaches.
The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 186.23
points, or 1.29 percent, closing the day at 14,599.23. On Tuesday,
the average lost 15.27 points, or 0.11 percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.24 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.62
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 121.00 yen overnight.
	   Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hinted in
Washington on Tuesday that Clinton will be pushing Japan to move
its economy forward when he visits Tokyo on Thursday and Friday.
	   Summers' comments have raised hopes that Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi may respond with more stimulus measures when he meets with
Clinton, traders said.
	   ``With Clinton coming here, Obuchi has to look good,'' said
Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Traders said Japan is also under pressure to do more to
stimulate its economy at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum meeting under way in Malaysia.
	   Buying by Japanese public funds and by some overseas investors
largely contributed to the rise in the Nikkei index, traders said.
	   ``There appears to be an inflow of public funds,'' said Naoki
Takahashi of Marusan Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.77 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,113.42. The
TOPIX closed up 2.15 points, or 0.19 percent Tuesday.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 24.97 points _ or 0.28 percent _ to close Tuesday's session
at 8,986.28.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened on buying by
Japanese institutional investors and importers as well as some
purchases by speculators looking to cover short, or oversold,
dollar positions, traders said.
	   But traders said the currency quickly lost upward momentum in
the absence of fresh market-moving news on Wednesday, a day after
the U.S. Federal Reserve cut key interest rates.
	   The Fed announced Tuesday it cut two rates by a quarter
percentage point for the third time in less than two months.
	   The federal funds rate, charged on overnight loans between
banks, dropped to 4.75 percent, and the discount rate, which the
Fed charges on its own loans to banks, fell to 4.5 percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.840 percent from 0.855 percent Tuesday, driving its
price up to 108.50 yen from 108.36 yen.

Atherton cleared for first test

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England opening batsman Michael
Atherton will play in the first Ashes cricket test against
Australia starting in Brisbane Friday after passing a fitness test.
	   The former England captain, who was given a cortisone injection
in his lower back, was included in a 12-man squad named Wednesday
for the opening match of the Ashes series.
	   Fellow batsman John Crawley was also included in the squad after
being assaulted in Cairns in north Queensland state on Sunday
night. Crawley suffered cuts and bruises to his face but was one of
seven batsmen named by England.
	   With England's other opener, Mark Butcher, in poor form with
just nine runs in five first-class innings this tour, Atherton's
importance in the five test series has increased greatly.
	   Australian pace spearhead Glenn McGrath immediately pledged to
give Atherton, whose movement will be restricted because of the
injury, a torrid time.
	   ``I'll probably loosen him up with a few short ones,'' said
McGrath. ``If he's got a bit of a dodgy back then he's probably not
getting under short balls as well as he would like to do.''
	   ``I've had quite a bit of success against Athers, last time he
was captain as well as probably one of the linchpins in the team.
If we can knock him over early it sets us up and puts us in a
better position.''
	   However, former England great Ian Botham warned Australia not to
underestimate Atherton's fighting qualities.
	   ``He's a world-class player and not many sides have got players
of that sort of quality,'' Botham said. ``England will be delighted
in the camp that he has passed a fitness test.''
	   And he also said Butcher would rise to the challenge of the
Ashes opener.
	   ``I'll just take you back to the series in England (last year),
a lot of your so-called experts and ex-players were calling for
Australian captain Mark Taylor's head,'' Botham said.
	   ``They had that shoved back down their throats so I wouldn't
shout too much about Butcher yet.''
	   The teams:
	   AUSTRALIA: Mark Taylor (captain), Steve Waugh, Michael Slater,
Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, , Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Damien
Fleming, Stuart MacGill, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath, Michael
Kasprowicz (12th man to be named).
	   ENGLAND: Alec Stewart (captain), Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher,
Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, John Crawley,
Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Angus Fraser, Alan Mullally, Darren
Gough (12th man to be named).

U.N. resumes monitoring of Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors resumed their
monitoring of suspected arms sites in Iraq on Wednesday for the
first time in more than two weeks, after Baghdad agreed to resume
cooperation with inspectors under the threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   Some six U.N. vehicles accompanied by half a dozen Iraqi cars
set off from U.N. headquarters in the eastern outskirts of Baghdad,
heading for sites where they will search for signs of banned
weapons programs.
	   The monitors have resumed ``full-range activities'' and are
hoping for ``a production and professional relationship'' with
Iraq, inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said.
	   Cross declined to say where the monitors were heading or what
specifically they were looking for.
	   At first, the inspectors are expected to visit declared arms
sites where they have already installed cameras and sensors for
long-term monitoring.
	   The real challenge will come later, when they begin surprise
checks on sites where U.N. arms experts suspect Iraq has been
hiding evidence of banned chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Iraq suspended monitoring activities of the U.N. Special
Commission on Oct. 31. The United States and Britain threatened
airstrikes against Iraq unless it removed its restrictions. Iraq
backed down Saturday as air and missile attacks were about to be
unleashed.
	   Inspectors from the United Nations and the International Atomic
Energy Agency were withdrawn last week. The inspectors, 80 from
UNSCOM and six from the IAEA, returned Tuesday after Iraq agreed to
allow them to resume their work.
	   Another six inspectors left Bahrain for Baghdad on Wednesday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi
forces overran Kuwait in 1990 can be lifted. Iraq says that it has
already complied with the U.N. demands.
	   Once the inspectors report they are able to work effectively,
the U.N. Security Council has pledged to conduct a review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq wants the review to lead to a quick lifting of U.N.
sanctions _ a move both the United States and Britain have
resisted.
	   The sanctions have devastated the country's economy.
	   Iraq banned inspectors from working on Aug. 5 and then cut off
long-term monitoring of its weapons program on Oct. 31.

IAAF declines to lift ban on Susantika Jayasinghe ahead of Asian

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The International Amateur Athletic
Federation declined Wednesday to lift its suspension of Sri Lankan
track star Susantika Jayasinghe, who has been accused of using a
banned drug.
	   Jayasinghe, who hopes to stage a comeback at the Asian Games in
Bangkok next month, already has been cleared of charges that she
took Nandralone-19 by the Sri Lankan Amateur Athletic Association.
But she must be cleared by the international body before she can
compete in the Bangkok games.
	   The IAAF's doping commission said in a letter to its Sri Lanka
counterpart Wednesday that Jayasinghe's case will be referred to an
arbitration panel that will meet Thursday and Friday.
	   China has lobbied the IAAF saying that bans on several Chinese
athletes should be reconsidered if Jayasinghe is allowed to take
part in the Bangkok games.
	   Jayasinghe, 23, who is Sri Lanka's best hope in the 100- and
200-meter races, tested positive for Nandralone-19 after a track
and field championship in Athens, where she finished ahead of
Jamaican star Merlene Ottey.
	   Jayasinghe denied taking Nandralone-19 and said she had simply
taken a drug to control her menstrual cycle. She claimed she was
set up by frustrated Sri Lankan sports officials and government
ministers after she resisted their amorous advances.

Lawyers ask court to reveal date of first Philippine execution in
</HEADLINE>
22 years &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lawyers for the first convict to be
executed in the Philippines in 22 years urged a judge Wednesday to
reveal the date of his execution so he could prepare for it.
	   The impending execution by lethal injection of Leo Echegaray,
38, would be the first since capital punishment was reimposed in
the country in 1994. A debate on the death penalty has divided
Filipinos.
	   On Monday, Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court, which convicted Echegaray of raping his stepdaughter
in 1994, issued an order to National Prisons Director Pedro Sistoza
to execute the convict.
	   It was not immediately known whether an execution date, required
to be a working day, had been set by Ponferrada. Under government
rules, Echegaray would not be informed of the date until after
sunrise on execution day, a prohibition described by his lawyers as
inhumane.
	   Theodore Te, Echegaray's lawyer, said he appealed to Ponferrada
to reconsider her execution order. If she fixes a date, he also
petitioned the judge to inform Echegaray in advance.
	   ``The confidentiality of the working day designated by the judge
deprives Mr. Echegaray of due process as well as the right to be
informed,'' he told reporters. There was no immediate reply from
the judge.
	   Philippine executions in the past customarily were carried out
on Fridays. Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84
criminals by electrocution.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty, but it
gave congress the option of restoring it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking. Legislators,
alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option when they brought back
executions, by electric chair and gassing, in 1994.
	   Two years later, the law was changed to prescribe lethal
injections as the only method of execution.
	   Echegaray is the first to be scheduled for execution among more
than 800 death-row inmates, all detained in a maximum-security
prison in suburban Muntinlupa City.
	   Proponents say the death penalty would deter crime by
frightening would-be criminals. They say crime remains rampant
because no one among the death row convicts has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death
penalty say there is no proof of that, and that the poor are
disadvantaged because they cannot afford good lawyers for their
defense.
	   President Joseph Estrada, who can grant clemency and save
Echegaray from death, has said he would not pardon the convict.

Graf, Hingis win Chase matches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th and 12th grafs to correct that Novotna, not Graf, had
calf cramps &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steffi Graf continued her remarkable resurgence
Tuesday night, advancing into the quarterfinals of the Chase
Championships with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1 victory over third-seeded
Jana Novotna.
	   After suffering a series of injuries and surgeries, Graf is
playing again like the woman who dominated women's tennis for a
decade.
	   Since undergoing wrist surgery in September, Graf has won 11
consecutive matches and two tournaments.
	   The top three players in the world have been among her last four
victims. And she has won her last nine matches in the season-ending
Championships at Madison Square Garden, having won the title in
both 1995 and 1996 before missing last year while recuperating from
knee surgery.
	   Also advancing into the quarterfinals Tuesday were second-seeded
Martina Hingis and No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat. Hingis beat Swiss Fed
Cup teammate Patty Schnyder 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, while Tauziat ousted
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 6-3, 6-1 earlier in the day.
	   Novotna became the Championships' first defending champion to
lose in the first round. But she ran into one of the best players
in history in Graf, who, because of a lack of matches, wasn't
seeded. And Novotna suffered cramps in both calves, taking an
injury timeout in the opening game of the final set.
	   With the Garden crowd solidly behind her, cheering loudly every
time she won a point, Graf put her feared forehand on display,
spraying winners all around the court.
	   But Novotna, who captured her first Grand Slam tournament title
this year when she won Wimbledon, was up to the task, matching Graf
stroke for stroke, point for point.
	   She won the first-set tiebreak when her forehand down the line
hit the top of the net and bounced over Graf, landing just inside
the baseline. Novotna blew a kiss skyward as she walked off the
court.
	   Graf didn't delay letting Novotna know she was in a battle. The
German broke Novotna to begin the second set. It was the only break
of the set, but the only one she needed.
	   Then came a long and decisive game to begin the third set.
	   Graf won the first point with a perfectly placed forehand down
the line. Novotna followed with a fault on the next point and
immediately walked to umpire Mike Morrissey and requested an injury
timeout. A trainer came on the court and worked on both calves.
	   The Czech Republic right-hander held serve, raising her arms in
mock triumph when she won the final point on an overhead. It was
the last game she would win.
	   Schnyder and Hingis engaged in long baseline barrages. Hingis
pulled off the first service break, in the fifth game of the
opening set when Schnyder made two forehand errors. But the
second-seeded Hingis gave the break right back in the next game
when she double-faulted on the last two points.
	   Both struggled to hold serve before Schnyder finally did in the
10th game to close out the first set, much to the displeasure of
Hingis. When a shot by Schnyder that appeared to hit the baseline
was not called long, Hingis whined, ``Come on.''
	   The loss of the set was like a wakeup call. Hingis ripped
through the next set as her penetrating groundstrokes kept Schnyder
back on her heels behind the baseline.
	   She was only getting her second wind.
	   The third set produced excellent tennis as both players found
the lines. Schnyder broke Hingis in the second game after the two
battled through three deuces. On the final point of the game, both
were at the net when Schnyder lofted a perfect lob volley over the
head of Hingis.
	   The Madison Square Garden crowd roared its approval.
	   Hingis broke right back, then won the next three games for a 4-2
lead, and after Schnyder held at love in the seventh game, Hingis
wrapped up the first-round victory by losing only three points in
the next two games.
	   The last time Tauziat and Zvereva played was at Wimbledon, with
Tauziat coming from behind to earn a hard-fought, three-set
victory.
	   Their match Tuesday had little excitement as Zvereva couldn't do
enough with the ball to create problems for the French veteran.
Tauziat kept hitting to Zvereva's backhand, a tactic that worked
repeatedly.
	   Tauziat pulled off the first service break in the match in the
sixth game of the first set for a 4-2 lead. That was followed by
two more breaks of serve, giving Tauziat a 5-3 lead. She closed out
the set when Zvereva's backhand down the line was wide.
	   It only took 37 minutes for Tauziat to wrap up the opening set,
and she sailed through the second set in 31 minutes.

Indian rebel arrested shopping for uniforms in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ A militant from neighboring India
arrested while shopping for uniforms in Bangladesh told police his
group had two camps in Bangladesh from which it launched attacks on
India, intelligence sources said Wednesday.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunil
Debanath Tripura was arrested Monday as he tried to buy 50 uniforms
from a source in the port city of Chittagong. He had been under
surveillance since police received information he had brought 100
uniforms since arriving in Chittagong about two weeks ago.
	   Tripura was not immediately charged. Under Bangladesh law, he
can be held without charge while police continue their
investigation.
	   Under interrogation, the sources said, Tripura admitted to being
a member of the All Tripura Tiger Force. The Tigers are drawn from
Tripuri tribes who have been reduced to a minority by waves of
immigration from Bangladesh and neighboring Indian states. They are
demanding more administrative autonomy in areas of tribal
domination.
	   He told the police the Tigers operate two camps in the jungles
along Bangladesh's border with India, from where about 80
guerrillas launch attacks on Tripura. He said he had visited
Chittagong twice in the past to buy arms and ammunition.
	   At a conference with Indian counterparts last month, Bangladeshi
military officials said they had tried and failed to locate the
camps of Indian insurgents New Delhi said existed in Bangladesh.
Dhaka in turn alleged there was a camp on Indian territory which
was training Bangladeshi insurgents opposing a peace accord reached
in December last year between the government and tribespeople in
the country's southern hill districts.
	   The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported Wednesday that police
arrested 35 members of the Tripura National Volunteers, another
militant group, about two months ago in northcentral Bangladesh.
	   Three leaders of rebels seeking independence for another
neighboring Indian state, Assam, were recently imprisoned in
Bangladesh after being convicted of entering the country illegally.
	   Several separatist fights are smoldering in India's northeastern
states.

Asians look to sky for spectacular meteor storm

<TEXT>
	   KADENA AIR BASE, Okinawa (AP) _ Star-gazers across Asia huddled
outside in the predawn chill Wednesday to admire luminous flares of
red and white streaking through the skies during the greatest
meteor shower in decades.
	   NASA sent up research planes from this U.S. Air Force base in
southern Japan in an attempt to glean hints about the origins of
life on Earth and the planet's relationship to the cosmos.
	   From Thailand's highest peak to the neon-drenched streets of
Tokyo, people in Asia _ where the meteors burned brightest _ lifted
their eyes to a magnificent spectacle of nature as the storm
reached its climax in the direction of the constellation Leo.
	   ``It's wonderful,'' said Toshiaki Kogai, one of hundreds of
Japanese who watched the storm from a park just south of Tokyo. ``I
never imagined it would be like this.''
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to dim their lights to
enhance viewing of the storm, which peaks every 33 years.
	   In Kanagawa prefecture (state) near Tokyo, a 19-year-old trade
school student died when she fell off the handrail of a bridge to
the concrete below while trying to see the cascading stars with her
friends, police said.
	   Minori Suzuki fell 15 meters (50 meters) to her death when she
tried to grab her shawl as wind blew it away, they said.
	   Though the night remained bright in the capital area, meteors
could be seen every two or three minutes at the height of the
shower.
	   Some appeared to fizzle as they fell. Others looked like moving
dots.
	   Each brought many a wish.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife out watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo
suburb of Yokohama.
	   In the United States, the best seats were wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest.
	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California early Tuesday were enthusiastic.
	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors. ``I could
see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the highway,''
she said.
	   One group was camping out in the Sandhills of central Nebraska,
getting away from city lights.
	   ``We're catching an average of two or three meteors a minute,
one of the best meteor showers I've seen in quite some time,''
Daniel Glomski said early Tuesday morning.
	   In northern Thailand, tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to
Doi Inthanon, the Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565
meters (8,464 feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed
Buddhist temple on top.
	   But clouds and lightning hindered the viewing.
	   The view was clearer in Norway, where rescuers were swamped with
calls from people who spotted what they thought were red distress
flares fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
	   NASA sent up two research planes to study the composition of
both comets and meteoroids _ and perhaps learn something about the
beginnings of life on Earth in the process.
	   ``We have a very unique opportunity here to get some information
about the way life may have arisen,'' said NASA astrobiology
specialist Gregg Schmidt.
	   Some scientists believe the elements necessary for life on Earth
may have been brought here by comets or meteorites.
	   The NASA planes will provide scientists with data to determine
the cosmic debris' molecular composition _ and find traces of any
organic material it may carry.
	   The shower is caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years, the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   NASA scientist Schmidt said the Leonid storm in 1833, for
example, packed as many as 10,000 meteors per hour.

what people saw,'' he said.

Navy program helps Hondurans cope with Mitch trauma

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Dust and laughter rise from the
playground, where barefoot boys kick a ball over a rutted field.
Javier Alexis Avila wishes the day would never end _ it keeps the
memories of Hurricane Mitch at bay.
	   When bedtime comes, the terror returns.
	   ``The days are better because I don't dream,'' the 10-year-old
said. ``At night I dream of all the things that happened, and then
I can't sleep any more.''
	   Mitch's rampage through Central America left an estimated 10,000
people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. The storm is gone,
but the nightmares endure. Beyond seeking food and medicine,
Honduras has asked the United States for help healing the
psychological scars left by Mitch.
	   Two Navy officers arrived this week to train Hondurans to deal
with post-traumatic syndrome. Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Roysden and Lt.
George Steffian are part of SPRINT _ short for Special
Psychological Rapid Intervention Team _ based in San Diego,
California.
	   They hope to train about 60 people, who in turn will train
others and eventually the goal is to reach most of the country's 6
million inhabitants.
	   Any traumatic event _ such as a plane crash or a bank holdup _
can leave lasting effects, said Roysden, a chaplain. It can affect
sleep, appetite, attention span, aggressiveness and the ability to
hold a job or maintain relationships.
	   Javier keeps reliving Mitch, which ripped through the Nueva
Esperanza district in the capital, washing out hillsides and
burying homes and families under tons of rock and mud.
	   ``Houses rolling head over foot, falling, falling, down to the
river, and then there was not even a trace. Our neighbor was
screaming, `My children, my children,' but they were all buried,''
he said. ``Snakes _ everywhere. They live under this earth, under
the houses, and when the earth moved they all came out.''
	   His parents and three sisters escaped, and the family moved into
a school converted into a shelter for the scores of homeless
families. But for Javier, Mitch is still all too real.
	   ``I pray every night and ask God not to let it happen again,''
he said. ``I ask my papa, `Please do not leave us alone, because if
it happens again we will have no one.' He tells me not to be afraid
and to trust in God, that he will make me strong. But still I am
afraid.''
	   The procedure for helping trauma victims starts with getting
people to talk about their experiences, rather than keeping it
bottled inside. Almost anyone can learn how to do it, Roysden said.
	   ``The more times you tell it, the more real it becomes. That's
just our human response,'' he said. ``It becomes something that can
be handled, rather than this nightmarish thing.''
	   The course here will become the model for a Spanish-language
trauma program, said Steffian, a psychologist. A special course
will be taught for dealing with trauma in children.
	   At a center for street kids in downtown Tegucigalpa, educators
say the children aren't the same after Mitch. Kids who used to
sleep under bridges by the river are afraid to do so now.
	   ``Every time it clouds up, they get tense. They think it will
happen again,'' said Carlos Alvarado, a psychologist at the Casa
Alianza center.
	   Many Hondurans cope by resigning themselves to the will of
providence, he said.
	   ``People don't understand, or don't want to,'' Alvarado said.
``They think it is God's punishment for corruption, or give some
magical or religious explanation. This is the vision of our
people.''

Police find body of Norwegian tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ A Norwegian tourist found dead in
northern India had apparently been strangled, police said
Wednesday.
	   Villagers walking in a forest near Chandigarh, 245 kilometers
(150 miles) north of New Delhi stumbled on the body of Tormod
Lindstroem, 24, of Stavanger, Norway on Sunday, local police
superintendent M.L. Negi said. A Norwegian passport found with the
body helped police identify Lindstroem, and indicated he had
arrived in India last week.
	   The Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi was contacted and helped
arrange for Lindstroem to be cremated at his parents' request and
his ashes sent to Norway.
	   An autopsy indicated the cause of death was strangulation, Negi
said. Negi had no further details and said police were
investigating.

Daly flexes his national pride
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos WHAN101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ John Daly can struggle to keep
it together for himself, but give him a team and a United States
flag and he feels transformed.
	   Daly will join Scott Verplank as the U.S. team in the 32-nation
World Cup of Golf which starts at the Gulf Harbor course Thursday.
	   While his PGA Tour form remains disappointing and overshadowed
by breakdowns and his battle with the bottle, team play seems to
bring out the best in the big-hitting Daly.
	   ``I look at the World Cup as the Ryder Cup for me,'' said Daly
after his first full round at the resort course Wednesday. ``Here
and the Dunhill Cup _ it's great to represent my country. I'm
playing for the U.S. and it doesn't get any better than that.''
	   Daly teamed with Fuzzy Zoeller at last week's Shark Shootout and
before that was alongside Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara in the
Dunhill Cup in England.
	   He impressed at the Dunhill Cup, winning all his matches, but
had a difficult PGA year, going winless for the second-straight
season.
	   ``I had a good start _ I thought I should have won out on the
west coast but it didn't carry over to the east coast,'' Daly said.
``I putted really well in the first 12-13 tournaments, then I
started hitting it good but didn't putt good. It drives you
crazy.''
	   The attractive first-year course promises to test the teams and
the strong winds have been the subject of most pre-tournament talk.
	   ``I love the wind,'' Daly said. ``This course is perfect for my
game as long as I hit the driver solid.''
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie and Andrew Coltart will start
favorite for the team's event and last year's individual winner
Montgomerie said he wanted to lift his country to its first World
Cup victory. The tournament was launched as the Canada Cup in 1953.
	   ``Scotland's been second a few times so we're trying to go one
better,'' Montgomerie said.
	   Montgomerie, the European Order of Merit winner for the past six
years, said he was wary of the course after a full round Wednesday.
	   ``Hopefully the pins will be fair, otherwise the scores will be
high,'' Montgomerie said. ``Greens are severe with severe slopes
but if pins are fair good shots will be rewarded.''
	   But Coltart, who was the outstanding player on last year's
Australasian Tour and a two-time World Cup player, believes the
conditions will suit the Scots.
	   ``It was very breezy today but very playable,'' Coltart said.
``Breeze can play havoc and make putts a bit tricky but winds are
something we are both familiar with.''
	   England's Nick Faldo, who had a poor year on the US Tour after
moving from the European scene admitted he was looking for a way
out of a slump.
	   ``I'm playing the world cup to try to get my old form back,''
Faldo admitted Wednesday.
	   ``I want to get my world ranking moving in the right direction
in time for the world match play last year.''
	   England, like Scotland, has never won the World Cup and its
chances have dipped because of an injury to Faldo's teammate David
Carter.
	   ``I'm taking pain killers but still not swinging with freedom,''
Carter said. His teammate is doing his bit to have Carter in a good
mood come the opening round. The pair have rented a town house near
the course and Faldo has been cooking breakfast.
	   ``It's real five-star treatment _ the full English breakfast,
mixed grill, fruit juice _ the full monty.''
	   Faldo, a four-time major winner who has fallen out of form and
split from coach David Leadbetter and girlfriend Brenna Cepelak in
recent times, spent Wednesday's pro-am with another sporting figure
who knows a bit about loss.
	   All Blacks coach John Hart, whose rugby team is enduring its
worst losing streak in history, joined Faldo for 18 holes and a few
laughs.
	   The tournament was launched Wednesday night with a traditional
Maori welcome at Gulf Harbor. Almost 100 indigenous New Zealanders
in traditional dress performed for the players.

Philippine Airlines resumes flights to Singapore, Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines resumed flights
to Taiwan and Singapore Wednesday, the latest step in restoring
Asian operations after a recent shutdown.
	   PAL had closed on Sept. 23 due to disputes with its largest
labor union and mounting debts and losses, partly caused by Asia's
financial crisis. It resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7 and
starting restoring international flights last month after settling
its labor problems.
	   A PAL statement said a fully booked flight left for Taipei
Wednesday morning, marking the return of daily flights there. It
said it decided to use a bigger Airbus plane than originally
planned for the route to accommodate more passengers.
	   A flight to Singapore was scheduled to leave Wednesday
afternoon, also marking a resumption of daily service.
	   Before its labor and financial troubles, PAL flew as many as 14
times a week to Taipei and daily to Taiwan's southern port of
Kaohsiung.
	   PAL resumed flights to the United States Oct. 29 and to Hong
Kong and Japan last week. It is scheduled to restart twice-weekly
flights to Fukuoka in Japan on Thursday and to other Asian
countries and the Middle East later this year.
	   PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and the two airlines are drawing up a
comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.

Power company cuts service because of unpaid debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's main electricity company said
it would cut service Wednesday to many districts and towns because
of unpaid bills and a drop in power production.
	   Emzar Chachkhiani, general director of Sakenergo, said the
company was owed some dlrs 50 million by consumers. Power supplies
to 33 districts were being cut and energy supply will be limited to
seven major cities, he said.
	   The company did not say how many people would be affected by the
power cut or how long it would last.
	   Chachkhiani said the company was also forced to cut its power
supply because low rainfalls had lowered hydro-electric production.
	   Georgia, like other former Soviet republics, has been struggling
for years with a weak economy and declining services.

Fed rate cut helps lift most Asian shares

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Blue chips were rallying Wednesday on Asia's
three top stock exchanges _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore _ in
response to lower U.S. interest rates and speculation that Japan
might do more to fix its economic troubles.
	   Prices were mixed in smaller markets.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the region's biggest, the key
Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues rose 186.23 points, or 1.29
percent, closing at 14,599.23.
	   The quarter-point decrease in U.S. interest rates helped support
Tokyo prices, but traders also were buying stocks on expectations
that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi might offer further economic
stimulus measures as U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives Thursday.
	   ``With Clinton coming here, Obuchi has to look good,'' said
Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index had climbed by 156.08 points,
or 1.5 percent, to 10,304.77 by midday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, cut its discount rate early Wednesday, stirring
speculation that commercial Hong Kong banks will cut their own
rates at a meeting Friday. The U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed rates
Tuesday, after Asian exchanges had closed for the day.
	   John Lo, an associate institutional sales director at BNP Prime
Peregrine Securities Ltd., saw two reasons for the Hong Kong rally:
``The rate cut news and the better regional markets.''
	   Shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore also soared, thanks to
the U.S. rate cut as well as an interest rate reduction announced
earlier Tuesday by the Development Bank of Singapore, one of its
top four banks.
	   By midday, the benchmark Straits Times Index stood at 1,273.92,
up 38.16 points, or 3.1 percent.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished lower, with
traders focusing more on a fall by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand
Ltd. than they were on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's plans to
ease monetary policy. The index closed down 11.55 points at
1,975.95.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed broadly lower, with some large
stocks falling hard on a round of negative news. The All Ordinaries
index closed at 2,668.7, down 7.9 points, or 0.29 percent.
	   SEOUL: The Korea Composite Stock Price Index was up 0.15 point
at 424.58 in early dealings.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares opened just slightly higher with
strong support from institutional investors, but analysts warned
that political concerns might limit any gains. The Composite Index
of 100 blue-chip stocks was at 464.37 points, up 0.25 point from
Tuesday.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesia's JSX Composite Index was up 2.6 percent, as
gainers outnumbered losers by 24 to 2, with 17 stocks unchanged.
	   TAIPEI: Shares finished lower for the first time in four
sessions after giving up early gains. The Weighted Price Index
closed down 31.76 points, or 0.44 percent, at 7,100.14.

Brunei's withdrawal forces redraw for Asian Games soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A new draw for the soccer tournament of
next month's Asian Games will be made Saturday due to the
withdrawal of Brunei's team, the organizers announced.
	   The new draw will establish seven groups for the 23 teams taking
part _ two groups of four teams each and five groups of three teams
each, said a news release received Wednesday.
	   There will be a total of 110 matches played under the new
arrangement.
	   In announcing Monday that it would not send a soccer team,
Brunei's Olympic committee apparently believed that the team was
not up to standard, the Bangkok Post said.
	   The withdrawal would have left just two teams _ North Korea and
the United Arab Emirates _ in the group to which Brunei had
belonged, and with two teams from each group advancing their game
would have become irrelevant, the Post said.
	   Originally, 32 teams were expected for the soccer competition,
but only 21 have confirmed their participation, the latest being
Kuwait. Final confirmations are still awaited from Mongolia and
Tajikistan.

Mir undamaged by ``meteor shower''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Mir space station was unaffected by a
cloud of micro-meteorite particles and its crew didn't even notice
any of them, officials said Wednesday.
	   Ground controllers ordered cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei
Avdeyev to go to the Soyuz escape capsule when the ``meteor
shower,'' consisting of very small particles that are remnants of a
comet, reached its peak Tuesday night.
	   The crew ``neither saw nor heard'' the shower and all the
station's systems were functioning normally, Mission Control said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. There had been concern that
the particles could puncture the Mir's surface.
	   During the encounter, the Mir's position was adjusted to avoid
as much of the shower as possible.
	   During a spacewalk last week, Padalka and Avdeyev mounted a
French-made ``meteorite trap'' on the Mir's outer surface. The
device, intended to catch particles for study, will stay attached
to the Mir until 1999, when it is due to be taken back to Earth by
a French astronaut, due to fly to the station early next year.
	   The meteorites are the debris of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle which
approached the Earth last January. They look like clouds of glowing
gases with small solid particles.

Hundreds march as Indonesian Parliament promises to enact reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 400 students marching; some Indonesians use only
one name &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Military Ads &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Angered by deadly clashes with the
military last week, hundreds of protesters marched through downtown
streets Wednesday as Parliament started work on enacting political
reforms that fall short of their demands.
	   About 400 students moved peacefully past hotels and office
buildings, but were blocked by about 100 army anti-riot officers
from proceeding to the National Monument near the presidential
palace.
	   To avoid a confrontation, the group headed toward Atama Jaya
University, where soldiers and police opened fire on protesters
last Friday.
	   Thousands of soldiers remained on duty around Jakarta and around
the Parliament building.
	   In a speech that opened a new session of the legislature,
Speaker Harmoko warned that any delay to the reform process could
``trigger new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation,
already beset by political and economic turmoil.
	   He said parliamentary elections in May or early June 1999 would
be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct, open to
all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired plastic bullets at protesters. Other people,
including some police, died when rioting broke out in parts of
Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Thousands of troops guarded the Parliament. The military opened
fire on students when they tried to march there last week.
	   City authorities said 123 buildings and 97 cars were damaged or
set afire, the newspaper The Jakarta Post reported.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto took out advertisements in
several national newspapers expressing his ``sincere condolences''
for last week's deaths.
	   Opposition politicians and students have demanded that Wiranto
resign as armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of
the shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.
	   It was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people in
May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   ``For those who died outside the Parliament we deliver our
condolences and hope that the deaths will prove to be meaningful in
the long term,'' Harmoko said.
	   Police have questioned more than a dozen opposition figures,
including two retired generals, in a sedition inquiry.
	   Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has alleged that the student protests were orchestrated by
conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted police as saying those questioned were
suspected of subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of
lifetime imprisonment.
	   Several were summoned to police headquarters Wednesday. The
roundup is the first major crackdown on dissidents since Habibie
took office.
	   Last week's bloodshed erupted after tens of thousands of
students tried to march on the green-domed legislature where the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly approved a range of
political reforms sponsored by Habibie.
	   These reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly but is now sitting in its own
right.
	   The process to make the reforms into law is expected to take
several months, and Harmoko urged Indonesians to give the
Parliament a chance to implement the changes in line with the
constitution and not to be provoked by ``irresponsible parties.''
	   Although the reforms call for new elections and go some way in
dismantling Suharto's authoritarian legacy, the students and other
critics say that they do not represent true democratic reform.
	   They have demanded that the powerful military be banned from
political activity and that Suharto be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Instead, the assembly merely approved a decree to reduce the
number of seats the military will have in Parliament. The number
was expected to be cut back from a current 75 to 55.
	   While it also named Suharto in a decree calling for a full
corruption investigation, critics say the move is largely cosmetic.
	   Despite vehement student opposition, Harmoko said the reforms
represent the true aspirations of Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   Once they were made law, the parliament would have a duty to
ensure that Habibie's government would carry them out quickly, he
said.

Russia, Peru and Vietnam enjoy their first summit

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Peru's president sought more
investments from foreign businesses. Russia's premier carefully
explained his country's economic woes to the U.S. delegation. And
Vietnam's leader hunted for new technology.
	   For each of them, their first visit to an Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit opened a new way of doing business and
maintaining contact with powerful world leaders.
	   In fact, as new members of the free-trade group this year, Peru,
Russia and Vietnam seemed unconcerned by all the bickering over
tariffs and human rights that took place at this summit.
	   Instead, they worried about issues closer to home.
	   President Alberto Fujimori of Peru walked away from his meeting
with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi with dlrs 480 million in
aid to build new roads and bridges that were destroyed by cyclones
in Peru this year, a Peruvian official said.
	   Tokyo offered help implement an accord between Peru and Ecuador
that ended a half-century dispute between the neighboring countries
over a slice of Amazon jungle.
	   Fujimori also appeared before the 1,000 business leaders meeting
alongside the APEC summit.
	   ``To become a valuable partner in this exclusive forum, my
country has been clearing the path to modernization and progress,''
Fujimori said in a speech to them.
	   Even though Peru has a small economy, he said, it contains the
``ideal conditions that investors look for.''
	   In his two-hour meeting with U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
Russia's premier, Yevgeny Primakov, discussed Russia's financial
crisis, a steel trade dispute, and America's concerns about
anti-Semitic comments that were made in Russia.
	   Russia also was looking into the possibility of tapping into the
pool of financial expertise among APEC members so that Moscow could
run its new private-sector banks better.
	   ``We hope that APEC participation will help us increase the
effectiveness of our banking system,'' Andrei Denisov, a senior
Russian trade official, said after one of the forum's meetings.
	   Russian companies immediately tried take advantage of their
country's new APEC membership, too.
	   At a nearby trade show, 50 Russian companies showed everything
from X-ray machines to commercial jets, moving in to get a toehold
in the Southeast Asian market.
	   ``We are here to investigate markets and make contacts for sales
and distribution,'' said Alexander A. Brook of the Myasishchev
Design Bureau, which makes small aircraft.
	   Vietnam, a communist country still experimenting with
capitalism, asked APEC's many wealthy members for sophisticated
technology for its fledgling industries.
	   The government hopes to create 1 million to 1.2 million jobs
next year, leaning on small and medium-size enterprises and
vocational training.
	   ``Access to science and technology is important to us now. We
hope to gain from transfer of technology,'' Vietnam's vice prime
minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, told a local newspaper.
	   APEC started in 1989 with 12 countries: Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines,
Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and the United States. China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Chile were accepted
later.
	   Now that Russia, Peru and Vietnam have become new members, the
APEC is closed to others for 10 years.

Taiwanese fugitive arrested in Philippines

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police arrested a Taiwanese who had
fled a death sentence back home after he threatened another
Taiwanese with a gun during an argument at a Manila restaurant, an
officer said Wednesday.
	   In an identity check after his arrest, police discovered that
Chen Kwan-yuen, alias Chin Hui, had fled Taipei last year after
being sentenced to death for large-scale drug trafficking, police
investigator Wenceslao Villanueva said.
	   Two of Chen's associates already had been executed, and he was
among six people still being sought by Taiwanese police.
	   Villanueva said Taiwanese officers will arrive later this week
to escort Chen back to Taiwan.
	   He said President Joseph Estrada may personally hand over Chen
to the Taiwanese police.
	   ``Chen was found out because he was hot-headed,'' Villanueva
said. ``It would not have been a serious case and he would not have
been discovered had he not used a gun.''
	   He said Chen was arrested Sunday at his hotel room in Manila's
Ermita district, a day after the argument.
	   Villanueva said a drunken Chen was shouting insults at Estrada
when the other Taiwanese, who claimed to be a close friend of the
president, overhead him and tried to defend the Philippine leader.
	   Chen pulled out a gun and challenged the other Taiwanese to a
fight, he said.
	   Restaurant employees persuaded the other Taiwanese to leave to
avoid violence. The man then went to a police station to complain,
and Chen was arrested the next day.

Guatemala 4, Honduras 3 in Los Angeles tournament to benefit Mitch

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Goalkeeper Edgar Estrada made the key save as
Guatemala defeated Honduras on penalty kicks 4-3 in the first round
of a soccer tournament to raise money for the Central American
victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Mexico defeated El Salvador earlier Tuesday night on goals from
Luis Hernandez and Oscar Mascorro in the first game of Project
Soccer Relief '98, organized by the international relief agency
CARE and CONCACAF, the federation that governs soccer in North
America.
	   Proceeds will go to CARE for aid earmarked for Central America.
Governments of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala say
at least 10,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were left
homeless in their countries when Mitch rampaged across the region.
	   Guatemala will meet Mexico in Wednesday night's final, preceded
by the third-place game between El Salvador and Honduras at the Los
Angeles Coliseum, where a crowd of 21,300 watched Tuesday night's
doubleheader.
	   Guatemala and Honduras each made four of five penalty kicks
after the teams tied in overtime, 3-3. Both teams then alternated
penalty kicks until one team earned an advantage.
	   Guatemala secured the victory when Estrada blocked Luis
Guifarro's attempt. German Ruano and Victor Gomez converted for
Guatemala in the extra penalty-kick session.
	   Guatemala had a 3-1 lead, but Honduras scored twice in the final
25 minutes. Cesar Obando converted a penalty kick in the 69th
minute, and Alex Pineda scored off Guifarro's corner kick in the
85th minute.
	   Guatemala's Engelvert Herrera opened the scoring in the 29th
minute, but Honduras tied the score on a header by Marlon Hernandez
in the 38th minute. Then Guatemala built its 3-1 lead on goals from
Juan Carlos Plata in the 43rd minute and Everardo Valencia in the
65th minute.

Air France strike grounds flights for second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France flights were severely disrupted
Wednesday as a strike by flight attendants entered its second and
final day.
	   Air France said it would guarantee 55 percent of long-haul
flights and 60 percent of short and medium-distance flights, the
same as Tuesday.
	   The flight attendants are demanding that the company scrap a
two-tier salary scheme under which staff hired since December 1995
earn less than their counterparts.
	   The strike was called by six unions.
	   A 10-day pilots strike in early June cost Air France one billion
francs (dlrs 166 million) before the main pilots union accepted an
offer of stock in exchange for salary freezes.
	   The strike coincided with the arrival of hundreds of thousands
of people to watch the World Cup.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.

Parliament's speaker warns of poor nutrition harming children's
</HEADLINE>
brains &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Poor nutrition resulting from the
worst economic crisis in three decades could result in lower
intelligence among Indonesian children, the speaker of the
Parliament said Wednesday.
	   ``Inadequate food and nutrition will cause our children to grow
up with weak brains and low intelligence,'' Speaker Harmoko said in
a speech to Parliament.
	   Harmoko said the number of infants receiving inadequate protein
in their diets is rising, and the quality of Indonesia's human
resources could be affected in future years.
	   ``Children as the next generation must get our attention,
especially in the middle of an economic crisis like now,'' he said.
	   ``They are the ones that most feel the effects of this crisis
because they are still developing physically and psychologically.''
	   Food prices, unemployment and poverty rates have soared
dramatically over the past year of financial meltdown in Asia.
	   Last month, U.N. officials in Jakarta warned that chronic
malnutrition among Indonesian children could lead to ``a lost
generation.''
	   Stephen Woodhouse, UNICEF's representative in Indonesia,
estimated that 50 percent of Indonesian children below the age of
2, or about 4 million infants, were not receiving adequate
nutrition for proper brain development and were in danger of losing
10 to 15 IQ points.

Australia plans to bid for indigenous games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Indigenous Australians announced
plans Wednesday to host their own world sporting event and warned
they might protest at the 2000 Sydney Olympics if the government
fails to improve their living standards.
	   Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins, chairman of a committee
bidding to host the inaugural World Indigenous Games, said more
cooperation was needed from the government before the Olympics to
satisfy indigenous Australians.
	   ``We don't want people at the Games when there's a lot of
poverty, ill health and misery in a lot of Aboriginal
communities,'' he said at a national indigenous sport conference.
	   ``Have the Games, but don't dance on our graves.''
	   Perkins, who was announcing plans for Australia to bid for the
right to host the inaugural World Indigenous Games in 2003, said
aborigines also wanted their flag flown at Sydney 2000.
	   ``I don't see any harm with flying the Aboriginal flag,'' he
said.
	   Perkins said he realized International Olympic Committee (IOC)
rules required the official national flag to be flown.
	   ``But we can fly the flag somewhere,'' he said. ``It's very
inspirational, it's very symbolic, it's a question of dignity.''
	   Perkins said a World Indigenous Games, suggested for Sydney as a
follow up to the Olympics, would bring black and white Australians
closer together and motivate Aboriginal youth to take a more active
interest in sport.
	   Perkins said the bid committee had started a feasibility study
and had the support of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission
and the indigenous sport program within the Australian Sports
Commission.
	   Australia's chances of hosting the games depend on funding and
the possibility of a rival bid from North America, Perkins said.

Japanese stock prices rebound, dollar rises against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rebounded Wednesday on
anticipation that U.S. President Bill Clinton will prod the
Japanese government to further stimulate the economy when he visits
this week. The dollar rose against the yen.
	   The dollar bought 121.22 yen in late afternoon, up 0.60 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
121.00 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 186.23
points, or 1.29 percent, closing at 14,599.23. On Tuesday, the
average had lost 15.27 points, or 0.11 percent.
	   Among Wednesday's gainers were blue chips, including Sony and
Honda Motor, as well as major banking issues like Sumitomo Bank and
Fuji Bank.
	   In Washington Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
suggested that Clinton will be pushing Japan to move its economy
forward when he visits Japan Thursday and Friday.
	   Summers' comments have fueled hopes that Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi may respond with more stimulus measures when he meets with
Clinton, traders said.
	   ``With Clinton coming here, Obuchi has to look good,'' said
Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Traders said Japan is also under pressure to do more to bolster
the nation's economy at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum meeting in Malaysia.
	   Buying by Japanese public funds and some overseas investors
largely contributed to the rise in the Nikkei index, traders said.
The Nikkei last closed above 14,500 points on Nov. 4, when it
finished at 14,527.81.
	   On Monday, the government unveiled a record 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 198 billion) stimulus package, but many traders have said
they were disappointed because the package avoided the painful
structural reforms they believe are needed to pull Japan's economy
out of its worst recession in decades.
	   Trading was moderate, with about 477 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Tuesday's 385 million. Advances
outnumbered declines 818 to 344, with 110 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.77 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,113.42. It
had edged up 2.15 points, or 0.19 percent, Tuesday.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened on buying by
Japanese institutional investors and importers as well as some
purchases by speculators looking to cover short, or oversold,
dollar positions, traders said.
	   But traders said the currency quickly lost upward momentum in
the absence of fresh market-moving news Wednesday, a day after the
U.S. Federal Reserve cut key interest rates.
	   The Fed cut short-term interest rates by one-quarter percentage
point Tuesday to protect the U.S. economy against spillover from
global financial turmoil.
	   The dollar ranged between 120.85 yen and 121.75 yen in
Wednesday's trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.830 percent from 0.855 percent Tuesday, driving its
price up to 108.59 yen from 108.36 yen.

Players face testing conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Players in the Australian PGA
Championship will be battling Mother Nature as much as the course
when they line up for the 380,000 US dlrs tournament at the New
South Wales Golf Club.
	   Wild winds of up to 50 knots battered the 6,267-meter
(6,850-yard) par-72 course during Wednesday's pro-am, leading to
several players calling it unplayable.
	   Similar conditions are forecast for Thursday. The situation has
forced Australian PGA tour operations director Trevor Herden to
plan to restrict cutting of the greens, particularly on the more
exposed 13th, 14th and 17th holes, in an effort to ensure there is
no need to suspend play.
	   Trinidad professional Stephen Ames said Wednesday's conditions
were worse than the storm-lashed third round of this year's British
Open at Royal Birkdale.
	   ``I had three balls move on me on the green,'' Ames said after
his pro-am round. ``It was close, but it was unplayable.''
	   He said that into the wind, he had to use a club six to eight
numbers lower than he would have in still conditions.
	   ``The good thing is that this course is built for the wind and
your shots to run up onto the greens,'' Ames said.
	   The weather is almost always a key factor in tournaments at this
course, but local man Peter Lonard agreed with Ames' assessment of
the conditions.
	   ``The course was getting borderline,'' Lonard said, noting
problems at the exposed and sloping 13th and 14th greens where the
wind was ``coming over the hill at 100 miles an hour.''
	   The course has also been affected by bushfires earlier this
year, which has led to vast areas bordering about half the holes
being declared Ground Under Repair.
	   South Australian Justin Cooper said that in a practice round
Tuesday, he'd made a regulation par 4 on the 16th. His playing
partner, meanwhile, lost two balls into the burned-out scrub but
was still able to make par thanks to two free drops.

Opposition leader lashes out at U.S. silence on Singapore human
</HEADLINE>
rights &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ One of Singapore's beleaguered opposition
leaders lashed out at the United States on Wednesday for its
virtual silence on human rights in the island republic.
	   Workers Party chief J.B. Jeyaretnam said he agreed with U.S.
Vice President Al Gore's recent call for democracy in the region,
but that American officials ``have remained very muted about the
(Singapore) government's persecution of human rights activists and
opposition party leaders.''
	   Jeyaretnam, who holds one of only three opposition seats in the
84-member Parliament, added that no visiting U.S. official ``has
ever asked to meet with any opposition leader in Singapore,'' and
that requests by the opposition to meet the Americans have been
denied.
	   Leaders of the People's Action Party, which has ruled Singapore
under tight control since independence in 1965, have repeatedly
sued various opposition leaders for libel and defamation.
	   Jeyaretnam was the latest target of such legal action, when
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong sued him for defamation over his
accurate statement that another Workers Party leader had filed a
police report against ``Goh and his people.''
	   The High Court ruled that Jeyaretnam had to pay 100,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 61,000) in damages, plus hefty legal fees.
To avoid being declared bankrupt and losing his seat in Parliament,
Jeyaretnam is paying the damages in installments.
	   He is also awaiting seven additional suits by other ministers
over the same remark.
	   The latest U.S. State Department Human Rights Report cited the
case as an example of the Singapore government using lawsuits to
stifle freedom of speech and intimidate the political opposition.
	   Singapore's draconian Internal Security Act has also been used
to detain without trial those deemed dangerous to the state.
	   Aside from the annual Human Rights Report, the U.S. government
issues practically no other criticism of Singapore's occasionally
heavy-handed treatment of its more vocal domestic critics.
	   Jeyaretnam questioned whether ``this silence by U.S. government
officials on the Singapore government's record on human rights (is)
because the PAP government best serves U.S. economic and military
interests in the region.''
	   The U.S. Navy maintains a major logistics operation in
Singapore, where American vessels frequently call. The two
countries cooperate closely in military discussions and exercises.
	   Despite Singapore's small economy, trade between the two
countries totaled dlrs 42 billion last year. America remains the
top foreign investor here, with dlrs 17.5 billion at the end of
1997, and about 1,200 U.S. companies operate in the tiny republic.

Malaysia to build nuclear test detection facility, says official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia plans to build a dlrs
250,000 facility as part of a global effort to detect nuclear
weapons tests, a senior official from a nuclear non-proliferation
organization said Wednesday.
	   Wolfgang Hoffman, executive secretary of the Vienna-based
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, said the
facility would detect radioactive trace elements released after a
nuclear explosion.
	   ``It's a great step toward controlling nuclear buildup,'' he
said. ``We trust each other, but we also want to be sure.''
	   Malaysia has been chosen as an ideal location for the detection
station because it is located at the confluence of global wind
currents that carry trace elements from nuclear tests.

Premier: Kurdish leader must prove he's renounced terrorism

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A ship loaded with about 200 Kurds reached the coast
of Sicily Wednesday, raising fears of a mass exodus of Kurds
encouraged by Italy's refusal so far to extradite their captured
rebel leader.
	   Kurds are launching rallies and hunger strikes across Europe in
opposition to Turkey's request that Abdullah Ocalan be extradited
for trial.
	   An estimated 10,000 Kurds protested in Rome on Tuesday to demand
asylum for their captured leader _ a demand Italy's premier said
would be denied unless the rebel commander has truly renounced
terrorism.
	   The march was the largest yet in days of growing protests since
Italian police arrested Ocalan at Rome's airport Thursday.
	   More than 4,000 also protested Tuesday outside the Interior
Ministry in Bonn, Germany. Smaller but more violent protests were
staged in Moscow, Ankara, Turkey, and the Belgian capital,
Brussels.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Supporters marched past the Colosseum and into Piazza Venezia on
Tuesday, waving red flags and making the streets of downtown Rome
ring with their cries.
	   Kneeling in the piazza, they chanted, ``We love you, Ocalan. We
are with you, Ocalan. We will die for you, Ocalan.''
	   The Kurd would-be immigrants who arrived by ship early Wednesday
said they had departed from a Turkish port and traveled for six
days. Thousands of Kurds fleeing persecution at home have reached
Italy in recent years, but most headed north to Germany or the
Netherlands.
	   Some expect thousands more Kurds will reach Italy in the coming
days and that many will stay in the country if Ocalan is granted
asylum.
	   On Tuesday, Premier Massimo D'Alema told Parliament's lower
house that Ocalan had issued a statement in which he ``rejected all
terrorist actions.'' ``Now it's a matter of seeing whether he
sticks to it,'' D'Alema said.

Kurd dies after setting himself on fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Kurdish man who set himself on fire in the
center of Moscow to protest the arrest of a Kurdish rebel leader
has died in a city hospital, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   The man, identified as Ahmed Tsyldyrym, 25, died overnight at
Moscow's Sklifosofsky Institute of Critical Care, the report said.
A second man who also set himself on fire was in critical condition
with kidney failure and severe burns, it said.
	   The two men splashed themselves with a flammable liquid and then
set it ablaze Tuesday outside the Duma building in the heart of
Moscow. Police managed to extinguish the flames.
	   The protest came as about 100 Kurdish residents observed a
hunger strike to protest what they claim is an international
conspiracy against Abdullah Ocalan, who leads the Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK.
	   The PKK has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, where
it has been outlawed. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the
14-year-old conflict.
	   Ocalan was arrested last week in Rome on a Turkish warrant after
stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he had fled after being
forced out of Syria. Russia denied him asylum.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings. The charges can bring the death
penalty.

French police set to protest rural station closings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police were to take to the streets Wednesday
to protest a government plan to close almost 100 rural police
stations.
	   Police unions said they expect 10,000 officers from all over
France to march in the protest in Paris, set to begin Wednesday
morning.
	   Police are unhappy with a government plan to close 94 stations
in rural areas and replace officers with national paramilitary
police known as gendarmes.
	   According to the government plan, the rural police are to be
reassigned to troubled urban zones. A union spokesman said,
however, he feared the plan could lead to the eventual loss of
police jobs.

Marine pleads guilty to hit-and-run on Okinawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine pleaded guilty Wednesday in an
Okinawa court to charges of hit-and-run, death through professional
negligence and drunken driving in an accident that killed a
teen-ager.
	   Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Indiana,
pleaded guilty in his trial's opening to the charges presented by
prosecutors at Naha District Court, said Marine spokesman Maj. Dan
Ryan.
	   Eskridge was charged with driving the car that struck the small
motorcycle that 18-year-old Yuki Uema was on, then fleeing the
scene on Oct.7. Uema died of head injuries a week later at a
hospital.
	   The fatal hit-and-run was extremely sensitive, given the
backdrop of the often strained relations between the residents of
Okinawa and the U.S. military.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Foley met to talk about it, and Foley expressed his condolences to
the victim's family.
	   Okinawans have long resented having most of the American troops
in Japan stationed on their tiny island, 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Eskridge's next court session is set for Dec. 11, when the court
will hear evidence to be used in deciding his sentence. He is being
held in the Naha Detention Center.
	   The Marines say they took time out last month to offer prayers
for Uema and her family, reflect on personal responsibility and
discourage excessive alcohol use in their ranks.
	   About two weeks after Uema's death, another Marine was arrested
in a hit-and-run in Okinawa that left a Japanese man with minor
injuries.
	   Marine Cpl. Scotty L. Jackson, 22, of Wichita, Kansas, was
released Nov. 6 upon pleading guilty to violation of traffic laws,
drunken driving and injury through professional negligence, and
paying a 150,000 yen (dlrs 1,200) fine in a court in Okinawa.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese workers will feel the effects of their
country's recession on their pocketbooks this winter as bonuses
paid by companies shrink for the first time in four years, a major
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The average December bonus will drop 2.12 percent to 808,980 yen
(dlrs 6,685) per worker, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported based
on a survey of 391 major companies.
	   This is the largest fall in percentage terms since the newspaper
began surveying corporate bonuses in 1975, the report said.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of workers' salaries and a
similar summer bonus is paid around July or early August. The
amount is loosely reflects the company's profitability and is
considered a barometer of the health of the nation's overall
economy.
	   The newspaper said the average winter bonus at manufacturing
firms covered by the survey will fall 2.19 percent from last year,
and the average bonus at non-manufacturing firms will drop 1.07
percent.
	   Japan's economy has been sluggish for much of this decade after
the collapse of the speculative ``bubble'' economy in the late
1980s.
	   Things went from bad to worse last year, when the economy slid
into the longest recession on record.
	   In its latest monthly report released Tuesday, Japan's central
bank said consumption remains sluggish, bloating inventories and
eroding corporate profits.
	   On Monday, the Japanese government announced a record 24
trillion yen (dlrs 198 billion) package, including public works
spending and tax cuts, aimed at restoring the economy to growth.
	   ___
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The opening of a second runway at Hong Kong's
new U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport will be delayed for six months
because its lighting system needs modifications, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Airport Authority spokesman Chris Donnolly said the delay was
unlikely to have any significant impact on operations. Air traffic
remains 20 percent below the peak capacity of 37 flights per hour
at Chek Lap Kok, which has been plagued by a series of snags since
opening in July.
	   Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's flag carrier, called the
delay ``unfortunate'' but will cooperate with airport authorities
to ensure the second runway opens as soon as possible, spokeswoman
Quince Chong said.
	   Last month, a Boeing 747 cargo jet burst two tires when taking
off, closing the first runway and delaying about 100 flights,
including six that had to be diverted.
	   Donnolly said airport authorities were ``not in a rush'' to
complete the second runway, which had been scheduled to open in
late December, until improvements can be made in the lighting
system _ which cost 300 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 38
million).
	   ``As desirable as two runways are, we think it is more prudent
to ensure that everything works in the northern runway,'' Donnolly
said.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's largest bank slashed its prime
lending rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday, sparking the
fourth round of such cuts in about two months.
	   Government-linked Development Bank of Singapore lowered the
interest rate it charges its best customers from 6.5 percent to 6
percent. Singapore's other major local banks are expected to follow
suit soon.
	   Since mid-September, the four largest Singapore banks have eased
credit in line with falling local interbank rates, slumping global
interest rates, and a stronger local currency.
	   DBS has gradually trimmed 1.5 percentage points off the prime
rate since the cuts began.
	   Three-month interbank rates in the city-state are hovering at
around 2.25 percent. Local banks usually adjust their lending rates
if the difference between the prime lending rate and the interbank
rate widens to about 2.5 to 3 percentage points, analysts said.
	   The latest round of Singapore rate reductions comes as the U.S.
Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rate on Tuesday by a
quarter of a percentage point to the lowest level in four years.
	   The Singapore stock market reacted positively to the U.S. and
local rate cuts.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 1.9 percent higher in
early morning trading. Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as banks
and property shares have led the market rally.
	   The bank's decision to cut came just a day after it completed
its takeover of national savings bank PosBank and its subsidiaries
for 1.6 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 979 million).

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines resumed flights
to Taiwan and Singapore Wednesday, the latest step in restoring
Asian operations after a recent shutdown.
	   PAL had closed on Sept. 23 due to disputes with its largest
labor union and mounting debts and losses, partly caused by Asia's
financial crisis. It resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7 and
starting restoring international flights last month after settling
its labor problems.
	   A PAL statement said a fully booked flight left for Taipei
Wednesday morning, marking the return of daily flights there. It
said it decided to use a bigger Airbus plane than originally
planned for the route to accommodate more passengers.
	   A flight to Singapore was scheduled to leave Wednesday
afternoon, also marking a resumption of daily service.
	   Before its labor and financial troubles, PAL flew as many as 14
times a week to Taipei and daily to Taiwan's southern port of
Kaohsiung.
	   PAL resumed flights to the United States Oct. 29 and to Hong
Kong and Japan last week. It is scheduled to restart twice-weekly
flights to Fukuoka in Japan on Thursday and to other Asian
countries and the Middle East later this year.
	   PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and the two airlines are drawing up a
comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.

Hundreds march as Indonesian Parliament promises to enact reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with student protests growing larger, violence in

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Military Ads &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Angered by deadly clashes with the
military last week, about 1,000 student protesters marched through
downtown streets Wednesday as Parliament started work on enacting
political reforms that fall short of their demands.
	   Meanwhile, police with sticks beat student activists who forced
their way into the governor's office in Surabaya, Indonesia's
second-largest city. Radio reports said several students were
injured.
	   Hundreds of protesters demanding democratic reform also tore
down the gates of the local Parliament in Surabaya.
	   In Jakarta, the students moved peacefully past hotels and office
buildings, but were blocked by about 100 army anti-riot officers
from proceeding to the National Monument near the presidential
palace.
	   To avoid a confrontation, the group headed toward Atama Jaya
University, where soldiers and police opened fire on protesters
last Friday.
	   A separate group of hundreds of demonstrators riding in a dozen
buses was blocked by soldiers near the Parliament building.
	   In a speech that opened a new session of the legislature,
Speaker Harmoko warned that any delay to the reform process could
``trigger new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation,
already beset by political and economic turmoil.
	   He said parliamentary elections in May or early June 1999 would
be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct, open to
all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired plastic bullets at protesters. Other people,
including some police, died when rioting broke out in parts of
Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Thousands of troops guarded the Parliament. The military opened
fired on students when they tried to march there last week.
	   City authorities said 123 buildings and 97 cars were damaged or
set afire, the newspaper The Jakarta Post reported.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto took out advertisements in
several national newspapers expressing his ``sincere condolences''
for last week's deaths.
	   Opposition and students have demanded that Wiranto resign as
armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of the
shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.
	   It was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people in
May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   ``For those who died outside the Parliament we deliver our
condolences and hope that the deaths will prove to be meaningful in
the long term,'' Harmoko said.
	   Police have questioned more than a dozen opposition figures,
including two retired generals, in a sedition inquiry.
	   Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has alleged that the student protests were orchestrated by
conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted police as saying those questioned were
suspected of subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of
lifetime imprisonment.
	   Several were summoned to police headquarters Wednesday. The
roundup is the first major crackdown on dissidents since Habibie
took office.
	   Last week's bloodshed erupted after tens of thousands of
students tried to march on the green-domed legislature where the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly approved a range of
political reforms sponsored by Habibie.
	   These reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly but is now sitting in its own
right.
	   Although the reforms call for new elections and go some way in
dismantling Suharto's authoritarian legacy, the students and other
critics say that they do not represent true democratic reform.
	   They have demanded that the powerful military be banned from
political activity and that Suharto be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Instead the assembly merely approved a decree to reduce the
number of seats the military will have in Parliament. The number
was expected to be cut back from a current 75 to 55.
	   While it also named Suharto in a decree calling for a full
corruption investigation, critics say the move is largely cosmetic.

Free-trade summit in Malaysia ends with modest proposals

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's worst
economic crisis in decades, following a disappointing summit
overshadowed by conflicts about human rights and free trade.
	   The group's final statement praised signs of recovery in
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. It said these hard-hit
countries should continue adopting painful reforms recommended by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also
called for more financial assistance from the international
community, and endorsed a U.S. proposal to speed emergency loans to
the Asian countries at the center of the crisis.
	   Despite the strong anti-free market views promoted by this
year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC
statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign exchange
trading or new controls on the movement of capital in and out of
countries.
	   Offering Mahathir a consolation prize, the statement did call
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that the
agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily,
without proper review.
	   ``We are resolved to work together to support an early and
sustained recovery in the region, to contain the risks of contagion
and prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, read by Mahathir at the conclusion of the two-day summit
by APEC leaders.
	   Some of the leaders, standing under the sun in stifling heat,
mopped their faces with handkerchiefs as the declaration was read.
	   The statement also praised China for maintaining the value of
its currency, the yuan, and Japan for announcing a new stimulus
package and reform measures to revive its ailing economy.
	   The free-trade forum was overshadowed by a diplomatic furor set
off by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and by a disagreement between
the United States and Japan which forced the group to delay a
landmark free-trade agreement.
	   The pact sought to slash tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in world
trade. But opposition by Japan to opening up two of the nine
proposed sectors _ fishing and forestry products _ forced APEC to
send the plan to the 124-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva
for resolution.
	   But Gore also announced an agreement with Japan on a joint
approach to dealing with the financial crisis, including a dlrs 10
billion support package designed to help struggling Asian nations.
	   Half the money will come from the United States and the other
half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The assistance, although small compared with the magnitude of
the region's debt burdens, should help assure nervous financial
markets that the world's two largest economies have put aside past
bickering over the best approaches to take.
	   Gore's decision to deliver a speech on the eve of the summit
that sympathized with the host country's anti-government reform
movement caused divisions among APEC's leaders.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Gore's
remarks could put the nation's democratic process at risk. And APEC
officials from Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand urged the vice
president to stick to economic issues during the meetings.
	   Nevertheless, Gore defended his speech, saying that nations
fighting off economic crises must work as hard to promote
democracy. Gore was a stand-in for President Bill Clinton, who
stayed in Washington because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   Protests by supporters of Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim have
occurred in the country since the deputy prime minister was fired,
arrested and put on trial after challenging Mahathir's 17-year
rule.
	   During the APEC meetings, top officials from the U.S.,
Philippine, Canadian and Australian delegations met privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to sympathize with his campaign and to
express concern over his treatment and trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   With Asia in its worst financial crisis in decades, the APEC
summit was intended to be a chance for the leaders to recommend
measures that would help revive economic growth and stabilize
currency and stock markets.
	   The crisis, which began in July 1997 in Thailand, has spread to
Russia and is threatening Brazil and other Latin American nations.
The U.S. economy has even felt the effects.
	   As expected, the final statement appeared to hew closely to the
Clinton administration's free-market, pro-IMF handling of the
crisis. The IMF has organized loan packages totaling nearly dlrs
120 billion to Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bolster
their economies. In return, it has demanded the nations adopt
unpopular measures that have sent interest rates soaring and
unemployment rising. Not all Asia's leaders have embraced the IMF
formula.
	   Mahathir has criticized the bailout programs and blamed Asia's
woes on foreign currency speculators. In September, he banned
trading of the national currency outside the country and imposed

Rocket hits capital near airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket slammed into the beleaguered
capital at noon on Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports
of casualties.
	   The rocket, which hit near the combined military and civilian
airport, was fired from positions north of the capital where
soldiers loyal to opposition leader Ahmed Shah Massood are
positioned.
	   The battlefield, barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the
city, has been relatively quiet in recent weeks while much of the
fighting has been restricted to the northern provinces of Kunduz
and Takhar provinces.
	   There the opposition soldiers are trying to push their Taliban
enemies out of areas they have captured in recent months.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army, which rules in 90 percent of the
country and has imposed its version of Muslim law, is trying to
gain full control, while the northern-based alliance is fighting to
preserve the 10 percent of the area they control.
	   Opposition soldiers say Taliban jet fighters have been pounded
their area killing civilians, a charge the religious militia has
denied.
	   However in recent weeks the opposition has been firing rockets
at the airport in an apparent attempt to stop the aircraft from
taking off. But so far there has been little damage to the airport
as a result of the rockets, Taliban officials say.

Hong Kong shares end higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares in Hong Kong edged up Wednesday, with
traders encouraged after seeing Hong Kong's monetary authority
follow the United States in cutting interest rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 64.73 points, or 0.6
percent, closing at 10,213.42. On Tuesday, the index had fallen
149.40 points.
	   Turnover surged to 8.40 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.08 billion) from Tuesday's 6.34 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 812 million).
	   The index climbed following news that the territory's de facto
central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, reduced its
discount rate in a move to match a quarter-point rate cut by the
U.S. Federal Reserve.
	   ``The market rallied today because of the rate cut news,'' said
Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS Securities Hong Kong Ltd.
Au-Young noted that gains early in the day were partially erased as
investors sold off some shares near the end of trading.
	   Following the U.S. rate cuts, it seems likely that the Hong Kong
Association of Banks _ the local commercial rate-setting cartel _
will lower deposit rates by at least a quarter percentage point
Friday, said Kenny Tang, research manager at Tung Tai Securities
Co.
	   That would be expected to trigger a discount rate cut by most
Hong Kong commercial banks.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 50 Hong Kong cents to
180.00, while its affiliate Hang Seng Bank surged 2.50 dollars to
66.50.
	   Among real estate companies, Sun Hung Kai Properties gained 75
Hong Kong cents to 55.50, and Cheung Kong Holdings slipped 50 cents
to 58.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa gained 1.00 dollar to 56.00, and
First Pacific gained 30 cents to 3.90.

Djibouti closes embassy in Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Djibouti closed its embassy in Asmara on
Wednesday to protest Eritrea's allegation that it has sided with
Ethiopia in their six-month border conflict.
	   Djibouti also was offended by Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki's effort to bar Djiboutian President Hassan Gouled Aptidon
from failed peace negotiations in Burkina Faso earlier this month.
	   Aptidon was one of three African leaders appointed by the
Organization of African Unity to mediate an end to fighting, which
has largely subsided since June.
	   Despite a demand by Djiboutian Foreign Minister Mohamed Moussa
Chehem last week, Eritrea has refused to apologize. Yemane Gebreab,
adviser to Isaias, said Eritrea would express no regret to a nation
that is backing Ethiopia.
	   Djiboutian Ambassador Ahmed Issa Gobabey and other embassy staff
left Asmara on Tuesday. Eritrea does not plan to break off
diplomatic relations with Djibouti, Yemane said.
	   Dalo Airlines, a private Djiboutian carrier with regular flights
to Eritrea, said Wednesday that no Eritreans will be allowed to
board its flights to Djibouti.
	   Dalo will continue to fly to Asmara, taking passengers of other
nationalities. Eritrea does not have its own airline.
	   Yemane said Eritrea asked Djibouti to withdraw from the OAU
talks ``because it has become party to the conflict by supporting
the Ethiopian war effort through providing facilities and services
to the Ethiopian army.''
	   The border conflict has forced landlocked Ethiopia to divert
most of its maritime trade through Djibouti's Gulf of Aden port.
Previously, 70 percent of Ethiopia's trade passed through Eritrea's
Red Sea ports of Massawa and Assab.
	   Last month, Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae visited
Djibouti to complain that Ethiopia was using Djiboutian territory
to launch attacks on Eritrea. Yemane said Djiboutian officials
denied Ethiopian troops were on their soil.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and gained
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries was
never officially declared.

SAfrican transport minister to call it quits

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The transport minister said he
would step down after 1999 elections, becoming the first African
National Congress stalwart to announce his departure from the next
government.
	   The announcement Tuesday night by Mac Maharaj, who served 12
years in prison fighting the apartheid regime, was an early sign of
a shake-up in the government and dominant party ahead of next
year's vote.
	   Maharaj, 63, said he would not run for re-election to the
legislature to spend more time with his family. He denied in
newspaper reports Wednesday that his decision stemmed from friction
with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. An Mbeki spokesman made a
similar denial.
	   Mbeki succeeded President Nelson Mandela as head of the party,
which led the fight against apartheid for decades, and is widely
expected to take over as president after the mid-year vote. No date
has been set.
	   ``There has never really been friction between Thabo and me.
Each of us has a healthy respect for the other, even when
approaching matters from a different perspective,'' Maharaj told
Business Day.
	   The ANC came to power after the 1994 elections that ended white
minority rule. Many of its key figures who fought apartheid inside
and outside the country and served prison terms joined Mandela in
the government.
	   As minister, Maharaj established a 20-year strategic plan for
transport and set up regulatory agencies to oversee roads, maritime
safety, border-crossings and aviation.
	   A member of the ANC since 1961, he received military training in
East Germany, and was imprisoned on sabotage charges in 1964. He
served time with Mandela in the notorious Robben Island jail.
There, he smuggled information in and out of the prison, keeping
ANC figures informed of outside events and getting their messages
out. On his release, he smuggled out Mandela's autobiography.
	   Maharaj went into exile after his release and worked underground
for the ANC.
	   He was a key member of the ANC team that negotiated the
transition to democracy with the former ruling National party.
	   Maharaj said he would continue as a member of the ANC executive
committee and finish out his term as minister.

US trade representative blasts Japan ahead of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ On the eve of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's official visit to Japan, the United States signaled
Wednesday that it remains upset over Tokyo's refusal to lower trade
barriers, calling it an ``unconscionable outcome.''
	   Clinton's visit comes on the heels of a Pacific Rim economic
summit in Kuala Lumpur, where the United States and Japan took
opposite sides in a bitter trade dispute.
	   American officials had hoped to reduce or eliminate tariffs on
dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of trade but failed to forge a pact
covering nine industries because of opposition from Japan to
lowering border taxes on two of them, fish and wood products.
	   Before leaving Malaysia at the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky told reporters that ``Japan refused to exercise
any leadership and that is inexcusable. ... It is an unconscionable
outcome.''
	   Japan was the only APEC member country that sought to protect
two entire sectors from tariff cuts.
	   For that reason, the United States planned to raise the dispute
during Clinton's trip to Tokyo.
	   ``Japan was isolated, and Japan will be called to account,''
Barshefsky told reporters.
	   Clinton leaves Washington early Wednesday on a six-day journey
to Japan, South Korea and Guam. He had planned to begin that trip
in Malaysia at the APEC summit, but had to send U.S. Vice President
Al Gore in his place because of the U.S.-Iraq standoff.
	   Economic policy will also be on the agenda when Clinton meets
with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Obuchi told a group of Asian leaders on
Wednesday that there is no reason to worry about Japan's economy,
even though many forecasters say it's unlikely to grow at all this
year.
	   ``Japan's individual savings are high, and its foreign reserves
are big. I want others not to worry at all,'' Obuchi was quoted as
saying by a Japanese government official.
	   The prime minister sought to reassure the leaders that a 24
trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) package of new spending and tax
cuts, unveiled Monday, would lift Japan out of its deepest
recession since World War II.
	   A revitalized economy in Japan is critical to Asia because it
accounts for more than two-thirds of the region's economic power.
	   Critics worry the package may not be as effective as the
government hopes. Japan has implemented seven previous stimulus
plans, but the economy has been stagnant for much of the past five
years.
	   Obuchi also sought to assure the leaders that Japan is doing its
part to lead the region out of its economic crisis by reminding
them of his country's pledge to provide dlrs 30 billion in aid to
ailing Asian economies.

Philippine shares continue surge, peso weakens

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing peso-dollar rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares continued to surge
Wednesday, with the main index hitting a four-month high after the
latest round of U.S. interest rate cuts, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 41.54 points,
or 2.3 percent, to 1,820.77. On Tuesday, it had gained 33.63
points, or 1.9 percent.
	   The index has risen 108.79 points, or 6.4 percent, since Monday.
	   Metro Pacific, the local flagship of Hong Kong's First Pacific
Co., was among the most actively traded stocks. Investors
anticipate that efforts to block First Pacific's takeover of
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. will be resolved, paving the
way for the deal to be completed, traders said.
	   PLDT was also actively traded Wednesday.
	   Traders said investors, mostly local, drew strength from the
decision by the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday to
lower the target for the federal funds rate to 4.75 percent from 5
percent and the discount rate to 4.50 percent from 4.75 percent.
	   The cuts are expected to trigger a fresh round of rate
reductions in other financial markets, releasing more investment
funds, some of which may find their way into emerging markets like
the Philippines, traders said.
	   The strengthening of the Philippine peso, which accounted partly
for the market's surge in previous sessions, was tempered Wednesday
following the fall of other Asian currencies led by the Japanese
yen, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.947 pesos at the close of trading,
slightly higher than its Tuesday closing average of 39.857 pesos.
The dollar traded between 39.84 pesos and 40.10 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 173 million, down from Tuesday's 210
million.
	   Traders said regional currency players shrugged off the latest
cut in key U.S. interest rates and focused instead on Moody's
Investors Service's downgrade of Japan's country rating.
	   U.S. rate cuts are customarily seen as increasing the dollar
supply in global financial markets, thus providing support to other
currencies, traders say.
	   But a dealer for a large local bank said the latest U.S. rate
cuts are viewed more as supportive for the U.S. dollar as they may
boost the U.S. economy and protect it from the effects of a
possible global economic recession.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Most industries and businesses across
Zimbabwe shut down Wednesday as workers heeded calls for the second
in a series of one-day strikes to protest economic policies.
	   Troops and riot police backed by helicopters patrolled townships
around Harare and the main provincial centers.
	   In Harare, troops guarded bus stations after the government said
it would protect employees wishing to show up for work, but only a
few state-owned buses and private taxi vans were operating.
	   There were no reports of violence.
	   Heavy overnight rain and continuing drizzle left most suburbs
almost deserted.
	   Banks, supermarkets and offices in downtown Harare remained
closed.
	   ``It's very quiet out here, even quieter that last week,''
Alphious Kamhuka, a resident of the western Glen View township of
Harare.
	   A one-day national stay-away called by the main labor federation
last Wednesday was rated 95 percent effective by independent
monitoring groups.
	   Most factories in western Harare didn't attempt to open their
gates this Wednesday also.
	   ``There's more activity on a normal Sunday when firms around
here run weekend shifts,'' said clothing maker Colin Wilson.
	   Residents and businesses in the second city of Bulawayo and the
eastern border town of Mutare, where one striker was shot dead
during demonstrations by strikers last Wednesday, reported similar
conditions.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions called the stay-away after
talks with the government Monday failed to avert it.
	   The group, representing 90 percent of the nation's labor unions,
is protesting a 67 percent hike in gasoline prices that has
triggered increases in commuter fares and food production costs.
	   Unrest over worsening economic hardships is posing the most
serious threat yet to President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled the
former Rhodesia since it gained independence from Britain and
became Zimbabwe in 1980.
	   The gasoline price increase touched off three days of rioting
and demonstrations earlier this month that claimed one life, and
Wednesday's action was the fourth crippling national strike since
December.
	   The government blames the gasoline price hike on an 80 percent
Zimbabwe currency drop against the U.S. dollar in the past year.
	   Labor groups say the state is wasting resources keeping 8,000
troops in Congo to support embattled President Laurent Kabila and
should concentrate instead on reviving the crumbling economy.

Yeltsin cancels December visit to India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Kremlin said Wednesday that President Boris
Yeltsin has canceled a state visit next month to India, a
development likely to raise new concern about the health of the
ailing Russian leader.
	   A presidential press official said Yeltsin would be replaced by
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but gave no further details.
	   Yeltsin, who has been plagued by poor health for years, fell ill
in early October with what was described as bronchial problems. He
has since spent most of his time at a government rest home outside
Moscow and is rarely seen in public.
	   Yeltsin met Tuesday with visiting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder at the Kremlin. The Russian leader looked fit and spoke
clearly, but slowly. He did not attend a press conference later
with Schroeder.
	   Kremlin officials said Yeltsin would meet next week in Moscow
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Opposition parties insist that Yeltsin is no longer fit enough
to run the country. The president has been out of sight during
Russia's economic crisis, leaving day-to-day running of the
government to Primakov.
	   Yeltsin, 67, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996 and has
suffered various illnesses since. The president insists his health
is fine and he will serve out the rest of his term, which ends in
200.

Ukraine's Cabinet to allocate funds to try accused mass killers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government has decided to
allocate money for a court in central Ukraine for an unprecedented
trial against two men accused of murdering 52 people, a news report
said Wednesday.
	   The Cabinet would provide 143,000 hryvna (dlrs 41,700) for the
regional court in Zhytomyr, which badly needs the money to bring in
some 400 witnesses who can offer evidence against Anatoliy
Onoprienko and Serhiy Rogozin, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Zhytomyr court officials have said the trial, expected to last
up to a year, could begin as early as next Monday if the required
funds are allocated.
	   Ukraine's Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Onoprienko
and Rogozin be tried in Zhytomyr because most of the murders were
committed there.
	   However, the trial could not start because the underfunded
Zhytomyr court, like many throughout the rest of Ukraine, did not
have money to cover travel and living expenses for the witnesses.
	   Onoprienko and Rogozin were arrested in the spring of 1996 after
a manhunt that lasted three-and-a-half months.
	   The two men are accused of a killing spree in the Zhytomyr
region and western Lviv region that stunned the whole country.
Entire families were killed in several instances, and at least 10
of the victims were children.

	   No. 9 maegashira Tosanoumi was one match behind the leader at
10-1, followed by yokozuna Takanohana at 9-2 and three wrestlers at
8-3 _ Wakanohana and ozekis (champions) Musashimaru and Takanonami.

	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, drove No. 4
maegashira Toki (4-7) after fighting off his foe's hand thrusts.
	   Komusubi (junior champion second class) Dejima sent out
Takanonami with hand thrusts for his sixth victory against five
defeats.

initial charge and tossed down No. 1 maegashira Kaio (6-5) for his
seventh victory against four defeats.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
toppled No. 14 maegashira Akinoshu with an arm throw for his fifth
victory against six defeats. Akinoshu is 2-9.
	   No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, of the
juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi division, twisted
down No. 15 maegashira Oikari, leaving both wrestlers at 5-6.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or
Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, sent out No. 5-ranked Zenshinyama

Indian border guards kill four Bangladeshis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Four Bangladeshis were killed by
Indian border guards in two shootings this week, a news agency and
border officials reported Wednesday.
	   Independent APB news agency, quoting unnamed officials, said
three villagers were shot and killed Sunday as they cut wood near
the border. Indian guards may have thought the three had crossed
the border in the area in central Mymensingh district, 112
kilometers (70 miles) north of Dhaka, the capital. Border officials
reached by The Associated Press confirmed the killings.
	   A fourth Bangladeshi was killed Monday in nearby Jhaniadah
district.
	   Border skirmishes between the two countries have become common
in recent months as India tries to deport people it calls illegal
migrants from Bangladesh. Dhaka denies the Indian claim that poor
Bangladeshis have been crossing the border in search of jobs in
India.
	   On occasion, Indian and Bangladeshi border guards have exchanged
fire. The two countries share a 2,500-mile (4,000-kilometer)
border.

Police probe whether Saudi prince imprisoned servants in hotel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police are investigating whether a
Saudi prince turned a room in the five star hotel where he lives
into a prison for his servants, officials said Wednesday.
	   Two of Prince Turki's servants escaped from a room in the Cairo
Ramses Hilton on Monday by knotting bedsheets together and lowering
themselves through a window from the 29th floor to the 24th floor.
	   The two men told police that the prince locked them in the room
after they complained of mistreatment, police officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The opposition newspaper Al-Ahrar said Wednesday one of the men
was hospitalized for treatment of bone injuries and bruises he
sustained during the escape.
	   A spokesman for the hotel refused to comment on the incident.
	   Prince Turki, one of King Fahd's seven brothers, has been living
in Egypt for 16 years since he fell out with the royal family over
his marriage to a Moroccan women. He rents two floors of the Ramses
Hilton from his family and entourage.
	   Earlier this year, police launched an investigation into claims
that Turki and his wife mistreated servants and locked them up in a
hotel room.
	   Complaints of high-handed behavior by bodyguards of visiting
Saudi royalty are common but the government usually ignores them to
avoid embarrassing publicity.
	   In May, Turki's bodyguards allegedly beat up the Egyptian
husband of an American hairdresser who worked for his wife. Later,
Egypt deported the hairdresser after the prince claimed that the
man visited the hairdresser in her hotel room without permission.
	   Last year, police arrested one of the prince's American
bodyguards after he allegedly punched two men who objected to his
blocking a road with his car.
	   Three of the prince's bodyguards, including an American, were
deported from Egypt in 1995 over similar incidents.

Taiwan suspends stock trading in seven companies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Hoping to restore confidence in the
rattled Taipei stock market, the government ordered seven companies
to suspend trading in their shares while urging major banks
Wednesday to avoid tightening credit to healthy businesses.
	   Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said the seven companies,
which will be suspended from trading for two months beginning
Friday, ran into trouble by overinvesting in the stock market.
	   They were borrowing money to invest, then using their shares as
collateral to buy more shares, in a spiral that was cut off when
banks tightened their credit policies.
	   Amid those problems and rampant rumors of troubles in more
companies, Taiwan has embarked on a plan to try to rebuild
confidence. One goal is to ensure that banks keep extending credit
to good businesses that need it.
	   ``Our business environment is basically sound, and there is no
reason for a credit crunch,'' Yen told a news conference. He added
that Japan's economy has been hurt by shrinking bank loans, and the
problem should not be repeated in Taiwan.
	   Last week, the government set up an intervention fund of 283
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.7 billion) to try to stabilize
the stock market, which had plummeted after several business groups
reported financial troubles and two defaulted on huge stock
purchases.
	   Critics say the bailout measures will distort normal market
operations at the risk of draining government finances. Others have
suggested the measures are a quick fix intended to help Taiwan's
ruling Nationalist Party fare better in Dec. 5 elections for the
national legislature and mayors in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Yen said Wednesday the government will provide loan assistance
only to bail out healthy companies that face short-term cash-flow
problems.
	   Banks operating the stock fund will decide when and what to buy
without government directives, he added.
	   Hit by Asia's financial crisis, Taiwan's economy has slowed and
domestic consumption slumped, leaving many companies struggling to
pay off debts.
	   Keng Ping, president of Dah An Commercial Bank, said he believed
confidence in the market could return if most banks go along with
the government's suggestion and keep lending to sound businesses.
	   ``Most of our businesses shall survive the economy slump,'' Keng
said. ``The problem is a few companies have borrowed too much money
too easily at good times, and those loans were mainly used for
capital gains, not on business expansion.''
	   He defended some of the tighter credit policies, saying: ``Banks
are worried that they can only look into the companies' financial
status, rather than stock speculation by their shareholders.''
	   Keng said companies were buying shares and using them as
collateral for more loans, but they eventually ran into trouble
when credit dried up.
	   The companies whose shares will be suspended for two months
include Chinese Auto, Hung Fu Construction, Kuoyang Construction,
Ace Union Foods and three companies under the New Magnitude Group,
a conglomerate that defaulted on stock purchases early this month.
	   Prices on the stock market seem to have stabilized after the
government intervened last week. But Wei Chuan Food Co. and
Taichung Machinery continued to see their shares fall 7 percent
Wednesday, the daily limit allowed by Taiwan's securities laws,
amid rumors they might default on stock purchases.
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission has said it will revise
laws to better regulate companies buying stocks through their
subsidiaries.

Premier: Kurdish leader must prove he's renounced terrorism

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A ship loaded with about 200 Kurds reached the coast
of Sicily Wednesday, raising fears of a mass exodus of Kurds
encouraged by Italy's refusal so far to extradite their captured
rebel leader.
	   Kurds are launching rallies and hunger strikes across Europe in
opposition to Turkey's request that Abdullah Ocalan be extradited
for trial.
	   An estimated 10,000 Kurds protested in Rome on Tuesday to demand
asylum for their captured leader _ a demand Italy's premier said
would be denied unless the rebel commander has truly renounced
terrorism.
	   The march was the largest yet in days of growing protests since
Italian police arrested Ocalan at Rome's airport Thursday.
	   More than 4,000 also protested Tuesday outside the Interior
Ministry in Bonn, Germany. Smaller but more violent protests were
staged in Moscow, Ankara, Turkey, and the Belgian capital,
Brussels.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Supporters marched past the Colosseum and into Piazza Venezia on
Tuesday, waving red flags and making the streets of downtown Rome
ring with their cries.
	   Kneeling in the piazza, they chanted, ``We love you, Ocalan. We
are with you, Ocalan. We will die for you, Ocalan.''
	   The Kurd would-be immigrants who arrived by ship early Wednesday
said they had departed from a Turkish port and traveled for six
days. Thousands of Kurds fleeing persecution at home have reached
Italy in recent years, but most headed north to Germany or the
Netherlands.
	   Some expect thousands more Kurds will reach Italy in the coming
days and that many will stay in the country if Ocalan is granted
asylum.
	   On Tuesday, Premier Massimo D'Alema told Parliament's lower
house that Ocalan had issued a statement in which he ``rejected all
terrorist actions.'' ``Now it's a matter of seeing whether he
sticks to it,'' D'Alema said.

Three illegal gold miners killed in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Three miners digging illegally for gold in
central Vietnam were killed when their 30-meter-deep
(100-foot-deep) tunnel collapsed, police said Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred Saturday in Quang Nam province, police
said. Some parts of the province had been submerged by downpours
from Tropical Storm Chip.
	   Several hundred people have gone to the province for a gold
rush, police said. Provincial authorities have been trying to crack
down on illegal gold mining, but it has proved difficult.
	   Gold mining without a government permit is illegal in Vietnam.
	   Last year, 26 illegal gold miners were killed in tunnel
collapses in the province.

Police probe whether Saudi prince imprisoned servants in hotel

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police are investigating whether a
Saudi prince turned a room in the five star hotel where he lives
into a prison for his servants, officials said Wednesday.

Threats to Mahathir less serious than to Indonesia's Suharto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMES HOOKWAY &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Unemployment, inflation and
anti-government protests in neighboring Indonesia ended the 32-year
rule of President Suharto. Now, political unrest is intensifying in
Malaysia.
	   But economists and political commentators say threats to the
survival of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his government are
far less serious.
	   Despite a full-blown riot Oct. 24, they say Malaysia is unlikely
to explode the way Indonesia did _ largely because it has avoided
the economic cataclysm that slammed its giant, much poorer
neighbor.
	   Unemployment in Malaysia is forecast to hit 6 percent this year
_ high for an economy that until last year was growing so fast that
it had to import workers, but low compared with 20 percent in
Indonesia. Inflation is 5.6 percent, far below the 80 percent
Indonesian rate forecast this year.
	   And Malaysians are much richer than Indonesians. In 1996, even
before the Asian crisis slashed Indonesian incomes, Malaysia had a
per-capita income of dlrs 4,370 a year, compared with dlrs 1,080 in
Indonesia.
	   ``People aren't so desperate. They're not as angry,'' Noordin
Sopiee, an adviser to the Malaysian government, told Dow Jones
Newswires. ``When there's adversity here, people lose their jobs.
Over there, people don't eat.''
	   Protests against the arrest and trial of Mahathir's former
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, embarrassed the Malaysian leader as he
played host to a meeting of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   On Monday, U.S. Vice President Al Gore added to Mahathir's image
of international isolation by referring in a speech to the ``brave
Malaysians'' agitating for change.
	   But Mahathir is a political survivor who has lasted 17 years in
power, becoming the longest-ruling Asian leader when Suharto of
Indonesia was forced to step down in July.
	   Mahathir, 72, has dramatically transformed Malaysia from a
supplier of rubber, tin and oil into a manufacturing center for
computers and consumer electronics, with growing auto, banking and
high-tech industries.
	   Many supporters of Anwar, who denies sex and corruption charges
that he says are politically motivated, also think the danger of
bloodshed is slight.
	   One man, a physician educated abroad, said Saturday as he sat
watching protesters who were later scattered by police that he was
sure Kuala Lumpur wouldn't see the kind of violence that has
scarred the Indonesian capital.
	   ``This is civilized, isn't it? You can sit here and have a
coffee with all these demonstrations happening around you. It's not
like this in Jakarta,'' said the man, who declined to be named.
	   And Mahathir's government has taken dramatic steps to attack its
economic slump. A radical policy unveiled in early September froze
the exchange rate of the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, and
limited flows of money into and out of the country.
	   Its goal is to protect the currency against inflation while the
government tries to stimulate the economy with more spending and
looser credit.
	   Though government leaders say the plan is working, economic
statistics tell a different story.
	   In the month after the new controls were imposed, a decline in
industrial production accelerated, and car sales sagged after a
mild recovery.
	   Mahathir's position could weaken if the economy doesn't turn
around, said Bill Belchere, a senior researcher for Merrill Lynch
in Singapore.
	   ``I don't think change will come from a direct political
challenge,'' Belchere said. ``It comes from the economy winding
down.''

Top Russian official warns of ``national catastrophe''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a mission of the International Monetary Fund
back in town Wednesday for talks on more loans, a top Cabinet
member warned that Russia is facing a ``national catastrophe.''
	   Without foreign money infusions, Russia will have to print large
amounts of new rubles, triggering high inflation and a sharp drop
in industrial output, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said in
an interview with the business daily Kommersant.
	   If the current government fails to stabilize the economic
situation, ``we will be facing a national catastrophe that would
write off the free-market economy, democracy and the territorial
integrity of Russia,'' he said.
	   The Russian government has been pushing the IMF to release the
next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion aid package, saying
more loans are vital for dealing with the worst economic crisis
since the Soviet collapse.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pushed for more IMF
loans at his meetings this week with visiting German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder in Moscow and with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where both men attended the annual
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.
	   Primakov said more loans are essential for Russia to pay off its
huge debts, including those to the IMF and the World Bank.
	   Primakov said he was satisfied with the talks, but there was no
sign that Washington or Bonn would back further international aid.
	   However, Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, who
accompanied Primakov, said the meeting with Gore ``significantly
advanced'' the Russian plea for more loans, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported on Wednesday.
	   The IMF has urged the Russian Cabinet to start implementing a
sober economic plan and put forward a realistic budget for the next
year as the key condition for more loans. It has criticized the
government's blueprint, finally released over the weekend after two
months of hesitation, as scarce on specifics and heavy on state
intervention in the economy.
	   The IMF officials said they expected little from the current
round of talks, as the sides remained where they were before.
	   A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday that the Russian government appears to believe it can lobby
Western leaders into forcing the IMF to make concessions.
	   Despite IMF warnings against money printing, Russia has already
printed some cash to help its ailing banks and pay some debts,
although officials said the amount was small and wouldn't fuel
inflation. Maslyukov said in the interview that the amount of new
cash wouldn't exceed 15-20 billion rubles (dlrs 0.8-1.2 billion).
	   Speaking at a Cabinet session on Wednesday, Maslyukov said the
Russian currency would float in a band ``plus or minus three or
four rubles'' around the current rate of 17 rubles to the dollar.

Mir undamaged by ``meteor shower''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no Russian satellites damaged by shower in new

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Mir space station was unaffected by a
cloud of micro-meteorite particles and its crew didn't even notice
any of them, officials said Wednesday.
	   Ground controllers ordered cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei
Avdeyev to go to the Soyuz escape capsule when the ``meteor
shower,'' consisting of very small particles that are remnants of a
comet, reached its peak Tuesday night.
	   The crew ``neither saw nor heard'' the shower and all the
station's systems were functioning normally, Mission Control said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. There had been concern that
the particles could puncture the Mir's surface.
	   During the encounter, the Mir's position was adjusted to avoid
as much of the shower as possible.
	   During a spacewalk last week, Padalka and Avdeyev mounted a
French-made ``meteorite trap'' on the Mir's outer surface. The
device, intended to catch particles for study, will stay attached
to the Mir until 1999, when it is due to be taken back to Earth by
a French astronaut, due to fly to the station early next year.
	   None of Russia's 137 military and civilian satellites currently
in orbit has been damaged by the shower, the Russian strategic
forces said in a statement, according to the ITAR-Tass.
	   The meteorites are the debris of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle which
approached the Earth last January. They look like clouds of glowing
gases with small solid particles.

China expels German reporter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A reporter for the German magazine Der Spiegel
said he was ordered Wednesday to leave China within 48 hours by
state security officers who accused him of illegally obtaining
state secrets.
	   A group of eight officials, most apparently state security
police, burst into the office of Juergen Kremb, manhandled him and
told him he had to leave the country and could not return for five
years, the reporter said.
	   ``They stormed in quite roughly and pressed me against the
wall,'' Kremb said.
	   He was the second reporter expelled by Chinese authorities in
two months. In October, a Japanese journalist was expelled after
the government accused him of stealing and buying state secrets.
	   Kremb, who had been working in Singapore since July and returned
Tuesday to Beijing to cover a jazz festival, said he had no idea
what precipitated the trouble.
	   Although Kremb had transferred out of China, he said his Foreign
Ministry accreditation had not yet expired and he retained a valid
visa to enter the country. This was his fourth return visit. He
said he had originally planned to leave China on Saturday.
	   Kremb's replacement in Beijing was due to arrive in January.
	   The reporter said that on Tuesday, a group of state security
officers entered the magazine's office and searched it for three
hours. Afterward, they produced documents they said they had found
in his possession, presented an arrest warrant, and threatened
Kremb with handcuffs, which they did not use.
	   The officials asked Kremb to sign a ``confession'' that said he
had violated Chinese law, possessed state secrets and had refused
to cooperate with the authorities. Kremb refused, and they
eventually left.
	   During both encounters with the police, Kremb was denied
requests to call the German Embassy.
	   It was Kremb's second major confrontation with the police. In
April 1997, the reporter was detained for two days for visiting the
hometown of then-imprisoned dissident Wei Jingsheng, who has since
been released into exile.
	   The Chinese government has strict regulations regarding
activities of foreign journalists, although the rules are enforced
arbitrarily.
	   Kremb is the second German reporter to be forced from the
country in recent years. In 1995, the government refused to renew a
visa for Henrik Bork, a reporter for the Frankfurter Rundschau
newspaper, obliging him to leave the country earlier than he had
planned.

Euro Disney net profit up 34 percent despite attendance drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite a fall in theme park attendance, Euro
Disney reported Wednesday that net profit rose 34 percent to 290
million francs (dlrs 51.8 million) for the year that ended Sept.
30.
	   Euro Disney SCA, the French unit of Walt Disney Co., said theme
park revenue rose 3 percent to 3.04 billion francs (dlrs 542.8
million) from a year earlier, despite a fall-off in attendance in
June and July due to the World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Attendance at Disneyland Paris, east of the capital, fell to
12.51 million visitors, from 12.57 million a year earlier.
	   In a statement, the company said a 180 million-franc (dlrs 32
million) rise in lease and net financial charges to 895 million
francs (dlrs 160 million) was more than offset by a 50 percent rise
in profit before exceptional items to 248 million francs (dlrs 44
million) from a year earlier.
	   Hotels and Disney Village revenue rose 10 percent to 2.39
billion francs (dlrs 426.8 million) from a year before thanks to a
boost in convention activity and strong corporate business during
the World Cup, Euro Disney said.
	   The company added that exceptional gains of 42 million francs
(dlrs 7.5 million) were due mainly to non-recurring gains on the
company's shopping mall, business and residential project.
	   Euro Disney said the current financial year will see the partial
reinstatement of royalties and management fees to Walt Disney Co. _
waived for the last five years _ with the impact estimated at
around 200 million francs (dlrs 36 million). Lease charges are also
set to rise by around 82 million francs (dlrs 14.6 million) next
year.
	   New projects for 1999 include the spring launch of ``Honey, I
Shrunk The Audience!,'' the first major new attraction in the theme
park since 1995, and continued expansion of the Disney Village, the
company said.
	   Euro Disney, 39 percent owned by the Walt Disney Co. based in
Burbank, California, opened its doors in April 1992 and has
reported annual profit since 1995.

Forestry officials order temporary halt on disputed DiCaprio film
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai officials have ordered a temporary
halt to preliminary work for an upcoming Leonardo DiCaprio film,
``The Beach,'' to allow environmental complaints to be examined.
	   The order by the Forestry Department amounts to a setback for
20th Century Fox, the film's maker, which is also embroiled in a
dispute with Thailand's Film Board over plans to remake ``The King
and I.''
	   Plans to film Alex Garland's best-selling novel on Phi Island
off southern Thailand have fallen afoul of environmentalists, who
say that laws to protect the national park are being violated.
	   Parts of a beach have been bulldozed and the film maker wants to
plant a coconut grove.
	   The Forestry Department has granted approval to the project and
the film maker has paid a security deposit against environmental
damage.
	   But a noisy campaign by environmental activists persuaded
department officials to decide Tuesday to suspend the work for two
weeks to further study threats to the island's delicate ecology.
	   A committee consisting of biological, forestry and fishery
experts, including some local residents, will report its findings
in two weeks.
	   The film's Thai coordinators had not yet received the order and
said Wednesday they would continue production until they did.
	   Critics of the environmentalists note that Phi Island has
already been damaged _ despite its protected status _ by the
illegal construction of tourist facilities allowed by corrupt
officials.
	   Fox's plans to film ``Anna and The King,'' starring Jodie Foster
and Chow Yun Fat, in Thailand have been rejected by the Film Board
on grounds the film portrays 19th century monarch King Mongkut in a
disrespectful light.

Free-trade summit in Malaysia ends with modest proposals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Malaysia, U.S. minimizing impact of differences
in grafs 16-17. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's worst
economic crisis in decades, following a disappointing summit
overshadowed by conflicts about human rights and free trade.
	   The group's final statement praised signs of recovery in
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. It said these hard-hit
countries should continue adopting painful reforms recommended by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also
called for more financial assistance from the international
community, and endorsed a U.S. proposal to speed emergency loans to
the Asian countries at the center of the crisis.
	   Despite the strong anti-free market views promoted by this
year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC
statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign exchange
trading or new controls on the movement of capital in and out of
countries.
	   Offering Mahathir a consolation prize, the statement did call
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that the
agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily,
without proper review.
	   ``We are resolved to work together to support an early and
sustained recovery in the region, to contain the risks of contagion
and prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, read by Mahathir at the conclusion of the two-day summit
by APEC leaders.
	   The statement also praised China for maintaining the value of
its currency, the yuan, and Japan for announcing a new stimulus
package and reform measures to revive its ailing economy.
	   Some of the leaders, standing under the sun in stifling heat,
mopped their faces with handkerchiefs as the declaration was read.
	   The free-trade forum was overshadowed by a diplomatic furor set
off by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and by a disagreement between
the United States and Japan which forced the group to delay a
landmark free-trade agreement.
	   The pact sought to slash tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in world
trade. But opposition by Japan to opening up two of the nine
proposed sectors _ fishing and forestry products _ forced APEC to
send the plan to the 124-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva
for resolution.
	   But Gore also announced an agreement with Japan on a joint
approach to dealing with the financial crisis, including a dlrs 10
billion support package designed to help struggling Asian nations.
	   Half the money will come from the United States and the other
half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The assistance, although small compared with the magnitude of
the region's debt burdens, should help assure nervous financial
markets.
	   Gore's decision to deliver a speech on the eve of the summit
that sympathized with the host country's anti-government reform
movement caused divisions among APEC's leaders.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Gore's
remarks could put the nation's democratic process at risk. And APEC
officials from Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand urged the vice
president to stick to economic issues during the meetings.
	   After reading the APEC statement Wednesday, Mahathir brushed
aside two questions from reporters about Gore's comments, saying he
was not aware of any differences between them.
	   The U.S. side also rejected suggestions that Gore's comments had
distracted the summit from dealing with the serious economic crisis
in Asia.
	   Gore was a stand-in for President Bill Clinton, who stayed in
Washington because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   Protests by supporters of Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim have
occurred in the country since he was fired as deputy prime
minister, arrested and put on trial after challenging Mahathir's
17-year rule.
	   During the APEC meetings, top officials from the U.S.,
Philippine, Canadian and Australian delegations met privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to sympathize with his campaign and to
express concern over his treatment and trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   With Asia in its worst financial crisis in decades, the APEC
summit was intended to be a chance for the leaders to recommend
measures that would help revive economic growth and stabilize
currency and stock markets.
	   The crisis, which began in July 1997 in Thailand, has spread to
Russia and is threatening Brazil and other Latin American nations.
Even the U.S. economy has felt the effects.
	   As expected, the final statement appeared to hew closely to the
Clinton administration's free-market, pro-IMF handling of the
crisis.
	   The IMF has organized loan packages totaling nearly dlrs 120
billion to Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bolster
their economies. In return, it has demanded the nations adopt
unpopular measures that have sent interest rates soaring and
unemployment rising. Not all Asia's leaders have embraced the IMF
formula.
	   Mahathir has criticized the bailout programs and blamed Asia's
woes on foreign currency speculators. In September, he banned
trading of the national currency outside the country and imposed
controls on foreigners trying to pull money out of Malaysia.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials are to
relaunch long-suspended talks about a final peace treaty Wednesday,
while snags threatened implementation of the Wye accord signed just
last month.
	   The meeting was an indication that the peace process was moving
once again after a series of wrangles over implementation.
	   But there was another dispute, as well, this time over the first
group of Palestinian prisoners Israel was to release. Palestinians
complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were ordinary
criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps under the
accord. A green light from the Cabinet will set in motion a series
of steps, including an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
probably on Friday.
	   By a wide margin, Israel's 120-member Knesset Tuesday endorsed
the accord, negotiated in a marathon summit at Wye Plantation and
signed at the White House Oct. 23. The dovish opposition Labor
Party provided the margin of approval in the 75 to 19 vote with
nine abstentions. Most of the ``no'' votes came from Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's own coalition. Five members of his Cabinet
voted against the accord and others were absent.
	   Right-wingers charged that the pullback endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. They complained that the government did
not present detailed maps of areas to be handed over to the
Palestinians over the next three months.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet at the Foreign
Ministry in Jerusalem with Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, known as
Abu Mazen, to discuss a permanent peace treaty between the two
sides.
	   It will be the first official meeting about a final status
agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996. Abbas said
on the Voice of Palestine that his meeting with Sharon will focus
on the agenda for full-scale talks on a permanent settlement which
he expected to begin in a week to 10 days.
	   The interim framework, including the Wye accord, is set to
expire on May 4, 1999.
	   ``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements,'' Abu Mazen said.
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to rifles by Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, led to a mini-crisis Monday. Netanyahu
suspended Israel's withdrawal until Arafat retracted the statement.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment
to negotiations as the only way to settle disputes with Israel. The
Israelis accepted this as a retraction and lifted their suspension
threat.
	   Meanwhile, a new dispute arose over the release of Palestinian
prisoners. Abbas, who met Israeli Internal Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani Tuesday, said there was agreement to release
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons Friday, and the protocol
allowing opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza would be signed
Thursday so flights could begin Friday.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Arafat, complained that the 150
prisoners to be released are common criminals, not members of
resistance groups. He charged that this was a violation of the Wye
agreement and said the Palestinians have complained to the United
States. Special envoy Dennis Ross will seek to resolve the issue,
he added.
	   There was still some doubt about the timing of the withdrawal
because Israel insisted that the Palestinians fulfill all their
commitments according to the timetable in the Wye accord before any
land is turned over.
	   An Israeli statement said the Cabinet would examine whether
Palestinian terror suspects have been arrested, a plan to
confiscate illegal arms is in place and a statement against
incitement has been published.
	   According to the Wye agreement, the first Israeli pullback
involves giving the Palestinians civilian rule over two percent of
West Bank land now under full Israeli control. Also, an area
amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank is to be transferred from
joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full Palestinian rule. The
pullback had been scheduled for Monday.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the biggest anti-government turnout
since deadly clashes with the military last week, about 3,000
student protesters took to downtown streets Wednesday as Parliament
started work on political reforms that fall short of their demands.
	   Meanwhile, police with sticks beat student activists who forced
their way into the governor's office in Surabaya, Indonesia's
second-largest city. Radio reports said several students were
injured.
	   Hundreds of protesters demanding democratic reform also tore
down the gates of the local Parliament in Surabaya.
	   In Jakarta, two protests brought rush-hour traffic chaos to the
city.
	   About 1,500 students marched peacefully past hotels and office
buildings, but were blocked by about 100 army anti-riot officers
from proceeding to the National Monument near the presidential
palace. Many carried flowers to commemorate their slain friends.
	   To avoid a confrontation, the group headed toward Atama Jaya
University, where soldiers and police had opened fire on protesters
last Friday.
	   A separate group of about 1,500 demonstrators, riding in and
atop 15 buses, was blocked by soldiers about 200 meters (yards)
from the Parliament building.
	   In a speech that opened a new session of the legislature,
Speaker Harmoko warned that any delay to the reform process could
``trigger new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation,
already beset by political and economic turmoil.
	   He said parliamentary elections in May or early June 1999 would
be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct, open to
all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired plastic bullets at protesters. Other people,
including some police, died when rioting broke out in parts of
Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Thousands of troops guarded the Parliament. The military opened
fired on students when they tried to march there last week.
	   City authorities said 123 buildings and 97 cars were damaged or
set afire, the newspaper The Jakarta Post reported.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto took out advertisements in
several national newspapers expressing his ``sincere condolences''
for last week's deaths.
	   Opposition and students have demanded that Wiranto resign as
armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of the
shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.
	   It was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people in
May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   ``For those who died outside the Parliament we deliver our
condolences and hope that the deaths will prove to be meaningful in
the long term,'' Harmoko said.
	   Police have questioned more than a dozen opposition figures,
including two retired generals, in a sedition inquiry.
	   Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has alleged that the student protests were orchestrated by
conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted police as saying those questioned were
suspected of subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of
lifetime imprisonment.
	   Five were summoned to police headquarters Wednesday. The roundup
is the first major crackdown on dissidents since Habibie took
office.
	   ``The accusations are a mere fabrication,'' said Lt. Gen. Kemal
Idris, a retired army general, before he entered the National
Police headquarters.
	   Last week's bloodshed erupted after tens of thousands of
students tried to march on the green-domed legislature where the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly approved a range of
political reforms sponsored by Habibie.
	   These reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly but is now sitting in its own
right.
	   Although the reforms called for new elections and go some way in
dismantling Suharto's authoritarian legacy, the students and other
critics say that they do not represent true democratic reform.
	   They have demanded that the powerful military be banned from
political activity and that Suharto be tried for corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   Instead the assembly merely approved a decree to reduce the
number of seats the military will have in Parliament. The number
was expected to be cut back from a current 75 to 55.
	   While it also named Suharto in a decree calling for a full
corruption investigation, critics say the move is largely cosmetic.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police are investigating whether a
Saudi prince turned a room in the five star hotel where he lives
into a prison for his servants, officials said Wednesday.
	   Two of Prince Turki's servants escaped from a room in the Cairo
Ramses Hilton on Monday by knotting bedsheets together and lowering
themselves through a window from the 29th floor to the 24th floor.
	   The two men told police that the prince locked them in the room
after they complained of mistreatment, police officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The opposition newspaper Al-Ahrar said Wednesday one of the men
was hospitalized for treatment of bone injuries and bruises he
sustained during the escape.
	   A spokesman for the hotel refused to comment on the incident.
	   Prince Turki, one of King Fahd's six full brothers, has been
living in Egypt for 16 years since he fell out with the royal
family over his marriage to a Moroccan women. He rents two floors
of the Ramses Hilton from his family and entourage.

Parliament mulls poverty line bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A poor Russian is entitled to one bath towel every
23 years, the government has decided.
	   Parliament is now debating a bill that establishes the basic
needs of all Russians, to be used in calculating minimum wages and
pensions. Excerpts were printed in a newspaper Wednesday.
	   Basics for a woman include six pairs of panty hose and five
pairs of underwear every two years, two bras every three years, a
skirt and a dress every five years and a winter coat every eight
years, the business daily Kommersant reported.
	   ``The concept of the needs of poor people would make the
Spartans envious,'' the newspaper said.
	   The measure, drafted by the government, is intended purely as a
calculating device, and doesn't envisage rationing.
	   The government also wants to monitor the consumer market to
ensure minimum levels of supply as the country deals with the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Lawmakers in the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, held
hearings this week to discuss the bill and many criticized it.
	   ``A Russian woman will lose fertility in such conditions,'' one
expert said.
	   ``Why should I sleep on the same pillow for 25 years?'' exploded
Vladimir Pashuto, a deputy head of the parliament committee for
labor issues, referring to another of the guidelines. ``By
approving such a consumer basket we would legalize poverty.''
	   However, most lawmakers supported the bill during the hearings,
clearing it for consideration by the full parliament.

Le Pen says he will decide on appeal by Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said he plans to
announce his decision whether to appeal an assault conviction that
bans him from politics for a year by next Monday.
	   Le Pen told the France Soir newspaper in an interview that
appeared Wednesday that he was very tempted to appeal to France's
highest court to reverse the decision by an appeals court.
	   The appeals court on Tuesday upheld an assault conviction
against Le Pen, which means he cannot hold office, run for office
or vote for a year unless he launches a final, successful appeal.
	   If he fails, he will be ineligible to run in European Parliament
elections in June 1999. He has said his wife, Jany, would run in
his place, a move that has divided National Front supporters.
	   The court rejected Le Pen's appeal against an April conviction
for assaulting a Socialist politician, but reduced the punishment
from a two-year ban to one year.
	   ``I am going to first of all read the judicial decision and talk
with my lawyers and political friends,'' Le Pen told France Soir.
	   Since the period to file the appeal is very short, ``I will be
obliged to make my decision before Friday and will announce it
Monday at the latest,'' Le Pen said.
	   He defended his decision to put up his wife in his stead if
denied the possibility to run in the European Parliament vote,
saying she ``has an enormous political advantage over everybody
because she has my name.''
	   The National Front has won about 15 percent of the vote in
recent national and regional elections. It blames immigrants,
especially from North Africa, for high unemployment and crime. It
has been widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.

Dispersed families excited about sightseeing tour to North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ship leaving port; EDITS to conform. No pick up &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ Fireworks and balloons brightened
the evening sky, celebrating Wednesday's departure of a cruise ship
carrying South Korean tourists to a scenic mountain along the
North's east coast.
	   The five-day, four-night tour to Diamond Mountain marks the
first big joint venture between the two rival Korean states. Brass
bands and waving onlookers watched the ship slide out of the port
and head to North Korea.
	   If all goes well, Lee Man-soo will get a distant glimpse of the
seaside village he left 48 years ago.
	   Lee believes his brothers, who would be 74 and 77, still live in
Songjun-ri, 12 miles from Diamond Mountain. But like others paying
up to dlrs 2,530 each for the trip, Lee knows he won't be allowed
to visit the village or seek them out.
	   No reunions is just one of many restrictions the visitors must
abide by. Among the other rules: No photographing or talking to
North Koreans, no straying from the group, no acts or remarks
critical of North Korea's human rights or social and political
systems.
	   ``Half-happy and half-sad, that's my feeling,'' Lee, 67, said
before his departure.
	   ``I couldn't live a single day in the past half-century without
tears,'' Lee said, holding the wrinkled hand of his 63-year-old
wife, Ji Un-suk, a North Korea native who was accompanying him.
``Setting foot on North Korean soil is my lifetime dream.''
	   It was a cold winter day in 1950 when Lee was drafted into the
North Korean People's Army to serve as a medic at the height of the
Korean War. In early 1951, he surrendered when his battalion was
routed by American troops. Later, he was set free and became a
South Korean citizen.
	   ``I became a Christian and I'm now happily married. But I always
feel empty somewhere deep in my heart. Family, my family in the
North, always gives me pain,'' he said.
	   About 10 million people in both Koreas remain separated from
their families since the division of their peninsula into the
communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 and the 1950-53
Korean War. Their border, the world's most heavily armed, is sealed
with no mail or other direct means of communications.
	   The organizer of the tour, the Hyundai group, had hoped to send
up to 2,000 tourists a week on the tours. But only 1,200 people
have signed up for the first two cruises, reflecting disappointment
in the restrictions and tighter economic times.
	   Although Lee won't see his family, he still considers himself
lucky because he is one of those who will be coming closest to
their homes. He happily remembers the days he climbed Diamond
Mountain twice.
	   Shim Jae-rin, at 98 the oldest person on the tour, lived on the
west coast several hundred miles from Diamond Mountain, but says
that ``going to the mountain is going halfway to my home.''
	   He's had to take sleeping pills to calm himself since his
friends and neighbors chipped in to pay his dlrs 800 fare.
	   Shim, a widower, said his brother in Los Angeles visited the
North a few years ago and confirmed that many of his relatives are
still alive in his hometown of Jinnampo.
	   While sympathizing with the problems of separated family
members, government officials are concerned that emotionally
overwhelmed visitors may break away to try to meet their families.
	   ``Don't think ever that family reunion will be possible. If you
do anything to provoke North Koreans, that will jeopardize the
whole tour project,'' Sohn In-sup, a government instructor, said
during a recent orientation.

Thousands of workers and pupils protest economic hardships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of workers and students
protested economic hardships or unheated classrooms in several
cities and called for the resignation of the government, media
reported Wednesday.
	   Some 5,000 workers gathered Tuesday in a central square in the
western city of Timisoara, where the revolt which toppled communism
started in 1989.
	   ``Shame on the government! Resignation! We want privatization
not robbery!'' shouted protesters, the National daily reported.
	   Workers accused the government of not having any strategy on
reducing communist-era state ownership and said too high taxes were
causing widespread poverty.
	   They carried black coffins inscribed with ``Our Hope,'' which
they said they would send to Premier Radu Vasile and President Emil
Constantinescu as a bitter Christmas gift.
	   The coffins were a symbol of ``the burial of the Romanian
economy,'' reported the paper.
	   In recent weeks, thousands of protesters have taken to the
streets to vent their anger at the government, which is accused of
doing too little to retool the economy along market lines.
	   The average monthly salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120) and
unemployment stands at about 8 percent.
	   Trade union leaders who joined the protest in Timisoara, some
425 kilometers (266 miles) northwest of Bucharest, said Romanians
had lost their confidence in the president.
	   ``Our president ... is good at making nice promises but
(delivers) nothing concrete,'' Matei Bratianu, the leader of the
National Union Block, told the daily Adevarul.
	   Hundreds of students, aged from 10 to 16, on Tuesday refused to
enter unheated classrooms in the cities of Giurgiu and Calan after
the national natural gas distributor, Romgaz cut off service
because of unpaid bills. Some teachers joined their protests.

Serbian president heads for Kosovo despite Albanian boycott
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's president arrived in Kosovo
on Wednesday for talks doomed to failure because of a boycott by
ethnic Albanians, while a newspaper published what it reported was
a U.S. draft plan outlining virtual self-rule for the province.
	   President Milan Milutinovic was pressing for a direct meeting
with a Kosovo Albanian delegation, apparently seeking to assert
Serbia's stand that any negotiations on the future of the
separatist province is its internal issue.
	   But Serbian authority over Kosovo appeared to be put to question
in the draft plan published by the daily Koha Ditore. It envisages
almost no Serbian control of the Albanian-majority province, while
leaving it under partial jurisdiction of Yugoslavia, made up of
Serbia and Montenegro.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the authenticity of the
plan. But previous versions published in the past have proven
accurate.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, trying to find a peace formula,
discussed the American draft on Tuesday with independence-minded
ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Their support is crucial in the wake of
an uneasy cease fire that for the most part ended nearly eight
months of fighting between them and a joint force of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces.
	   There were no immediate comments from Serb and Albanian
politicians. But Serbian media have reported the government
disapproves of the plan because it sharply curtails its authority
in the province.
	   The draft published Wednesday said Kosovo would have its own
president, courts, government and parliament. Only defense, foreign
affairs, customs, foreign trade and monetary policy would be in the
hands of the Yugoslav federation.
	   The plan further envisages Kosovo's many ethnic communities
sharing power according to ethnic structure _ giving Kosovo's
90-percent Albanian majority the clear advantage _ and solving
disputed internal issues in the Kosovo Supreme Court. If the
dispute remains unsolved it would go to the European courts.
	   Disputes with Serbia and the federation would be solved in a
special court, which would include representatives of Yugoslavia,
Kosovo and the international community.
	   The reported plan seems to push Kosovo further away from Serbia
and bring it closer to becoming a de-facto third republic in the
Yugoslav federation. Koha Ditore said it published only the first
part of the plan.
	   Serbia is unlikely to accept such a solution for Kosovo because
it insists that its province is the cradle of Serb history and
culture.
	   A top ethnic Albanian negotiator, however, indicated Tuesday his
side could settle for less than long-proclaimed goal of
independence. Fehmi Agani said giving Kosovo equal rights as Serbia
and Montenegro within Yugoslavia would be acceptable, if such
status were respected by Serbia.
	   It was not clear whether the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army would
agree to any deal short of the independence they have been fighting
for. The guerrillas said they would give their opinion on the plan
in 10 days.
	   Agani and others who are part of the more moderate camp around
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova said they would boycott talks
called for by Milutinovic, describing it as a cheap publicity
stunt. Agani said a basic formula for Kosovo must be found before
direct talks could start.
	   Ethnic Albanians have so far rejected 16 such invitations for
talks by the Serbian government. The Serbs are apparently trying to
ease international pressure by attempting to persuade world powers
that they are committed to peace.

Vatican deaths inquiry still under way, Swiss Guard commander says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A Vatican investigation into the
slaying of the Swiss Guard's former commander has yet to produce
results, the tiny papal force's new leader said Wednesday.
	   Pius Segmueller took over the Swiss Guard in August, three
months after the death of Alois Estermann. A report will be
published as soon as the internal inquiry is concluded, Segmueller
said.
	   In May, Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, were found
dead of gunshot wounds in their apartment inside the Vatican walls.
	   Laying next to them was the body of guard member Cedric Tornay,
whom the Vatican said killed the couple and himself in a fit of
madness.
	   Segmueller, speaking at a news conference marking his first 100
days as commander, said he aims to make the training of Swiss Guard
recruits more professional.
	   New regulations planned for next year will bring the force's
promotion procedures in line with those of the Swiss army, he
added.
	   The guards provide ceremonial guard duty, assist at Vatican
functions and provide protection for the pontiff.
	   With 16 new recruits now in training, the corps has grown to 110
members, Segmueller said.

Fed rate cut helps lift most Asian shares

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Blue chips rallied Wednesday on Asia's three
top stock exchanges _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore _ in response
to lower U.S. interest rates and speculation that Japan might do
more to fix its economic troubles.
	   Prices were mixed in smaller markets.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the region's biggest, the key
Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues rose 186.23 points, or 1.29
percent, closing at 14,599.23.
	   The quarter-point decrease in U.S. interest rates helped support
Tokyo prices, but traders were also buying stocks on expectations
that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi might offer further economic
stimulus measures as U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives on
Thursday.
	   ``With Clinton coming here, Obuchi has to look good,'' said
Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of
blue chips, gained 64.73 points, or 0.6 percent, closing at
10,213.42.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, cut its discount rate early Wednesday, stirring
speculation that commercial Hong Kong banks will cut their own
rates at a meeting Friday. The U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed rates
Tuesday, after Asian exchanges had closed for the day.
	   John Lo, an associate institutional sales director at BNP Prime
Peregrine Securities Ltd., saw two reasons for the Hong Kong rally:
``The rate cut news and the better regional markets.''
	   Shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore also soared, thanks to
the U.S. rate cut as well as an interest rate reduction announced
earlier Tuesday by the Development Bank of Singapore, one of its
top four banks.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index closed up 2.9 percent, or
35.94 points, at 1,271.70.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished lower, with
traders focusing more on a fall by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand
Ltd. than they were on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's plans to
ease monetary policy. The index closed down 11.55 points at
1,975.95.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed broadly lower, with some large

 &UR; Economists warn German government on deficit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government
faces the risk of higher budget deficits after Europe's single
currency kicks in, the government's council of economic advisers
said Wednesday.
	   Failure by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to cut costly social
welfare programs will reverse a trend of falling deficits pushed
through in Germany to help make the euro a stable currency for its
Jan. 1 debut, the group's annual report said.
	   Germany's budget deficit will be 1.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year, dropping to 1.8 percent in 1999, the report
said.
	   But five-man panel warned that the trend won't hold.
	   ``The causes of recent deficit developments make it clear that
this isn't a sustainable development,''
	   A chief cause was a lack of reform in Germany's wide social
safety net, according to the report.
	   Schroeder's government, which came to power in September
elections, has failed to make clear how it will meet promises for
rigor in government spending, the report said.
	   The government's plans so far _ including pressure on central
bankers to lower interest rate and attempts to increase Germans'
spending power with tax cuts _ were ``not designed to counter
uncertainty among investors and consumers.''
	   ``Financial policy therefore is not making the necesary
contribution to a stabilization of expectations,'' the report
added.

Lawyers ask court to reveal date of first Philippine execution in
</HEADLINE>
22 years &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prison official saying Echegaray has learned of
execution order, turned to prayer; Echegaray requesting copies of
Bibles for 16 of 21 fellow death convicts, grafs 7-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lawyers for the first convict to be
executed in the Philippines in 22 years urged a judge Wednesday to
reveal the date of his execution so he could prepare for it.
	   The impending execution by lethal injection of Leo Echegaray,
38, would be the first since capital punishment was reimposed in
the country in 1994. A debate on the death penalty has divided
Filipinos.
	   On Monday, Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court, which convicted Echegaray of raping his stepdaughter
in 1994, issued an order to National Prisons Director Pedro Sistoza
to execute the convict.
	   It was not immediately known whether an execution date, required
to be a working day, had been set by Ponferrada. Under government
rules, Echegaray would not be informed of the date until after
sunrise on execution day, a prohibition described by his lawyers as
inhumane.
	   Theodore Te, Echegaray's lawyer, said he appealed to Ponferrada
to reconsider her execution order. If she fixes a date, he also
petitioned the judge to inform Echegaray in advance.
	   ``The confidentiality of the working day designated by the judge
deprives Mr. Echegaray of due process as well as the right to be
informed,'' he told reporters. There was no immediate reply from
the judge.
	   A prison official said Echegaray already has been informed of
the execution order and has taken it calmly. ``He's OK, he's
stable,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Echegaray has turned to prayer, and has
requested copies of the Bible for 16 of 21 death-row inmates who
don't have one. The death sentences of the 21 inmates have been
upheld by the Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences.
	   The 21 convicts are being held separately from more than 800
other death-row inmates in a maximum-security prison area in
suburban Muntinlupa city.
	   Philippine executions in the past customarily were carried out
on Fridays. Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84
criminals by electrocution.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty, but it
gave congress the option of restoring it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking. Legislators,
alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option when they brought back
executions, by electric chair and gassing, in 1994.
	   Two years later, the law was changed to prescribe lethal
injections as the only method of execution.
	   Proponents say the death penalty would deter crime by
frightening would-be criminals. They say crime remains rampant
because no one among the death-row convicts has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death
penalty say there is no proof of that, and that the poor are
disadvantaged because they cannot afford good lawyers for their
defense.
	   President Joseph Estrada, who can grant clemency and save
Echegaray from death, has said he would not pardon the convict.

Final statement of economic summit in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   Here is the text of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
statement, released at the conclusion of the leaders' two-day
summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   ``We, the economic leaders of APEC, meeting in Kuala Lumpur Nov.
18, 1998, renew our resolve toward creating a prosperous
Asia-Pacific community where economic disparities among our peoples
will be bridged by strengthening the foundations for our economies
for growth, providing the environment necessary for the efficient
flow of trade, investment and technology and by enhancing the
capacities of our economies to participate and benefit fully from
liberalization.
	   2. Our meeting in Kuala Lumpur takes place at a critical time.
We need to deal urgently with the financial crisis which has spread
beyond the APEC region. It has resulted in far reaching social
costs, with the affected economies experiencing rising unemployment
and falling real incomes, setting back decades of progress achieved
in eliminating poverty and increasing education opportunities, as
well as access to basic health and infrastructure facilities. We
are resolved to work together to support an early and sustained
recovery in the region, to contain the risks of contagion and
prevent the possibility of a global recession.
	   3. We reaffirm our confidence in the strong economic
fundamentals and prospects for recovery for the economies of the
Asia-Pacific. We believe our emphasis on prudent, growth-oriented
macroeconomics policies, strengthened financial institutions and
markets, trade and investment liberalization, and capacity building
are cornerstones for renewed and sustainable growth. In particular,
our emphasis on ``capacity building'' across the broad range of
APEC activities this year is particularly relevant in addressing
the challenges confronting the region during this time. APEC's
emphasis on human resources development, including skills
development, technological upgrading, infrastructure improvements
and wider outreach to SMEs (small and medium-size enterprises) will
strengthen our resilience and capability in overcoming these
challenges and restoring stability and confidence to the region.

Japan backs IMF bailout for Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will back a planned International Monetary
Fund bailout for Pakistan, which had been stalled to protest
Pakistan's nuclear tests in May, the Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told visiting Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz of Tokyo's decision on the planned dlrs 5
billion IMF bailout package when they met Wednesday, but he said
Japan will continue to withhold its own assistance to Pakistan, a
ministry official said.
	   Aziz, who arrived Tuesday for a four-day visit, told Komura that
Pakistan will sign the treaty banning nuclear tests by next
September.
	   Komura said Japan would consider resuming aid if Pakistan makes
good on its promise, the official said, speaking on the customary
condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear when a decision on the IMF funding to Pakistan
would be made.
	   Washington has decided to lift most of the sanctions that were
imposed against Pakistan and India for the tests, and also will
back the IMF bailout.
	   India, which is not seeking IMF funds, has refused to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It says the treaty allows declared
nuclear powers to build and test nuclear weapons while denying the
opportunity to other nations that want to do so.
	   Japan, the only nation ever to suffer nuclear attack, was
outraged when India and Pakistan carried out nuclear tests earlier
this year.

Giant natural gas company may be facing a loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The giant Gazprom natural gas company expects bad
financial results for the rest of the year because of poor market
conditions and may be facing a loss, Chairman Rem Vyakhirev said
Wednesday.
	   A sharp drop in world oil prices and poor domestic conditions
had hit the company, he said.
	   ``We will have bad results,'' Vyakhirev said. ``I think we will
even make a loss.''
	   Vyakhirev said payments for gas deliveries dropped dramatically
when Russia's latest financial crisis broke out in August after the
government defaulted on its treasury debt. In September, the
virtual collapse of the banking system brought all payments to a
halt.
	   ``In August, (payments) were very bad, and in September almost
no payments were made,'' Vyakhirev said.
	   He said the situation was now improving and payments rising.
	   In October, the central bank made some progress in restarting
the banking system and the weakening of the ruble slowed.

<TEXT>
	   4. Since we meet in Vancouver in November last year, the outlook
for the global economy has weakened considerably. The regional
financial crisis has had economic and social aftershocks more
severe than earlier anticipated and similar problems have appeared
in other parts of the world.
	   Nevertheless, there have been several encouraging developments
in our economies and in the international financial system in
recent months. The progress made by Indonesia, (South) Korea, the
Philippines and Thailand in the implementation of strong reform
programs, backed by an unprecedented degree of financial
cooperation and support from the international community, has
resulted in a substantial degree of finance stability, thereby
laying the foundation for recovery in the APEC economies most
directly affected by the crisis. In these economies:
	   _Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, and have
strengthened in many of these economies over the past several
months. This has permitted substantial reductions in nominal
interest rates to levels which, in some cases, are below those
prevailing before the crisis.
	   _Fiscal policies have been adjusted with support from the IFIs
(international financial institutions) to allow increased spending
to support demand and employment.
	   _The initial acceleration in inflation that accompanied
devaluation has been contained to moderate levels in most emerging
Asian economies, and the rate of inflation is now decelerating
across the region.
	   _Short-term external debt burdens have been reduced and reserves
have begun to be replenished in many economies.
	   _Current account balances have moved into surplus, although most
of the adjustments have come from reduced imports.
	   _Output declines have been more extensive than many had
anticipated, but are now moderating.
	   _Several other economies including Indonesia, (South) Korea and
Thailand, have made impressive efforts to strengthen and
restructure their respective corporate and financial sectors.
	   5. In China, interest rates have been eased and an expansionary
fiscal package is being implemented to further stimulate economic
growth. Maintenance of the renmimbi (yuan) exchange rate has
provided an important anchor to help secure regional financial
stability.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials geared up
Wednesday to relaunch long-suspended talks about a final peace
treaty, even as snags threatened the implementation of an interim
accord signed just last month.
	   Wednesday's meeting was an indication that the peace process was
moving once again after a series of disputes.
	   But those disputes did not stop: The latest arose over the first
group of Palestinian prisoners that Israel was to release.
Palestinians complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were
ordinary criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps under
last month's Wye accord. A go-ahead from the Cabinet will set in
motion an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank,
probably on Friday.
	   By a wide margin, Israel's 120-member Knesset endorsed the
accord Tuesday, negotiated in a marathon summit at Wye Plantation
in the U.S. state of Maryland and signed at the White House Oct.
23. The dovish opposition Labor Party provided the margin of
approval in the 75 to 19 vote with nine abstentions.
	   Most of the ``no'' votes came from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's own coalition. Five members of his Cabinet voted
against the accord and others were absent.
	   Right-wingers charged that the troop withdrawal endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. They also complained that the government
did not present detailed maps of areas to be handed over to the
Palestinians.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet at the Foreign
Ministry in Jerusalem later Wednesday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, to discuss a permanent peace
treaty between the two sides.
	   It will be the first official meeting about a final status
agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996. Abbas told
the Voice of Palestine radio that his meeting with Sharon will
focus on the agenda for full-scale talks on a permanent settlement,
which he expected to begin in a week to 10 days.
	   The interim framework, including the Wye accord, is set to
expire on May 4, 1999.
	   ``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements,'' Abbas said.
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to armed conflict by Arafat, led to
a mini-crisis Monday. Netanyahu suspended Israel's withdrawal until
Arafat retracted the statement.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment
to negotiations as the only way to settle disputes with Israel. The
Israelis accepted this as a retraction and lifted their suspension
threat.
	   According to the Wye agreement, the first Israeli pullback
involves giving the Palestinians civilian rule over two percent of
West Bank land now under full Israeli control. Also, an area
amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank is to be transferred from
joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full Palestinian rule.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the biggest anti-government turnout
since deadly clashes with the military last week, about 4,000
student protesters marched through the capital's streets and laid
flowers outside the gates of the heavily guarded Parliament
Wednesday.
	   Two peaceful protests were held in downtown Jakarta after
legislators inside started work on enacting political reforms that
the students view as falling short of true democratic reform.
	   Meanwhile, police with sticks beat student activists who forced
their way into the governor's office in Surabaya, Indonesia's
second-largest city. Radio reports said several students were
injured.
	   Hundreds of protesters demanding democratic reform also tore
down the gates of the local Parliament in Surabaya.
	   In Jakarta, rush-hour traffic was brought to a standstill when
about 2,500 students marched peacefully past hotels and office
buildings. They were blocked by about 100 army anti-riot officers
from proceeding to the National Monument near the presidential
palace.
	   To avoid a confrontation, the group headed toward Atama Jaya
University, where soldiers and police had opened fire on protesters
last Friday.
	   A separate group of about 1,500 demonstrators, riding in and
atop 15 buses, was blocked by soldiers. They were later allowed to
gather outside the Parliament building under a military escort.
	   Earlier, in a speech that opened a new session of the
legislature, Speaker Harmoko warned that any delay to the reform
process could ``trigger new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast
Asian nation, already beset by political and economic turmoil.
	   He said parliamentary elections in May or early June 1999 would
be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct, open to
all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired plastic bullets at protesters who tried to
march on Parliament. Other people, including some police, died when
rioting broke out in parts of Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   City authorities said 123 buildings and 97 cars were damaged or
set afire, the newspaper The Jakarta Post reported.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto took out advertisements in
several national newspapers expressing his ``sincere condolences''
for last week's deaths.
	   Opposition and students have demanded that Wiranto resign as
armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of the
shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.
	   Friday's was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people
in May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   ``For those who died outside the Parliament we deliver our
condolences and hope that the deaths will prove to be meaningful in
the long term,'' Harmoko said.
	   Police have questioned more than a dozen opposition figures,
including two retired generals, in a sedition inquiry.
	   Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has alleged that the student protests were orchestrated by
conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted police as saying those questioned were
suspected of subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of
lifetime imprisonment.
	   Five were summoned to police headquarters Wednesday. The roundup
is the first major crackdown on dissidents since Habibie took
office.
	   ``The accusations are a mere fabrication,'' said Lt. Gen. Kemal
Idris, a retired army general, before he entered the National
Police headquarters.
	   Last week's bloodshed erupted after tens of thousands of
students tried to march on the green-domed legislature where the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly approved a range of
political reforms sponsored by Habibie.
	   These reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly but is now sitting in its own
right.
	   Although the reforms call for new elections and go some way in
dismantling Suharto's authoritarian legacy, the students and other
critics say that they don't go far enough.

UNDATED: financial stability.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   6. In recent weeks, these developments have been reinforced by:
	   _the reduction of short-term interest rates in a number of
industrialized economies.
	   _Japan's commitment of substantial public resources to
strengthen its financial system. The authorities have made clear
their intention that the essential swift and effective action in
the banking sector, including the recapitalization of banks, with
appropriate conditions, will be taken as a matter of urgency. This
action, together with a sustained boost to domestic demand is key
to the restoration of market confidence and growth not just in
Japan but in the whole Asian region.
	   _The progress made toward providing additional resources to the
IMF.
	   _The G-7's (Group of Seven's) agreement to support the
establishment of a new IMF (International Monetary Fund) facility
to deal with contagion by providing a precautionary line of credit
for economies with sound policies supported by the IMF.
	   7. But important challenges remain. To meet these challenges, we
are committed to pursuing a cooperative growth strategy with the
following dimensions:
	   _Growth-oriented, prudent macroeconomic policies, appropriate to
the specific requirements of each of our economies.
	   _Expanded financial assistance from the international community
to generate employment and to build and strengthen social safety
nets to protect the poor and vulnerable.
	   _A comprehensive program of support for efforts to strengthen
financial systems, restore trade finance, and accelerate corporate
sector restructuring.
	   _New approaches to catalyze the return of stable and sustainable
private capital flows into within APEC.
	   _Looking toward the long-term, urgent work among ourselves and
with other economies and institutions to develop and implement
measures to strengthen the international financial system.
	   In this context, we welcome Japan's proposed financial package
of dlrs 30 billion to support economic recovery efforts in Asia. We
also welcome the multilateral initiative to revitalize private
sector growth announced this week by Japan and the U.S. in
conjunction with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. We
believe these initiatives will significantly aid our joint efforts
to promote recovery and growth in the region and we look forward to
their early implementation.

Report: Floods force thousands of Malaysians to evacuate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 5,000 Malaysians sought
refuge in mosques, churches and community halls after floods
threatened to engulf their homes, local news reports said
Wednesday.
	   Nearly 2,000 residents in the Baling district of northern Kedah
state have been evacuated from their homes since heavy rains began
Sunday, the New Straits Times said.
	   Koh Tsu Koon, chief minister of Penang state, warned people
living in low-lying areas that the situation will worsen as
meteorologists predict more rain that could result in rivers
spilling over their banks Thursday.
	   ``Relief centers have been set up at mosques, community halls,
churches and temples to accommodate the victims,' Koh said.
	   No deaths or injuries have been reported.
	   This year's monsoon season has brought heavier than usual rains
in many parts of Malaysia due to La Nina, a weather pattern related
to the El Nino phenomenon that earlier brought unusually hot or
cold conditions to Pacific Rim nations.

Red Cross given security role for Zapatista meeting with mediators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The international Red Cross said Wednesday it has
been asked to set up a security perimeter around a meeting this
week between Zapatista rebels and congressional mediators in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas.
	   It also has been asked to transport rebel representatives to the
talks planned for Friday and Sunday in San Cristobal de las Casas,
the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.
	   The operation will start Thursday with Zapatista representatives
being transferred from the villages of Oventic, La Garrucha and La
Realidad, it added.
	   The congressional committee, known as Cocopa, had planned to
meet the rebels earlier this month in the jungle hamlet of La
Realidad.
	   But the Zapatistas called that meeting off, saying they couldn't
attend because of heightened military patrols near the planned
meeting site.
	   The Zapatista rebels rose briefly in arms in 1994, demanding
democracy and better conditions for the impoverished indigenous
population of Chiapas.
	   Peace talks between the government and the rebels have been
stalled since 1996, when President Ernesto Zedillo's administration
refused to honor a partial peace accord signed by government
representatives.
	   This week's operation will involve 11 ICRC delegates and some
100 Mexican Red Cross volunteers, who will help with the security
cordon, the ICRC said.
	   After the 1994 rebellion, the ICRC supported medical care
efforts and also served as escort for Zapatista delegates attending
peace talks with the government.
	   Some Mexican officials were uncomfortable with the ICRC role,
arguing that the conflict was a Mexican affair that should not
involve international agencies. Its activity tailed off sharply
after mid-1995.
	   In May, the ICRC reached a new agreement with the Mexican
government allowing it to resume humanitarian activities in
Chiapas.

UNDATED: early implementation.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   8. Each APEC economy has a role to play in accelerating recovery
in the region by directing policies with the objective of
maintaining or achieving robust growth, contributing to a
supportive external environment, and keeping markets open.
	   _The major industrialized economies need to create or sustain
conditions for strong domestic demand-led growth.
	   _For the APEC economies most directly affected by the crisis, it
is important to continue and accelerate structural reforms within a
framework of prudent, growth-oriented macroeconomic policies.
	   _Other economies in the region where growth may be moderate or
slowing also need to continue efforts to implement appropriately
stimulative macroeconomic policies which maintain financial
stability and sound levels of domestic savings, while also working
to address financial sector reforms in ways that build investor
confidence.
	   International Support for Employment and Social Safety Nets
	   9. We note that the financial crisis has resulted in far-
reaching social costs. In addition to rising unemployment and
falling real incomes, the financial crisis could lead to a
substantial increase in poverty in the most seriously affected
economies.
	   We therefore endorse the greater flexibility of International
Monetary Fund programs and welcome efforts by the World Bank to
triple and the Asian Development Bank to double their social sector
lending.
	   Financial and Corporate Sector Restructuring
	   10. Revitalizing the private sector by helping to recapitalize
financial institutions, addressing companies' heavy debt burdens
and restoring their access to trade and working capital financing
are critical to achieving renewed economic growth in the economies
most severely affected by the crisis.
	   In this regard, we will encourage financial and corporate sector
restructuring through mechanisms to:
	   _Mobilize additional assistance to support implementation of
accelerated financial and corporate sector restructuring, including
through use of multilateral development bank guarantees and other
innovative mechanisms.
	   _Increase the availability of working capital and trade finance,
including through cooperative efforts between export credit and
insurance agencies and between such bilateral institutions and the
multilateral development banks.
	   _Such efforts to mobilize significant private sector equity
capital and investment to help distressed companies and financial
institutions in the APEC region successfully restructure both their
finances and their operations.
	   _Review and, in line with the respective circumstances, remove
regulatory and legal impediments to the ability of private
financial institutions to participate constructively in the
restructuring of the debt of private sector borrowers, while
encouraging export credit and insurance agencies to play a more
catalytic role in encouraging such restructuring.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen guarantees safety of politicians

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen has
guaranteed the safety and political freedom of all politicians,
trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they will be arrested
or killed if they return to the country.
	   The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a
vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take
refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest after Hun
Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life.
	   Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have
been holed up overseas for two months. But a deal reached between
Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on forming a
new government last week has opened the door for their return.
	   In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father and
Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television
Tuesday, Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to
Ranariddh applied to all politicians.
	   His assurances come a week before the first session of
Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly.
	   Sam Rainsy said Wednesday that he was unsatisfied with the
guarantee. He said it contained indirect language and loopholes
that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy Party members are still under
threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling party.
	   ``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be
arrested,''' the opposition leader said in a statement. ``But
instead they make roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can
easily be exploited by a legal system that is completely in their
control.''
	   Ranariddh told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe
for Sam Rainsy in Cambodia.
	   Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, the
prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the
apportioning of ministries in the new coalition government.
	   Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen
as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the
National Assembly. The deal assures the two-thirds vote in
parliament needed to approve a new government.
	   The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew
Ranariddh in a coup last year.
	   ``I think Hun Sen has got everything. He's got the premiership
and legitimacy through the election and recognition from his
majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for Hun Sen to
cause instability for our country,'' Ranariddh said.
	   The prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would
not be given back his previous position as the second-ranking
general in the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's
outnumbered forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful
resistance to last year's coup.

U.S. skipper sees silver lining in aborted attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAH101-3
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS EISENHOWER (AP) _ Even though the United States
aborted a colossal attack on Iraq, Navy forces in the Gulf gained
``a tremendous amount'' of experience by executing the elaborate
assault plan up to the eleventh hour, a senior Navy officer said.
	   ``Everything was absolutely perfect. And next time it will be
even more perfect,'' Capt. Denby Starling, the skipper of this
aircraft carrier, told visiting journalists Tuesday.
	   USS Eisenhower, carrying 4.1 million tons of ordnance, 10 F-14s
and 36 F/A-18 strike fighters, was to have been the main punch of
the planned Nov. 14 attack. The assault would have involved waves
of air raids and a barrage of cruise missile strikes from support
ships in the carrier's armada now patrolling the Gulf.
	   ``We gained a tremendous amount,'' Starling said, speaking from
the bridge high above the black flight deck of his 18-deck boat,
which is the length of the Empire State Building.
	   ``We had an opportunity to do what we wouldn't routinely do. It
is one thing to ... put (the crew) in a simulated environment. It
is entirely different when you think it is the real thing,''
Starling said.
	   Eisenhower's armada showcases some of the most best U.S. strike
capability that would have been unleashed had Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein not backed down from its Oct. 31 decision to
completely suspend U.N. weapons inspections. The inspectors resumed
their work Wednesday.
	   Iraq says it bowed to the diplomatic efforts of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
	   Not many on the Eisenhower are convinced.
	   ``Diplomacy? Yes, it was 95,000 tons of diplomacy that convinced
Saddam,'' said Eisenhower spokesman Ernest Duplessis, referring to
the amount of water that this nuclear-powered ship displaces.
	   Many sailors interviewed on the ship said Iraq will likely break
its pledge. Hopefully not soon, they add. Eisenhower is scheduled
to return to its home in Norfolk, Virginia on Dec. 10 provided
there is no emergency in the Gulf.
	   Lisa Tobin, a 31-year-old native of Washington D.C., said she
was a little disappointed when the strike was called off at the
last moment.
	   But now she is ``just anxious to get home for Christmas,'' said
Tobin, who maintains small arms and a fire fighting system in the
weapons magazine.
	   But even as the U.S. military rolls down its sleeve, the muscle
that was only brandished remains evident in the daily routines on
the ship.
	   Just below the flight deck is Command Chaplain Sheila
Robertson's office where conversations take place in between the
thundering take off and landings.
	   Planes are catapulted on the 319-foot (96-meter) runway with
steel slings that send the aircraft from 0 to 180 mph (290kmph) in
three seconds. They touch down on a narrow square, and cords strung
across the deck arrest the plane to bring them to a halt almost
instantly.
	   ``I would like to know who built the chaplain's office here,''
Robertson said good humoredly, adding: ``It would be nice to get
back home. There will actually be a Christmas.''

Fighting kills 13 in northern Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil Tiger rebels and government
troops broke a lull in their fighting in northern Sri Lanka with
clashes that left at least 13 people dead, the military said
Wednesday.
	   Six guerrillas were killed and 36 wounded Tuesday when
government troops attacked a rebel bunker line near Paranthan town
in Kilinochchi district, said Maj. Kumar Dewage, a military
spokesman.
	   There were no military casualties in that clash 275 kilometers
(170 miles) north of the capital, Colombo, the spokesman said.
	   Two more rebels were killed in a clash with a military patrol
near the town of Mankulam, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south.
	   In nearby Mannar district, four rebels and a soldier were killed
when troops ambushed guerrillas in the jungle, said Dewage.
	   Fighting has trailed off since the last major battle on Sept.
27, when the rebels overran northern Kilinochchi town, killing
nearly a thousand soldiers. Both sides have been recruiting more
fighters since then.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils, who claim they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who dominate the government and military. More than
56,000 people have been killed since fighting began in 1983.

LG sells carbon black business to Germany's Degussa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LG Chemical Ltd. said Wednesday it has
signed a deal to sell its two carbon black plants in South Korea to
Degussa AG of Germany for dlrs 170 million.
	   Carbon black is used in the manufacture of tires, ink and paint.
LG's two plants produced 213,000 tons of the material last year,
making a profit of dlrs 7.1 million on sales of dlrs 85.2 million.
	   LG said the sale is part of its efforts to concentrate on core
products such as polycarbonate, a plastic material used in compact
discs, mobile phones and car interiors, and photoresist, which is
used in semiconductors.
	   Degussa AG is the world's second largest carbon black
manufacturer.
	   LG Chemical, a unit of South Korean conglomerate LG, is the
country's largest chemical company, with dlrs 4 billion in 1997
sales.

Report:Turkish ambassador repeats warning over missile sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Turkish ambassador repeated warnings Wednesday
that his country will take retaliatory measures if Russian
anti-aircraft missiles are delivered to Cyprus. But he said the
measures would not be aimed at Russia.
	   Russia is selling S-300 missiles to the Cypriot government which
controls the ethnic Greek side of the divided island nation.
	   Turkey, which supports the ethnic Turkish side of the island, is
angered by the deal and has threatened to use force to prevent the
deployment of the weapons.
	   In an interview carried Wednesday by the Interfax news agency,
Ambassador Nabi Sensoy said any possible retaliation would be
directed at the missiles.
	   ``If we respond, it will focus on the arms in the Greek section.
Therefore, Russia and Turkey would not clash on this issue,'' he
was quoted as saying.
	   ``We will not interfere in Russia's matters although the sale of
the weapons runs counter to our interests and poses a threat,'' he
added.
	   But he said Turkey could not ignore the fact that ``the systems
which could be used in an offensive against it will be controlled
and inspected by Russian experts.''
	   ``The three parties (Moscow, Nicosia and Athens) involved will
have to contemplate the consequences of this sale,'' he added.
	   Turkey claims the deployment of the missiles is a menace both to
Turkish Cypriots and to Turkey itself, and has threatened
pre-emptive strikes against them.
	   The S-300 is similar to the U.S. Patriot missile, which was used
against Iraqi missiles during the Gulf War.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish communities since
1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup by
ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.

UNDATED: such restructuring.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   In order for the region to fully recover from the crisis, we
must be able to attract growth-enhancing, stable capital flows into
the region. The increased risk aversion by investors as well as by
major private financial institutions has led to a sharp reduction
in the flow of capital into East Asian and other emerging market
economies without respect to the diversity of prospects among the
economies and their long-term growth potential.
	   In response to this challenge, we support efforts by the
multilateral development banks to use innovative financial
instruments to help catalyze and leverage private sector capital
flows.
	   In light of the concerns expressed about the role of the recent
performance of the international credit rating agencies, we call
for a review of their practices to promote greater effectiveness
and to contribute to sustainable capital flows.
	   In particular, we also need to strengthen the preparedness of
our own domestic financial systems to withstand the potentially
destabilizing impact of short-term flows and to ensure the
allocation of long-term capital to productive uses.
	   Strengthening the International Financial Architecture
	   12. While our immediate priority must be to mitigate the adverse
social impacts of the crisis and to restore financial stability and
economic growth, we must strengthen the international financial
architecture so as to better prevent future financial instability
and to resolve crisis more effectively when they occur.
	   We agree that now is the time to effect changes aimed at
strengthening the international financial system, so as to capture
the full benefits of international capital flows and global
markets, while minimizing the risk of destructive disruptions.
	   We fully agree that strengthened global arrangements are
important to enable us to benefit from increased globalization
while avoiding the difficulties many of our members are currently
facing.
	   In particular, we welcome and support the establishment of the
new IMF facility for a precautionary line of credit for economies
with sound policies supported by the IMF that are threatened by
contagion.
	   The close collaboration and participation of the industrialized
economies and the emerging market economies is vital to the success
of these efforts to strengthen the international financial system.
	   APEC has already played a major role in this regard notably in
promoting improvements in the international community's ability to
respond to crises, through instruments such as the IMF's
Supplemental Reserve Facility.
	   We pledge to continue such collaboration.
	   Challenges to Trade and Investment Liberalization and
Facilitation
	   13. The expansion of trade and investment remain essential
elements of our economic recovery and we reiterate the need for
liberal and open markets and an enabling environment for
investment.
	   We consider it particularly important that in the current
circumstances, early progress be made on broad-based multilateral
negotiations in the World Trade Organization, achieving an overall
balance of interests of all members.
	   We reaffirm our commitment to uphold and strengthen the
multilateral trading term to ensure fair rules and benefits for
all.
	   We urge the prompt accession to the WTO of applicants in
accordance with WTO rules, with a view towards achieving the
universality of WTO membership.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Romanian president, Emil
Constantinescu, arrived in Sarajevo Wednesday, on his first
official visit to Bosnia since the two Balkan countries established
diplomatic relations last year.
	   In the Bosnian capital, Constantinescu met the three-member
Bosnian joint presidency and was scheduled to visit commanders of
the NATO-led peace force stationed in the country.
	   Following a 1992-95 war, Bosnia was divided into the
Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic. A strong
international presence has helped return the country to stability.
	   Later Wednesday, Constantinescu is to travel to central Bosnian
town of Zenica to visit Romanian soldiers serving in the peace
force.

Downer says no to new inquiry into Dili massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on
Wednesday ruled out a new Australian inquiry into the 1991 killing
of pro-independence protesters in East Timor, but stopped short of
accusing his predecessor Gareth Evans of a cover-up.
	   Indonesia has admitted 50 people died when its troops opened
fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Santa Cruz cemetery in the
East Timorese capital of Dili in November 1991.
	   But Mario Carrascalao, the Indonesian governor of East Timor at
the time, said Wednesday about 200 demonstrators died, many of them
murdered in follow-up killings by Indonesian troops.
	   The claim has prompted new allegations that Evans, Australia's
foreign minister at the time, was informed of the later killings,
despite public denials.
	   Carrascalao said a witness named Carlos told him at least 100
people were buried in a mass grave at a rubbish dump near Dili. He
said many others wounded were later killed by Indonesian troops.
	   ``On the same day of the killings of Santa Cruz, my wife and
Bishop Belo went together to Santa Cruz,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio Wednesday.
	   ``My wife counted 18 very heavily wounded and when she visited
the hospital ... she could not even see one of those.''
	   Carrascalao said he believed many of those wounded had been
later killed by Indonesian troops and thrown in a river.
	   He said he had not informed the Australian ambassador at the
time, Philip Flood, of the additional killings.
	   Downer said it was likely there were follow-up killings in Dili.
	   ``I think there's strong evidence people were killed over and
above those who were killed at Dili,'' Downer said Wednesday.
	   ``But whether, as you put it rather emotively, it was a
massacre, as distinct from people being killed in a more ad hoc
way, I think that's very hard to judge.''
	   Downer made clear he would not be ordering any new investigation
into the incident.
	   ``This was in 1991. It's not possible for us to do more than to
once more review the files,'' Downer said.
	   ``I don't think, really, in 1998, there's a great deal as the
foreign minister I can do. I think it's a matter you should raise
with Gareth Evans because he was the minister at the time.''
	   Downer said he did not believe Evans would have covered up a
second massacre.
	   ``I don't think I could ever claim that Gareth Evans would have
deliberately gone out and covered up material,'' Downer said.
	   Evans was in Kuala Lumpur for a conference of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, and was not available to comment on the
allegations Wednesday. He was to return to Australia Thursday.

	   Challenges to Economic and Technical Cooperation
	   14. Given APEC's diversity and differing levels of development,
globalization and liberalization must be complemented by
initiatives that build confidence and increase capacity to benefit
fully from these processes in order to narrow the disparities in
income and wealth. Such initiatives will not only strengthen
systemic capacities but will also support APEC's liberalization and
facilitation efforts. The challenge will be to continue to achieve
a balance in all three pillars of APEC cooperation to ensure
sustained economic growth and development. Economic and technical
cooperation has acquired added urgency in the wake of the financial
crisis.
	   Key Achievements in 1998
	   15. We in APEC have continually given emphasis to result and
outcome-oriented individual and cooperative efforts through the
APEC approach. As we move into the third year of implementation
after Subic (the Philippines), and Vancouver, (Canada), we note the
substantial achievements made in advancing APEC cooperation in our
trade and investment liberalization and facilitation agenda as well
as progress in capacity building efforts on economic and technical
cooperation.
	   16. We have reflected on the progress and the results achieved
throughout the year as reported to us by our ministers and we
express satisfaction in fulfilling the tasks we set for ourselves
when we last met in Vancouver. We welcome the outcomes of the
various sectoral ministerial meetings held throughout the year and
direct APEC fora to follow up on the recommendations.
	   17. Toward realizing the goal of free trade and investment in
the region in accordance with the principles of the Osaka Action
Agenda, we pledge to continue improvements and implementation of
our individual action plans.
	   18. We commend the work of our ministers to facilitate the flow
of goods, resources, capital and technology among our economies. We
will improve the facilitation process to promote efficiency and
cost reduction through strengthening members' capacities including
adopting policies to harness the potential of new technologies.
	   19. We welcome the progress achieved on the EVSL (Early
Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization) package of nine sectors. We
instruct ministers of participating economies to implement the
agreement reached on these sectors and further advance work on the
remaining six sectors demonstrating our commitment to the
liberalization process amidst the financial crisis in the region.
	   20. We affirm that progressing all three pillars of cooperation
in APEC will strengthen the foundations for further growth. We
commend progress in the priority areas of human resources
development and harnessing technologies of the future. We note the
improvements in the management of the economic and technical
co-operation process including the work underway in infrastructure
and sustainable development. We instruct ministers to give further
focus to strengthen coordination in Ecotech (economic and technical
cooperation) activities and intensify work in the priority areas.
We believe the contribution of the business/private sector in
Ecotech activities will enhance and strengthen our efforts to
advance the economic and technical cooperation agenda and welcome
ABAC's (APEC Business Advisory Council's) commitment in this area
through the Partnership for Equitable Growth.

U.S. skipper sees silver lining in aborted attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAH101-3
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS EISENHOWER (AP) _ Even though the United States
aborted a colossal attack on Iraq, Navy forces in the Gulf gained
``a tremendous amount'' of experience by executing the elaborate
assault plan up to the eleventh hour, a senior Navy officer said.
	   ``Everything was absolutely perfect. And next time it will be
even more perfect,'' Capt. Denby Starling, the skipper of this
aircraft carrier in the Gulf, told visiting journalists Tuesday.
	   USS Eisenhower, carrying 4.1 million tons of ordnance, 10 F-14s
and 36 F/A-18 strike fighters, was to have been the main punch of
the planned Nov. 14 attack. The assault would have involved waves
of air raids and a barrage of cruise missile strikes from support
ships in the carrier's armada now patrolling the Gulf.
	   ``We gained a tremendous amount,'' Starling said, speaking from
the bridge high above the black flight deck of his 18-deck boat,
which is the length of New York City's Empire State Building.
	   ``We had an opportunity to do what we wouldn't routinely do. It
is one thing to ... put (the crew) in a simulated environment. It
is entirely different when you think it is the real thing,''
Starling said.
	   Eisenhower's armada showcases some of the most best U.S. strike
capability that would have been unleashed had Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein not backed down from its Oct. 31 decision to
completely suspend U.N. weapons inspections. The inspectors resumed
their work Wednesday.
	   Iraq says it bowed to the diplomatic efforts of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
	   Not many on the Eisenhower are convinced.
	   ``Diplomacy? Yes, it was 95,000 tons of diplomacy that convinced
Saddam,'' said Eisenhower spokesman Ernest Duplessis, referring to
the amount of water that this nuclear-powered ship displaces.
	   Many sailors interviewed on the ship said Iraq will likely break
its pledge. Hopefully not soon, they add. Eisenhower is scheduled
to return to its home in Norfolk, Virginia on Dec. 10 provided
there is no emergency in the Gulf.
	   Lisa Tobin, a 31-year-old native of Washington D.C., said she
was a little disappointed when the strike was called off at the
last moment.
	   But now she is ``just anxious to get home for Christmas,'' said
Tobin, who maintains small arms and a fire fighting system in the
weapons magazine.
	   But even as the U.S. military rolls down its sleeve, the muscle
that was only brandished remains evident in the daily routines on
the ship.
	   Just below the flight deck is Command Chaplain Sheila
Robertson's office where conversations take place in between the
thundering take off and landings.
	   Planes are catapulted on the 319-foot (96-meter) runway with
steel slings that send the aircraft from 0 to 180 mph (290kmph) in
three seconds. They touch down on a narrow square, and cords strung
across the deck arrest the plane to bring them to a halt almost
instantly.
	   ``I would like to know who built the chaplain's office here,''
Robertson said good humoredly, adding: ``It would be nice to get
back home. There will actually be a Christmas.''

New U.S. trade regulations lead to protests from Hong Kong

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ American efforts to halt the spread of a
tree-infesting beetle will affect some Hong Kong exports, but U.S.
agriculture officials acknowledged Wednesday they don't have all
the rules figured out a month before the deadline.
	   Hong Kong shipping executives attacked the lack of clarity and
complained that their costs will rise when the United States
imposes its ban on products packed in wood that is not certified to
be beetle-free _ just as Hong Kong is struggling through recession.
	   ``All this is not easy to accept,'' said Clement Yeung,
executive director of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council.
	   On Dec. 17, the U.S. government will impose new regulations to
keep the Asian long-horned beetle, believed to have arrived in
wooden packing crates from China, away from U.S.-bound exports.
	   The move has angered China, which calls it trade protectionism
in disguise, and a U.S. official who is in Hong Kong to explain
things got a chilly reception.
	   Isi Siddiqui, deputy undersecretary at the Agriculture
Department, said the U.S. government hasn't decided whether China
and Hong Kong would be treated equally under the beetle ban.
	   ``The rule will apply to Hong Kong in some form,'' Siddiqui told
reporters late Wednesday, adding that U.S. officials would notify
local authorities ``as soon as possible'' of any changes that would
apply specifically to Hong Kong.
	   ``The timing is too short for exporters and shippers to
adjust,'' Yeung told The Associated Press. He said the territory's
exporters do not have a sufficient supply of substitute metal or
plastic packing materials to meet the Dec. 17 deadline.
	   Hong Kong faces two issues: What to do about goods shipped from
mainland China to the United States via Hong Kong, and what to do
about goods bound for the United States that originated in Hong
Kong.
	   Under the new rule, wooden crates and pallets bound for the
United States from China must undergo heat or chemical treatment,
or be fumigated to get rid of any beetles.
	   Shipments packed in wood will need an official certificate
guaranteeing the treatment, while exports without wood packaging
must have documents declaring the contents wood-free.
	   The shiny, bullet-shaped Asian long-horned beetle is believed to
have arrived in wooden packing crates from its native China as long
as seven years ago. This year alone, the pests have eaten through
thousands of trees in New York and Chicago, costing about U.S. dlrs
11 million to cut them down.
	   Without such ``emergency regulations,'' the beetle impervious to
most known pesticides or predators could cause as much as U.S. dlrs
138 billion a year in damage, Siddiqui said.
	   In this year's first nine months, Hong Kong served as a conduit
for Chinese exports to the United States worth 179.1 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 23 billion), according to Hong Kong
government statistics.
	   Only 20 percent of such re-exports use solid wood packing
materials and would be subject to the new rules.
	   Over the same period, Hong Kong's domestic exports to the United
States reached 41.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5
billion), of which only 10 percent is estimated to use the affected
materials.
	   After the deadline, U.S. Customs can fine shipments lacking the
needed certification three times the value of the shipment plus the
cost of treatment. Alternatively, the cargo may simply be refused
entry to the United States and returned.
	   Siddiqui said the United States may postpone significant
penalties for up to 60 days.

	   21. As the APEC community enters its 10th year of cooperation,
we recognize the need to review its activities, structure and
mechanisms in order to ensure that APEC delivers focused and
outcome-oriented results in the most effective and efficient
manner. We observe the proliferation of APEC fora and meetings and
endorse work to further streamline the APEC management process. We
instruct ministers to complete the review of the APEC process by
1999 and for implementation of measures in 2000.
	   22. We recognize that the involvement of the business/private
sector is an important feature of APEC work and endorse its broader
participation in APEC activities. We direct ministers to enhance
business/private involvement, within existing guidelines in
relevant APEC activities. We welcome efforts to improve business
mobility through the APEC Business Travel Card Scheme and the
collective commitment to expand the availability of multiple entry
visas or permits to business travelers. We also welcome the
recommendations by ABAC and instruct our ministers to study ABAC'S
proposals, including the APEC Food System.
	   Strengthening The Foundations For Sustained Growth Into The 21st
Century
	   23. We are firmly resolved to strengthen social safety nets,
financial systems individually and globally, trade and investment
flows, the scientific and technological base, human resources and
development, economic infrastructure, and business and commercial
links so as to provide the base and set the pace for sustained
growth into the 21st century.
	   Strengthening Social Safety Nets
	   24. Given the ramifications of the crisis and the importance of
addressing social vulnerabilities, we agree that as a matter of
high priority, APEC should intensify efforts to address the social
impacts of the crisis. In particular, we direct our ministers to
work with the World Bank, the ADB (Asia Development Bank), the
Inter-American Development Bank and, where appropriate, public and
private institutions to formulate strategies of concrete actions
aimed at strengthening social safety nets. We look forward to
receiving a report at our next meeting.
	   Strengthening Financial Systems Individually and Globally
	   25. We recognize that the development and strengthening of the
financial system is fundamental to the realisation of APEC's goal
of free and open trade and investment by the year 2010/2020.
	   We welcome the work undertaken in several fora to strengthen the
international financial system and in particular take note of the
proposals made to improve transparency and accountability; to
strengthen national financial systems and market infrastructure;
and improve coordination and involvement of the private sector in
the prevention and orderly resolution of international financial
crises. We believe that there would be considerable value in
continuing this work in a process involving both industrialized and
emerging markets economies.
	   We agree that a forum such as an expanded G-22 (Group of 22)
would be appropriate for this purpose. We also call on our finance
ministers to develop, on an expedited basis, measures to implement
these proposals. We ask for a report at our next meeting on the
outcomes of such deliberations within APEC and elsewhere.

	   We attach special urgency to examine the scope for strengthened
prudential regulation of financial institutions in industrialized
economies to promote safe and sustainable capital flows, to
encourage sound analysis and better risk assessment; to examine the
questions of appropriate transparency and disclosure standards for
private sector financial institutions involved in international
capital flows, such as investment banks, hedge funds and other
institutional investors; and to examine the implications of
operations of highly leveraged and off-shore institutions.
	   We call for the early establishment of a task force including
the systemically significant economies to develop practical
proposals in these areas.
	   We also call for work to proceed immediately in an appropriately
constituted international working group on improved crisis
management including orderly debt workout arrangements with the
private sector.
	   These proposals can be discussed in the forum for endorsement at
the leaders' level and subsequent implementation.
	   The financial instability in Asia underscores the importance of
developing strong, resilient, and well-regulated domestic financial
markets within the framework of a stable international financial
system.
	   We therefore call for the adoption by member economies of
internationally recognized principles for enhancing supervision of
banking systems and securities markets.
	   Among these are the Basle Principles on Effective Banking
Supervision and those of the International Organization of
Securities Commissions.
	   In this connection, we welcome work by our finance ministers and
central bank governors to explore ways to assess the adequacy of
and to help reinforce efforts to strengthen financial supervisory
regimes in member economies, including by identifying ways to
record in APEC their progress in adopting international
standards/codes/best practices.
	   We look forward to a report at our next meeting on both these
directives.
	   We also direct our finance ministers to look for innovative ways
to promote the recovery of capital flows into the region, including
through partnerships among member economies, the private sector and
collaborative efforts with the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank and other multilateral institutions.
	   We look forward to concrete results at our next meeting.
	   27. We record our satisfaction with the progress made by our
finance ministers in promoting the Cebu (the Philippines)
collaborative initiatives to develop strong, resilient and stable
financial and capital markets in our region and we look forward to
regular updates on the implementation of these initiatives at the
individual and regional level. We endorse the move by our finance
ministers to address the need for freer and stable capital flows
into the region and in this regard direct our finance ministers to
incorporate the useful lessons of the past 18 months as they
endeavor to develop a pragmatic Voluntary Action Plan as well as
formulate appropriate guidelines for monitoring capital flows,
including short-term flows.
	   28. We commend increased efforts to assist crisis-affected
regional economies develop sufficient capacity to rebuild their
economies and overcome current difficulties. We welcome the
Australian initiative on Economic Governance Capacity Building and
the areas proposed for enhanced capacity building joint activities.
We also welcome the Singapore initiative which will provide
technical assistance programs at the International Monetary
Fund-Singapore Regional Training Institute and in collaboration
with other interested partners and institutions. We encourage
economies to pursue such capacity building initiatives.

Singapore community leaders: workers should not bear brunt of

cost-cutting &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government-dominated union organization defending
proportion of wage-related cuts, grafs 10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore community leaders are questioning why
workers should bear the brunt of upcoming cost-cutting measures and
want the government to do more, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   A government-appointed panel recently recommended significant
wage-related cuts as the principal component in a 10 billion
Singapore dollar (dlrs 6 billion) package reducing business costs
to turn around the ailing economy.
	   The pro-business authorities plan to slash labor costs by about
15 percent, through pay cuts of between 5 and 8 percent and a 50
percent reduction in employers' contributions to the mandatory
state-run pension fund.
	   Under the plan, workers will suffer the most, while the
cash-rich government _ with reserves totaling 125 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 76 billion) _ will bear only about 30 percent of the
total cost-cutting, mainly by lowering rentals, tariffs, levies and
utilities and other mild cutbacks.
	   In closed-door meetings Monday and Tuesday involving grassroots
elders, unionists and corporate leaders, many urged the government
to take on a greater share of the burden in cutting business
expenses.
	   They are ``concerned about how the lower-income groups will be
affected by the (pension) and wage cuts,'' Parliament member Ang
Mong Seng, who chaired one of the meetings, was quoted as saying in
The Straits Times newspaper.
	   Community leaders pressed the government to match the proposed 7
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.3 billion) in wage-related
reductions with deeper cuts in government charges.
	   Participants also suggested a lower goods and services tax,
which stands at 3 percent, and exemption from wage cuts for those
earning 1,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 610) or less a month,
reported The Business Times. Supermarket prices could also be
lowered, they said.
	   ``From my discussions with the grassroots people, the concern is
that wage cuts are going to eat into their take-home pay,''
Parliament member Yaacob Ibrahim was quoted as saying in The New
Paper. ``The feeling is that, `Fine, you can cut my pay but can you
make up for it in other ways?'''
	   But the government-dominated National Trades Union Congress, an
umbrella organization representing the major labor unions in
Singapore, has defended the proportion of wage-related cuts in the
package.
	   In a newsletter editorial, the NTUC argued that since wages
account for much more of total business costs than government
charges, an equitable overall reduction means more emphasis must be
placed on salaries and pensions.
	   Singapore's Parliament will meet Nov. 23-24 to discuss the
proposed measures, though many observers expect the government to
adopt the plan as it stands.

Congo's Kabila visits Angola for talks on military cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila arrived
here Wednesday for talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on
Angola's continued military backing for his efforts to quell a
rebellion at home.
	   A revolt against Kabila's rule by ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of the Congolese army and opposition politicians has sucked
in many of Congo's neighbors, including Angola which has provided
several thousand troops.
	   The Angolan forces played a key role in blocking a rebel
offensive in southwest Congo, near the border, soon after the
conflict erupted in early August.
	   However, the Angolan government is increasingly concerned about
the mounting threat at home from the former rebel group UNITA,
which recently attacked remote villages in contravention of the
country's 1994 peace pact, and unconfirmed reports say Luanda is
considering withdrawing its troops from Congo.
	   Kabila was scheduled to speak to reporters before leaving Luanda
later Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   29. We are agreed on the importance of improving economic
transparency and predictability at the national and international
levels. Therefore, we welcome a new collaborative initiative agreed
by finance ministers at Kananaskis, (Canada), to examine ways of
strengthening corporate governance in the region. We also welcome a
new initiative on the development of domestic bond markets. We
applaud the initiative of the Financiers Group to create private
sector training and education program for financiers across the
APEC region, which we believe, will complement the effort of the
member economies in this area. We direct our finance ministers to
focus efforts on advancing progress on all these initiatives and
look forward to a report on concrete outcomes at our next meeting.
	   Strengthening Trade and Investment Flows
	   30. We welcome further efforts to strengthen trade and
investment flows in the region. These include work on competition
policy and regulatory reforms as well as rapid implementation of
measures to further enhance an environment conducive for trade and
investment flows. In this regard we welcome the adoption of the
menu of options and measures on investment and Korea's initiative
to host an APEC Foreign Direct Investment Mart in Seoul in June
1999.
	   We note that knowledge-based industries and tourism have
considerable potential to contribute to growth and development in
the next century. We recognize the need for efforts to maximize the
contribution of these sectors to the prosperity of APEC economies.
	   Strengthening The Science and Technological Base
	   31. We endorse the 1998 APEC Agenda for Science and Technology
Industry Cooperation into the 21st century which will facilitate
our vision of enhancing APEC's ability to harness technologies for
the future and catalyze the development of strong sustainable
regional science and technology networks and partnership. We take
note of the principles, mechanisms and areas for joint actions set
out therein and instruct ministers to undertake due efforts to
implement the agenda. We welcome the establishment of the China
APEC Science and Technology Industry Cooperation Fund.
	   Strengthening Human Resources Development
	   32. We reiterate our common belief that human resources
development is a key and integral factor to the realization of all
efforts towards a capacity for sustained growth in the economies of
the Asia-Pacific into the 21st century. We have made a commitment
to a framework to advance human resources development across the
entire spectrum of our work plan. We therefore endorse the attached
1998 Kuala Lumpur Action Program on Skills Development in APEC as a
significant inroad into public-business collaborative partnership
in skills development. This program recognizes the value of the
contribution of the business sector and underscores APEC's
continued broadening of its outreach to the business community. We
welcome the initiatives of member economies and further instruct
ministers to undertake concerted efforts towards the implementation
of this Action Program. In this regard, we welcome Singapore's
technical assistance for the training of health care professionals
in the region.
	   We support continued efforts to further the role of women in the
APEC process. To this end, we instruct ministers to develop a
Framework for the Integration of Women in APEC.

'Diana teams' to help care for terminally ill children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paying tribute to the late Princess Diana, the
British government on Wednesday introduced the ``Diana teams'' that
will assist families caring for terminally ill children at home.
	   The care teams, which could include a combination of doctors,
nurses, psychologists and social workers, will be paid for by the
National Health Service, Britain's universal health-care program.
	   ``As well as providing specialist nursing care and practical
help when it is most needed, these Diana teams will bring emotional
support for all the family,'' health minister Baroness Hayman said.
	   Ten teams will be launched initially at a cost of 2 million
pounds (dlrs 3.3 million). They will be tested and evaluated before
other teams are created throughout the country.
	   ``They will be a lasting contribution to the memory of Princess
Diana, whose love of children and concern for the chronically sick
and disabled was so well-known,'' Baroness Hayman said.
	   The idea for the teams was suggested by a memorial committee
formed after the princess' 1997 death in a Paris car crash. The
other main memorials are a garden and a commemorative coin.

Tribunal expects immediate cooperation from Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
officials said Wednesday they expect immediate compliance from
Belgrade with a Security Council resolution calling on Yugoslavia
to cooperate fully with the U.N. court.
	   The council demanded Tuesday that Belgrade arrest three former
Yugoslav National Army officers charged with organizing a massacre
of 200 Croats in 1991 and said it deplored Yugoslavia's recent
refusal to allow investigators to visit the embattled Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   The resolution is ``explicit and unequivocal in what is expected
from the authorities in Belgrade,'' tribunal spokesman Jim Landale
said.
	   It ``should leave them in no doubt that the international
community will hold them to their obligations under international
law. The ball is now in their court and we expect them to take
immediate action.''
	   Yugoslav authorities cite a constitutional ban on extraditing
suspects as a reason for repeatedly refusing to hand over the three
officers despite international warrants for their arrest.
	   But the resolution, passed by a 14-0 vote with China abstaining,
rejected that argument.
	   ``A state may not invoke provisions of its domestic law as
justification for its failure to perform binding obligations under
international law,'' the council said.
	   The resolution, which is legally binding, did not contain the
threat of punitive action if Yugoslavia doesn't comply.
	   The council also repeated its call to Yugoslav authorities and
leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community to cooperate with the
tribunal in the investigation of possible war crimes.
	   Yugoslav authorities have refused to grant investigators visas
to work in Kosovo, claiming the tribunal has no jurisdiction.
	   Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said he was still
hoping to get investigators into the province ``at the earliest
opportunity.''
	   Blewitt also said that he and Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour no
longer planned to head the team.
	   Meanwhile, investigators are interviewing witnesses who have
fled Kosovo, he said. He gave no further details.
	   Hundreds have been killed since February when Serb forces began
a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds of thousands
have been forced from their homes.
	   Ethnic Albanian's, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, favor independence, while Serbs consider Kosovo an
integral part of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.

Report: Violent crime on the increase in Cambodian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The proliferation of illegally owned
firearms in the Cambodian capital has contributed to an increase in
violent crime, according to a municipal report.
	   Violent crimes in Phnom Penh in this year's first nine months
have already surpassed the total for all of 1997, The Cambodia
Daily newspaper reported Wednesday, citing the report.
	   It stated that 297 people have died in crimes so far this year,
compared with 284 deaths last year. Unregistered weapons are held
responsible for 115 of this year's deaths and 130 injuries.
	   The reason for the rise in violent crime, the municipality
concluded, is that ``the use of illegal weapons has increased,
creating insecurity and public disorder.''
	   Cambodia is awash in weapons left over from decades of civil war
and strife. Assault rifles and handguns are a common sight on the
streets of Phnom Penh.
	   Firearms, ammunition and even hand grenades can be cheaply
bought at local markets.
	   Phnom Penh could have as many as 150,000 illegally owned
firearms, The Cambodia Daily reported, citing preliminary figures
from a citywide census of weapons that began this month.
	   The census, which Phnom Penh Deputy Governor Chea Sophara told
the newspaper is 30 percent complete, has already counted 50,000
firearms. Only 216 were registered.
	   The census is part of an anti-crime initiative Chea Sophara
ordered last month. Checkpoints manned by heavily armed police
looking for weapons are a daily occurrence.
	   At the end of the census, city residents will be asked to
surrender all unregistered weapons, the newspaper said. It was
unclear whether stronger measures would be taken against those who
refuse to comply.
	   The municipality so far has collected 185 weapons in a
cash-for-guns program being conducted alongside the census,
according to the report. All weapons collected are to be destroyed.

16,000 evacuated near Berlin due to WWII-era bombs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ State roads were closed, trains
halted and 16,000 people evacuated from their homes near Berlin on
Wednesday while experts worked at defusing two big U.S. bombs from
World War II.
	   The chemical fuses on the bombs _ designed to ignite not on
impact but hours later _ were still live and could go off at any
time, authorities said.
	   One 500 kilo (1,100-pound) bomb was unearthed during
construction on a park, and a 250 kilo (550-pound) bomb was found
during work on a golf course.
	   About half of Oranienburg was evacuated shortly before noon. The
city, just north of Berlin in former East Germany, was a center for
arms production during World War II _ including enriched uranium
for Adolf Hitler's atomic bomb project _ and so a prime target for
Allied bombing raids.
	   More than 60 duds have been found there since a construction
boom started following German unification in 1990. None have
exploded in Oranienburg since 1991, when three people were injured
and 10 houses destroyed.
	   Many residents resent the constant evacuation orders _ a dozen
so far this year alone. In April, 10 residents were fined 1,000
marks (dlrs 625) each for refusing to leave their homes during a
defusing action. Among them was a mother who barricaded herself and
her two young children in their apartment.
	   About 100 kilometers (60 miles) east in Frankfurt an der Oder,
450 people were evacuated from their homes Wednesday while
authorities defused two World War II-era bombs.

Technical glitch silences broadcast of APEC summit declaration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An event meant to showcase
Malaysia's new high-tech metropolis turned into an embarrassment
Wednesday when the sound went out during a live broadcast of the
final ceremony of the Asian economic summit.
	   Viewers of the live television broadcast heard only a hiss as
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad read the declaration at the end of
the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The ceremony was held in Cyberjaya, a new city nestled in a
jungle of palm oil plantations outside the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
The 4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) development, a pet project
of Mahathir, is part of a Multimedia Super Corridor which will be
bound by a fiber-optic network.
	   An engineer for Radio Television Malaysia said the audio link
was working during a test just moments before the ceremony began
but broke down shortly after Mahathir began reading the
declaration.
	   ``It was a failure for us,'' said the RTM engineer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The broadcaster suspects one of the microwave antennas used to
relay the broadcast shifted slightly, cutting off the audio signal.
	   The planned fiber-optic network which will connect the site to
much of Kuala Lumpur is to be completed by 2000.
	   Journalists who planned to cover the event by watching the live
broadcast from a media center away from the site were unable to
hear it.

	   ROME (AP) _ Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan said in
interviews published Wednesday that he came to Italy in hopes of
mustering international pressure on Turkey to seek a peaceful
solution to its 14-year old war with autonomy seeking Kurds.
	   ``We have abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace
accord,'' he told the daily newspaper La Repubblica. ``My presence
here testifies to a change in the strategy of the Kurdish national
movement.''
	   Ocalan, who has asked for political asylum in Italy, was also
interviewed by L'Unita. ``Without international pressure, a
solution won't be found,'' he told the newspaper.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. The
14-year-old conflict with the Turkish army has killed 37,000
people.
	   Since his arrest in Rome last week, Kurds throughout Europe have
been demonstrating and staging hunger strikes to oppose his
extradition to Turkey.
	   More than 4,000 protested Tuesday outside the Interior Ministry
in Bonn, Germany. Smaller but more violent protests were staged in
Moscow, Ankara, Turkey, and the Belgian capital, Brussels. One Kurd
died in Moscow after setting himself on fire.
	   In Rome, estimated 10,000 Kurds marched Tuesday in his behalf
and hundreds are camped out at the military hospital where he was
believed held.
	   In his interview with L'Unita, Ocalan compared his people's
struggle to that of the Irish and Basques, two conflicts where
guerrilla armies have recently opted for more peaceful means.
	   ``We want to be recognized as Kurds through the introduction of
democratic laws,'' Ocalan said.
	   There are 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out in Turkey, Syria,
Iran and Iraq. Turkey refuses to recognize its 12 to 15 million
Kurds as an official minority, which would give them the right to
teach and broadcast in their own language.
	   In 14 years of war, it has refused to negotiate with the PKK and
outlaws all political parties based on ethnic identity. The one
pro-Kurdish party in Turkey faces numerous legal charges.
	   Ocalan's presence is awkward for Italy. Turkey, a NATO ally and
trading partner, and the United States consider him a terrorist and
is pushing Italy to extradite.
	   Thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the Italian
Embassy in Ankara for the past two days urging Ocalan's extradition
and the government on Wednesday offered free faxes to anyone who
wanted to write the Italian government.
	   Extradition is unlikely because Ocalan is on trial in absentia
for capital crimes in Turkey. Italy's courts have consistently
forbidden extraditing suspects to a country where they could be
executed.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema made it clear Tuesday that Italy
will consider granting Ocalan political asylum only if it is
convinced his renunciation of terrorism is sincere
	   ``Our country doesn't intend to be a host for terrorist
activities,'' he said.
	   Political asylum, an option with considerable domestic support,
is also a problem because it could encourage Kurdish refugees to
flock to Italy, which is already having trouble coping with
immigrants _ both legal and illegal.
	   On Wednesday morning, a boat loaded with nearly 200 Kurdish
refugees from Turkey landed in Sicily. Thousands of Kurds fleeing
persecution at home have reached Italy in recent years, but most
headed north to Germany or the Netherlands.
	   Belgium, home to the self-styled Kurdish parliament-in-exile,
has said it doesn't want Ocalan. And Germany, which has large
populations of both Kurds and Turks, says it doesn't want him
either.
	   In Sweden, National Police Chief Lars Nylen was quoted by the
newspaper Dagens Nyheter as saying police hope to question Ocalan
about the 1986 killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme. According to
reports in Turkey, the PKK's second-in-command said after his
capture this year that the rebels were behind the killing, but
later retracted his statement.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A German magazine reporter was ordered Wednesday
to leave China within 48 hours by state security officers who burst
into his office, pinned him against a wall and accused him of
illegally obtaining state secrets.
	   Juergen Kremb of Der Spiegel said a group of officials from the
powerful and secretive Ministry of State Security told him he had
been violating Chinese laws for years, and that he could not come
back to China for five years.
	   ``They stormed in quite roughly and pressed me against the
wall,'' Kremb said.
	   He was the second reporter expelled by Chinese authorities in
two months. In October, a Japanese journalist was expelled after
the government accused him of stealing and buying state secrets.
	   Kremb, 41, speculated that Chinese officials might have been
seeking to punish him for his sometimes critical reporting and for
contacts with dissidents, including former political prisoner Wei
Jingsheng, about whom Kremb published a book last year.
	   ``The Chinese authorities always associated me with the
dissident scene. I reported a lot from it. I also reported a lot
about the secret services and the military. I suppose this was
their final way of saying, `People who report about these things,
which doesn't suit us, we don't want them in our country,''' Kremb
told German radio.
	   Kremb moved to Singapore in July after 8 1/2 years in China and
returned Tuesday to Beijing to report on a jazz festival and
Germany's new embassy building in the capital.
	   China's Foreign Ministry confirmed Wednesday to the embassy that
the security ministry ordered Kremb to leave, but said the decision
should not be allowed to disrupt bilateral relations, an embassy
spokesman said.
	   Although Kremb had transferred out of China, he said his Foreign
Ministry accreditation and his visa had not expired. This was his
fourth return visit. He said he had originally planned to leave
China on Saturday. Kremb's replacement in Beijing was due to arrive
in January.
	   The reporter said that on Tuesday, a group of eight officers in
plainclothes entered the magazine's office and searched it. They
produced documents they said they found in his possession,
presented an arrest warrant, and threatened Kremb with handcuffs,
which they did not use.
	   The officials asked Kremb to sign a ``confession'' that said he
had violated Chinese law, possessed state secrets and refused to
cooperate with authorities. Kremb refused. After four hours in the
office, they told Kremb he must not leave Beijing and then left.
	   The plainclothes officials, including one who wore sunglasses,
produced no identification but said they were from the security
ministry, China's equivalent of the former Soviet Union's KGB,
Kremb said.
	   During both encounters, Kremb was denied requests to call the
German Embassy. The officials also filmed and photographed Kremb
while they read him an expulsion order and during Tuesday's search
and interrogation.
	   It was Kremb's second major confrontation with authorities. In
April 1997, the reporter was detained for two days for visiting the
hometown of then-imprisoned dissident Wei Jingsheng, who has since
been released into exile.
	   The government has strict regulations regarding activities of
foreign journalists, although the rules are enforced arbitrarily.
	   Kremb is the second German reporter to be forced from the
country in recent years. In 1995, the government refused to renew a
visa for Henrik Bork, a reporter for the Frankfurter Rundschau
newspaper, obliging him to leave the country earlier than he had
planned.

<TEXT>
	   33. We reaffirm that strengthening the capacity of our economic
infrastructure is an essential component towards the realization of
our goals of sustainable and equitable growth and development
throughout the APEC community. We commend in particular commitment
given throughout 1998 to further strengthen and develop economic
infrastructure. We welcome the Natural Gas Initiative approved by
the energy ministers at Okinawa, (Japan). We acknowledge the
progress that is ongoing in the implementation of the Vancouver
Framework for Enhanced Public-Private Partnerships in
Infrastructure Development. We welcome progress being made in
advancing the initiative of creating the Asia-Pacific Information
Society and endorse work to further advance the development of the
Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure.
	   We reiterate our commitment to advance sustainable development
across the entire spectrum of our work plan including cleaner
production, protection of the marine environment and sustainable
cities. We endorse the joint actions to be launched in the areas of
food, energy and the environment in relation to the economic and
population growth of the APEC community. We instruct that ministers
undertake efforts to develop the implementation of these joint
actions. We commend the initiative of Ministers in establishing the
APEC Framework for Capacity Building Initiatives on Emergency
Preparedness, which seeks to foster cooperation in longer-term
capacity building in preventive and responsive measures for
unexpected natural emergency disasters.
	   Strengthening Business and Commercial Links
	   34. SMEs (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) are major
stakeholder in APEC comprising over 95 percent of all enterprises,
employing up to 80 percent of the work force and contribute 30
percent to 60 percent of the GNP (Gross National Product) of APEC
economies. We stress the importance of harnessing and increasing
the potential for SMEs to contribute to growth and development in
the region. We commend ministers for producing the Integrated Plan
of Action for SME Development that sets out the blueprint of
strategic directions for both enterprise and entrepreneur
development through individual and collective actions. We instruct
ministers to focus on further developing and strengthening the
dynamism of SMEs and to give priority to the implementation of
joint actions of the SPAN and encourage economies to adopt
individual actions to strengthen the development of SMEs. We look
forward to receiving more concrete outcomes at our next meeting.
	   35. We commend ministers for formulating the APEC Blueprint For
Action On Electronic Commerce containing broad themes and
cooperative activities for the promotion and development of
electronic commerce in the region. We recognize that the Y2K (Year
2000) problem has the potential to cause significant economic,
trade and financial disruption. We agree that all economies need to
enhance awareness and implement necessary measures to resolve this
problem on an accelerated basis.
	   We are confident that APEC, bound together by our commitment to
our goals and our resolve to strengthen the foundations for growth,
will meet the challenges of the 21st century.

Congolese rebels mend rift, prepare for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ In a bid to unify ranks ahead of another
round of peace talks, Congolese rebels said Wednesday they struck a
deal with a rival anti-government fighter who threatened to divide
their forces.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the leader of the main rebel group
trying to oust President Laurent Kabila, said he met in the Ugandan
capital with Jean-Pierre Bemba and they agreed to work together
instead of creating divisions.
	   The 39-year-old Bemba, a businessman and son of a Congolese
tycoon, has claimed independent military successes against
Congolese government troops and their allies from Chad in northern
Congo.
	   He also has accused Wamba's Congolese Democratic Coalition of
creating a vacuum in northern and northeastern Congo by failing to
rally the local population.
	   Wamba said they overcame their differences at a meeting in
Kampala on Tuesday under auspices of Ugandan government. Both
Uganda and Rwanda have sent troops to back the rebels who have
seized control of a quarter of a country since they took up arms
Aug. 2.
	   ``Bemba is a Congolese and he has the right to be involved,''
Wamba told The Associated Press from the eastern Congolese rebel
stronghold at Goma. ``We have agreed to work together and avoid
statements creating an illusion of a division. From now on, there
is no Bemba issue.''
	   Uganda, whose troops control much of northern Congo, has been
accused of training and backing Bemba and his men, apparently in a
bid to win popular support where the rebel movement has failed.
	   But the rebels and their Rwandan allies were worried Kabila
would use the emergence of an obscure rival leader to divide their
forces and avoid talks with rebel representatives.
	   A Rwandan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was little Bemba could contribute to the rebel cause apart
from money. He said the Rwandan government had suggested he join
the main rebel group when he came to seek their advice in Kigali.
	   So far, Kabila has ruled out talking with the rebels, demanding
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for the
insurgents.
	   Wamba said the rebels will attend the so-called proximity talks
in Botswana on Friday. The talks, under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community, are to consider proposals
from African experts on achieving a cease-fire and the withdrawal
of foreign forces, as well as direct talks between the Congolese
combatants.
	   Meanwhile, the Rwandan government on Tuesday summoned foreign
diplomats to protest the forthcoming visit by Kabila to European
capitals, including Brussels, Paris and Rome, Nov. 22-28.
	   Patrick Mazimhaka, a minister in President Pasteur Bizimungu's
office, said Kabila was responsible for massacring Tutsis in
northern and southern Congo; executing his own soldiers accused of
desertion; and supporting former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who
took part in a 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
	   ``Kabila doesn't deserve to be welcomed as a distinguished guest
by the states who value human rights and liberty,'' Mazimhaka said.
	   Diplomats in Kigali said Kabila's visit to Brussels appeared to
be connected with Belgium's concerns over the fate of at least
3,000 Belgium nationals living in their former African colony.
	   In Paris, Kabila will attend the summit of African Francophone
countries Nov. 26. He was scheduled to meet with Pope John Paul II
in the Vatican Nov. 24, Congolese radio reported, quoting Monsignor
Faustino Sainz Munoz.

US trade representative blasts Japan ahead of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi saying Japan's recovery is vital for
region in 13th graf
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ On the eve of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's official visit to Japan, the United States signaled
Wednesday that it remains upset over Tokyo's refusal to lower trade
barriers, calling it an ``unconscionable outcome.''
	   Clinton's visit comes on the heels of a Pacific Rim economic
summit in Kuala Lumpur, where the United States and Japan took
opposite sides in a bitter trade dispute.
	   American officials had hoped to reduce or eliminate tariffs on
dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of trade but failed to forge a pact
covering nine industries because of opposition from Japan to
lowering border taxes on two of them, fish and wood products.
	   Before leaving Malaysia at the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky told reporters that ``Japan refused to exercise
any leadership and that is inexcusable. ... It is an unconscionable
outcome.''
	   Japan was the only APEC member country that sought to protect
two entire sectors from tariff cuts.
	   For that reason, the United States planned to raise the dispute
during Clinton's trip to Tokyo.
	   ``Japan was isolated, and Japan will be called to account,''
Barshefsky told reporters.
	   Clinton leaves Washington early Wednesday on a six-day journey
to Japan, South Korea and Guam. He had planned to begin that trip
in Malaysia at the APEC summit, but had to send U.S. Vice President
Al Gore in his place because of the U.S.-Iraq standoff.
	   Economic policy will also be on the agenda when Clinton meets
with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Obuchi told a group of Asian leaders on
Wednesday that there is no reason to worry about Japan's economy,
even though many forecasters say it's unlikely to grow at all this
year.
	   ``Japan's individual savings are high, and its foreign reserves
are big. I want others not to worry at all,'' Obuchi was quoted as
saying by a Japanese government official.
	   The prime minister sought to reassure the leaders that a 24
trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) package of new spending and tax
cuts, unveiled Monday, would lift Japan out of its deepest
recession since World War II.
	   ``Japan's recovery and aid are vital to Asian economies,''
Obuchi told reporters just before boarding a flight bound for
Tokyo.
	   Japan accounts for more than two-thirds of the region's economic
power.
	   Critics worry the package may not be as effective as the
government hopes. Japan has implemented seven previous stimulus
plans, but the economy has been stagnant for much of the past five
years.
	   Obuchi also sought to assure the leaders that Japan is doing its
part to lead the region out of its economic crisis by reminding
them of his country's pledge to provide dlrs 30 billion in aid to
ailing Asian economies.
	   The prime minister said he will explain these measures to
Clinton later this week.

Azerbaijani journalists on hungers strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Editors and journalists from independent
newspapers were on a hunger strike Wednesday to protest police
beatings of journalists and libel suits against opposition media.
	   Four journalists with the opposition newspaper Yeni Musavat were
injured last Friday when police dispersed a rally by newspaper
employees in central Baku, the capital of the former Soviet
republic on the Caspian Sea.
	   The demonstrators were protesting a suit against Yeni Musavat by
the head of the presidential administration, Ramiz Mekhtiyev, who
said the newspaper had published articles damaging to his
reputation.
	   President Geidar Aliev's brother Dzhalal has sued another
opposition newspaper, Azadlyg, for reporting that he and other
relatives of the president have bought expensive real estate in
Britain.
	   The Interfax news agency reported that damages sought by
officials in these and other suits against the two newspapers
exceed dlrs 500,000 _ a staggering amount in a country where
average salaries rarely exceed the equivalent of dlrs 43 a month.
	   Several journalists have been on hunger strike since last
Thursday to protest the suits, and more senior editors joined the
strike in the Yeni Musavat office on Wednesday, bringing the total
number of protesters to 19.
	   Human rights groups have criticized Aliev for cracking down on
the press, though he eased censorship this summer ahead of
presidential elections.

UN war crimes tribunal expects immediate cooperation from Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Officials at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said Wednesday they expect immediate compliance
from Belgrade with a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on
Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the U.N. court.
	   The council demanded Tuesday that Belgrade arrest three former
Yugoslav National Army officers charged with organizing a massacre
of 200 Croats in 1991 and said it deplored Yugoslavia's recent
refusal to allow investigators to visit the embattled Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   The resolution is ``explicit and unequivocal in what is expected
from the authorities in Belgrade,'' tribunal spokesman Jim Landale
said.
	   It ``should leave them in no doubt that the international
community will hold them to their obligations under international
law. The ball is now in their court and we expect them to take
immediate action.''
	   Yugoslav authorities cite a constitutional ban on extraditing
suspects as a reason for repeatedly refusing to hand over the three
officers despite international warrants for their arrest.
	   But the resolution, passed by a 14-0 vote with China abstaining,
rejected that argument.
	   ``A state may not invoke provisions of its domestic law as
justification for its failure to perform binding obligations under
international law,'' the council said.
	   The resolution, which is legally binding, did not contain the
threat of punitive action if Yugoslavia doesn't comply.
	   The council also repeated its call to Yugoslav authorities and
leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community to cooperate with the
tribunal in the investigation of possible war crimes.
	   Yugoslav authorities have refused to grant investigators visas
to work in Kosovo, claiming the tribunal has no jurisdiction.
	   Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt said he was still
hoping to get investigators into the province ``at the earliest
opportunity.''
	   Blewitt also said that he and Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour no
longer planned to head the team.
	   Meanwhile, investigators are interviewing witnesses who have
fled Kosovo, he said. He gave no further details.
	   Hundreds have been killed since February when Serb forces began
a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds of thousands
have been forced from their homes.
	   Ethnic Albanian's, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, favor independence, while Serbs consider Kosovo an
integral part of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 7th graf with special shirt quickly made for Gore
after Clinton canceled his visit

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a colorful contrast to the
stark economic crisis they were discussing, Pacific Rim leaders
donned bold batik shirts on Wednesday handpicked by Malaysia's
prime minister.
	   ``It's green and bright, like Kuala Lumpur sunshine,'' Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said of his shirt.
	   Tradition has it that leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum wear clothing symbolic of the host country in a
light-hearted show of unity during their annual summits.
	   On Wednesday, several of the 21 leaders pointed to their shirts
as they entered the Malaysian-style Cyberview Lodge, the site of
their informal talks in a high-tech business park 40 kilometers (25
miles) outside Kuala Lumpur.
	   All were bright, with bold geometric or floral designs and
different colors.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, sitting in for President Clinton,
who stayed in Washington to deal with the Iraqi crisis, sported a
dark rose-colored version with a blue, green and white floral
pattern.
	   Gore's shirt was quickly made after Clinton canceled his visit,
officials said.
	   New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, the only woman,
instead wore a lavender ``baju kebaya,'' Malaysia's national dress
consisting of a long blouse over a sarong-like skirt.
	   The leaders waved as they posed in their outfits for the
traditional group photograph that has become synonymous with the
annual APEC summits.
	   Last year in Vancouver they wore matching leather bomber
jackets, and the year before in the Philippines they wore
traditional barong shirts.
	   This year the shirts were handpicked by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and reportedly cost 600 ringgit (dlrs 160) each.
	   Each shirt was tailored according to each leader's measurements
after Mahathir selected his favorites from a local designer.
	   ``The prime minister chose 21 shirts from a selection of about
40 or 50,'' an APEC spokesman told The Star newspaper.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Fed rate cut helps lift most Asian shares

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Blue chips rallied Wednesday on Asia's three
top stock exchanges _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore _ in response
to lower U.S. interest rates and speculation that Japan might do
more to fix its economic troubles.
	   Prices were mixed in smaller markets.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the region's biggest, the key
Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues rose 186.23 points, or 1.29
percent, closing at 14,599.23.
	   The quarter-point decrease in U.S. interest rates helped support
Tokyo prices, but traders were also buying stocks on expectations
that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi might offer further economic
stimulus measures as U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives on
Thursday.
	   ``With Clinton coming here, Obuchi has to look good,'' said
Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought 121.22 yen in late afternoon,
up 0.60 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New
York level of 121.00 yen overnight. While lower interest rates
usually make a nation's currency less attractive, analysts said the
latest U.S. move was seen as helpful for the American economy.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of
blue chips, gained 64.73 points, or 0.6 percent, closing at
10,213.42.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, cut its discount rate early Wednesday, stirring
speculation that commercial Hong Kong banks will cut their own
rates at a meeting Friday. The U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed rates
Tuesday, after Asian exchanges had closed for the day.
	   John Lo, an associate institutional sales director at BNP Prime
Peregrine Securities Ltd., saw two reasons for the Hong Kong rally:
``The rate cut news and the better regional markets.''
	   Shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore also soared, thanks to
the U.S. rate cut as well as an interest rate reduction announced
earlier Tuesday by the Development Bank of Singapore, one of its
top four banks.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index closed up 2.9 percent, or
35.94 points, at 1,271.70.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished lower, with
traders focusing more on a fall by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand
Ltd. than they were on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's plans to
ease monetary policy. The index closed down 11.55 points at
1,975.95.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed broadly lower, with some large
stocks falling hard on a round of negative news. The All Ordinaries
index closed at 2,668.7, down 7.9 points, or 0.29 percent.
	   SEOUL: South Korean shares closed slightly lower on a correction
over recent advances. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
0.69 point to 423.74.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished lower on heavy selling
ahead of the market's trade settlement deadline. The Composite
Index of 100 blue-chip stocks ended at 458.34 points, down 5.78
points, or 1.2 percent.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares ended sharply higher on the back of
the U.S. rate cut. Indonesia's JSX Composite Index ended up 13.768
points, or 3.9 percent, at 369.994.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares ended marginally higher. Shares on the
Stock Exchange of Thailand gained 1.05 points, closing at 345.13.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended higher, with the main index
hitting a four-month high on the back of the U.S. interest rate
cuts. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed up 41.54 points,
or 2.3 percent, at 1,820.77.
	   TAIPEI: Shares finished lower for the first time in four
sessions after giving up early gains. The Weighted Price Index
closed down 31.76 points, or 0.44 percent, at 7,100.14.

Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's economic
crisis after a disappointing summit overshadowed by conflicts about
human rights and free trade. The group's final statement praised
signs of recovery in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. It said
these hard-hit countries should continue adopting painful reforms
recommended by the International Monetary Fund. But the 21-member
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also urged more financial
assistance from the international community, and endorsed a U.S.
proposal to speed emergency loans to the Asian countries at the
center of the crisis. Despite the strong anti-free market views
promoted by this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, the APEC statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation
of foreign exchange trading or new controls on the movement of
capital in and out of countries. (APEC)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton is going to
economically battered Asia with the message that the key to
recovery lies in Japan, which is struggling to emerge from its
worst recession since World War II. The journey will take him from
ornate palaces in Tokyo to military training fields in South Korea.
The final stop will be the Pacific island of Guam where he will
spend several hours before returning to Washington. The trip, which
begins Wednesday, was delayed and then rearranged, dropping a visit
to Malaysia, after the weekend showdown with Iraq. The first stop
is in Tokyo where Clinton is expected to speak frankly about
economic differences with Japan. Clinton's trip comes two days
after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi unveiled a dlrs 196 billion
package of spending and tax cuts to revive Japan's recession-bound
economy. (US-CLINTON-ASIA)
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Most industries and businesses across
Zimbabwe shut down Wednesday as workers heeded calls for the second
in a series of one-day strikes to protest economic policies. In the
capital, Harare, troops guarded bus stations after the government
said it would protect employees wishing to show up for work, but
only a few state-owned buses and private taxi vans were operating.
There were no reports of violence. Unrest over worsening economic
hardships is posing the most serious threat yet to President Robert
Mugabe, who has ruled the former Rhodesia since it gained
independence from Britain and became Zimbabwe in 1980. A gasoline
price increase touched off three days of rioting and demonstrations
earlier this month that claimed one life, and Wednesday's action
was the fourth crippling national strike since December. The
government blames the gasoline price hike on an 80 percent Zimbabwe
currency drop against the U.S. dollar in the past year.
(ZIMBABWE-STRIKE)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government
faces the risk of higher budget deficits after Europe's single
currency kicks in, the government's council of economic advisers
said Wednesday. Failure by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to cut
costly social welfare programs will reverse a trend of falling
deficits pushed through in Germany to help make the euro a stable
currency for its Jan. 1 debut, the group's annual report said.
Germany's budget deficit will be 1.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year, dropping to 1.8 percent in 1999, the report
said. But five-man panel warned that the trend won't hold. A chief
cause was that Schroeder's government, which came to power in
September elections, has failed to make clear how it will keep
Germany's wide social safety net and meet promises for rigor in
government spending, the report said. (GERMANY-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors resumed their
monitoring of suspected arms sites in Iraq on Wednesday, after
Baghdad agreed to resume cooperation with inspectors under the
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes. U.N. vehicles accompanied by
half a dozen Iraqi cars set off from U.N. headquarters in the
eastern outskirts of Baghdad, heading for sites where they will
search for signs of banned weapons programs. At first, the
inspectors are expected to visit declared arms sites where they
have already installed cameras and sensors for long-term
monitoring. The real challenge will come later, when they begin
surprise checks on sites where U.N. arms experts suspect Iraq has
been hiding evidence of banned chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles. (IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials geared up
Wednesday to relaunch long-suspended talks about a final peace
treaty, even as snags threatened the implementation of an interim
accord signed just last month. Wednesday's meeting was an
indication that the peace process was moving once again after a
series of disputes. But those disputes did not stop: The latest
arose over the first group of Palestinian prisoners that Israel was
to release. Palestinians complained that 150 of the 250 to be set
free were ordinary criminals and not political prisoners as
promised. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided
Cabinet has scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian
steps under last month's Wye accord. A go-ahead from the Cabinet
will set in motion an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the
West Bank, probably on Friday. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ROME (AP) _ A ship loaded with about 200 Kurds reached the coast
of Sicily Wednesday, raising fears of a mass exodus of Kurds
encouraged by Italy's refusal so far to extradite their captured
rebel leader. Kurds are launching rallies and hunger strikes across
Europe in opposition to Turkey's request that Abdullah Ocalan be
extradited for trial. An estimated 10,000 Kurds protested in Rome
on Tuesday to demand asylum for their captured leader _ a demand
Italy's premier said would be denied unless the rebel commander has
truly renounced terrorism. The march was the largest yet in days of
growing protests since Italian police arrested Ocalan at Rome's
airport Thursday. Thousands of others protested Tuesday in Bonn,
Germany, Moscow, Ankara, Turkey, and the Belgian capital, Brussels.
Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is fighting
for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. The 14-year-old
conflict has killed 37,000 people. (ITALY-KURDS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the biggest antigovernment turnout
since deadly clashes with the military last week, about 4,000
student protesters marched through the capital's streets and laid
flowers outside the gates of the heavily guarded Parliament
Wednesday. Two peaceful protests were held in downtown Jakarta
after legislators inside started work on political reforms that the
students view as falling short of true democracy. Meanwhile, police
with sticks beat student activists who forced their way into the
governor's office in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
Radio reports said several students were injured. Hundreds of
protesters demanding an end to authoritarianism and military
involvement in the government also tore down the gates of the local
Parliament in Surabaya. (INDONESIA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's president arrived in Kosovo
on Wednesday for talks doomed to failure because of a boycott by
ethnic Albanians, while a newspaper published what it reported was
a U.S. draft plan outlining virtual self-rule for the province.
President Milan Milutinovic was pressing for a direct meeting with
a Kosovo Albanian delegation, apparently seeking to assert Serbia's
stand that any negotiations on the future of the separatist
province is its internal issue. But Serbian authority over Kosovo
appeared to be put to question in the draft plan published by the
daily Koha Ditore. It envisages almost no Serbian control of the
Albanian-majority province, while leaving it under partial
jurisdiction of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro. There
was no immediate confirmation of the authenticity of the plan. But
previous versions published in the past have proven accurate.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the biggest anti-government turnout
since deadly clashes with the military last week, about 4,000
student protesters marched through the capital's streets and laid
flowers and prayed outside the gates of the heavily guarded
Parliament Wednesday.
	   Two peaceful protests were held in downtown Jakarta after
legislators inside started work on enacting political reforms that
the students view as falling short of true democratic reform.
	   Meanwhile, police with sticks beat student activists who forced
their way into the governor's office in Surabaya, Indonesia's
second-largest city. Radio reports said several students were
injured.
	   Hundreds of protesters demanding democratic reform also tore
down the gates of the local Parliament in Surabaya.
	   In Jakarta, rush-hour traffic was brought to a standstill when
about 2,500 students marched peacefully past hotels and office
buildings. They were blocked by about 100 army anti-riot officers
from proceeding to the National Monument near the presidential
palace.
	   To avoid a confrontation, the group headed toward Atma Jaya
University, where soldiers and police had opened fire on protesters
last Friday.
	   A separate group of about 1,500 demonstrators, riding in and
atop 15 buses, was blocked by soldiers. They were later allowed to
gather outside the Parliament building under a military escort.
	   Earlier, in a speech that opened a new session of the
legislature, Speaker Harmoko warned that any delay to the reform
process could ``trigger new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast
Asian nation, already beset by political and economic turmoil.
	   He said parliamentary elections in May or early June 1999 would
be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct, open to
all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired at protesters who tried to march on
Parliament. Others, including some police, died when rioting broke
out in parts of Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Friday's was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people
in May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   Cabinet Minister Adi Sasono said Wednesday that autopsies showed
some dead students had been killed by live ammunition.
	   ``Yes, they used real bullets,'' Adi said in an interview with
Dow Jones Newswires. ``I got a report from the doctors who carried
out autopsies ... and found there were real bullets used.''
	   This is despite assurances by the military that security
personnel had been issued only with plastic bullets and blank
ammunition.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto, who has ordered an inquiry,
took out advertisements in several national newspapers expressing
his ``sincere condolences'' for last week's deaths.
	   Opposition and students have demanded that Wiranto resign as
armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of the
shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.
	   City authorities said 123 buildings and 97 cars were damaged or
set afire, the newspaper The Jakarta Post reported.
	   Police have questioned more than a dozen opposition figures,
including two retired generals, in a sedition inquiry.
	   Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has alleged that the student protests were orchestrated by
conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted police as saying those questioned were
suspected of subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of
lifetime imprisonment.
	   Five were summoned to police headquarters Wednesday. The roundup
is the first major crackdown on dissidents since Habibie took
office.
	   ``The accusations are a mere fabrication,'' said Lt. Gen. Kemal
Idris, a retired army general, before he entered the National
Police headquarters.
	   Last week's bloodshed erupted after tens of thousands of
students tried to march on the green-domed legislature where the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly approved a range of
political reforms sponsored by Habibie.
	   These reforms will now be enacted by the 500-member Parliament,
which makes up half of the assembly but is now sitting in its own
right.
	   Although the reforms call for new elections and go some way in
dismantling Suharto's authoritarian legacy, the students and other
critics say that they don't go far enough.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS settlement expansion attempt, comment grafs 5-9
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials prepared to
relaunch long-suspended talks about a final peace treaty Wednesday,
while snags threatened implementation of the Wye accord signed just
last month.
	   The meeting was an indication that the peace process was moving
once again, after a series of wrangles over implementation.
	   But there was another dispute, as well, this time over the first
group of Palestinian prisoners Israel was to release. Palestinians
complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were ordinary
criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an ongoing effort by Jewish settlers
to expand areas they control.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a hilltop near the West
Bank Jewish settlement of Kedumim near Nablus on Wednesday. About
30 settlers camped on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were
establishing a new community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by building
access roads to settlements that would be surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after the Israeli withdrawals
under the Wye accord.
	   Expansion of settlements and road-building came under fire from
Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
He charged that the Israelis are confiscating Palestinian land and
uprooting olive trees. ``It cannot be accepted,'' he complained.
``This is an obvious violation of the agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps under the
accord. A green light from the Cabinet will set in motion a series
of steps, including an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
probably on Friday.
	   Right-wingers charged that the pullback endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. Settler leaders called on Cabinet
ministers Wednesday not to approve the pullback.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet at the Foreign
Ministry in Jerusalem with Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, known as
Abu Mazen, to discuss a permanent peace treaty between the two
sides.
	   It will be the first official meeting about a final status
agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996. Abbas said
on the Voice of Palestine that his meeting with Sharon will focus
on the agenda for full-scale talks on a permanent settlement which
he expected to begin in a week to 10 days.
	   The interim framework, including the Wye accord, is set to
expire on May 4, 1999.
	   ``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements,'' Abu Mazen said.
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to rifles by Arafat, led to a
mini-crisis Monday. Netanyahu suspended Israel's withdrawal until
Arafat retracted the statement.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment
to negotiations as the only way to settle disputes with Israel. The
Israelis accepted this as a retraction and lifted their suspension
threat.
	   Meanwhile, a new dispute arose over the release of Palestinian
prisoners. Abbas, who met Israeli Internal Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani Tuesday, said there was agreement to release
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons Friday, and the protocol
allowing opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza would be signed
Thursday so flights could begin Friday.
	   Tibi complained that the 150 prisoners to be released are common
criminals, not members of resistance groups. He charged that this
was a violation of the Wye agreement and said the Palestinians have
complained to the United States. Special envoy Dennis Ross will
seek to resolve the issue, he added.
	   According to the Wye agreement, the first Israeli pullback
involves giving the Palestinians civilian rule over two percent of
West Bank land now under full Israeli control. Also, an area
amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank is to be transferred from
joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full Palestinian rule. The
pullback had been scheduled for Monday.

Malaysia, U.S. seek to limit differences over Gore comments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian and U.S. officials
sought Wednesday to limit a diplomatic furor set off by Vice
President Al Gore's declaration of support for Malaysian
dissidents.
	   Asked if he had made up with Gore during the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
replied: ``Made up? I don't know of any differences. I'm not aware
of anything.''
	   U.S. officials also rejected suggestions that Gore's comments
had distracted the APEC summit from dealing with Asia's serious
economic crisis.
	   During informal socializing during the summit, Gore and Mahathir
chatted and smiled as they walked together. Mahathir told reporters
they did not discuss Gore's remarks and that ``there's no change in
relations between the U.S. and Malaysia.''
	   The attempt at minimizing the rift contrasted sharply with
comments by Malaysian officials a day earlier and in local
newspapers on Wednesday.
	   Gore infuriated Malaysian leaders earlier in the week when he
sympathized with the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who are part of a
growing street protest movement that is calling for an end to
Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Malaysia's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, called the speech ``the
most disgusting ... I've ever heard in my life.''
	   Malaysian newspapers bristled with editorials condemning Gore.
Many had front-page stories highlighting criticism of Gore's
remarks. ``Al Gored'' read the headline in The Star's story.
	   The New Straits Times carried nearly a dozen angry articles.
	   ``The world community is all too familiar with the U.S.'s double
standards in its self-appointed role of global supercop,'' the
Times said in an editorial.
	   Noordin Sopiee, the head of the Institute of Strategic and
International Studies, a think-tank, took out a full page
advertisement in the newspaper calling Gore crass and ignorant.
	   ``Mr. Gore should not only have left the meeting room
immediately after insulting us. He should have got on the plane and
left the country,'' it said.
	   A cartoon published by the New Straits Times showed Gore
shouting ``Democracy!'' and then being asked by a bellhop to sign
the bill for dozens of hotel rooms canceled by the U.S. delegation
after U.S. President Bill Clinton decided not to visit because of
the Iraqi crisis.
	   Gore's remarks were prompted by the arrest of Mahathir's former
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 20, and his alleged
beating while in police custody.
	   Anwar is standing trial on 10 charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct, allegations he denies and calls trumped up to undermine
his challenge to Mahathir.
	   The youth wing of Malaysia's governing coalition accused the
United States on Wednesday of trying to destabilize the government,
and lodged a formal complaint at the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``We cannot accept such a blatant insult to the Malaysian
nation,'' said the complaint, signed by leaders of the five main
youth divisions of the governing National Front coalition.
	   The note also objected to a meeting Sunday between U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Anwar's wife, Azizah
Ismail.

Indonesian minister says some students killed by live ammunition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Autopsies on student protesters shot
by Indonesian troops last week showed that some had died of wounds
from live ammunition, an Indonesian Cabinet minister said
Wednesday.
	   The claim by Cooperatives Minister Adi Sasono comes despite
assurances by military commanders that troops had been issued with
only plastic bullets or blank ammunition for use at protests.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto has ordered an investigation
into Friday's slayings.
	   ``Yes, they used real bullets,'' Adi said in an interview with
Dow Jones Newswires. ``I got a report from the doctors who carried
out autopsies ... and found there were real bullets used.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired at protesters who tried to march on
Parliament, where a special government assembly was passing
political reforms that fell short of protesters' demands.
	   Later other people, including some police, died when rioting
broke out in parts of Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Adi said ``third parties'' might have been involved in the
shootings and that Gen. Wiranto, who is also defense minister,
should not step down as demanded by students and other critics.
	   Adi, a key ally of President B.J. Habibie, said circumstances
surrounding Friday's shootings appeared similar to those when four
student protesters were killed in May. Those deaths triggered
rioting and led to the resignation of former President Suharto.
	   The minister said the military needed to improve its handling of
protests.
	   However, he said that many of the soldiers and police on duty
were fatigued and had been provoked by demonstrators.
	   ``People spit at them, calling them dogs,'' he said.

Bangkok expansion plan to go ahead, says Thai airport chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will go ahead with a plan to
expand Bangkok's international airport, and expects to call bids
for the 4.3 billion baht (dlrs 118.5 million) project by the end of
the year, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Air Chief Marshal Niphon Sakornyen, governor of the Airports
Authority of Thailand, said he expects construction could start
early next year and be completed before the end of 2000, the
Bangkok Post reported.
	   Some recent press reports had said the project might be scrapped
after delays caused by bidding and scheduling problems.
	   Last week, the Post quoted Niphon as saying the airport agency
was unable to find a construction company that could guarantee
credit for the full cost of the project.
	   Contractors protested the tough terms and the airport authority
recently relented by dropping the credit guarantee to 1 billion
baht (dlrs 27.5 million), the Post reported, adding that more than
50 contractors have already registered new bids for the project.
	   Phojana Simasathien, AAT's deputy managing director, downplayed
the effects of the bidding problems, saying the delay was also
caused by efforts to schedule the construction so that it doesn't
interfere with the normal flow of passengers and aircraft.

EU Commission bans Portuguese beef, cattle exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission on
Wednesday officially banned the export of beef and cattle from
Portugal, officials said.
	   The move had been widely expected but the bans were delayed
because they had to be examined by the Commission's legal service.
	   The ban on exports of beef from Portugal is for nine months. The
ban on exports of cattle from the country is indefinite, but it
will be reviewed by the Commission after 18 months at the latest.
	   The bans result from of a sharp rise this year in the number of
cases of ``mad cow disease'' - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy
- in cattle in Portugal this year. BSE in beef has been linked to a
fatal brain ailment in humans.
	   In 1997, Portugal exported a total of only about 3,100 metric
tons of beef and live bovine animals, according to the Commission.
Of that, 1,500 tons were beef exports and 1,600 tons were cattle
exports.
	   Portugal has reported at least 67 cases of BSE this year,
according to the Commission. The total number of BSE cases that had
been reported in Portugal at the start of the year was 91,
according to the Commission.

Stock exchange censures former company directors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong stock exchange has censured four
former executive directors of a troubled fire-fighting equipment
manufacturer for improper transactions and loans, the exchange said
in a statement Wednesday.
	   The four were involved in improper transactions totaling 91
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 11.7 million) between their
former company Mansion Holdings Ltd. and two related companies in
1995, it said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong identified the four former
directors as Henry Lam Kwong Let, William Leung Wai Chung, Danny
Tung Kin Bun and Jason Yip Chi Fun.
	   Mansion Holdings, which makes and distributes fire-fighting
equipment, ran into financial difficulties early this year, and
defaulted on some debt payments. Symphony Holdings Ltd. took over
Mansion Holdings in August. Mansion Holdings shares have been
suspended from trading since the takeover.
	   The exchange did not censure Mansion Holdings, only the former
directors.

Russia, Peru and Vietnam enjoy their first summit

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Peru's president sought more
investments from foreign businesses. Russia's premier carefully
explained his country's economic woes to the U.S. delegation. And
Vietnam's leader hunted for new technology.
	   For each of them, their first visit to an Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit opened a new way of doing business and
maintaining contact with powerful world leaders.
	   In fact, as new members of the free-trade group this year, Peru,
Russia and Vietnam seemed unconcerned by all the bickering over
tariffs and human rights that took place at this summit.
	   Instead, they worried about issues closer to home.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the three leaders
really enjoyed their first APEC experience, calling the summit
``useful,'' ``enlightening'' and ``an eye opener.''
	   President Alberto Fujimori of Peru walked away from his meeting
with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi with dlrs 480 million in
aid to build new roads and bridges that were destroyed by cyclones
in Peru this year, a Peruvian official said.
	   Tokyo offered help implement an accord between Peru and Ecuador
that ended a half-century dispute between the neighboring countries
over a slice of Amazon jungle.
	   Fujimori also appeared before the 1,000 business leaders meeting
alongside the APEC summit.
	   ``To become a valuable partner in this exclusive forum, my
country has been clearing the path to modernization and progress,''
Fujimori said in a speech to them.
	   Even though Peru has a small economy, he said, it contains the
``ideal conditions that investors look for.''
	   In his two-hour meeting with U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
Russia's premier, Yevgeny Primakov, discussed Russia's financial
crisis, a steel trade dispute, and America's concerns about
anti-Semitic comments that were made in Russia.
	   Russia also was looking into the possibility of tapping into the
pool of financial expertise among APEC members so that Moscow could
run its new private-sector banks better.
	   ``We hope that APEC participation will help us increase the
effectiveness of our banking system,'' Andrei Denisov, a senior
Russian trade official, said after one of the forum's meetings.
	   Russian companies immediately tried take advantage of their
country's new APEC membership, too.
	   At a nearby trade show, 50 Russian companies showed everything
from X-ray machines to commercial jets, moving in to get a toehold
in the Southeast Asian market.
	   ``We are here to investigate markets and make contacts for sales
and distribution,'' said Alexander A. Brook of the Myasishchev
Design Bureau, which makes small aircraft.
	   Vietnam, a communist country still experimenting with
capitalism, asked APEC's many wealthy members for sophisticated
technology for its fledgling industries.
	   The government hopes to create 1 million to 1.2 million jobs
next year, leaning on small and medium-size enterprises and
vocational training.
	   ``Access to science and technology is important to us now. We
hope to gain from transfer of technology,'' Vietnam's vice prime
minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, told a local newspaper.
	   APEC started in 1989 with 12 countries: Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines,
Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and the United States. China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Chile were accepted
later.
	   Now that Russia, Peru and Vietnam have become new members, the
APEC is closed to others for 10 years.

UK's Abbey National shopping for Italian bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Britain's second-largest mortgage lender,
Abbey National, is shopping for an Italian financial company to
boost its business in Italy, the chief executive for Italy said
Wednesday.
	   Flush with success at shaking up mortgage lending in Italy, it
wants to acquire an Italian unit that could add between 100,000 to
200,000 customers to its current 15,000-odd Italian clients, said
Adrian Hill, the company's chief executive for Italian operations.
	   He said it could take as much as a year to close a deal.
	   ``We don't want a retail bank,'' Hill said. ``They're too
expensive. What we're after is a large number of customers and
cross-sell investment and other products.''
	   Abbey National last April stunned Italy's banking establishment
by breaking just below the 5 percent mortgage barrier, or at least
1.0 to 2.0 percentage points lower than that offered by Italian
banks.
	   That move _ and the free publicity it generated _ led to a 50
percent to 60 per cent rise in monthly volume at Abbey National,
Hill said.
	   Italy's housing market also has picked up a bit thanks because
of new government incentives and generally lower interest rates.
Abbey National's lowest mortgage rate is 4.3 percent still the best
in Italy.

Croats mark fall of eastern town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VUKOVAR, Croatia (AP) _ Bearing candles and wreaths, thousands
of Croat mourners gathered at a mass grave Wednesday to commemorate
the fall of Vukovar _ the first ethnically cleansed city in the
wars that tore up the former Yugoslavia.
	   It is estimated that more than 10,000 people were killed at the
hands of rebel Serbs and Yugoslav army troops in this far-eastern
town during its three-month siege in late 1991.
	   Constant shelling reduced Vukovar to little more than bricks and
mortar and up to 100,000 Croats fled the carnage. Only a few
thousand have returned since January, when the region returned to
Croatian control through an internationally brokered peace deal.
	   Wednesday was the first time mourners were allowed unimpeded
access to graves and tombstones to commemorate the city's fall, as
a United Nations mandate previously restricted the flow of
visitors, fearing violence and reprisals against the Serb
population.
	   The crowd first paid homage to the victims of a massacre in
Ovcara on the outskirts of Vukovar, before proceeding to a newly
built cemetery holding the remains of mostly civilian victims.
	   The ceremony ended at city square by the Danube River where a
holy mass was held in memory of those who perished.
	   On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council reiterated
demands that Yugoslav officials arrest three army officers indicted
for war crimes by the International War Crimes Tribunal, based in
the Hague, Netherlands.
	   The three, Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan

Regional leader calls for secession from Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The young millionaire leader of a southern
republic has threatened to secede from Russia, prompting a quick
warning of retaliation from the Kremlin on Wednesday.
	   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, 36, the elected president of Kalmykia, went
on Russian television Tuesday night to say he would push for
secession because of the federal government's failure to deliver
subsidies to the impoverished region.
	   Ilyumzhinov reiterated his threat in an interview with the
Interfax news agency on Wednesday. ``We shall urge Moscow to give
us the status of an associated member (internally autonomous), or
just secede from Russia,'' he said.
	   Ilyumzhinov's bid appeared aimed at getting more federal funds
rather than open rebellion, but his statement was likely to
strengthen separatist trends in the Russian regions because of the
country's economic crisis. He indicated he might settle for greater
financial autonomy.
	   Kalmykia is a barren region along the Caspian Sea with a
population of 317,000 people. Kalmyks, descendants of Mongol nomads
who settled in the region in the 17th century, now account for
nearly half of the region's population.
	   It drew a quick response from President Boris Yeltsin, who on
Wednesday ordered an emergency session of the presidential Security
Council to address the issue and draw up a response.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Echo Moscow radio
that the session is likely to be held next week.
	   ``The president is concerned with such statements,'' Yakushkin
said. ``In the current difficult socio-economic situation, such
statements threaten to destabilize the country's political
stability.''
	   Ilyumzhinov's bid also prompted lawmakers in the Russian
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, to urge a probe by the
Prosecutor's General office.
	   A rich businessman, Ilyumzhinov is notorious for his extravagant
lifestyle. Ilyumzhinov, who is head of the World Chess Federation,
says he will run for the Russian presidency in 2000, although few
have taken that bid seriously.
	   Ilyumzhinov was first elected in 1993 and won re-election in
1995 in a vote which was denounced as unfair by the Russian Central
Election Commission.
	   Liberal Russian media have accused Ilyumzhinov of running the
mostly rural region like a medieval barony, flaunting his fleet of
luxury imported cars and wealth while crushing dissent and ignoring
the republic's social troubles. A journalist critical of the
president was recently murdered, and two suspects who worked for
the president have been arrested.
	   Ilyumzhinov spent huge sums to build the Chess City complex that
housed an international chess tournament earlier this year. Human
rights activists issued protests, saying the Chess City was built
with federal money earmarked for industrial and agricultural
programs in Kalmykia.
	   When the Russian economic crisis hit in August, Ilyumzhinov
openly challenged the federal government by refusing to turn over
taxes and printed money without federal permission.
	   The government responded by suspending credits to Kalmykia and
the Russian Central Bank in September shut down its local branch
there.
	   Many of Russia's 89 regions and republics have pushed for more
powers and received a significant level of autonomy in economic and
financial spheres.
	   One region, Chechnya, broke away from Russian after a 1994-96
war and has been running its own affairs, although Moscow still
considers it a part of Russia and no other nation has recognized
its independence.

Free-trade summit in Malaysia ends with modest proposals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir defending results of summit in 9th graf

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations approved a
modest set of proposals Wednesday to battle the region's worst
economic crisis in decades, following a disappointing summit
overshadowed by conflicts about human rights and free trade.
	   The group's final statement praised signs of recovery in
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. It said these hard-hit
countries should continue adopting painful reforms recommended by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also
called for more financial assistance from the international
community, and endorsed a U.S. proposal to speed emergency loans to
the Asian countries at the center of the crisis.
	   Despite the strong anti-free market views promoted by this
year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC
statement rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign exchange
trading or new controls on the movement of capital in and out of
countries.
	   Offering Mahathir a consolation prize, the statement did call
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that the
agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily,
without proper review.
	   ``We are resolved to work together to support an early and
sustained recovery in the region, to contain the risks of contagion
and prevent the possibility of a global recession,'' said the
statement, read by Mahathir at the conclusion of the two-day summit
by APEC leaders.
	   Some of the leaders, standing under the sun in stifling heat,
mopped their faces with handkerchiefs as the declaration was read.
	   The statement also praised China for maintaining the value of
its currency, the yuan, and Japan for announcing a new stimulus
package and reform measures to revive its ailing economy.
	   Mahathir countered criticism that the statement was too general
and failed to specify new steps for solving the region's financial
crisis. It is ``specific enough,'' he told reporters. ``The focus
is on the central issues that are of concern to all parties.''
	   The free-trade summit was overshadowed by a diplomatic furor set
off by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and by a disagreement between
the United States and Japan which forced the group to delay a
landmark free-trade agreement.
	   The pact sought to slash tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in world
trade. But opposition by Japan to opening up two of the nine
proposed sectors _ fishing and forestry products _ forced APEC to
send the plan to the 124-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva
for resolution.
	   But Gore also announced an agreement with Japan on a joint
approach to dealing with the financial crisis, including a dlrs 10
billion support package designed to help struggling Asian nations.
	   Half the money will come from the United States and the other
half from Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
	   The assistance, although small compared with the magnitude of
the region's debt burdens, should help assure nervous financial
markets.
	   Gore's decision to deliver a speech on the eve of the summit
that sympathized with the host country's anti-government reform
movement caused divisions among APEC's leaders.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Gore's
remarks could put the nation's democratic process at risk. And APEC
officials from Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand urged the vice
president to stick to economic issues during the meetings.
	   After reading the APEC statement Wednesday, Mahathir brushed
aside two questions from reporters about Gore's comments, saying he
was not aware of any differences between them.
	   The U.S. side also rejected suggestions that Gore's comments had
distracted the summit from dealing with the serious economic crisis
in Asia.
	   Gore was a stand-in for President Bill Clinton, who stayed in
Washington because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   Protests by supporters of Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim have
occurred in the country since he was fired as deputy prime
minister, arrested and put on trial after challenging Mahathir's
17-year rule.
	   During the APEC meetings, top officials from the U.S.,
Philippine, Canadian and Australian delegations met privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to sympathize with his campaign and to
express concern over his treatment and trial on corruption and sex
charges that he vehemently denies.
	   With Asia in its worst financial crisis in decades, the APEC
summit was intended to be a chance for the leaders to recommend
measures that would help revive economic growth and stabilize
currency and stock markets.
	   The crisis, which began in July 1997 in Thailand, has spread to
Russia and is threatening Brazil and other Latin American nations.
Even the U.S. economy has felt the effects.
	   As expected, the final statement appeared to hew closely to the
Clinton administration's free-market, pro-IMF handling of the
crisis.
	   The IMF has organized loan packages totaling nearly dlrs 120
billion to Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bolster
their economies. In return, it has demanded the nations adopt
unpopular measures that have sent interest rates soaring and
unemployment rising. Not all Asia's leaders have embraced the IMF
formula.
	   Mahathir has criticized the bailout programs and blamed Asia's
woes on foreign currency speculators. In September, he banned
trading of the national currency outside the country and imposed
controls on foreigners trying to pull money out of Malaysia.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

New German coalition paves way for key social reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament was set to take up the new
government's plans to bolster social programs after the ruling
center-left coalition settled differences over energy taxes that
were holding up its agenda.
	   Lawmakers from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats
and their junior partner, the ecology-minded Greens, completed a
bill late Tuesday that would undo cuts in the social safety net by
the previous government.
	   Repealing the measures was a campaign promise by Schroeder, who
unseated longtime chancellor Helmut Kohl in September elections.
Since then, Schroeder has also pledged a review of all social
programs as part of his top priority _ fighting high unemployment.
	   The new law overturning cuts in sick pay and easing of Germany's
strict firing rules is to take effect Jan. 1 _ along with higher
energy prices.
	   Ignoring protests by service industries, another measure would
make more low-paying jobs subject to social security taxes.
	   Parliament, where the coalition holds a 21-seat majority, is to
debate the package Friday and is expected to pass it next month.
	   Details of the energy tax _ another campaign plank of the left _
took weeks to settle. After Schroeder ruled out radical moves as
harmful to industry, the Greens settled for far less than they
originally demanded.
	   The final plan calls for a six-pfennig (3.5-cent) increase in
gasoline prices. Electricity, heating oil and natural gas prices
will also go up.
	   But 27 industries with high energy use, including aluminum and
cement, will be exempted from the tax hike. Other energy-intensive
industries will pay a reduced rate.
	   The new taxes will finance a dip in government-mandated payroll
levies for old-age benefits, portrayed by the government as a first
step toward lowering high labor costs that hurt German
competitiveness.
	   The ``ecological tax reform'' is also designed to promote
conservation.

Earthquakes in Iran destroy houses, but no casualties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two earthquakes hit Iran on Wednesday,
destroying houses but not inflicting casualties.
	   The more powerful earthquake of magnitude 5.6 wrecked buildings
in six villages in the central province of Kerman, said an official
of the Red Crescent Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red
Cross.
	   It struck at 11:11 local time (0741 GMT), when most villagers
were working in the fields, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Red Crescent has already dispatched tents, food and blankets
to the area, he added.
	   Earlier, a quake of 4.6 magnitude hit the northwest province of
East Azerbaijan at 4:34 local time (0104 GMT), Iranian radio
reported. It did not give further details.
	   On Friday, a temblor of magnitude 5.7 struck the southwest
province of Fars, causing homes to collapse and mud slides that
killed 5 people and injured about 100.
	   Iran is prone to earthquakes. In May 1997, a magnitude-7.1 quake
killed 1,500 people in the north. In June 1990, two quakes of
magnitudes 7.3 and 7.7 destroyed a northwestern town, killing
50,000 people.

Congo's Kabila visits Angola for talks on military cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila flew to
Angola on Wednesday for talks with President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos to discuss continued Angolan military support for fighting
rebels trying to oust the Congolese leader.
	   A revolt against Kabila's rule by ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of the Congolese army and opposition politicians has drawn
in many of Congo's neighbors, including Angola, which has provided
several thousand troops.
	   The Angolan forces played a key role in blocking a rebel
offensive in southwest Congo, near the border, soon after the
conflict erupted in early August.
	   However, the Angolan government is increasingly concerned about
the mounting threat at home from the former rebel group UNITA,
which recently attacked remote villages in contravention of the
country's 1994 peace pact, and unconfirmed reports say Luanda is
considering withdrawing its troops from Congo.
	   Kabila was scheduled to speak to reporters before leaving Luanda
later Wednesday.

EU Commission clears Bayer takeover of Chiron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission on
Wednesday cleared the takeover of U.S. technology and
pharmaceutical company Chiron Corp.'s clinical diagnostics division
by German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG.
	   The EU Commission said in a statement the change would not
hinder competition in the relevant markets.
	   Under the terms of the deal, Chiron, which is based in
Emeryville, California, will receive dlrs 1.1 billion from Bayer AG
for its in-vitro diagnostic business and will receive license fees
and royalties for its HC/HIV intellectual property.
	   Chiron will keep its profitable brood-screening business, which
last year recorded a dlrs 93 million operating profit.
	   The unit makes and sells blood chemistry tests and systems that
check tissue samples for infectious agents.
	   Chiron will have three remaining business units: one that
develops vaccines, a second that sells cancer treatments and a
third that uses genetic engineering techniques to develop new
drugs.
	   The sale represents a major restructuring for Chiron and
analysts generally applauded the effort to refocus its operations.

What's in the stars from meteor shower? Astrologers unsure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's much-respected fortune
tellers can normally spin a detailed account of how events in the
stars affect human life, but the spectacular meteor shower being
watched by millions worldwide has them shrugging their shoulders.
	   The mountains near this northern city have been a prime viewing
platform for the Leonids meteor shower, drawing tens of thousands
of Thais and foreign visitors to catch a glimpse of the most
spectacular celestial fireworks show in 33 years.
	   The star-gazers have made wishes faster than the meteors _
actually meteoroids in the tail of the Tempel-Tuttle Comet crossing
the Earth's orbit _ can fall. But local astrology experts don't
have much idea how the event will affect a person's fate.
	   ``Meteor showers are often associated with traditional myth,''
said Col. Kitikorn Methathip, a sought-after fortune teller by
hobby and a soldier by profession. ``This is because there is not
enough statistical evidence to form the basis for an astrological
analysis.''
	   Kitikorn said events in the celestial realm that occur on a
regular basis are recorded in astrological charts and used to
analyze a person's likely destiny.
	   The charts link the day a person was born to determine which
planet, plus the moon, is associated with him and to a zodiac sign
of that particular month. Thai women have arranged Caesarean births
to ensure their children are born under a favorable conjuncture.
	   ``It's about mapping out one's fate with the celestial
information,'' Kitikorn said. ``All of us are born with a set of
characteristics and fate that have been largely defined by which
day we were born and which constellation we fall under.''
	   But meteor showers like Leonids are outside the astrologer's
context of understanding, an unpredictable wild card in what people
like Kitikorn consider the known potential of the stars.
	   The Leonids meteor shower _ so-named because they were thought
to originate from the Leo constellation _ actually turns up every
year in November, but is only close enough to Earth to be really
visible in the night skies every 33 years.
	   In their last appearance, some 150,000 separate meteoroids _ or
particles from the comet, some of which are no bigger than a grain
of sand _ were recorded.
	   This time, the best viewing is theoretically in Asia, but bad
weather disappointed many people on what was widely considered the
prime viewing night Tuesday.
	   Kitikorn contrasted the meteor shower and its astrological
usefulness with that of lunar and solar eclipses, which fortune
tellers use in their analyses.
	   Last year, a lunar eclipse led millions of Thais to make
offerings to the Hindu god of darkness, Rahu, in the belief that a
lunar eclipse he was associated with would bring good luck.
	   The arrival of the Leonids meteors has been more like a party.
	   On Tuesday, tens of thousands of people jammed the roads out of
Bangkok, Thailand's capital, 560 kilometers (380 miles) south of
Chiang Mai, to get a glimpse of the meteors. They drank beer and
made wishes as the meteoroids streaked across the night skies.
	   In the end, Kitikorn said, neither meteors nor stars make much
difference.
	   ``A person can be born under the best astrological attributes,
but he or she cannot escape the ultimate responsibility as a human
being _ which is paying the price for all the bad deeds one has
done in the previous life,'' he said.

Anwar's wife thanks APEC leaders, rebuffs Malaysian government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Azizah comment in new grafs 8-9.
 &UR; With BC-APEC-Anwar &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of imprisoned opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim on Wednesday thanked the Pacific Rim leaders
who have supported her and her husband, and rebuffed criticism from
the Malaysian government.
	   Azizah Ismail, reading from a prepared statement, said: ``I do
not regard the mere expression of support for Anwar and his cause
as interference in the internal affairs of Malaysia.''
	   During the just-ended summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, Azizah met with top officials from Australia,
Canada and the United States, as well as with Philippine President
Joseph Estrada.
	   Those meetings infuriated the Malaysian government, which said
they amounted to unwarranted meddling in domestic affairs.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2. He's now on trial on charges of abuse of power
and sexual misconduct. He denies the charges and says they're part
of a vendetta orchestrated by a man who was once his mentor but is
now his enemy, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Since Anwar has been imprisoned during his trial, his
46-year-old wife has taken over as the de facto leader of the
``reformasi,'' or reform, movement he started.
	   Dressed in a mint green Muslim head scarf, Azizah denounced the
Mahathir government, without naming him specifically.
	   ``It is because Malaysians want change and can no longer
tolerate authoritarianism and corruption that they are clamoring
for `reformasi,'' she said.
	   ``My family and I appreciate very much the moral support shown
by APEC leaders for my husband, Anwar Ibrahim,'' Azizah told
reporters at the family home in an upscale neighborhood of Kuala
Lumpur. ``Every government has the right to comment on what is
happening in some other part of the world.''
	   She added: ``Government leaders and the controlled media should
not try to discredit `reformasi' by giving the impression that it
is part of some foreign agenda.''
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore touched off a national outcry in
Malaysia when he praised the reform movement during a speech on
Monday night, just before the APEC summit began.
	   The Malaysian government has suggested that foreign elements
have been supporting the reform movement.

Reds star furious over Hoddle's comments

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Call him Angry Cole.
	   Overlooked by Glenn Hoddle for England's exhibition game against
the Czech Republic Wednesday, Manchester United striker Andy Cole
is so furious with the England coach that his business manager has
sent a letter of complaint about him to the Football Association.
	   Cole, who has played twice for England but only as a substitute
for Hoddle, described the coach as a ``coward'' for not telling him
face to face why he had been left off the team at a time when
England's leading strikers, Alan Shearer and Michael Owen, are both
out injured.
	   The Manchester United striker, who has scored seven goals this
season and has netted 65 in 125 games for United, accused the
England coach of criticizing him through the media.
	   ``His behavior towards me has been cowardly,'' Cole told the Sun
tabloid. ``His comments about me are diabolical and disrespectful.
I'm convinced that his reasons for leaving me out of the
international squad are not professional, they're personal.''
	   Hoddle has been quoted as saying he did not think that Cole's
scoring record had improved enough to justify a recall. He said
that Cole required seven chances to score while others needed only
one.
	   According to the Sun, Cole's business manager, Paul Stretford,
had sent a letter of complaint to the FA about Hoddle's criticism
of the Manchester United player through the media.
	   ``I am protesting about spurious allegations,'' Stretford told
the Sun. ``Andy has a fine record and Hoddle's statements are out
of order.''
	   With Shearer and Owen sidelined, Hoddle has recalled Liverpool's
Robbie Fowler to the squad yet was expected to field 35-year-old
Ian Wright and 31-year-old Dion Dublin against the Czechs.
	   Cole's public criticism of Hoddle may ruin any chance of an
immediate recall and the Manchester United striker appears to have
accepted that.
	   ``By going public like this I'm not doing my chances of future
selection any good to say the least,'' he told the Sun.
	   ``But I'm convinced I'm not going to get in again while Hoddle
is in charge anyway.''

French group sponsors ecotourism race in central Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A French group is sponsoring an
ecotourism cross-country race in the central Philippines early next
year to encourage tourists to visit one of the country's poorest
regions, organizers said Wednesday.
	   The first ``Authentic Adventure'' competition, sponsored by the
French petroleum company Elf Aquitaine, will debut in the
Philippines April 15, said Gerard Fusil, leader of the organizing
group.
	   Fusil said seven-member teams will race over 700 kilometers (438
miles) from Catarman town on Samar Island to Tacloban City on
nearby Leyte Island.
	   With three members providing logistical support, each team's
four racers will have to climb several mountains, cross rugged
terrain, explore caves, wade in rivers, jump in waterfalls, roller
skate, kayak and sail in small, native canoes, he said.
	   Fusil said participants will be encouraged to mingle and
interact with the local people during rest periods.
	   Amelie de Robiano, another organizer, said about 40 foreign
teams are expected, including about 20 French teams. Teams from the
United States, Brazil, Colombia and Spain have expressed interest,
she said.
	   De Robiano said communist rebels reportedly operate in some of
the areas.
	   ``We only found many snakes and leeches, but no communists,''
she added.
	   De Robiano, Fusil and several other organizers have tested the
course, which took them two weeks to complete.
	   The winning team will receive about dlrs 8,000 and a trophy.
	   De Robiano said the areas for the race have been ignored by
tourists in the past, and the contest will enable foreigners to see
their unspoiled beauty.
	   She said local officials claim that the last foreigners to visit
some areas on Samar where the competitors will pass were Japanese
soldiers during World War II.
	   ``It's going to be a new experience for foreigners and also for
the local people who have not seen foreigners before,'' she said.
	   The project will move to another country for the next
competition.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The woman known to be Japan's oldest person died
Wednesday in a Tokyo home for the elderly. She was 114.
	   Tase Matsunaga, born May 11, 1884, died of heart failure at the
Mutsumien home, said an official at the home, speaking on condition
of anonymity. She declined to give further details.
	   Yasu Akino, 113, of Shizuoka prefecture (state), 150 kilometers
(95 miles) west of Tokyo, is now the oldest person living in Japan,
Kyodo News agency said.
	   Matsunaga, a former farmer, lived with her daughter, now 86, in
Tokyo until she moved into Mutsumien in 1983, Kyodo said. Her
husband died in 1962, it said.

German state leader says prison escape may have been inside job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ A Russian accused of kidnapping a young
man and leaving him to die in a pit in the woods may have had
inside help when he escaped from prison last week, a German state
leader said Wednesday.
	   Brandenburg state governor Manfred Stolpe called on
investigators to look into suspicions that Sergei Serov, 38, who is
considered dangerous, had helpers ``inside or outside'' the jail in
Potsdam, just south of Berlin.
	   Serov climbed down from the roof of the jail Saturday night
using bed sheets. Jail officials didn't realize he was missing
until midday Sunday, although a surveillance camera on a
neighboring building had captured the escape on videotape.
	   State justice minister Hans Otto Braeutigam resigned over the
jailbreak Wednesday.
	   Serov and fellow Russian Vyacheslav Orlov, 28, were to go on
trial early next year on charges of kidnapping leading to death.
Authorities said the two had made partial confessions in the case
of Matthias Hintze, a 20-year-old kidnapped Sept. 14, 1997 and
buried in a pit, where he slowly suffocated.
	   His body was found Oct. 8, 1997, a day after the two Russians
were arrested while trying to pick up the 1 million mark (dlrs
625,000) ransom.
	   Hintze's family's lawyer, Andreas Schulz, has accused
authorities of incompetence, saying Moscow police weren't
officially informed about Serov's escape until Tuesday, learning of
it instead in newspapers Monday.
	   Authorities believe Serov may have fled Germany, possibly to
Russia.
	   Berlin prosecutors have filed kidnapping charges against the two
in the case of a Berlin-based Russian computer dealer, Alexander
Galius, who disappeared in June 1997. One million marks was
demanded in that case as well.
	   Galius was never found and police suspect he died in an
underground shaft like Hintze.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement to resume

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials prepared to
relaunch long-suspended talks Wednesday about a final peace treaty,
while snags threatened implementation of the Wye accord signed last
month.
	   The meeting showed the peace process was moving again, after a
series of wrangles over implementation.
	   But there was another dispute, as well, this time over the first
group of Palestinian prisoners Israel was to release. Palestinians
complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were ordinary
criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an ongoing effort by Jewish settlers
to expand areas they control.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a hilltop Wednesday near
the West Bank settlement of Kedumim near Nablus. About 30 settlers
camped on the site Tuesday, declaring they were establishing a new
community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by building
access roads to settlements that would be surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after the Israeli withdrawals
under the Wye accord.
	   Expansion of settlements and road-building came under fire from
Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
He charged that the Israelis are confiscating Palestinian land and
uprooting olive trees. ``It cannot be accepted,'' he complained.
``This is an obvious violation of the agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps under the
accord. A green light from the Cabinet will set in motion a series
of steps, including an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
probably on Friday.
	   Right-wingers charged that the pullback endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. Settler leaders called on Cabinet
ministers Wednesday not to approve the pullback.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet at the Foreign
Ministry in Jerusalem with Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, known as
Abu Mazen, to discuss a permanent peace treaty between the two
sides.
	   It will be the first official meeting about a final status
agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996. Abbas said
on Voice of Palestine radio that his meeting with Sharon will focus
on the agenda for full-scale talks on a permanent settlement which
he expected to begin in a week to 10 days.
	   The interim framework, including the Wye accord, is set to
expire on May 4, 1999.
	   ``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements,'' Abu Mazen said.
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to rifles by Arafat, led to a
mini-crisis Monday. Netanyahu suspended Israel's withdrawal until
Arafat retracted the statement.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment
to negotiations as the only way to settle disputes with Israel. The
Israelis accepted this as a retraction and lifted their suspension
threat.
	   Meanwhile, a new dispute arose over the release of Palestinian
prisoners. Abbas, who met Israeli Internal Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Tuesday, said there was agreement to release
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons Friday.
	   Tibi complained that the 150 prisoners to be released are common
criminals, not members of resistance groups. He charged that this
was a violation of the Wye agreement and said the Palestinians have
complained to the United States. Special envoy Dennis Ross will
seek to resolve the issue, he added.
	   According to the Wye agreement, the first Israeli pullback
involves giving the Palestinians civilian rule over two percent of
West Bank land now under full Israeli control. Also, an area
amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank is to be transferred from
joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full Palestinian rule. The
pullback had been scheduled for Monday.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ American efforts to halt the spread of a
tree-infesting beetle will affect some Hong Kong exports, but U.S.
agriculture officials acknowledged Wednesday they don't have all
the rules figured out a month before the deadline.
	   Hong Kong trade officials told a visiting U.S. agriculture team
that there is no justification to single out Hong Kong in the ban
on products packed in wood that is not certified to be beetle-free.
	   ``The risk associated with Hong Kong is not high, and in any
case not greater than some of the U.S.' other trading partners,
particularly those who also happen to be habitats of ALB (Asian
long-horned beetle),'' said Stanley Ying, deputy director-general
of trade. He noted that the beetle is not found in southern China
nor has it been found in Hong Kong.
	   On Dec. 17, the U.S. government will impose new regulations to
keep the Asian long-horned beetle, believed to have arrived in
wooden packing crates from China, away from U.S.-bound exports.
	   Hong Kong shipping executives attacked the lack of clarity and
complained that their costs will rise when the United States
imposes its ban _ just as Hong Kong is struggling through
recession.
	   ``All this is not easy to accept,'' said Clement Yeung,
executive director of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council.
	   The ban has angered China, which calls it trade protectionism in
disguise, and a U.S. official who is in Hong Kong to explain things
got a chilly reception.
	   Isi Siddiqui, deputy undersecretary at the Agriculture
Department, said the U.S. government hasn't decided whether China
and Hong Kong would be treated equally under the beetle ban.
	   ``The rule will apply to Hong Kong in some form,'' Siddiqui told
reporters late Wednesday, adding that U.S. officials would notify
local authorities ``as soon as possible'' of any changes that would
apply specifically to Hong Kong.
	   ``The timing is too short for exporters and shippers to
adjust,'' Yeung told The Associated Press. He said the territory's
exporters do not have a sufficient supply of substitute metal or
plastic packing materials to meet the Dec. 17 deadline.
	   Hong Kong faces two issues: What to do about goods shipped from
mainland China to the United States via Hong Kong, and what to do
about goods bound for the United States that originated in Hong
Kong.
	   Under the new rule, wooden crates and pallets bound for the
United States from China must undergo heat or chemical treatment,
or be fumigated to get rid of any beetles.
	   Shipments packed in wood will need an official certificate
guaranteeing the treatment, while exports without wood packaging
must have documents declaring the contents wood-free.
	   The shiny, bullet-shaped Asian long-horned beetle is believed to
have arrived in wooden packing crates from its native China as long
as seven years ago. This year alone, the pests have eaten through
thousands of trees in New York and Chicago, costing about U.S. dlrs
11 million to cut them down.
	   Without such ``emergency regulations,'' the beetle impervious to
most known pesticides or predators could cause as much as U.S. dlrs
138 billion a year in damage, Siddiqui said.
	   In this year's first nine months, Hong Kong served as a conduit
for Chinese exports to the United States worth 179.1 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 23 billion), according to Hong Kong
government statistics.
	   Only 20 percent of such re-exports use solid wood packing
materials and would be subject to the new rules.
	   Over the same period, Hong Kong's domestic exports to the United
States reached 41.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5
billion), of which only 10 percent is estimated to use the affected
materials.
	   After the deadline, U.S. Customs can fine shipments lacking the
needed certification three times the value of the shipment plus the
cost of treatment. Alternatively, the cargo may simply be refused
entry to the United States and returned.
	   Siddiqui said the United States may postpone significant
penalties for up to 60 days.

Top Russian official warns of ``national catastrophe''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a mission of the International Monetary Fund
back in town Wednesday for talks on more loans, a top Cabinet
member warned that Russia is facing a ``national catastrophe.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov warned that inflation would
spiral out of control next year unless the government reaches an
agreement with its creditors to reschedule some of the dlrs 17
billion in foreign debt payments due in 1999.
	   ``If we succeed to restructure just a half of this amount, we
will manage to keep the impact on inflation and industrial output
within reasonable limits,'' he said in an interview with the
business daily Kommersant.
	   If the current government fails to stabilize the economic
situation, ``we will be facing a national catastrophe that would
write off the free-market economy, democracy and the territorial
integrity of Russia,'' he said.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. Last month, 42 million Russians, or 29 percent of the
population were living below the official poverty line of 644
rubles (just under dlrs 40), compared to 31 million (21 percent) a
year ago, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   The economy has continued to contract with industrial production
falling 11 percent last month, it said.
	   The Russian government has been pushing the IMF to release the
next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion aid package, saying
more loans are vital to paying off huge domestic and foreign debts.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pushed for more IMF
loans at meetings this week with visiting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in Moscow and with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, where both men attended the annual Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Summit.
	   Primakov said he was satisfied with the talks, but there was no
sign that Washington or Bonn would back further international aid.
	   However, Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, who
accompanied Primakov, said the meeting with Gore ``significantly
advanced'' the Russian plea for more loans, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported on Wednesday.
	   The IMF has urged the Russian Cabinet to start implementing a
strict economic plan and put forward a realistic budget for next
year as the key condition for more loans. It has criticized the
government's economic plan, finally released last weekend after two
months of hesitation, as scarce on specifics and heavy on state
intervention in the economy.
	   The visiting IMF officials said they expected little from the
current round of talks.
	   Maslyukov said on Wednesday that the government will meet
Saturday to discuss key guidelines of next year's budget.
	   Despite IMF warnings against money printing, Russia has already
printed some cash to help its ailing banks and pay some debts,
although officials said the amount was small and wouldn't fuel
inflation. Maslyukov said in the interview that the amount of new
cash wouldn't exceed 15-20 billion rubles (dlrs 0.8-1.2 billion).
	   Speaking at a Cabinet session on Wednesday, Maslyukov said the
Russian currency would remain relatively stable, within three to
four rubles of the current rate of 17 rubles to the dollar.
	   Addressing reporters later, he reiterated that the government
isn't planning to review privatization carried out by the previous
governments or renationalize any of privatized companies.
	   ``No one is planning to do this,'' he said. ``To whomever is
worried about plans for massive renationalization, (I can only say)
this won't take place.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Sorely lacking the unity it possessed under
Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's opposition Socialist party is to meet this
week in a bid to end a crisis over who is party chief, Josep
Borrell or Joaquin Almunia.
	   The party, which governed Spain under Gonzalez between 1982-96,
has been steeped in confusion and division over the past year
because of the split leadership and often conflicting opinions
presented by Borrell, as party candidate for prime minister, and
Almunia who is party secretary general.
	   Observers believe the Socialists have little chance of regaining
office in the next general elections, scheduled for 2000, as long
has they lack a single unified leadership.
	   News reports Wednesday cited Almunia as saying a ``definitive
solution' to the problem should be reached at Saturday's federal
committee meeting to be attended buy some 200 delegates.
	   ``The party has seen better times,'' former Justice Minister
Juan Alberto Belloch told reporters. He said that if the Saturday's
meeting failed to resolve the issue, a special national congress
would have to be convened.
	   Borrell is seen as the more dynamic and progressive of the two
candidates while Almunia is closely associated the old guard of the
Gonzalez years.
	   A party press spokeswoman said that although the leadership
topic was not on the meeting's agenda it would likely be the main
issue of debate and that a resolution could be expected by the end
of the day.
	   The Socialist party was Spain's strongest party under Gonzalez,
who doubled as premier and party secretary general until the 1996
general loss to the ruling conservative Popular Party in the 1996
general elections.
	   Almunia was voted in to replace Gonzalez as secretary general by
some 1,000 delegates at federal congress in 1996 but in 1997 he
lost to Borrell when the party's rank and file voted on who should
be candidate for premier.
	   Both politicians believe their respective elections entitle them
to act as party chief.

More than 600 workers on strike over late payment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Late salary payments led 623 workers of a
South Korean company in southern Vietnam to stage a one-day strike,
a provincial labor federation official said Wednesday.
	   Nguyen Van Khuong, vice president of the federation, said
workers at the Young Shin footwear company, a 100 percent South
Korean-owned company, resumed work Wednesday in Binh Duong
province.
	   Khuong said the workers have not been paid their October salary
and that the labor federation is negotiating with the company,
which reportedly cited poor export performance as the cause for the
delay.
	   Khuong said there have been four strikes so far by workers,
mostly at Korean-invested companies, in the province this year.

	   ABOARD THE USS EISENHOWER (AP) _ Even though the United States
aborted a colossal attack on Iraq, Navy forces in the Gulf gained
``a tremendous amount'' of experience by executing the elaborate
assault plan up to the eleventh hour, a senior Navy officer said.
	   ``Everything was absolutely perfect. And next time it will be
even more perfect,'' Capt. Denby Starling, the skipper of this
aircraft carrier, told visiting journalists Tuesday.
	   USS Eisenhower, carrying 4.1 million pounds (1.8 million
kilograms) of ordnance, 10 F-14s and 36 F/A-18 strike fighters, was
to have been the main punch of the planned Nov. 14 attack. The
assault would have involved waves of air raids and a barrage of
cruise missile strikes from support ships in the carrier's armada
now patrolling the Gulf.

Official: no danger of hunger in Russia, but diets turning
</HEADLINE>
unhealthy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russians will not starve this winter, but
shrinking supplies of cheap food means the poor will have to switch
to less healthy diets, an agriculture expert said Wednesday.
	   Russia's economic crisis, coming on top of the worst grain
harvest in 40 years, has led to serious concerns about possible
food shortages during the winter. Plenty of food remains in stores,
but prices on most products have jumped sharply.
	   ``There is no reason to fear hunger,'' the head of Russia's
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Gennady Romanenko, was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   But meals on the tables of poor families this winter will
consist mainly of bread, cabbage and potatoes, he said.
	   Many Russians have been forced to resort to subsistence farming,
but potatoes, cabbage and carrots are about all most people can
grow on their small plots of land.
	   ``They will have to forget about drinking milk or eating meat,''
Romanenko said.
	   The government is also worried about possible shortages in
Russia's northern and far eastern regions, which did not receive
enough food shipments before delivery routes froze over.
	   Russia is receiving food aid from the European Union and the
United States worth about dlrs 1 billion to help stave off the
problem.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Hanoi has ceased new registration of
motorized three-wheel vehicles and banned them from 145 streets in
the capital, the newspaper Thanh Nien reported Wednesday.
	   The decision, signed last week and effective next Thursday,
cited safety and pollution problems with the two-stroke Lambretta
tricycles, the paper said.
	   No statistics are available on the number of such three-wheelers
in the city, though they often can be spotted carrying passengers
and goods.
	   City officials have encouraged three-wheeler drivers to switch
to small trucks.
	   On average, 18 people die each day in traffic accidents in
Vietnam, where bicycles and motorbikes account for more than 90
percent of the vehicles.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of imprisoned opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim on Wednesday thanked the Pacific Rim leaders
who supported her and her husband, and rebuffed criticism from the
Malaysian government.
	   Azizah Ismail, reading from a prepared statement, said: ``I do
not regard the mere expression of support for Anwar and his cause
as interference in the internal affairs of Malaysia.''
	   During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, and
meetings by the forum just before it, Azizah met with top officials
from Australia, Canada and the United States, as well as with
Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   Those meetings infuriated the Malaysian government, which said
they amounted to unwarranted meddling in domestic affairs.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2. He's now on trial on charges of abuse of power
and sexual misconduct. He denies them and says they are part of a
vendetta orchestrated by a man who was once his mentor but is now
his enemy, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Since Anwar was imprisoned before his trial, his 46-year-old
wife has taken over as the de facto leader of the ``reformasi,'' or
reform, movement that he started.
	   On Wednesday night, Azizah, who was dressed in a mint green
Muslim head scarf, denounced the Mahathir government, without
naming him specifically.
	   ``It is because Malaysians want change and can no longer
tolerate authoritarianism and corruption that they are clamoring
for `reformasi,'' she said.
	   ``My family and I appreciate very much the moral support shown
by APEC leaders for my husband, Anwar Ibrahim,'' Azizah told
reporters at the family home in an upscale neighborhood of Kuala
Lumpur. ``Every government has the right to comment on what is
happening in some other part of the world.''
	   She added: ``Government leaders and the controlled media should
not try to discredit `reformasi' by giving the impression that it
is part of some foreign agenda.''
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore touched off a national outcry in
Malaysia when he praised the reform movement during a speech on
Monday night, just before the two-day APEC summit began.
	   The Malaysian government has suggested that foreign elements
have been supporting the reform movement.
	   On Wednesday, the Asia Wall Street Journal carried a commentary
that Anwar wrote in jail. It blames Malaysia's economic crisis on
the Mahathir government's ``corruption and nepotism.''
	   Anwar accuses Mahathir and other Asian leaders of using their
power to enrich friends and stamp out true democracy.
	   ``It is not normal to conduct economic discourse from behind
prison walls. But these are not normal times in Malaysia, nor
indeed in much of Asia,'' Anwar writes.
	   During his final news conference at the APEC summit, Mahahtir
said the commentary in the newspaper shows that his government has
not gagged Anwar, or any other activists in the country. ``This
goes to show that the accusation that we have stopped him from
expressing his views is a lot of nonsense,'' Mahathir said.
	   The prime minister also blamed the foreign media, which heavily
covered the summit, for falsely reporting that his government has
been heavy handed in its response to the reform movement.

Technical college attended by rape suspects closed down

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Public outrage over the highly
publicized gang rape of two girls abducted from a bus by five
students has prompted the Education Ministry to order the technical
college the suspects attend to be closed.
	   The rape of the two girls, aged 14 and 18, has triggered
soul-searching over the failure of the bus driver, conductor and
scores of passengers to interfere with the suspects when they
pulled knives on the two girls and forced them off the crowded bus
Saturday.
	   The onlookers said they were too frightened to interfere. The
weeping girls were taken off the bus to a house on the outskirts of
Bangkok and raped.
	   The last of the five suspects was arrested Tuesday. In custody,
they reportedly told police interrogators that there was heavy peer
pressure at their school to carry weapons and boast of forced
sexual conquest.
	   The Education Ministry ordered the closure of the Buranapong
Vocation College on Tuesday for at least one month. Ministry
officials said students from the school were notorious for gang
fights and mused that the teaching was not up to standard.

 &UR; Turkey steps up campaign for return of Kurdish rebel leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Pushing Italy to extradite Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, the government on Wednesday offered free
faxes to people writing to the Italian government. Thousands of
people, meanwhile, demonstrated for a second day outside the
Italian embassy.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome last week, a
terrorist and is trying him in absentia on capital crimes. Italian
law, however, forbids extraditing someone to a country where they
face the death penalty.
	   The Turkish government said Wednesday that Ocalan's extradition
is a test of Italy's commitment to combat terrorism.
	   ``Italy will be labeled a terrorist state if it does not allow
for Ocalan's prosecution in Turkey,'' Deputy Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said.
	   Ocalan heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
at war with the Turkish army for 14 years in a conflict that has
killed about 37,000 people. The Kurds are fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
	   Thousands of people demanding his extradition gathered in front
of the Italian embassy in Ankara Wednesday, blocking traffic on the
city's main avenue. A similar protest took place in front of the
Italian consulate in Istanbul.
	   ``Is it normal for a country that respects human rights to keep
a man like this?'' asked 17-year-old Burcu Turkekul who skipped
school to attend the protest.
	   Also on Wednesday, Transport Minister Arif Ahmet Denizolgun said
post offices would provide free faxes to people writing to the
Italian government demanding Ocalan's return.
	   The daily newspaper Sabah is also sponsoring a fax campaign,
complete with a suggested text and the fax numbers of Italian
ministries.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of meeting, EDITS to conform
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials resumed
long-suspended talks about a final peace treaty Wednesday, while
snags threatened implementation of the Wye accord signed just last
month.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon hosted Palestinian leader
Mahmoud Abbas in Jerusalem. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, said the
actual negotiations would probably begin ``in a week or ten days.''
	   The meeting was an indication that the peace process was moving
once again, after a series of wrangles over implementation.
	   But there was another dispute, as well, this time over the first
group of Palestinian prisoners Israel was to release. Palestinians
complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were ordinary
criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an ongoing effort by Jewish settlers
to expand areas they control.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a hilltop near the West
Bank Jewish settlement of Kedumim near Nablus on Wednesday. About
30 settlers camped on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were
establishing a new community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied. Eleven settlers were detained for
questioning, according to Israeli police.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by building
access roads to settlements that would be surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after the Israeli withdrawals
under the Wye accord.
	   Expansion of settlements and road-building came under fire from
Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
He charged that the Israelis are confiscating Palestinian land and
uprooting olive trees. ``It cannot be accepted,'' he complained.
``This is an obvious violation of the agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps under the
accord. A green light from the Cabinet will set in motion a series
of steps, including an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank,
probably on Friday.
	   Right-wingers charged that the pullback endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. Settler leaders called on Cabinet
ministers Wednesday not to approve the pullback.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996.
	   The interim framework, including the Wye accord, is set to
expire on May 4, 1999. Abbas told the ``Voice of Palestine'' radio,
``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements.''
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to rifles by Arafat, led to a
mini-crisis Monday. Netanyahu suspended Israel's withdrawal until
Arafat retracted the statement.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment
to negotiations as the only way to settle disputes with Israel. The
Israelis accepted this as a retraction and lifted their suspension
threat.
	   Meanwhile, a new dispute arose over the release of Palestinian
prisoners. Abbas, who met Israeli Internal Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani Tuesday, said there was agreement to release
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons Friday, and the protocol
allowing opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza would be signed
Thursday so flights could begin Friday.
	   Tibi complained that the 150 prisoners to be released are common
criminals, not members of resistance groups. He charged that this
was a violation of the Wye agreement and said the Palestinians have
complained to the United States. Special envoy Dennis Ross will
seek to resolve the issue, he added.
	   According to the Wye agreement, the first Israeli pullback
involves giving the Palestinians civilian rule over two percent of
West Bank land now under full Israeli control. Also, an area
amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank is to be transferred from
joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full Palestinian rule. The
pullback had been scheduled for Monday.

Minister in hot water over alleged nepotism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The family comes first for Hungary's
agriculture minister. But some government members say that in
Jozsef Torgyan's case, clan loyalties have gone too far.
	   A leader in the majority party in the center-right coalition has
criticized Torgyan, head of the junior coalition party, over
political appointments to state-run companies, the daily
Nepszabadsag reported Wednesday.
	   Torgyan heads the Independent Smallholders Party. His wife, a
former singer, is a Smallholders deputy whose voice is rarely heard
in parliament.
	   Their son, Attila, is on the board of the state-run news agency
MTI and also legal counsel to the travel agency run by the
country's biggest bank, which handles all travel arrangements for
Torgyan's ministry.
	   Torgyan's daughter-in-law was appointed to the managing board of
the state airlines, Malev, despite fairly uninspiring
qualifications _ she's a high school graduate who used to work at a
travel agency. In trying to defend the appointment, Torgyan has put
forward the claim that former British Prime Minister John Major
also never went past high school
	   And the daughter-in-law's mother sits on the board of the State
Lottery Company.
	   Such appointments are ``morally questionable,'' Robert Repassy,
a senior member of Orban's party, the Federation of Young
Democrats-Civic Party, told Nepszabadsag.
	   Laszlo Koever, the minister overseeing Hungary's security
services, expressed the hope such appointments would not become
regular practice.
	   ``What Mr. Torgyan has done is called nepotism,'' the political
scientist Laszlo Keri told the daily Magyar Hirlap Wednesday.
	   In campaigning for office before elections in May, members of
the present government pledged to reduce corruption they alleged
was rife under the last government, led by the Socialists.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two U.S. Navy warships and a submarine
sailed through the Suez Canal on Wednesday en route to the Gulf,
canal officials said.
	   Submarine USS Miami, missile launcher Gettysburg and supply ship
Detroit crossed early Wednesday, said the Suez Canal officials who
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Later this week, aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise, and a
destroyer will also pass through the canal, said the officials.
	   The ships were ordered to move to the Gulf to join the U.S.
naval force that was preparing to launch military strikes on Iraq.
The strikes were averted after Iraq accepted to resume cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors, in charge of destroying Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   There are already 23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to
174 aircraft, 21 ships, including nine armed with Tomahawk cruise
missiles, according to the Pentagon.

Albanian drug runners threaten police with grenade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two Albanian men transporting 103
kilograms (231 pounds) of marijuana were arrested in northern
Greece Wednesday after policemen were threatened with a hand
grenade, police said.
	   Three other men traveling with the Albanians in a car escaped
arrest. Police also confiscated six grenades and two assault
rifles.
	   The incident occurred outside the town of Trikala, when police
stopped to question the five men as they were repairing the car.
One man was apprehended immediately while the second threatened
police with a grenade. He was eventually persuaded to give himself
up after police fired warning shots.
	   Drug and weapons smuggling is widespread in neighboring Albania,
where arsenals were looted last year during a popular revolt and
parts of the country remain lawless.

EU Commission adopts new rules on working hours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday proposed new rules aimed at curbing long
working hours for junior doctors and transport workers.
	   The proposed measures extend most of the benefits of an 1993 EU
law setting a basic maximum working week of 48 hours in the
15-nation bloc to over five million workers.
	   The proposals on working hours must still be approved by EU
social affairs ministers, who will get a first chance of assessing
them at their regular meeting Friday.
	   ``It's an important day for millions of workers who were left
out of the initial directive,'' the EU's Commissioner for
Employment Padraig Flynn told a joint news conference with EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   The new rules would affect truckers, as well as workers in air,
rail and maritime transport.
	   The conditions for lorry and coach drivers would include a
maximum 48-hour week, averaged out over four months but never
exceeding 60 hours in any one week. ``The arrangement will help
save lives and prevent accidents,'' Kinnock said.
	   Asked whether non-EU truckers driving on EU roads will be
affected by the new rules, Kinnock said all road vehicles will be
subjected to random roadside checks. ``The origin of the driver is
not relevant,'' he said.
	   At the end of September the EU Commission began drawing up
legislation on working conditions for truckers after unions and
management failed to agree on limited driving time.
	   All the workers affected by the new proposals had been excluded
until now because of the difficulty of reconciling the hours
dictated by the nature of their jobs with the 1993 EU law for other
workers.
	   The proposals would make it illegal for junior doctors to work
more than 54 hours a week on average over a four-month period. But
the Commission is proposing to allow EU countries seven years to
implement the rules affecting doctors.
	   Under the 1993 Working Time Directive, EU workers should work no
more than 48 hours a week and get at least one day off a week. They
are entitled to four weeks of paid leave a year.

Earthquakes in Iran destroy houses, but no casualties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two earthquakes hit Iran on Wednesday,
destroying houses but inflicting no reported casualties.
	   The more powerful earthquake, which had a magnitude of 5.6,
wrecked buildings in six villages in the central Kerman province,
said an official of the Red Crescent Society, the Islamic
equivalent of the Red Cross. It struck in the morning when most
villagers were working in the fields, said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The Red Crescent has already dispatched tents, food and blankets
to the area.
	   Hours earlier, a quake of 4.6 magnitude hit the northwest
province of East Azerbaijan, Iranian radio reported. It did not
give further details.
	   On Friday, a temblor of magnitude 5.7 struck the southwest
province of Fars, causing homes to collapse and mud slides that
killed 5 people and injured about 100.
	   Iran is prone to earthquakes. In May 1997, a magnitude-7.1 quake
killed 1,500 people in the north. In June 1990, two quakes of
magnitudes 7.3 and 7.7 destroyed a northwestern town, killing
50,000 people.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila flew to
Angola on Wednesday for talks with President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos to discuss continued Angolan military support for fighting
rebels trying to oust the Congolese leader.
	   A revolt against Kabila, led by ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of the Congolese army and opposition politicians, has drawn
in many of Congo's neighbors, including Angola, which has provided
several thousand troops.
	   The Angolan forces played a key role in blocking a rebel
offensive in southwest Congo, near the border, soon after the
conflict erupted in early August.
	   However, the Angolan government is increasingly concerned about
the mounting threat at home from the former rebel group UNITA,
which recently attacked remote villages in contravention of the
country's 1994 peace pact, and unconfirmed reports say Luanda is
considering withdrawing its troops from Congo.
	   Kabila was scheduled to speak to reporters before leaving Luanda
later Wednesday.

French premier arrives for official visit

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ French Premier Lionel Jospin
arrives here Wednesday for a day of talks with Czech leaders EU
expansion and improving bilateral economic ties.
	   Jospin is expected to arrive in Prague late in the day,
accompanied by Foreign minister Hubert Vedrine, Defense minister
Alain Richard as well as a group of prominent businessmen.
	   He is hosted by Premier Milos Zeman. Jospin's schedule also
includes meeting with President Vaclav Havel and a lecture at the
Charles University.
	   The ongoing enlargement of the European Union will take center
stage throughout the visit _ the Czechs are among those favored for
membership in the first round of enlargement together with Poland,
Hungary and Slovenia.
	   Jospin arrives in Prague less than four months after the
country's early elections ended two years of political deadlock.
	   Zeman's center-left minority cabinet made a stability pact with
the main opposition party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus, making
steady European integration its main priority.
	   The emphasis is well placed _ recent EU reports blasted the
Czech Republic for slowing down reform over the last two years,
notably by not adopting enough legislation compatible with European
Union standards.
	   Lack of reform in the judicial system and regional
administration were among those issues most criticized by Brussels.
	   Czech politicians largely accepted the criticism, but some
voiced concerns new delays in European integration could be
dangerous.
	   ``Amid the technical ... and administrative matters ... the
historical purpose of the integration is being dangerously
forgotten,'' Havel said in an interview with the CTK news agency
last week.
	   Havel spoke in reference to a recent EU summit in Poertschach,
Austria, which indicated integration efforts could be delayed for
technical reasons.
	   Also, the change of government in Germany is seen by Czech
politicians to bring more ``caution and realism'' in the process,
as the so far unspecified date of EU enlargement draws nearer.
	   Speaking just days before Jospin visit, Havel urged France to
play a large role in the EU expansion process.
	   ``I think that France could be expected to bring a substantial
contribution (to integration) because it was France which
traditionally ... used to bring interesting spiritual thoughts and
visions to European history,'' Havel said.
	   French culture and language influenced the Czech and Slovak
upper classes in pre-war Czechoslovakia, laying foundations for
strong cultural ties before the 1948 Communist takeover.
	   Following the 1989 anti-Communist revolution, business with
France tripled over the last five years to approximately dlrs 2
billion in 1997.
	   Although 1997 is the first year when Czechs did more business
with France than Russia, economic ties with Germany clearly
dominate the country's foreign trade.

<TEXT>
	   KADENA AIR BASE, Okinawa (AP) _ Star-gazers across Asia huddled
outside in the predawn chill Wednesday to admire luminous flares of
red and white streaking through the skies during the greatest
meteor shower in decades.
	   NASA sent up research planes from this U.S. Air Force base in
southern Japan in an attempt to glean hints about the origins of
life on Earth and the planet's relationship to the cosmos.
	   From Thailand's highest peak to the neon-drenched streets of
Tokyo, people in Asia _ where the meteors burned brightest _ lifted
their eyes to a magnificent spectacle of nature as the storm
reached its climax in the direction of the constellation Leo.
	   ``It's wonderful,'' said Toshiaki Kogai, one of hundreds of
Japanese who watched the storm from a park just south of Tokyo. ``I
never imagined it would be like this.''
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to dim their lights to
enhance viewing of the storm, which peaks every 33 years.
	   In Kanagawa prefecture (state) near Tokyo, a 19-year-old trade
school student died when she fell off the handrail of a bridge to
the concrete below while trying to see the cascading stars with her
friends, police said.
	   Minori Suzuki fell 15 meters (50 meters) to her death when she
tried to grab her shawl as wind blew it away, they said.
	   Four other people died in traffic accidents on the way to or
from star-gazing throughout Japan, and another person died in an
accident caused by a driver distracted by the stars, Kyodo News
agency said.
	   A 21-year-old woman was reported slightly injured when she fell
into a smokestack from a dormitory roof in Tokyo, Kyodo said.
	   Tokyo police received more than 100 calls complaining about
noise made by the gazers and about their illegally parked cars, it
said. Tokyo police would not comment on the reports.
	   Although the night remained bright in the capital area, meteors
could be seen every two or three minutes at the height of the
shower.
	   Some appeared to fizzle as they fell. Others looked like moving
dots.
	   Each brought many a wish.
	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife out watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo
suburb of Yokohama.
	   In the United States, the best seats were wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest.
	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California early Tuesday were enthusiastic.
	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors. ``I could
see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the highway,''
she said.
	   One group was camping out in the Sandhills of central Nebraska,
getting away from city lights.
	   ``We're catching an average of two or three meteors a minute,
one of the best meteor showers I've seen in quite some time,''
Daniel Glomski said early Tuesday morning.
	   In northern Thailand, tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to
Doi Inthanon, the Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565
meters (8,464 feet), and Doi Suthep, another mountain with a famed
Buddhist temple on top.
	   But clouds and lightning hindered the viewing.
	   The view was clearer in Norway, where rescuers were swamped with
calls from people who spotted what they thought were red distress
flares fired from ships in trouble off the southern coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
	   NASA sent up two research planes to study the composition of
both comets and meteoroids _ and perhaps learn something about the
beginnings of life on Earth in the process.
	   ``We have a very unique opportunity here to get some information
about the way life may have arisen,'' said NASA astrobiology
specialist Gregg Schmidt.
	   Some scientists believe the elements necessary for life on Earth
may have been brought here by comets or meteorites.
	   The NASA planes will provide scientists with data to determine
the cosmic debris' molecular composition _ and find traces of any
organic material it may carry.
	   The shower is caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years, the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   NASA scientist Schmidt said the Leonid storm in 1833, for
example, packed as many as 10,000 meteors per hour.
	   ``The 1833 Leonid shower started a religious revival based on
what people saw,'' he said.

Taiwan says bond proposal still alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Taiwanese proposal to help
debt-laden Asian countries recover by reselling bonds has not been
dropped and may still be included in a debt-restructuring plan the
United States and Japan are putting together, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Chiang Pin-kung, head of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said the plan was not included
in a statement issued Wednesday by leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum because details still need to be worked
out.
	   But he said key countries had supported the plan, which would
organize a way to purchase and use existing bonds from troubled
countries as collateral for new debt.
	   ``Basically, I think we have had positive feedback from
Singapore and Japan. So I think this will be a very good basis to
work out the details,'' he told reporters after the end of the APEC
summit.
	   Chiang said Malaysian officials had met to discuss using the
debt vehicle to borrow fresh capital. Taiwan has pledged 25 percent
to back such a plan.
	   The Japan-U.S. announcement Monday of a dlrs 5 billion debt
restructuring plan raised questions of whether Taiwan's proposal
was still necessary.
	   Chiang said U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who unveiled the plan,
will consider other ``mechanisms'' to incorporate into the Japan
and U.S. plan.
	   ``The American and Japanese plan will serve as sort of an
umbrella,'' Chiang said.
	   Chiang said the APEC summit was an opportunity to meet with
Southeast Asian leaders and discuss ways to help them out of their
crisis. China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, objects
to Taiwanese officials conducting official exchanges that might
expand its diplomatic influence in the region. China insists that
all of Taiwan's aid be funneled through non-governmental channels.
	   ``Although China resists these efforts, we will keep trying
because it is important for us to help,'' Chiang said.
	   Chiang attended the summit in the place of President Lee
Teng-hui because of the diplomatic restrictions China demands.
	   APEC is one of the few international organizations in which both
China and Taiwan are members. It groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia,
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and
Vietnam.

Deputy prime minister says Turkish government will collapse over
</HEADLINE>
mafia scandal &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's deputy prime minister on
Wednesday said the government is going to collapse when it faces a
confidence vote next week prompted by a mafia scandal.
	   The crisis comes as Turkey is waging a diplomatic war with Italy
over Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan was arrested in
Rome, but Italy appears unlikely to grant Turkey's request for
extradition.
	   ``We have to freeze this government crisis. While this country
is waging a serious struggle abroad, it is in no one's interest the
pull the chair out from under the government,'' the daily newspaper
Milliyet said Wednesday.
	   But Deputy Prime Minister told a meeting of his Democratic Left
Party that the government's chances of survival are slim.
	   ``This government will probably fall next week,'' he said,
accusing the opposition parties who've asked for the confidence
vote of an ``irresponsible act.''
	   The minority coalition government faces three no-confidence
votes in parliament. Parliamentary proceedings begin Friday and a
final vote is expected next Wednesday.
	   The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of ties with
organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state
bank. He has denied the charges.
	   If the government falls, parties will have 45 days to try to set
up another coalition, but most analysts say a new coalition is
unlikely to secure a confidence vote in parliament.
	   If they fail, the president could appoint a caretaker government
to rule until the April 18 elections.
	   Ocalan is wanted on terrorist charges in Turkey, where he is on
trial in absentia for crimes punishable by death. Italian law
forbids extraditing anyone to a county where they face execution.
	   Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, has
asked Italy for political asylum. He said he has renounced
terrorism and is seeking to enlist European support in starting
negotiations with Turkey.
	   The PKK has been at war since 1984 with the Turkish army in
southeastern Turkey, where the rebels are fighting for Kurdish
autonomy. The conflict has killed about 37,000 people.

El-Bashir says U.S. missile attack helped Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The U.S. missile attack on a Sudanese
pharmaceutical factory three months ago has backfired on America
and brought blessings to the Sudanese government, President Omar
el-Bashir said Wednesday.
	   ``Despite the material and human losses caused by the American
strike ... as well as the receding of relations between Sudan and
America, it was the Sudan that has actually won, politically and
diplomatically,'' el-Bashir said in a speech to Parliament.
	   He added that the attack on the el-Shifa pharmaceutical factory
brought sympathy to the Sudanese people from Arab, Islamic and
world opinion.
	   European countries and the world ``have been witnesses to the
American arrogance and injustice in the form of its strikes on
el-Shifa medicines factory,'' he said.
	   The United States fired missiles at the factory in Khartoum on
August 20 to avenge the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that left 224 people dead, including 12 Americans. It
maintained the factory made components for chemical weapons, which
Sudan denies.

EU Commission bans Portuguese beef, cattle exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive agency
on Wednesday banned the export of beef and cattle from Portugal.
	   The action, which had been expected, prohibits the export of
beef from Portugal for nine months. The ban cattle exports is
indefinite, but it will be reviewed by the European Commission
after 18 months, at the latest.
	   The measures were taken because of a sharp rise this year in the
number of cases of ``mad cow disease'' _ or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy _ in cattle in Portugal this year. BSE in beef has
been linked to a fatal brain ailment in humans.
	   In 1997, Portugal exported a total of only about 3,100 metric
tons (3,400 US tons) of beef and live bovine animals, according to
the Commission. Of that, 1,500 tons (1,650 US tons) were beef
exports and 1,600 tons (1,750 US tons) were cattle exports.
	   Portugal has reported at least 67 cases of BSE this year,
according to the Commission. The total number of BSE cases that had
been reported in Portugal at the start of the year was 91.
	   Most of Portugal's beef exports go to neighboring Spain, which
in September banned the import of Portuguese beef, and Angola.

EU Commission clears Bayer takeover of Chiron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission on
Wednesday cleared the takeover of U.S. technology and drug company
Chiron Corp.'s clinical diagnostics division by German
pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG.
	   The EU Commission said in a statement the change would not
hinder competition in the relevant markets.
	   Under the terms of the deal, Emeryville, California-based
Chiron, will receive dlrs 1.1 billion from Bayer AG for its
in-vitro diagnostic business and will receive license fees and
royalties for HIV-related intellectual property.
	   Chiron will keep its profitable blood-screening business, which
last year recorded a dlrs 93 million operating profit.
	   The unit makes and sells blood chemistry tests and systems that
check tissue samples for infectious agents.
	   Chiron will have three remaining business units: one that
develops vaccines, a second that sells cancer treatments and a
third that uses genetic engineering techniques to develop new
drugs.

French police rally to protest rural station closings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with march starting, color &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Several thousand French police officers took to the
streets Wednesday to protest a government plan to close almost 100
rural police stations.
	   Officers from all over France started marching in the early
afternoon on Paris' Right Bank, waving banners reading ``Why change
a winning team?'' and ``Citizens, elected officials, police: all
together to maintain public order.''
	   Police unions said they expected 10,000 officers to march in the
protest, but official estimates on the number of marchers were not
immediately available.
	   Police are unhappy with a government plan to close 94 stations
in rural areas and replace officers with national paramilitary
police known as gendarmes.
	   According to the government plan, the rural police are to be
reassigned to troubled urban zones. A union spokesman said,
however, he feared the plan could lead to the eventual loss of
police jobs.

Hong Kong official criticizes government's Y2K preparation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government's actions to tackle the
``millennium bug,'' a computer glitch expected to emerge on Jan. 1,
2000, have not been comprehensive, coordinated or systematic, a
Hong Kong official said Wednesday.
	   There is a risk that many critical areas will not be able to
convert their systems in time, and that could threaten the
effective functioning of the global community, warned Director of
Audit Dominic Chan, the government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   The problem, also known as Y2K, affects many computers and
computer chips because they were programmed to recognize only the
last two digits of a year. Unless reprogrammed or replaced, they
may read 00 as 1900 when it should be 2000.
	   Of 74 government organizations affected by the problem, 40 were
still completing their impact assessments at the end of January and
three had not started, the radio reported.
	   In his report on the Y2K problem, Chan pressed the government to
take urgent action.
	   The government, however, said its Steering Committee on the Year
2000 Compliance had approached the problem in a coordinated and
comprehensive way.
	   A spokesman for the Information Technology and Broadcasting
Bureau said many of the findings of Chan's report had been
overtaken by the steering committee, which was established in
March.
	   Each government department had developed a Y2K compliance plan
and action timetable, the spokesman said.
	   ``We have set June 30, 1999, as the target date for government
departments to complete the rectification work for all
mission-critical systems,'' he said in a government statement.
	   As of September 1998, more than 80 percent of the government's
critical computer and embedded systems were Y2K compliant or were
rectified for the problem, he said.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ As fighting rages in northern
Afghanistan, the opposition alliance fighting the Taliban religious
militia stepped up rocket assaults on the beleaguered capital,
firing at least four rockets Wednesday into the airport.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   Shopkeepers nearby said they didn't see any casualties, but the
combined military and civilian airport is off limits to Kabul's
civilian population.
	   The rockets were fired from the north, where soldiers loyal to
opposition leader Ahmed Shah Massood are positioned.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army, which rules in 90 percent of the
country and has imposed its version of Islamic law, is trying to
gain full control, while the northern-based alliance is fighting to
preserve the 10 percent of the area they control.
	   Opposition soldiers say Taliban jets have pounded their area,
killing civilians, which the religious militia denies.
	   In recent weeks, the opposition fired rockets at the airport in
an apparent attempt to stop the aircraft from taking off. But so
far there has been little damage to the airport as a result of the
rockets, Taliban officials say.
	   There were no reports of damage to the airport in Wednesday's
attack and the roar of military cargo aircraft taking off from the
airport could be heard in the city.
	   The battlefield, barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the
city, has been relatively quiet in recent weeks.
	   Much of the fighting has been restricted to the northern Kunduz
and Takhar provinces where opposition soldiers are trying to push
their Taliban enemies out of areas they captured in recent months.

Dolly creators hope to clone pig
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ The scientists who helped create
Dolly the cloned sheep said Wednesday they are now trying to clone
a pig.
	   A project in the works by Roslin Bio-Med, a company formed in
April by the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, hopes to help solve a
worldwide shortage of donor organs. Cloning would allow pigs to be
modified genetically so their organs can be transplanted into
humans, the company said.
	   ``We are currently working hard to produce a cloned pig,'' said
Simon Best, its chief executive. ``Obviously, we have got some work
to do, but we are hoping we can do it within the next year or so.''
	   Unlike Dolly, who was cloned from an adult sheep in 1996,
scientists said they first will try to create a pig from fetal
tissue.
	   ``We are starting from an embryo cell because it is easier and
quicker,'' Best said. ``Once we have cloned from an embryo, we will
try to clone from an adult cell.''
	   Two groups in the United States also are working on pig cloning,
Best said.
	   ``When you are in a race, you cannot be absolutely certain of
being first, but we think we are well-placed,'' he said.
	   Pigs are being targeted because, although not a close genetic
relation to humans, their kidneys and hearts are similar in size
and structure.
	   ``Of all the animals available, they are the closest we can
find,'' Best said. ``Chimps are not as big as we are, and gorillas
are an endangered species.''

Russian water polo star attacked

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian water polo star Sergei Markoch was
assaulted on his way home from training, two weeks after an attack
on a soccer star in the same southern Russian city, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Unidentified attackers smashed a bottle over Markoch's head in
the entrance to his apartment building and robbed him Sunday in
Volgograd, about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Moscow,
the Noviye Izvestia newspaper reported.
	   Markoch, the former captain of the Russian water polo team and
now a leading player with Spartak Volgograd, suffered head and
internal injuries. But officials with Spartak Volgograd said he
would be able to play in the European Cup match Saturday, the
report said.
	   His colleagues dismissed it as a random robbery. Police are
investigating.
	   Markoch was a member of the bronze medal teams at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics and 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   On Oct. 29, an unidentified assailant splashed acid into the
face of Oleg Veretennikov, a leading soccer player with Rotor
Volgograd, while he was taking a walk with his daughter. He
suffered light burns. No one has been arrested in the case.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 4,000 student protesters marched
through the capital and laid flowers outside the gates of the
heavily guarded Parliament Wednesday in the largest anti-government
turnout since last week's deadly clashes with the military.
	   Later, police announced they had charged 10 opposition
activists, including two retired generals, with orchestrating last
week's violence in a plot to topple the government of President
B.J. Habibie. If convicted, they could be imprisoned for life.
	   More sedition charges could be laid against others, police said.
	   Two peaceful protests were held in downtown Jakarta Wednesday
after legislators inside Parliament started work on enacting
political reforms the students view as falling short of true
democratic reform.
	   Meanwhile, violent protest erupted in two provincial cities.
	   In the second largest city, Surabaya, police with sticks beat
student activists who forced their way into the governor's office.
	   In Ambon, 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) northeast of Jakarta,
about 40 people were injured when protesters and soldiers clashed.
Two military vehicles and a nightclub were set afire.
	   In Jakarta, rush-hour traffic was brought to a standstill when
about 2,500 students marched peacefully past hotels and office
buildings. They were blocked by about 100 army anti-riot officers
from proceeding to the National Monument near the presidential
palace.
	   To avoid a confrontation, the group headed toward Atma Jaya
University, where soldiers and police had opened fire on protesters
last Friday.
	   A separate group of about 1,500 demonstrators, riding in and
atop 15 buses, was blocked by soldiers. They were later allowed to
gather outside the Parliament building under a military escort.
	   Earlier, in a speech that opened a new session of the
legislature, Speaker Harmoko warned that any delay to the reform
process could ``trigger new problems'' in the sprawling Southeast
Asian nation, already beset by political and economic turmoil.
	   He said parliamentary elections in May or early June 1999 would
be ``based on honesty and justice, and would be direct, open to
all, free and secret.''
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired at protesters who tried to march on
Parliament. Others, including some police, died when rioting broke
out in parts of Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   Habibie has alleged that the student protests were orchestrated
by conspirators wanting to topple his 6-month-old government.
	   National police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said 10
opposition figures had been formally charged with attacking the
government. The 10 were not in custody, but had been banned from
leaving Indonesia.
	   The roundup is the first major crackdown on dissidents since
Habibie took office.
	   ``The accusations are a mere fabrication,'' said Lt. Gen. Kemal
Idris, a retired army general who was among those charged.
	   Friday's was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people
in May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   Cabinet Minister Adi Sasono said Wednesday that autopsies showed
some dead students had been killed by live ammunition.
	   ``Yes, they used real bullets,'' Adi said in an interview with
Dow Jones Newswires. ``I got a report from the doctors who carried
out autopsies ... and found there were real bullets used.''
	   This is despite assurances by the military that security
personnel had been issued only with plastic bullets and blank
ammunition.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto, who has ordered an inquiry,
took out advertisements in several national newspapers expressing
his ``sincere condolences'' for last week's deaths.
	   Opposition and students have demanded that Wiranto resign as
armed forces chief and defense minister in the wake of the
shootings.
	   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side and for
all the families that they left behind, may God give them patience
and strengthen their souls to face this hardest of situations,''
the advertisement said.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement to resume

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials resumed
long-suspended talks about a final peace treaty on Wednesday, while
snags threatened implementation of the Wye accord signed last
month.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon hosted Palestinian leader
Mahmoud Abbas in Jerusalem. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, said the
actual negotiations would probably begin ``in a week or ten days.''
	   The meeting was an indication that the peace process was moving
once again after a series of disputes.
	   But those disputes did not stop: The latest arose over the first
group of Palestinian prisoners that Israel was to release.
Palestinians complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were
ordinary criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an ongoing effort by Jewish settlers
to expand areas they control.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a hilltop Wednesday near
the West Bank settlement of Kedumim near Nablus. About 30 settlers
camped on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were establishing a
new community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill he and the others had occupied.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by building
access roads to settlements that would be surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after the Israeli withdrawals
under the Wye accord.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said the expansion of settlements and the confiscation of
Palestinian land ``cannot be accepted,'' adding that it ``is an
obvious violation of the agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps under the
Wye accord. A go-ahead from the Cabinet would set in motion an
Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, probably on
Friday.
	   By a wide margin, Israel's 120-member Knesset endorsed the
accord Tuesday, negotiated in a marathon summit at Wye Plantation
and signed at the White House Oct. 23. The dovish opposition Labor
Party provided the margin of approval in the 75 to 19 vote with
nine abstentions.
	   Most of the ``no'' votes came from Netanyahu's own coalition.
Five members of his Cabinet voted against the accord and others
were absent.
	   Right-wingers charged that the troop withdrawal endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. They also complained that the government
did not present detailed maps of areas to be handed over to the
Palestinians.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996.
	   The interim framework, including the Wye accord, is set to
expire on May 4, 1999.
	   ``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements,'' Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to rifles by Arafat, led to a
mini-crisis Monday. Netanyahu suspended Israel's withdrawal until
Arafat retracted the statement.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment
to negotiations as the only way to settle disputes with Israel. The
Israelis accepted this as a retraction and lifted their suspension
threat.
	   According to the Wye agreement, the first Israeli pullback
involves giving the Palestinians civilian rule over 2 percent of
West Bank land now under full Israeli control. Also, an area
amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank is to be transferred from
joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full Palestinian rule.

France refuses to extradite alleged British spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French appeals court on Wednesday rejected a
British request to extradite a former MI5 intelligence agent and
ordered David Shayler to be freed, judicial sources said.
	   Shayler, 32, faced being charged under Britain's Official
Secrets Acts if he had been deported by French authorities who had
arrested him on Aug. 1 at Scotland's Yard's request.
	   The British government alleges that Shayler sold information on
Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence agency to a London newspaper.
At the time of his arrest, Home Secretary Jack Straw said that
Shayler had access to highly sensitive information.
	   The French court's reason for letting Shayler go was not made
public. The former spy was to be released from French custody later
Wednesday, the judicial sources said.
	   Shayler was arrested in France after he reportedly considered
releasing information about an alleged British plot to kill Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, which the British government denies.
	   Shayler worked for MI5 internal security service from 1994 until
1997. He fled to France last year after selling stories about the
agency's operations to a British newspaper.
	   Libya also had asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Until his arrest, Shayler had been living with his girlfriend in
a remote part of rural France.

Indonesian police file charges against opposition activists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police formally charged 10
opposition activists Wednesday with orchestrating deadly student
protests in a plot to overthrow the 6-month-old government of
President B.J. Habibie, a police spokesman said.
	   The 10, including two retired army generals aged in their 70s,
could be imprisoned for life if convicted.
	   ``We have formally charged them for attacking the government,''
police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said.
	   Sedition charges could also be filed against other suspects, he
said.
	   Sixteen people, including eight students, were killed last week.
Security forces fired at protesters who tried to march on
Parliament, where a special government assembly was passing
political reforms on Friday. Student protesters say the reforms
fall short of true democracy.
	   Later others, including some police officers, died when rioting
broke out in parts of Jakarta. Hundreds were injured.
	   It was the worst violence since riots killed 1,200 people in
May, forcing then autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32
years in power.
	   The suspects were rounded up for questioning on the weekend. It
was the first crackdown on opposition figures since Habibie
replaced Suharto, his mentor.
	   ``The accusations are a mere fabrication,'' said Lt. Gen. Kemal
Idris, a retired army general and one of those charged.

Top Russian official warns of ``national catastrophe''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 15th graf with 8 billion rubles printed since
Oct. 1 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a mission of the International Monetary Fund
back in town Wednesday for talks on more loans, a top Cabinet
member warned that Russia is facing a ``national catastrophe.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov warned that inflation would
spiral out of control next year unless the government reaches an
agreement with its creditors to reschedule some of the dlrs 17
billion in foreign debt payments due in 1999.
	   ``If we succeed to restructure just a half of this amount, we
will manage to keep the impact on inflation and industrial output
within reasonable limits,'' he said in an interview with the
business daily Kommersant.
	   If the current government fails to stabilize the economic
situation, ``we will be facing a national catastrophe that would
write off the free-market economy, democracy and the territorial
integrity of Russia,'' he said.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. Last month, 42 million Russians, or 29 percent of the
population were living below the official poverty line of 644
rubles (just under dlrs 40), compared to 31 million (21 percent) a
year ago, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   The economy has continued to contract with industrial production
falling 11 percent last month, it said.
	   The Russian government has been pushing the IMF to release the
next installment of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion aid package, saying
more loans are vital to paying off huge domestic and foreign debts.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pushed for more IMF
loans at meetings this week with visiting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in Moscow and with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, where both men attended the annual Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Summit.
	   Primakov said he was satisfied with the talks, but there was no
sign that Washington or Bonn would back further international aid.
	   However, Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, who
accompanied Primakov, said the meeting with Gore ``significantly
advanced'' the Russian plea for more loans, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported on Wednesday.
	   The IMF has urged the Russian Cabinet to start implementing a
strict economic plan and put forward a realistic budget for next
year as the key condition for more loans. It has criticized the
government's economic plan, finally released last weekend after two
months of hesitation, as scarce on specifics and heavy on state
intervention in the economy.
	   The visiting IMF officials said they expected little from the
current round of talks.
	   Maslyukov said on Wednesday that the government will meet
Saturday to discuss key guidelines of next year's budget.
	   Despite IMF warnings against money printing, Russia has already
printed some cash to help its ailing banks and pay some debts.
Maslyukov said in the interview that the amount of new cash
wouldn't exceed 15-20 billion rubles (dlrs 800 million to 1.2
billion).
	   Yet Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that Russia
has already printed 8 billion rubles (dlrs 470 million) since Oct.
1, Interfax said.
	   Speaking at a Cabinet session on Wednesday, Maslyukov said the
Russian currency would remain relatively stable, within three to
four rubles of the current rate of 17 rubles to the dollar.
	   Addressing reporters later, he reiterated that the government
isn't planning to review privatization carried out by the previous
governments or renationalize any of privatized companies.
	   ``No one is planning to do this,'' he said. ``To whomever is
worried about plans for massive renationalization, (I can only say)
this won't take place.''

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases following ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday following a guerrilla
ambush near an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, security
officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the deserted
village of Aqmata, some 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of this
southern market town.
	   The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a stronghold of
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and is frequently used to
launch attacks against Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   The afternoon raid came a few hours after Hezbollah detonated a
roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was traveling near the
Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two miles) north of the
Israeli border.
	   Hezbollah, in a statement, said the bombing caused casualties
among the Israeli troops. But security officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said there was still no word of
causalities from the noontime attack.
	   The Israeli air attack comes at a time of heightened tension in
the volatile region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near the
Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   On Tuesday night, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile
at guerrillas who had attacked a military post in the occupied
zone. There were no casualties.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their Lebanese militia allies from the enclave Israel set up in
1985 to protect its northern territory from cross-border attacks.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Sharon, Abu Mazen
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials resumed
long-suspended talks about a final peace treaty Wednesday, while
snags threatened implementation of the Wye accord signed just last
month.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian negotiator
Mahmoud Abbas met at Israel's foreign ministry to discuss an agenda
for full-scale talks expected to begin by the end of the month.
	   ``We are starting today to negotiate the permanent agreement,''
Sharon told reporters. ``I think that we have to look to the
future. Looking to the past will not help us.''
	   Abu Mazen told reporters that he expected Israel to carry out
its first withdrawal under the Wye agreement on Friday.
	   ``Now we will discuss the future, and that is what is
important,'' he said.
	   Alone except for a translator, the two sat across from each
other in the second-floor of the barracks-like buildings in the
Foreign Ministry complex.
	   The final status negotiations are to deal with the question of
borders and Palestinian demands for statehood in addition to
refugees, water, Jewish settlements and the status of Jerusalem.

Philippine aid talks with Japan to begin next week, Estrada says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Philippines will begin
negotiations with the Japanese government next week on projects for
which it hopes to obtain funding from the Miyazawa fund, a dlrs 30
billion credit line for troubled Asian countries.
	   Estrada said he will place special emphasis on agricultural and
low-cost housing projects in seeking financing from the fund.
	   ``These are the priority projects,'' he told reporters at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Estrada said a dlrs 10 billion aid package unveiled by the
United States and Japan at the summit, coupled with the Miyazawa
fund and rescue packages led by the International Monetary Fund,
were positive developments in combating the economic turmoil that
has engulfed the Asia region over the past 16 months.
	   He said significant progress was made at the APEC summit in
advancing the Manila Framework, an agreement reached last November
in Manila to forge a cooperative effort to combat the crisis and
prevent future ones.
	   APEC, he said, had been ``strengthened'' by the willingness of
Japan and the United States to provide more financing to help
countries grappling with the crisis.
	   Estrada said a Japanese delegation will soon visit the southern
Philippine province of Mindanao to discuss development aid. Parts
of the region rank among the Philippines' poorest areas and have
been earmarked by Japan and other donor countries for special
attention for development financing.
	   Estrada rejected a suggestion that APEC was being fractured by a
political spat caused by U.S. Vice President Al Gore's expression
of support for Malaysia's reform movement.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu reiterated that
the Philippines has no intention of implementing currency controls,
but suggested that Malaysia's restrictions on the convertibility of
its currency, the ringgit, may have been the right solution for
that country's particular problems.
	   ``But it's not an option being considered by the Philippines,''
he said.
	   Espiritu said the call by APEC leaders in their joint statement
for a review of the practices of international credit rating
agencies was an issue that would be taken up by the group's finance
ministers.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Questions about human rights and
Malaysia's treatment of its jailed former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim dogged Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until the
final moments of a Pacific Rim summit Wednesday.
	   Brusque replies by Mahathir underlined the irritation of
Malaysian officials to the issues that sidetracked attention from
trade liberalization at the meeting of 21 world leaders.
	   When a reporter asked him whether his daughter's newspaper
column condemning an anti-homosexual movement had created tensions
in his family -- Anwar is on trial for homosexual acts -- Mahathir
snapped that he did not want to discuss family.
	   To a query about police violence, he said: ``If they
(demonstrators) beat up the police, are you expecting police to
submit to their beating?''
	   The United States' strong support for Anwar demonstrated by Vice
President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during
the summit angered Malaysia. Then the anti-government protests
embarrassed it.
	   On Wednesday, the final summit document did little to make
Mahathir feel better when it did not accommodate his strong views
on curbing currency trading. It rejected calls for stiffer
regulation of foreign exchange trading or new controls on the
movement of short-term capital.
	   But it did call for a review of the practices of international
credit rating agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days
that the agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries
arbitrarily, without proper review.
	   Mahathir said the statement had to focus on ``the central issues
that are of concern to all parties.''
	   ``I think it was a successful meeting.''
	   Mahathir denied that relations with the United States had
chilled after the APEC summit, during which Gore refused to meet
him.
	   But he refused to comment on Gore's speech that highlighted the
need for democracy and freedom of expression to make an economy
healthy. Gore snubbed Mahathir again by walking out of a dinner
after making the speech.
	   ``Whatever comments need to be made about the speech have been
made,'' he said, quickly moving on to the next question.
	   Asked about Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's refusal to
meet him over the same issue, Mahathir said: ``How could I meet all
the visiting leaders.''
	   Mahathir hit back as reporters persisted with questions about
Anwar and Malaysia's democracy.
	   ``A number of leaders did mention that the foreign media is
short on facts and more concerned with propagating their
viewpoints,'' he sniffed.
	   Mahathir said one leader told him ``I am surprised to see no
soldiers and tanks on the road. We were told by the press that the
place is, you know, in flames,'' he said.
	   He did not name the leader.

Rare violin fetches big money at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A rare 300-year-old Stradivari violin fetched
529,500 pounds (dlrs 884,000) at auction Wednesday.
	   The Joachim Kortschak, named after two of its previous owners,
was bought at Christie's by an anonymous telephone bidder, the
auction house said.
	   Christie's pre-sale estimate had been between 500,000 pounds
(dlrs 835,000) and 700,000 pounds (dlrs 1.2 million) following a
sale in April when the Kreutzer Stradivari sold for 947,000 pounds
(dlrs 1.6 million), making it the world's most valuable instrument.
	   The Joachim Kortschak, which had never before come to auction,
is in fine condition and ``an important example of the `long
pattern' Stradivari,'' the auction house said.
	   Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737) first won fame as an instrument
maker in the 1680s, and gained a reputation for experimenting with
new violin designs.
	   A total of 650 instruments made by him have survived, including
violins, violas, cellos and harps.

Germany commits soldiers to NATO force for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet
approved plans Wednesday to commit 250 German army soldiers to the
NATO ``extraction force'' being set up to protect unarmed observers
in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province.
	   The plan was expected to get the necessary parliamentary
approval on Thursday.
	   Parliament cleared the way last Friday for 350 German soldiers
and 16 unmanned spy planes to take part in NATO air surveillance
over Kosovo.
	   NATO's aim is to monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo and the safety of some 2,000 unarmed international
observers.
	   The 1,700-strong ``extraction force,'' intended to rescue the
observers if they run into trouble, is to be based in neighboring
Macedonia.

Editor and reporter from Benin daily jailed for defamation

<TEXT>
	   COTONOU, Benin (AP) _ The editor and a staff reporter from an
independent daily newspaper in Benin were sentenced to six months
in prison for defaming a former government minister, a court
official said Wednesday.
	   Maurice Chabi, the editor of Echoes of the Day newspaper and a
reporter, Pascal Zantou, were sentenced Tuesday after they were
found guilty of libel.
	   Chabi was sentenced in absentia and has been missing since the
verdict was announced earlier this week.
	   The newspaper earlier this year published a report that claimed
former Education Minsister Djidjoho Padonou has embezzeled state
funds.
	   The court said the claims were groundless and found both Zantou,
the author of the original article, and Chabi guilty of libel.

France set to introduce tough anti-doping law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the aftermath of the scandal-plagued Tour de
France, French lawmakers are expected Wednesday to pass one of the
world's toughest anti-doping laws.
	   The legislation would create a powerful doping prevention
committee, order federations to show that they are acting to stamp
out the use of illegal drugs, and punish individuals found
prescribing, supplying, facilitating or encouraging the use of such
substances.
	   Three legal experts, three medical or scientific representatives
and three sports officials would make up the nine-member committee.
	   It would have the power to impose specific penalties, and
stiffen sanctions where it believes that sports federations have
failed to crack down on doping.
	   The credibility of the system rests not only on its ability to
test individual athletes, but also to control federations that are
too lax, said Jean-Claude Nery, an official at the Culture
Ministry.
	   Under the bill, adopted by the French Senate in May and expected
to be passed by the National Assembly on Wednesday, the Ministry of
Sports will have the right to carry out raids on premises and order
athletes to undergo medical examinations.
	   Sports federations must also discipline offenders and make an
official report on infractions within five months of an offense.
	   Furthermore, the government will only issue sports licenses to
authorities that have a certificate showing that they are combating
doping.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight
against doping her central policy since coming into office in June
1997, admits that clamping down on doping will be a long, hard
struggle.
	   ``It will need a battle from day to day to reverse the flow,''
Buffet said before presenting the bill.
	   ``We cannot believe that once the law has been passed and
applied, we have dealt with the problem,'' she said.
	   Buffet also said that she would give details of the law to the
next meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in an
attempt to promote a more coherent international anti-doping
policy.
	   The doping controversies at the Tour de France, during which the
Festina team was expelled for admitting to the use of the
performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO), gave new impetus
to the fight against banned drugs in France.
	   But other sports have also been hit by drug scandals.
	   In 1997, former soccer internationals Cyrille Pouget and Vincent
Guerin, as well as Antoine Sibierski and Dominique Arribage, were
suspended after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid
nandrolone.
	   Stephane Paille, who plays for Scottish team Heart of
Midlothian, was suspended after testing positive for amphetamines.
	   And French international goalkeeper Bernard Lama was suspended
from his club Paris-Saint Germain after testing positive for
cannabis.

Ukrainian police detain armed conscripts who fled army unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police have detained two armed
soldiers who fled from their military unit last week after stealing
weapons and ammunition, newspapers said Wednesday.
	   Oleh Korniyenko and Roman Bebeshko were detained on a highway 30
kilometers (18 miles) from the northeastern city of Sumy, where
their military garrison is based, the daily Den said.
	   The 19-year-old conscripts deserted their unit on Nov. 8 with
two Kalashnikov rifles, two bayonets and four empty magazines. They
face up to five years in prison if convicted.
	   They told investigators they wanted to earn money from selling
the stolen weapons and ammunition and then become mercenaries, the
daily Fakty reported.
	   Cases of conscripts fleeing from the Ukrainian armed forces,
like those in neighboring Russia and other former Soviet republics,
have become common recently.
	   Last week, a 19-year-old soldier deserted his garrison in the
eastern city of Poltava and shot himself to death several hours
later after he was surrounded by fellow soldiers pursuing him.
	   The Ukrainian army, hit by the country's continuing economic
decline, suffers from poor living conditions, chronic shortages of
funds and supplies, and brutal hazings inflicted on young
conscripts by older soldiers.

Economists warn German government on deficit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with more detail, RECASTS &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government
faces a weakening economy which it so far hasn't done much to
boost, the government's council of economic advisers said Wednesday
in an often critical report.
	   Global economic instability and uncertainty at home about the
government's plans are the twin risks facing the Europe's biggest
economy, the panel said.
	   ``We don't expect a fundamental worsening in the economy, but
with the risks there are, development will be noticeably weaker,''
the report said.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the report ``helpful.'' He
jokingly defended his government, saying it hadn't gotten the
customary 100 days to get its agenda under way since taking office
Oct. 27
	   ``We're really proud that we're considered so good that the
grace period was shortened to suit us,'' Schroeder said as he
received the report in Bonn.
	   Schroeder said he was pleased the report had praised his
government's pet project _ round-table talks with industry and
labro to brainstorm on cutting unemployment _ and a planned tax on
energy, which many industry leaders have sharply criticized.
	   Germany's economic growth will slow to an estimated 2 percent in
1999, from 2.75 percent this year, the report said.
	   It described Germany's jobs situation as ``dramatic'' with
unemployment at 10.1 percent.
	   But it warned against the government's plan to stimulate the
economy with more generous monetary and fiscal policies, saying
that only long-term, pro-market reforms could get the huge base of
jobless back to work.
	   Germany already faces the risk of higher budget deficits after
Europe's single currency kicks in, the panel said.
	   Failure by Schroeder to cut costly social welfare programs would
reverse a trend of falling deficits pushed through in Germany to
help make the euro a stable currency for its Jan. 1 debut, it said.
	   Germany's budget deficit will be 1.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year, dropping to 1.8 percent in 1999, the report
said. But the panel said the trend won't hold, citing Germany's
costly social safety net.
	   Schroeder's government had failed to make clear how it will meet
promises for rigor in government spending, the report said.
	   Government actions so far _ including pressure on central
bankers to lower interest rate and attempts to increase Germans'
spending power with tax cuts _ were ``not designed to counter
uncertainty among investors and consumers.''
	   ``Financial policy therefore is not making the necesary
contribution to a stabilization of expectations,'' the report
added.
	   The panel warned against attempts by the Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine to persuade the new European Central Bank, which is
launching the euro, to deviate from its strict path of low
inflation and price stability.
	   Lafontaine wants the bank to help governments fight flagging
growth and high joblessness by cutting interest rates.
	   A more expansive monetary policy could lead to higher money
market rates and destabilize the economy, whereas the ECB would win
trust in the new currency by providing a stable environment, the
report said.

Government accuses defiant Lords of abusing power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Commons debate starts 1600 GMT; timing of Lords vote
uncertain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Already under a political death sentence in its
present form, Britain's unelected House of Lords has repeatedly
blocked a bill to change the voting system for European Parliament
elections in what the Labor Party government calls ``an abuse of
power.''
	   The Lords were expected to reject the bill for the fifth
straight time Wednesday in an unprecedented show of defiance that
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government blames on hereditary peers _
aristocrats who overwhelmingly support the opposition Conservative
Party.
	   Another defeat would kill the bill and would be used by Labor as
a major argument for its plan to abolish the 600-year-old right of
hereditary peers to vote in the Lords.
	   ``This issue is no longer about the best electoral system to
vote for the European Parliament,'' Home Secretary Jack Straw said
after the Lords rejected the bill by a 261-198 vote Tuesday night.
	   ``It is about the right of unelected hereditary peers _
accountable to no one but the Tory party _ to frustrate the
government's program,'' Straw said.
	   The current parliamentary session ends this week and Queen
Elizabeth II is due to open the new session Tuesday by reading out
the legislative program for the coming year _ likely to include a
bill to strip the hereditary peers of voting rights.
	   The government can get a measure rejected by the Lords passed
automatically in the next session of Parliament.
	   But Straw said reintroducing the bill in the new session would
be too late to set up the voting system _ which critics say gives
too much power to party machines _ for European Parliament
elections in July.
	   The new system, involving constituency boundary changes, could
not be in place until 2004 elections.
	   Conservative opponents of the bill, both lifetime and hereditary
peers, are supported by dozens of peers with no party affiliation,
some Labor rebels, and senior Church of England bishops who have
seats in the upper chamber.
	   But Blair's aides said that without the votes of Tory hereditary
peers, the measure would have passed by 36 votes on Tuesday.
	   The bill provides that instead of voting for a single candidate
in each district, voters choose a party. The party would then
allocate seats to its nominees, with the number of seats based on
the proportion of the overall vote won by each party.
	   The system is used in several European countries. But British
opponents say the measure deprives voters of the right to choose a
candidate and allows party apparatchiks to control who gets
elected.

Nearly 2,000 Ukrainian teachers go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 20,000 schoolchildren missed
their classes Wednesday because of a teachers' strike over unpaid
salaries in four regions of Ukraine, officials said.
	   Strikes involving 1,806 teachers were reported at a total of 59
schools in the Crimea, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kirovohrad and Ternopil
regions, the Education Ministry said. Teachers in other regions of
the country were prepared to join the strike, it added.
	   Earlier this fall, about 12,000 schoolchildren in Ukraine missed
several weeks of school because of a strike by teachers demanding
back wages.
	   Wage debts have only mounted since the start of the school year
on Sept. 1, the ministry said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Ukrainian teachers are owed 428 million hryvna (dlrs 125 million
at the current exchange rate) in back wages. In the Kirovohrad and
Ternopil regions, their salaries have not been paid for six to
seven months.
	   The former Soviet republic's economic troubles are affecting
many of the country's 500,000 teachers at Ukraine's 21,260 schools.
Education officials say wages are being paid more or less regularly
only around Kiev, the capital, and two other regions.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A putrid smell drifts around a torn
bag of plastic dinosaurs, pulled from the dirt of the hillside.
Then a headless rag doll emerges. The family must be close.
	   Barry Sessions scrapes away damp earth with his trenching tool
and uncovers a bag of baby clothes. A tiny sky-blue knit vest hangs
out. Evidence of a life blinked out by Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``It was a mother, a grandmother and four children. They slept
in the same bed, like piglets,'' he says. That bit was learned from
the neighbors, who managed to escape Mitch's wrath.
	   Sessions is one of 10 volunteers from England's Rescue and
Preparedness in Disasters, or RAPID, a group sponsored by performer
Norman Wisdom. They are helping Honduras dig out from the storm
that killed some 10,000 people in Central America.
	   About 60 of them are buried here in the district of Nueva
Esperanza. The name is Spanish for New Hope, but there is none, not
any more.
	   Mitch dumped nearly 3 feet (a meter) of rain on the country,
causing hillsides to slip away and swallowing up whole families and
their houses. After two weeks, the chances that anyone is still
alive are zero.
	   But the digging doesn't stop. Relatives want to give family
members a decent burial, or simply to have proof, rather than
lingering doubts. Many come to thank the volunteers. It's small
consolation.
	   A large boulder blocks the way. Mike Holyhead of Forest of Dean
works it loose with a portable winch, and the rock crashes down the
hillside to the muddy waters of the Choluteca River far below.
	   The have no heavy equipment. What the diggers give up in power,
they gain in mobility _ everything can be hand-carried and loaded
at a moment's notice.
	   The smell gets stronger, and the men pull on surgical masks.
When the spade turns up a nest of maggots, they go slow. It seems
they're getting close.
	   They found one baby a day earlier, then the body of the mother.
	   Team leader Sessions has been at this for years _ more than he
cares to say. From Peru to Iran to Japan, he's been there and done
that. But he never has seen anything like Mitch. No one has.
	   ``It's so big, you don't know where to start,'' he said. ``You
go by smell. And you don't need a dog.''
	   The digging takes them perilously under an shelf of rock and
loose dirt, but they keep going. Snakes, spiders and scorpions are
a constant hazard.
	   A Honduran policeman shouts that boulders may be loose up above,
and he gives the drill. ``If you hear a whistle, jump, um ... that
way,'' he says, pointing. The plan sounds precarious at best.
	   For all the danger and lack of pay, the personal rewards here
are small.
	   ``We take unnecessary risks to reach people,'' said Sessions, a
Devon native. ``But when you find someone alive, when you've scored
one, that makes it all worthwhile.
	   ``Here, there's no one alive. And when you find a child's body,
it tears you to pieces.'' He breaks off, his eyes moist.
	   They don't find one today. The spades dig through the area the
suspect area and hit rock. The contamination was from another body,
perhaps the mother. The search goes on.
	   ``We're just ordinary blokes doing ordinary jobs,'' says
Sessions. ``People allow as you're more than you are, but you're
just doing a job that needs to be done. And when you can't find
them, you just feel useless.''
	   Paul Minshull, 23, of Devon is a newcomer to RAPID. After two
years in training, this is his first oversees assignment. He likens
his job to a calling.
	   ``If you asked me why I do it, I couldn't explain,'' he said.
``I just know it feels right.''

	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Moldova's Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc was
taken suddenly to the hospital for treatment for an illness that
government officials declined to name, his office said Wednesday.
	   Ciubuc, 55, was brought to the hospital by ambulance Tuesday.
Some media reports in this former Soviet republic said he had a
heart attack, though his office would not comment on the
speculation.
	   Ciubuc canceled a visit to Croatia for a meeting of Central
European leaders scheduled for Nov. 20-21. His deputy Ion Sturza
will replace him.
	   Ciubuc's government on Friday survived a no-confidence vote in
parliament. Moldova is suffering a severe economic decline
following the crisis in Russia, its main trading partner.

	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Undeterred by cloudy skies and
disappointing results the previous night, visitors and residents of
this northern city headed up mountains Wednesday evening hoping for
the best view of a once-in-a-generation spectacle of shooting
stars.
	   Throughout Asia, the hoped-for Leonids meteor storm Tuesday
night turned out to be a minor shower, with more fizzle than sizzle
for people who stayed up in many cases until the break of dawn.
	   Wednesday night promised the third and final chance to observe a
grand show, although minor meteors showers should continue for
several more days.
	   Hong Kong police also were bracing for another batch of hopeful
star gazers, but cloudy weather was threatening to dash their
hopes.
	   They estimated some 30,000 people had fled the city lights and
headed to the south side of Hong Kong island Tuesday night to try
for a glimpse of the meteor shower. Traffic jams clogged roads
leading to viewing points and police were forced to close some
roads, but cloudy skies blocked views of the shower of cosmic dust.
	   Insufficient public transportation left many with no choice but
to walk home early Wednesday, Hong Kong media reported.
	   In Thailand, the numbers of sky watchers Wednesday appeared to
be much reduced from Tuesday, which experts had touted as the best
day for observation.
	   The showers are caused by the earth's passage through the long
tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. It is called the Leonid shower
because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the
constellation Leo.
	   Though the Leonids occur every November, they are usually not
particularly spectacular. But every 33 years, the comet speeds
through the inner solar system and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the sun.
	   Some 20,000 people Tuesday night visited the national park at
Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest mountain near Chiang Mai, but few
shooting stars could be observed, and clouds obscured half the sky
much of the night. Only 300 had come to the park by early Wednesday
night, and the weather prospects again appeared poor.
	   ``I don't want to call it a disappointment,'' said Malee
Arunpairog, 66, a mother of three on vacation with a friend. ``This
was an opportunity to get together with eight other friends. It's
nature and there's nobody to blame. I'm just glad it didn't rain on
us.''
	   In Singapore, 35,000 people lent a party atmosphere to the
meteor show as they crowded on to the equatorial city-state's
resort island in the early hours of Wednesday.
	   Although only a handful of shooting stars were sighted, and the
view was mostly obscured by cloud cover and light pollution.
	   Vietnamese scientists at Hanoi's Dich Vong astronomical
observatory post could see a few of the Leonids for 15 minutes
shortly after midnight Tuesday, the Afternoon News reported.
	   Hazy skies in the east largely prevented Vietnamese spectators
from seeing the meteor shower, the paper said.
	   In Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, public offices and
private businesses heeded a government plea to dim their lights to
enhance viewing of the storm.
	   ``It's wonderful,'' said Toshiaki Kogai, one of hundreds of
Japanese who watched the storm from a park just south of Tokyo. ``I
never imagined it would be like this.''
	   In Kanagawa prefecture (state) near Tokyo, a 19-year-old trade
school student died when she fell off the handrail of a bridge to
the concrete below while trying to see the cascading stars with her
friends, police said.
	   Four other people died in traffic accidents on the way to or
from star-gazing throughout Japan, and another person died in an
accident caused by a driver distracted by the stars, Kyodo News
agency said.
	   A 21-year-old woman was reported slightly injured when she fell
into a smokestack from a dormitory roof in Tokyo, Kyodo said.
	   Tokyo police received more than 100 calls complaining about
noise made by the gazers and about their illegally parked cars, it
said. Police would not comment on the reports.
	   Though the night remained bright in the capital area, meteors
could be seen every two or three minutes at the height of the
shower.
	   In the United States, the best seats were wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest.
	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California early Tuesday were enthusiastic.
	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors. ``I could
see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the highway,''
she said.

US trade representative blasts Japan ahead of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from a Japanese official
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. trade officials expressed
outrage Wednesday over Japan's refusal to lower trade barriers,
describing Tokyo's behavior as inexcusable and pledging the issue
would be raised during President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit.
	   Clinton's official visit to Japan Thursday comes on the heels of
a Pacific Rim economic summit in Kuala Lumpur, where the United
States and Japan took opposite sides in a bitter trade dispute.
	   American officials had hoped to reduce or eliminate tariffs on
dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of trade, but failed to forge a pact
covering nine industries because of opposition from Japan to
lowering border taxes on two of them, fish and wood products.
	   Before leaving Malaysia at the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit on Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky told reporters that ``Japan refused to exercise
any leadership and that is inexcusable. ... It is an unconscionable
outcome.''
	   Although other APEC members objected to the risks of the tariff
cuts in the face of the economic crisis, Japan's refusal to open
two sectors that are politically sensitive back home derailed the
pact.
	   In the end the group decided to pass it along to the 124-nation
World Trade Organization in Geneva, where they hope to attract
other countries to sign on to the tariff cuts so they can begin to
be implemented.
	   And Barshefsky suggested she would raise the tariff issue again.
	   ``Japan was isolated, and Japan will be called to account,'' she
told reporters.
	   Clinton leaves Washington early Wednesday on a six-day journey
to Japan, South Korea and Guam. He had planned to begin that trip
in Malaysia at the APEC summit, but had to send U.S. Vice President
Al Gore in his place because of the U.S.-Iraq standoff.
	   For its part, Japan seems to be tired of talking about trade.
	   The trade dispute ``is not the only issue in Japan-U.S.
relations,'' said Sadaaki Numata, spokesperson for Japan's Prime
Minister.
	   Sadaaki said Japan will explain to Clinton what it is doing to
deal with the Asian economic crisis.
	   Japan's own economic policy will also be on the agenda when
Clinton meets with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Obuchi told a group of Asian leaders Wednesday
that there is no reason to worry about Japan's economy, even though
many forecasters say it's unlikely to grow at all this year.
	   ``Japan's individual savings are high, and its foreign reserves
are big. I want others not to worry at all,'' Obuchi was quoted as
saying by a Japanese government official.
	   The prime minister sought to reassure the leaders that a 24
trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) package of new spending and tax
cuts, unveiled Monday, would lift Japan out of its deepest
recession since World War II.
	   ``Japan's recovery and aid are vital to Asian economies,''
Obuchi told reporters just before boarding a flight bound for
Tokyo.
	   Japan accounts for more than two-thirds of the region's economic
power.
	   Critics worry the package may not be as effective as the
government hopes. Japan has implemented seven previous stimulus
plans, but the economy has been stagnant for much of the past five
years.
	   Obuchi also sought to assure the leaders that Japan is doing its
part to lead the region out of its economic crisis by reminding
them of his country's pledge to provide dlrs30 billion in aid to
ailing Asian economies.

Court throws out actor's lawsuit against unauthorized biography
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Paris court on Wednesday threw out a lawsuit by
actor Alain Delon who was trying to ban publication of a still
unwritten unauthorized biography.
	   Delon, not present at Wednesday's hearing, won a temporary court
order in August to have the planned biography by Bernard Violet
banned pending further hearings.
	   Delon was also seeking 400,000 francs (dlrs 71,400) in damages.
	   But Wednesday's court ruling said a ban on an unwritten work
would run contrary to freedom of expression. It said that the final
contents of the book ``remained uncertain.''
	   A French magazine in August published court papers citing a
synopsis of the book, prompting Delon to seek a court order to
remove the magazine _ Marianne _ from newsstands. He failed.
	   Delon, who has seen the book synopsis, accused the author of
being a ``spelunker of the garbage can'' in his bid to get
information for the book.
	   Among the details in Marianne were Delon's alleged youthful
dalliances with other actors or actresses and reported ties to
shady politicians, mafia figures and mercenaries.
	   The book's publisher, Editions Grasset, had criticized the
original court ban, complaining of creeping censorship. It had no
immediate comment Wednesday on the court ruling.
	   Now 63, Delon was for decades a dashing screen idol in dozens of
movies including ``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers.''
	   Violet, a former reporter for French television, has written 10
other investigative books. Among them: biographies of the terrorist
Carlos, convicted Vichy official Maurice Papon, oceanographer
Jacques Cousteau, and a look at France's secret services under the
late President Francois Mitterrand.

U.S. poll shows two thirds of Croats want new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An overwhelming majority of Croats favor
a change of government, according to a poll run by IRI _ a U.S.
public opinion institute.
	   The poll, performed on 2,040 respondents eligible for voting who
answered a total of 88 questions, showed that 67 percent of voters
believe the ruling Croatian Democratic Union should be removed from
power.
	   In all, the opposition would muster 36 percent of the vote,
while the ruling party would have to make do with 21 percent, a
drop of 18 percent since the 1995 elections, according to the
International Republican Institute survey carried Wednesday by the
independent daily Jutarnji List.
	   The results were encouraging to the opposition who have been
calling for early elections amid a host of political scandals and
worsening social hardship.
	   The Social Democratic Party had the most reason to exalt over
the survey as it placed them on par with the ruling party with 21
percent, a fitting reward for their key role in recent weeks to
unite the usually fragmented and weak opposition.
	   The party did well in a hypothetical race for the presidency,
which is not due until 2003. However, a staggering 44 percent were
still unsure as to who should replace incumbent Franjo Tudjman, who
is in his final term.
	   Designed to gauge the pulse of citizens in foreign countries,
IRI opened its office in Zagreb earlier this year. The latest poll
is believed to be one of the most comprehensive and impartial
indicators of political will in Croatia.
	   General elections are not scheduled until the end of 1999, but
Tudjman's party may be forced to call early elections, with their
popularity rapidly sagging.

India, Pakistan to play field hockey series in February
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Traditional rivals India and Pakistan
will play a ten-match field hockey series in February next year, a
domestic news agency said Wednesday.
	   Dates for the matches will be finalized later this week during
Indian officials' meetings with Pakistan Hockey Federation
president Akhtar Rasool who arrives in New Delhi on Thursday,
United News of India reported.
	   Five matches each are likely to be played in both countries, the
news agency said quoting K.P.S. Gill, who heads the Indian Hockey
Federation. The first five matches will be held in India.
	   The two sides played an eight-match series in India and Pakistan
before huge crowds earlier this year, with Pakistan winning 4-3
with a game drawn.
	   Field hockey, like cricket, is hugely popular in both India and
Pakistan but matches between the two sides are often laced with
bitterness because of the 50-year enmity between New Delhi and
Islamabad.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947, when they
gained freedom from colonial British rule.

SAfrican Cabinet approves big military procurement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Cabinet gave preliminary
approval Wednesday to a major defense procurement package,
including the purchase of 28 Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British
Aerospace of Sweden and England.
	   The package includes three submarines and four corvette warships
from German consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from Italian
manufacturer Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from BAe.
	   The government said the finance minister and a Cabinet
subcommittee would carry out further negotiations with the
suppliers to finalize the deals.
	   The contracts have attracted intense bidding from international
manufacturers despite strings attached. The government is requiring
that countries wishing to sell weapons must invest an amount equal
to the purchase price into high technology industry here.
	   The defense purchases would be South Africa's largest since the
fall of the heavily militarized apartheid state in 1994.
	   The government placed the costs of the Gripen jets at 10.875
billion rand (dlrs 1.91 billion), the largest component of the
procurement.
	   The price of the corvettes was 6 billion rand (dlrs 1.05
billion), and 5.212 billion rand (dlrs 914.4 million for the subs,
4.728 billion rand (dlrs 838.6 million) for the Hawks, and 2.168
billion rand (dlrs 380.4 million) for the Agusta helicopters.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases following ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday after an ambush near an
Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the deserted
village of Aqmata, some 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of this
southern market town.
	   The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a stronghold of
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and is frequently used to
launch attacks against Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   The afternoon raid came a few hours after Hezbollah detonated a
roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was traveling near the
Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two miles) north of the
Israeli border.
	   Hezbollah, in a statement, said the bombing caused casualties
among the Israeli troops. But security officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said there was still no word of
causalities from the noontime attack.
	   The Israeli air attack comes at a time of heightened tension in
the volatile region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near the
Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   On Tuesday night, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile
at guerrillas who had attacked a military post in the occupied
zone. There were no casualties.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their Lebanese militia allies from the enclave Israel set up in
1985 to protect its northern territory from cross-border attacks.

Lights flicker around Malaysia due to major power outage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A major power failure hit much of
Malaysia on Wednesday, cutting off electricity for 30 minutes or
more in some areas.
	   Nine of the 10 states in peninsular Malaysia were affected by
the power failure during the afternoon, said a statement from
Tenaga Nasional, the national power utility company.
	   Certain areas were hit for more than two hours, Tenaga said.
	   ``Efforts are under way to have power fully restored as soon as
possible,'' the statement said, adding that electricity had been
restored to 80 percent of the affected areas.
	   Tenaga said the states that experienced the power breakdown were
Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Kelantan, Perak, Pulau Pinang, Negeri
Sembilan, Johor, Terengganu and Melaka.
	   The scale of the power failure Wednesday ranks it with two
incidents in 1992 and 1996.
	   Following a nationwide power failure in 1992, the monopoly of
Tenaga Nasional in producing electric power for the country was
broken.
	   The government allowed establishment of a number of independent
power producers. Tenaga Nasional, however, still maintains the
monopoly in the distribution of electricity.

Cambodian general who resisted coup won't regain old job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The top general of resistance forces
loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh will not be given back his
position in the Cambodian military, the prince said Wednesday.
	   Speaking to reporters on his return from a brief trip to
Bangkok, Ranariddh said resistance general Nhek Bunchhay could not
legally reclaim his position as the second-ranking general in the
army despite being pardoned for treason last week.
	   ``Nhek Bunchhay cannot be a deputy chief of staff anymore,
according to the law,'' Ranariddh said without elaborating.
	   Nhek Bunchhay led royalist forces that were forced to flee from
Phnom Penh by strongman Hun Sen's army last year when Ranariddh was
ousted as co-prime minister in a violent coup.
	   The general led a controlled retreat to the mountainous
Thai-Cambodian border, where his troops dug in and fought the
stronger government army to a stalemate.
	   A military court convicted Nhek Bunchhay and fellow resistance
army commander Serey Kosal in March this year of threatening
national security, disobeying orders and forming an illegal armed
insurgency.
	   The court also convicted Ranariddh of treasonous crimes, but he
was quickly pardoned as part of an internationally brokered deal to
bring opposition politicians back to Cambodia for a July election.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election,
but Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party finished a close second and forced
Hun Sen to compromise in the formation of a new government.
	   After a lengthy stalemate, the two parties agreed last week to
join in a coalition government with Hun Sen as prime minister.
Ranariddh was promised the presidency of the National Assembly,
despite the CPP's majority in parliament.
	   As part of the deal, Ranariddh also won pardons for Nhek
Bunchhay and Serey Kosal, as well as an agreement to reintegrate
his loyalists into the Cambodian army.
	   The prince said Wednesday that Nhek Bunchhay was pleased with
the lifting of his sentence and had written letters of thanks to
King Norodom Sihanouk, who granted the pardon, and Hun Sen.
	   Nhek Bunchhay could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
However, the general did not appear excited when the pardons were
announced last Friday.
	   ``It's nothing special for me because I never recognized the
verdicts,'' the general said.
	   Serey Kosal, speaking by telephone from Bangkok, said Wednesday
that he must accept whatever deal Ranariddh has made with Hun Sen.
	   ``I cannot object to what has been decided by the boss,'' said
Serey Kosal, a former provincial deputy governor.
	   ``I'm not asking for any position. I will accept whatever he is
pleased to give me if he still has in mind considerations about
people who have been loyal to him,'' he said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's oil revenue for 1998 is expected to be 45
percent lower than last year, the state-run news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Kuwaiti oil sources told the agency that the country's oil had
fetched an average price of a dlrs 10 a barrel this year, making
for projected earnings of dlrs 7.3 billion (2.2 billion dinars) for
the whole year.
	   Last year Kuwait sold its oil at an average price of dlrs 18 a
barrel.
	   The small Gulf state was now selling oil at dlrs 8.5 a barrel,
the Kuwait News Agency said.
	   The sources said the oil market was saturated. Members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a cartel to which
Kuwait belongs, as well as non-member producers would ``take
various steps'' to raise prices. They did not elaborate.
	   Oil is the mainstay of Kuwait's economy. Oil minister, Sheik
Saud al-Sabah, has been campaigning to raise prices.
	   Calculated at dlrs 12 a barrel, the government foresees a net
deficit of 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.35 billion) for fiscal
1998-99 that started July 1.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The French corporation Lafarge has bought
33 percent of the Jordan Cement Factories Co., but it will not be
represented on the privatized company's board of directors, the
director of the Amman stock exchange said Wednesday.
	   Lafarge presented the highest bid to buy 20 million shares of
Jordan Cement for 72 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 101.4 million),
said Tayseer Abdul-Jaber.
	   The government owned 49.3 percent of the country's sole cement
producer, which is Jordan's third largest firm after the potash and
phosphate companies. The rest is owned by private shareholders.
	   Abdul-Jaber said the deal, which was concluded Tuesday, allows
Lafarge to enjoy all the rights of a shareholder, except
management.
	   The Jordanian government is sensitive about foreign firms owning
the country's largest concerns.
	   It is thought that Lafarge agreed to these terms because Jordan
Cement turns a healthy profit. Its after-tax profits were in the
range of dlrs 20 million last year.
	   Plans to sell the firm to a foreign investor surfaced in 1996
after suggestions from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, which are supervising Jordan's economic reforms. The
country is burdened by dlrs 6.3 billion of foreign debt.
	   Jordan Cement, with a capital of 85 million dinars (dlrs 119.7
million), owns two factories that produce a total of 4.2 million
tons of cement each year.
	   Its exports are estimated at one million tons a year, and are
bought by Malaysia, Mauritius, the Palestinian territories, Saudi
Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Syria and Yemen.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Gulf Air will begin operating direct
flights from the United Arab Emirates to three Pakistani cities by
New Year, the airline said Wednesday.
	   The twice-a-week flights to Peshawar will begin in the middle of
December, while the other flights will begin Jan. 1 1999. There
will be four flights a week to Lahore and three a week to the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
	   At present Gulf Air flies only to Karachi.
	   The new flights will operate from Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, two
members of the United Arab Emirates. The airline flies Airbus A320
and Boeing 767 aircraft.
	   Gulf Air is owned equally by the governments of Bahrain, Oman,
Qatar and the U.A.E..
	   ____
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's annual exports should reach dlrs
700 million by the end of 1998, Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir
said Wednesday.
	   The external trade ministry has said exports are 22.4 percent
higher so far this year.
	   In a speech to parliament, el-Bashir said Sudan traded with 62
states in 1997-98, compared with 27 in 1994.
	   The country was currently exporting 63 products compared with 19
in 1994, the president added.
	   El-Bashir said that after Sudan becomes an oil exporter at the
end of 1999, Sudanese people would enjoy a better life without
shortages of goods.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A U.N. agency has donated dlrs 564,000 to
Lebanon to finance a scheme to raise women's earning power, the
government said Wednesday.
	   Gualtiero Fulcheri of the U.N. Development Fund for Women said
the project to be run by Lebanon's Council for Development and
Reconstruction would ``assist women in increasing their income and
improving their living standards.''
	   The European Union has pledged dlrs 494,000 toward the
three-year program.

	   --
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Three Eritrean civilians died in a
detention camp in southwest Ethiopia in October, the government
said Wednesday, citing a Red Cross report.
	   ``The three youths had been in detention for over four months
and died in the notorious, malaria-infested Bilate concentration
camp,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   There was no immediate comment from Ethiopian officials.
	   The Eritrean government called for an investigation into the
deaths, as well as the release of 1,500 imprisoned civilians,
including 37 university exchange students.
	   Eritrea says 34,000 of its citizens have been expelled from
Ethiopia since hostilities broke out between the two countries in
May. About 550,000 Eritreans were living in Ethiopia, mostly in the
capital and the northern provinces.
	   The U.N. human rights agency has condemned Ethiopia for
violating international principles by carrying out the
deportations.
	   Of an estimated 100,000 Ethiopians who were in Eritrea when the
conflict began, about 17,000 have voluntarily returned home.
	   --
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A three-judge panel began deliberations
Wednesday in the 19-month trial of two prominent Rwandans accused
in their country's 1994 genocide.
	   Clement Kayishema, who governed western Kibuye during the
slaughter, and Obed Ruzindana, a local businessman, pleaded
innocent to 25 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and
murder.
	   If convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
they face a maximum life sentence.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed
in a 90-day genocide launched by Hutu extremists in April 1994.
	   Prosecutors have accused Kayishema, aided by Ruzindana, of
masterminding a policy of encouraging frightened Tutsis to take
shelter in churches and a stadium on the pretext of offering them
protection, then slaughtering them.
	   From Kibuye's pre-genocide population of 252,000 Tutsis _ the
highest concentration in the country _ only 7,000 to 8,000 Tutsis
were left alive in the district by the end of June 1994, according
to African Rights, a London-based human rights group.
	   The killing stopped when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu government
in July 1994.
	   Separate from the U.N. tribunal, Rwanda has carried out its own
	   prosecutions in the genocide, and has executed 22 people.
	   Another 130,000 people in Rwandan jail awaiting genocide trials,
or possible release for lack of evidence.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A dispute has arisen in Uganda over the
number of people who die each year in the country's overcrowded
prisons.
	   Prisons Commissioner Joseph Etima told Radio Uganda Tuesday that
an average of 480 people die each year in prison and not 24,000 as
a newspaper reported.
	   ``The few deaths in prisons are caused by disease, poor
conditions and overcrowding,'' Etima told the government radio.
``There is no way 24,000 people can die in Ugandan prisons every
year.''
	   On Monday, the Nairobi Daily Nation quoted Jack Sabiti,
undersecretary in the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional
Affairs, as telling a seminar that 120,000 prisoners had died in
the past five years in the country's prisons.
	   J. K. Zirabamuzaale, chairman of the Uganda Prisoners Aid
Foundation, said that thousands die in prison from maltreatment,
disease, overcrowding, sexual abuse, torture and overwork.
	   --
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ A top Eritrean official said his country
doesn't expect a quick solution to its six-month conflict with
Ethiopia.
	   ``There are costs we are bearing _ economic costs and our
energies focusing on this issue _ but we are willing to wait for a
fair, just and lasting solution,'' Yemane Gebreab, political
director of Eritrea's ruling party, said Tuesday.
	   The latest peace mission by U.S. envoy Anthony Lake ended Sunday
with no indication of progress. As with Lake's visit to the region
in October, all parties have refused to discuss his efforts.
	   A separate but related initiative by the Organization of African
Unity is at an impasse.
	   Ethiopia had agreed to an 11-point plan, including a call for
Eritrea to withdraw to positions it held before May 12 when
Ethiopian militia shot Eritrean soldiers they claimed had occupied
Ethiopian territory.
	   Yemane said the OAU's demand that Eritrea unilaterally withdraw
from the contested Badme and Shiraro areas remains the main
stumbling block to a peaceful solution.
	   Eritrea wants an international monitoring force in place before
it withdraws any troops.

Sudanese president says U.S. missile attack helped his country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president said Wednesday that a
U.S. missile attack in August on a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory
backfired on America and was a political windfall for his country.
	   ``It was the Sudan that has actually won, politically and
diplomatically,'' said President Omar el-Bashir in a speech to
Parliament.
	   He said the attack on the el-Shifa factory brought sympathy to
the Sudanese people from other Arab countries and throughout the
world.
	   The United States fired missiles at the factory on August 20
after the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
	   America said the factory made components for chemical weapons
and was linked to the suspected mastermind of the bombings, Saudi
billionaire Osama bin-Laden. Sudan says the plant only made
medicine.

Siberian mayor gets suspended sentence, loses office for
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Siberian court handed down a suspended
three-year sentence to the mayor of a small city and dismissed him
from office Wednesday for misusing government funds, news reports
said.
	   Gennady Konyakhin was set free, but was barred from holding
public office for four years, the Interfax news agency reported.
The verdict means Konyakhin has been dismissed as mayor of
Leninsk-Kuznetsk, court officials said, according to Interfax.
	   During an investigation triggered by Konyakhin's reported links
to organized crime, he was accused of misappropriating 624,000
rubles (dlrs 37,000 at the current exchange rate) in government
resources, including 334,000 rubles (dlrs 20,000) worth of free
accommodation granted to a group of builders in a city hotel,
Russian media has reported.
	   Another 235,000 rubles (dlrs 14,000) in government resources was
misspent because of an arbitrary increase in the cost of repairs in
a building Konyakhin leased, the reports said.
	   Konyakhin, who was arrested in October 1997, pleaded innocent.
	   Prosecutors had called for a seven-year prison term, but the
court gave a three-year suspended sentence.
	   Following the verdict, the ex-mayor said he planned to go into
private business, Interfax reported.
	   Konyakhin was elected in the spring of 1997 and became known
nationwide after the influential newspaper Izvestia accused him of
being linked to the mafia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin threw his weight behind the newspaper
story, calling for a thorough investigation of Konyakhin's
activities and saying the case exemplified the growing criminal
infiltration of officialdom.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Cabinet gave preliminary
approval Wednesday to a major defense procurement package,
including the purchase of 28 Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British
Aerospace of Sweden and England.
	   The 29.77 billion-rand (dlrs 5.22 billion) package includes
three submarines and four corvette warships from German
consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from Italian manufacturer
Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from BAe.
	   The government said the finance minister and a Cabinet
subcommittee would carry out further negotiations with the
suppliers to finalize the deals.
	   The contracts have attracted intense bidding from international
manufacturers despite strings attached. The government is requiring
that countries wishing to sell weapons must invest an amount equal
to the purchase price into high technology industry here.
	   Swedish Ambassador Paul Heineback said he expected ``very
tough'' negotiations over Sweden's investment, but added, ``I'm
quite confident there will be final agreement.''
	   The defense purchases would be South Africa's largest since the
fall of the heavily militarized apartheid state in 1994. Critics
argue that the country has no business spending so much on arms
giving widespread poverty.
	   The government placed the costs of the Gripen jets at 10.875
billion rand (dlrs 1.91 billion), the largest component of the
procurement.
	   The price of the corvettes was 6 billion rand (dlrs 1.05
billion), and 5.212 billion rand (dlrs 914.4 million) for the subs,
4.728 billion rand (dlrs 838.6 million) for the Hawks, and 2.168
billion rand (dlrs 380.4 million) for the Agusta helicopters.
	   The package would also include four maritime helicopters from
GKN Westland of the United Kingdom valued at 787 million rand (dlrs
138 million).
	   The government said it had decided against the purchase of
tanks.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Pushing Italy to extradite Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, the government on Wednesday offered free
faxes to people writing to the Italian government. Thousands of

Nigeria looks for telecommunication partners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ British Telecom is among several foreign
investors that have expressed interest in buying 40 percent equity
shares in the state-owned telephone company, a Lagos newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   With the easing of diplomatic tensions between the two countries
since the death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, the way appears clear
for investment possibilities for British companies, Thisday
newspaper reported.
	   Last month, the government announced it would privatize key
state-controlled industries as part of a government move toward
economic reform.
	   Under the program, 40 percent of government-owned companies is
being offered to to investors.
	   Companies from the United States, Canada, Europe and South
Africa have expressed interest in investing in Nigeria.
	   Nigeria Telecom is the sole provider of domestic and
international telephone lines in the West African nation.
	   Service on its 600,000 current lines is abysmal due to a lack of
funds and chronic mismanagement.
	   All interested companies have six weeks within which to make
their bid, Thisday said.

EU Commission adopts new rules on working hours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday proposed new rules aimed at curbing long
working hours for junior doctors and transport workers.
	   The proposed measures extend most of the benefits of an 1993 EU
law setting a basic maximum working week of 48 hours in the
15-nation bloc to over five million workers.
	   The proposals on working hours must still be approved by EU
social affairs ministers, who will get a first chance of assessing
them at their regular meeting Friday.
	   ``It's an important day for millions of workers who were left
out of the initial directive,'' the EU's Commissioner for
Employment Padraig Flynn told a joint news conference with EU
Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   The new rules would affect truckers, as well as workers in air,
rail and maritime transport.
	   The conditions for truck and coach drivers would include a
maximum 48-hour week, averaged out over four months but never
exceeding 60 hours in any one week. ``The arrangement will help
save lives and prevent accidents,'' Kinnock said.
	   Asked whether non-EU truckers driving on EU roads will be
affected by the new rules, Kinnock said all road vehicles will be
subjected to random roadside checks. ``The origin of the driver is
not relevant,'' he said.
	   At the end of September the EU Commission began drawing up
legislation on working conditions for truckers after unions and
management failed to agree on limited driving time.
	   All the workers affected by the new proposals had been excluded
until now because of the difficulty of reconciling the hours
dictated by the nature of their jobs with the 1993 EU law for other
workers.
	   The proposals would make it illegal for junior doctors to work
more than 54 hours a week on average over a four-month period. But
the Commission is proposing to allow EU countries seven years to
implement the rules affecting doctors.
	   Under the 1993 Working Time Directive, EU workers should work no
more than 48 hours a week and get at least one day off a week. They
are entitled to four weeks of paid leave a year.

NATO commander stresses need for quick settlement in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ NATO's top commander in Europe warned
Wednesday that diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting settlement in
Kosovo must advance quickly because the cease-fire there is shaky
and could collapse within months.
	   ``Despite all our best efforts ... we probably have only a
two-to-four month window of relative peace,'' U.S. Gen. Wesley
Clark told a conference here.
	   ``We must use this respite to achieve a just and durable
political settlement'' in the southern Serb province, he said.
	   Independence-minded ethnic Albanians and Serb police and
military forces are preparing for further confrontation, Clark told
a meeting of the Atlantic Treaty Association, which groups various
official bodies from NATO countries.
	   ``The Albanian Kosovars are strengthening their force, they're
organizing, they're achieving greater discipline, and they're
preparing for what could happen if the political solution doesn't
appear.
	   ``No doubt the other side, the Serbs, are doing the same
thing,'' he told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting.
	   As part of the deal struck Oct. 12 by U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, up to 1,800
unarmed civilian verifiers are to be sent to Kosovo. They are to
ensure Milosevic abides by the agreement.
	   A French-commanded extraction force, based in neighboring
Macedonia, will be ready to rescue the verifiers if they come under
threat.
	   The force ``will have response times measured in everything from
minutes and hours up to days,'' depending on needs, according to
Clark, who said he will lead the extraction force's chain of
command.
	   Referring to NATO's readiness for crises like the one in Kosovo,
Clark said the deployment of ground forces must be quicker.
	   ``Frankly, our current military posture reflects an unhealthy
over-reliance on air power for rapid action,'' he said.
	   NATO needs ``urgently to strengthen capabilities and procedures
for (its) ground reaction forces,'' and this could take ``up to a
decade of sustained work'' to achieve, he said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's deputy prime minister on
Wednesday said the government is going to collapse when it faces a
confidence vote next week prompted by a mafia scandal.
	   The crisis comes as Turkey is waging a diplomatic war with Italy
over Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan was arrested in
Rome, but Italy appears unlikely to grant Turkey's request for
extradition.
	   ``We have to freeze this government crisis. While this country
is waging a serious struggle abroad, it is in no one's interest the
pull the chair out from under the government,'' the daily newspaper
Milliyet's columnist Hasan Pulur wrote Wednesday.

Polish leader warns against ``stereotype'' fears of eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski
on Wednesday warned against ``stereotypes'' among European Union
citizens concerning the negative impact of EU enlargement to the
east.
	   ``A whole range of stereotypes has attached itself to the
process of enlargement. They often take a life of their own,''
Kwasniewski told deputies at the European Parliament in Strasbourg,
France.
	   One unjustified fear, he said, was the idea that eastern
Europeans, once they are EU citizens and have free access to EU
jobs, will flock westwards in search of a better life.
	   ``Today, there are more Poles returning to their homeland than
leaving it. We are not interested in the outflow of qualified labor
force from Poland,'' Kwasniewski said.
	   The idea that EU enlargement could lead to a destabilization of
the EU's agricultural markets is also false, the Polish leader
continued.
	   Poland, the largest of the candidate countries, has a sizable
agriculture sector. But according to Kwasniewski, only half of
Polish farms sell products on the market. ``It is only for them
that agriculture is the main source of income,'' he said.
	   ``Protection of the natural environment is also perceived
through the prism of old stereotypes,'' Kwasniewski said. He said
Poland is mobilizing ``substantial investments'' to help protect
the environment.
	   Poland is one of six countries with which the EU opened formal
membership negotiations earlier this month. The other five are
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.
	   The EU refuses to predict when these countries are likely to
join the 15-nation bloc. A second batch - Romania, Bulgaria,
Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia - is also lobbying for EU accession.
	   Kwasniewski said he assumes Poland will be ready for accession
at the end of the year 2002.
	   After addressing the European Parliament, Kwasniewski met with
EU Commission President Jacques Santer to discuss enlargement.

U.S. does not want to topple Saddam, says top Saudi prince
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A brother of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, a
key American ally, said Wednesday he doubted the Clinton
administration wants to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Prince Talal Bin Abdel Aziz, an influential but maverick member
of the royal family, also accused the United States of double
standards in dealing with Arabs and said its main concerns in the
Middle East are the free flow of oil and Israel's security.
	   ``Let us be clear about this. I don't believe that America wants
to remove the (Iraqi) regime. I believe the existence of the regime
serves the American interests in one way or another,'' Talal said
in an interview with The Associated Press. ``If this true, then
this is a problem and a catastrophe.''
	   Talal suggested that the United States benefited from the
region's insecurity, making necessary an American presence in the
strategic Gulf and keeping Gulf countries dependent on Washington.
	   On Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said his administration
would intensify work with Iraqi opposition groups to try to remove
Saddam from power. The move signaled a more aggressive position
than the avowed policy of containing Saddam in the past.
	   However, the prince said, ``If they say they want to change the
regime, it is not evident.''
	   During this month's standoff between Iraq and the United
Nations, Saudi Arabia and many Gulf states reportedly refused to
commit themselves to allow U.S. forces to use their territories to
attack Iraq. But contrary to similar crisis in the past, they
blamed Saddam for starting the confrontation.
	   Talal also scoffed at Washington's Middle East policy, which he
described as biased toward Israel.
	   ``If you (Americans) have real interests in the area and you
want to keep the American presence here, you can do that if you
correct your policies towards Arabs and be neutral,'' he said.
	   Talal has no official position in the kingdom but his views
carry a lot of weight among Saudis and other Arabs. Some of his
views also reflect the opinion of the royal family, which rarely
airs its differences publicly.
	   Talal was nicknamed ``the free prince'' after he called for
democratic changes in the kingdom in the early '60s, a move that
cost him his job as ambassador to France.

Justin Rose shoots 6-over 78 in poor start for tour card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL Update with end of day's play

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Justin Rose, who finished fourth at the
British Open as a 17-year-old amateur, shot a 6-over-par 78
Wednesday in the first round of European tour qualifying school.
	   Since turning pro after the British Open, Rose has missed the
half-way cut at all eight tournaments he's played.
	   A total of 181 players are entered in the qualifying school,
with the top 35 receiving tour cards.
	   With Wednesday's poor start, Rose must now focus on making the
cut to 75 players after four rounds Saturday. The final two rounds
of the six-round event are Sunday and Monday.
	   Rose three-putted five times on the San Roque course and
admitted that part of his game had deserted him.
	   ``I hit the ball reasonably well,'' he said. ``But my putting
let me down. This is a marathon, though, and I'm not out of it for
sure.''
	   ``It's disappointing because I knew that if you can keep double
bogeys and three putts down to a minimum, then you're going to do
well.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _Ethnic Albanians ignored a visit to
Kosovo by Serbia's president on Wednesday, boycotting talks he
called to discuss the province's future.
	   President Milan Milutinovic arrived Wednesday in the southern
province, hoping to show that the Kosovo conflict remains an
internal matter. He was rebuffed, as he has been in 16 previous
attempts to hold talks with the ethnic Albanians, who insist on
international mediation.
	   The attempt to reassert authority came as a newspaper in the
provincial capital, Pristina, published what it said was part of a
U.S. draft plan outlining virtual self-rule for the province.
	   The plan published by the daily Koha Ditore, envisages almost no
Serbian control of the Albanian-majority province, while leaving it
under partial jurisdiction of Yugoslavia, which is made up of
Serbia and Montenegro.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the authenticity of the
plan. But previous versions published in the past have proven
accurate.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, trying to find a peace formula,
discussed the American draft on Tuesday with ethnic Albanian
guerrillas seeking independence whose support is crucial for any
resolution. There is an uneasy cease-fire in the province under
siege since February when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a crackdown on the separatist rebels.
	   There were no immediate comments from Serb and Albanian
politicians, but media in Serbia have reported the government there
disapproves of the plan because it sharply curtails its authority
in the province.
	   The draft published Wednesday said Kosovo would have its own
president, courts, government and parliament. Only defense, foreign
affairs, customs, foreign trade and monetary policy would be in the
hands of Yugoslavia.
	   The plan further envisages Kosovo's many ethnic communities
sharing power according to ethnic structure _ giving Kosovo's
90-percent Albanian majority the clear advantage.
	   The reported plan seems to push Kosovo further away from Serbia
and bring it closer to becoming a de-facto third republic in the
Yugoslav federation. Koha Ditore said it published only the first
part of the plan.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday following a guerrilla
ambush near an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, security
officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the deserted
village of Aqmata, some 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of this
southern market town.
	   The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a stronghold of

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government decided Wednesday
that it will still welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu next week even though he took part in a ceremony in
Jerusalem honoring Americans and Israelis who campaigned against
Swiss banks.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu's participation in the Knesset ceremony Tuesday
casts a shadow over the visit to Switzerland,'' said government
spokesman Achille Casanova.
	   But the governing Federal Council, or cabinet, will tell
Netanyahu of the irritation of the Swiss people and their
government and discuss with him problems that beset the relations
between the two countries, Casanova said.
	   Netanyahu is to co-chair a high-level Swiss-Israeli economic
forum Nov. 25.
	   Casanova said top Swiss officials also will bring up the Middle
East peace process in their talks with Netanyahu.
	   In the Jerusalem ceremony Netanyahu honored Edgar Bronfman,
President of the World Jewish Congress; former U.S. Senator Alfonse
D'Amato; U.S. Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat; and New
York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi role in negotiating settlement a
settlement with Swiss banks last August.
	   The banks agreed to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors
and their heirs to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks
by Jews and others trying to avoid Nazi confiscation.
	   The Swiss government remains angry with Bronfman for what it
considers were unfair attacks and in particular for remarks earlier
this year about ``total war'' on the Swiss.
	   D'Amato used his chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee
for repeated attacks on Switzerland. And Hevesi threatened Swiss
banks with economic sanctions when it appeared negotiations over
settling the accounts were breaking down.
	   Netanyahu also acknowledged the efforts of the Swiss government
in its handling of the affair.
	   ``I think Switzerland has shown important leadership,''
Netanyahu said. ``It has in many ways shown the way for other
European countries to confront responsibly, in a serious way the
problems of the past.''
	   Although neutral Switzerland stayed out of the war, it has been
accused by Jewish groups of profiting from the Holocaust and acting
as banker to the Nazis.

	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ In an unprecedented case for Greece, a
13-year-old boy was charged Wednesday with raping an 82-year-old
woman in this northern port city.
	   Police said the boy was arrested late Monday after allegedly
raping the woman in her home. She had let him into the house after
he begged her for food.
	   Police released the boy, who is said to be mentally handicapped,
into the custody of his parents until a trial date is set. Minors
under the age of 18 who are convicted of crimes are usually placed
in social welfare programs rather than jails.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspect arrested; justice minister's resignation
not accepted, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Four days after escaping from prison using
bedsheets tied together, a Russian accused of kidnapping a young
man and leaving him to die in a pit in the woods was re-arrested in
Berlin on Wednesday.
	   Sergei Serov, 38, was arrested in an apartment in eastern Berlin
just as he was shaving his head _ apparently for a disguise, police
said.
	   The person living in the apartment had found Serov shivering on
the street the night before and invited him in out of pity, police
said.
	   The next morning the renter became suspicious that his
houseguest might be Serov, whose picture was all over newspapers
and television.
	   He called police, who surrounded the building and sent a special
commando team in to arrest the man. Serov offered no resistance.
	   Serov had escaped late Saturday from a jail in Potsdam, the
capital of Brandenburg state, which surrounds Berlin.
	   Jail officials didn't realize he was missing until midday
Sunday, although a surveillance camera on a neighboring building
had captured him climbing down from the roof using bedsheets.
	   The escape of Serov, who was considered extremely dangerous,
caused a public uproar and charges of lax security and
incompetence.
	   Just hours before Serov was captured, Brandenburg's justice
minister, Hans Otto Braeutigam, offered to resign to take
responsibility for the escape.
	   But Gov. Manfred Stolpe refused later to accept the resignation,
saying Brauetigam retained his full confidence. Stolpe called,
however, for an investigation into suggestions that Serov may have
had help inside the prison.
	   Serov and fellow Russian Vyacheslav Orlov, 28, are to go on
trial early next year on charges of kidnapping leading to death.
	   Authorities said the two had made partial confessions in the
case of Matthias Hintze, a 20-year-old kidnapped Sept. 14, 1997 and
buried in a pit, where he slowly suffocated.
	   His body was found Oct. 8, 1997, a day after the two Russians
were arrested while trying to pick up the 1 million mark (dlrs
625,000) ransom.
	   Berlin prosecutors also have filed kidnapping charges against
the two in the case of a Berlin-based Russian computer dealer,
Alexander Galius, who disappeared in June 1997. One million marks
was demanded in that case as well.
	   Galius was never found and police suspect he died in an
underground shaft like Hintze.

Federation parliament against special ties with Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Lawmakers in Bosnia's
Muslim-Croat federation parliament sharply criticized Wednesday an
agreement on special ties with neighboring Croatia, calling it
dangerous for Bosnia's sovereignty.
	   The agreement was initiated by Croatia and defines military,
economic and other relations between it and the Muslim-Croat half
of Bosnia. Parliament president Ejup Ganic, president of the
federation, was to sign it in the Croatia capital Zagreb on Monday.
	   But pressure from Muslim lawmakers, who fear the it will grant
neighboring Croatia too much control over Muslims, prevented Granic
from signing the agreement.
	   ``This leads to the capitulation of Bosnia,'' said lawmaker
Irfan Ajanovic Wednesday.
	   Relations between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have been uneasy
since they fought each other in 1993-94. Croatia aided the Bosnian
Croats throughout the Bosnian war.
	   Ajanovic noted that the agreement also opens the door for the
Bosnian Serb half to involve in similar ties with Yugoslavia, which
would represent the division of Bosnia. Under the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement, Bosnia was divided into the Serb republic and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Croatia remains a major financial backer of Bosnian Croats, and
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is considered their chief
decision-maker.
	   While Western officials believe the agreement would define
relations, specifying military and economic cooperation in a
transparent way, others argue that any military support from
Croatia would give Croats the upper hand.
	   However, agreeing to the special ties could allow Bosnia use of
Croatia's southern port of Ploce, which Croatia agreed in Dayton to
let Bosnia use for 99 years. But Croatia has been reluctant to
really make this happen.
	   Pressed by the West, Zagreb agreed to allow Bosnia access to
Ploce under the condition of signing and ratifying of the
agreement.
	   No date has been set for the signing, but even if Ganic signs
the agreement, it still has to pass parliament before it becomes
official.

Court case to oust Jehovah's Witnesses delayed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Moscow judge on Wednesday delayed a trial on
banning Jehovah's Witnesses from operating in Russia until
February, saying prosecutors had not fully prepared their case.
	   The trial marks the first time prosecutors have applied Russia's
controversial religion law in court to try to disband religious
groups. Prosecutors argue that the Jehovah's Witnesses destroy
families, foster hatred and drive their members to insanity and
suicide.
	   The trial opened in September but was delayed until Tuesday. In
Wednesday's proceedings, defense lawyers asked for a delay because
prosecutors said they had not submitted all their evidence.
	   The judge sent the case back to prosecutors until Feb. 9.
	   Prosecutors say the group should be dissolved in Russia and its
activities banned under a religion law passed last year that gives
the government the right to disband any religious group it thinks
is inciting hatred or intolerant behavior.
	   Western leaders say the law, designed to strengthen the Russian
Orthodox Church and restrict foreign religions and cults that many
Russians consider dangerous, contradicts Russia's constitutional
right to freedom of religion.
	   If banned in Russia, the Jehovah's Witnesses would no longer
have the right to express their beliefs publicly, hold worship
services, rent property, or distribute literature.
	   In Tuesday's proceedings, prosecutors said the group destroys
families because the Jehovah's Witness practice of not celebrating
national holidays creates rifts between family members, and their
general refusal of blood transfusions threatens lives.
	   Defense lawyers countered that Jehovah's Witnesses are not
forced into the religion, and stressed that the case violates the
Russian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be the fifth-largest Christian
group in Russia, with about 10,000 members in Moscow and more than
250,000 across the country.
	   Russian prosecutors have conducted four separate criminal
investigations into the Jehovah's Witnesses but all were dismissed
for lack of evidence, said Judah Schroeder, spokesman for the
Jehovah's Witnesses headquarters in New York. He said this trial is
the first time the religion law has been tested in court.
	   Russian officials promised they would implement the law
leniently, and have not kicked out all religious groups that
haven't been in Russia for more than 15 years, as the law requires.
	   Still, they have denied return visas to missionaries and pastors
under the law.

Marcelo Rios has unkind words for ATP and colleagues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ One week before his battle to dethrone
Pete Sampras as the No. 1 tennis player in the world, Marcelo Rios
has described his peers as beasts of prey and blasted the ATP for
making machines out of players.
	   In an interview with the German weekly Stern, the often surly
22-year-old Chilean star said the tennis circuit is a lonely
affair.
	   ``In this job, it's like beasts of prey in a cage. Everybody
fights against everybody,'' Rios was quoted as saying in the
interview. Stern released excerpts of the interview Wednesday, in
advance of its publication Thursday.
	   ``Whoever claims to have good friends in this business is
talking nonsense,'' Rios was quoted as saying.
	   As for the ATP, Rios said, the tour was drilling players ``as if
we were in the army.''
	   ``If you break a racket in anger, a punishment machine is set
into motion. That's how people are reduced to bloodless
creatures,'' Rios was quoted as saying.
	   Rios is currently No. 2 in the world and could take the top
ranking from Sampras at next week's ATP Tour World Championship in
Hanover, Germany.
	   Winner of a tour-high seven titles this year, Rios has already
held the top ranking on two brief occasions this season.
	   Rios acknowledged his own behavioral shortcomings. For three
years in a row, Rios has been given the ``Prix Citrone'' (Lemon
Award) by journalists at the French Open for being the
unfriendliest player on the tour.
	   ``I have improved in the last few months. Maybe next year
someone else will finally get the lemon,'' Rios was quoted as
saying.

Two Pakistan Navy officers given jail sentence on graft charges

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani military court on
Wednesday sentenced two Navy officers who received kickbacks in a
$1-billion deal to purchase three French submarines in the early
1990s.
	   The General Court Martial sentenced Commodore Shahid Ashraf to
seven years in jail and Capt. Liaquat Ali Malik to three years, and
both were fined heavily, according to a statement from the
Pakistani navy. Their jail terms will be extended if they fail to
pay the fine, the statement said.
	   The statement did not say how much each officer received in
exchange for approving the $1-billion deal.
	   Besides Navy officers, the government has accused some top
officials of former prime minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government
of receiving commissions in the submarine deal.
	   Ms. Bhutto denies the charge.
	   The government is conducting an investigation against officials
in the Bhutto administration who were allegedly involved in the
deal for Agosta 90-B type submarines made in France.

ATMs and Internet greetings replace Christmas cards for Dutch bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Automatic teller machines will be
dispensing festive greetings along with guilders this Christmas as
a Dutch bank aims to save paper and cut costs.
	   Electronic messages on cash dispenser screens are replacing
traditional greeting cards as bearer of holiday cheer for Rabobank
customers.
	   The move will save 24 metric tons (26.4 tons) of paper _ that's
about 170 trees _ and one million guilders (dlrs 532,000). The bank
will also post seasonal greetings on its Internet site and print
them on account statements and in advertisements.
	   The decision also could signal the end of the impersonal
``Christmas Card Circuit,'' said bank spokesman Seger Pijnenburg.
	   ``If you send a card, you always have to get one back,'' he
said. ``The tradition got out of hand.''

Chinese foreign minister says yuan stability decision ``long-term''
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With BC-APEC &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said Wednesday his government's decision to keep its
currency stable is long-term.
	   ``Judging by all factors, we don't have to change or abandon
this decision,'' Tang said.
	   Tang was speaking at a news conference following the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In a statement Wednesday,
the 21-member group said China's decision to keep its currency, the
yuan, stable was an important contribution to regional financial
stability.
	   Tang rejected suggestions rejected that Beijing is losing
interest in joining the World Trade Organization, and said it is
willing to make concessions if the United States can be flexible.
	   A European Union official recently suggested that China had made
little recent headway on WTO membership because of its growing
focus on domestic issues, such as state enterprise reforms and
recovering from a summer of damaging floods.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
who met on the sidelines of the APEC conference Tuesday, agreed
''to speed up the progress'' for China's accession to the WTO,
according to Tang.
	   ''The Chinese side expressed its willingness to consider to show
flexibility if the same flexibility is shown on the American
side,'' he said.
	   Earlier this month, China said it would adopt its own code of
business conduct for the 21st century if it were not admitted to
the WTO next year.
	   China wants to become a WTO member before the organization
starts drafting trade rules for the next century.
	   Although China is the 10th-largest trader in the world in terms
of volume, it has been kept out of the WTO and its proceeding body,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, after more than a
decade of negotiations.
	   Chinese leaders contend that current WTO demands for tariff cuts
and the elimination of non-tariff barriers would cripple its
developing economy.
	   ''The sticking point at present is an imbalance between rights
and interests. China is a developing country but our negotiating
partners have asked China to undertake obligations that are
undertaken by developed countries,'' he said.
	   Separately, Tang made a veiled attack on Gore's remarks made
Monday in praise of the ''brave people of Malaysia'' who have taken
to the streets to protest Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
crackdown _ and jailing _ of a former ally.
	   ''I don't think I can comment,'' on the speech, he said. ''All I
can say is the Chinese people and the Chinese government will never
ever make irresponsible remarks on other countries' internal
affairs.''
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two U.S. Navy warships and a submarine
sailed through the Suez Canal on Wednesday en route to the Gulf,
canal officials said.
	   The cruiser USS Gettysburg, submarine USS Miami and supply ship
USS Detroit crossed early Wednesday, said the officials who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Later in the day, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and a
destroyer arrived at Port Said, the northern tip of the waterway,
said the officials. The destroyer's name was not given.
	   The ships were ordered to move to the Gulf to join the U.S.
naval force that was preparing to launch military strikes on Iraq.
The strikes were averted Saturday when Iraq agreed to resume
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   There are already 23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to
174 aircraft and 21 ships, including nine armed with cruise
missiles, according to the Pentagon.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday after a rebel ambush near
an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the deserted
village of Aqmata, 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of this
southern market town.
	   The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a stronghold of
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and is frequently used to
launch attacks against Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed that the air
force attacked area targets.

Heiress attends 10th anniversary memorial for mother's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKORPIOS, Greece (AP) _ Athina Roussel, the teenage heiress to
the Onassis shipping fortune, on Wednesday attended a memorial
service on the family's private island to mark the 10th anniversary
of her mother's death.
	   The 13-year-old granddaughter of the late shipping mogul
Aristotle Onassis placed 38 roses on her mother's grave,
representing Christina Onassis' age at the time of her death.
	   Her father, Thierry Roussel, accompanied her to the Ionian Sea
island of Skorpios, said family spokesman Alexis Mantheakis.
	   Located 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Athens, Skorpios
was a jet setters play ground during Onassis' heyday in the 1960s,
and the place where he married Jacqueline Kennedy.
	   Onassis, his son Alexander, and Christina are all buried on the
island, which Athina will inherit when she becomes of age. Although
Athina has visited the island before, it was the first time she
attended a memorial service for her mother.
	   Athina was to return for school in Geneva, Switzerland, later
Wednesday, but her father will remain in Athens where he is locked
in a bitter court fight with the trustees of his daughter's estate.
	   French-born Roussel is battling for management of the dlrs 600
million fortune that Athina stands to inherit on her 18th birthday.
	   The four Greek trustees administering the inheritance have sued
Roussel for slander, perjury and other charges after he lost a
court case in which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement.

Central Nairobi powerless after construction accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Most of central Nairobi was without
electric power Wednesday when a truck dumping rubble in the
capital's outskirts knocked over a major electric pylon, a Kenya
Power and Lightning Co. spokesman said.
	   ``Some contractors knocked down a pylon at a place where they
dump stones,'' said Migwi Theuri, KPL public relations officer.
	   Repair crews were at the site, but KPL officials expected it may
take up to two days to repair the high voltage line. Meanwhile,
engineers were trying to supply electricity through alternative
power lines, but KPL said its resources were limited.
	   Meanwhile, frustrated consumers kept calling KPL's emergency
services, traffic snarled in the central business district and
scores of shops without auxiliary generators were plunged into
darkness on a grey, rainy day.

Serbian president turns down unofficial US peace plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with president finding faults with peace
proposal, more quotes; trims
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's president on Wednesday
rejected a US draft plan for Kosovo's future as giving too much
power to ethnic Albanians, the overwhelming majority in the Serbian
province.
	   Speaking after waiting in vain for a Kosovo Albanian delegation
to turn up and begin talks on the future of the province, Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic criticized the latest US proposal,
which reportedly would give Kosovo virtual self rule.
	   ``It does not respect full equality of all ethnic communities in
Kosovo,'' Milutinovic said in a speech to local Serb officials who
attended the meeting at his behest.
	   Milutinovic also warned that ``terrorist groups'' _ a government
term for Kosovo Albanian guerrillas seeking independence _ ``will
be energetically neutralized by security forces,'' if they continue
what he said was attacks on government forces. The guerrillas say
they are only responding to attacks on them.
	   A draft version of the plan proposed by the top U.S. mediator in
Kosovo, Christopher Hill, published in an Albanian-language paper
Wednesday, envisages almost no Serbian control of the province,
while leaving it under partial jurisdiction of Yugoslavia, made up
of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Milutinovic rejected such a plan as contravening Serbia's
``territorial integrity.''
	   The draft said Kosovo would have its own president, courts,
government and parliament. Only defense, foreign affairs, customs,
foreign trade and monetary policy would be in the hands of the
Yugoslav federation.
	   Kosovo's many ethnic communities would share power according to
ethnic structure _ giving Kosovo's 90-percent Albanian majority the
clear advantage _ and solving disputed internal issues in the
Kosovo Supreme Court. If the dispute remains unresolved it would go
to the European courts.
	   Disputes with Serbia and the federation would be solved in a
special court, which would include representatives of Yugoslavia,
Kosovo and the international community.
	   The reported plan seems to push Kosovo further away from Serbia
and bring it closer to becoming a de-facto third republic in the
Yugoslav federation.
	   Milutinovic indicated that Serbia was willing to tolerate
``democratic self-rule through parliamentary, executive and
judicial bodies and a local police,'' he said. But such self-rule
could come only ``within Serbia,'' he said.
	   Despite the fact that Kosovo's Albanians make up more than 90
percent of the province's population, Milutinovic insisted Serbs
and even tinier minorities like ethnic Turks should have equal
clout to ``prevent outvoting'' of one community by another,
Milutinovic said.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, trying to find a peace formula,
discussed the American draft on Tuesday with the guerrillas. Their
support is crucial in the wake of an uneasy cease fire that for the
most part ended nearly eight months of fighting between them and a
joint force of Yugoslav army and Serb police forces.
	   A top ethnic negotiator in the camp of moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova indicated Tuesday his side could settle for
less than long-proclaimed goal of independence. Fehmi Agani said
giving Kosovo the same rights as Serbia and Montenegro within
Yugoslavia would be acceptable, if such status were respected by
Serbia.
	   But it was unclear whether the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
would agree to any deal short of the independence they have been
fighting for. The guerrillas said they would give their opinion by
next week.
	   Agani and others close to Rugova have discarded Milutinovic's
offer for direct talks without foreign mediation as a cheap
publicity stunt. The ethnic Albanians have so far rejected 16 such
invitations for talks by the Serbian government.

Poland's telecommunication monopoly listed on Warsaw's stock
</HEADLINE>
exchange

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In Poland's largest ever initial public
offering, the telecommunication monopoly made its debut Wednesday
on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, lifting a lackluster market.
	   The Treasury Ministry sold 15 percent of Telekomunikacja Polska
SA's stock, estimated at dlrs 8 billion, in three tranches for
domestic retail investors, domestic institutions and foreign
institutions.
	   The government hopes to sell another 25 to 35 percent of TPSA to
a strategic investor by the end of the first half of 1999, and
analysts expect that will boost demand.
	   The debut price was fixed at 16.9 zloty (dlrs 4.9), a gain of
11.2 percent over the subscription price, in line with analysts'
expectations.
	   Wieslaw Rozlucki, stock exchange president, called TPSA's debut
``a milestone in the market's development.'' It should also begin
the company's restructuring and hand profits to retail investors,
harmed recently by weak markets, he said.
	   More than 3.3 million TPSA shares changed hands, making up half
the volume of trading on the market. The relatively high demand on
a day when the market fell overall meant that the price may rise in
the short-term, said Grzegorz Kalin-Czerski, CAIB Securities
analyst.
	   With a market capitalization of about dlrs 7 billion, TPSA is
now the largest company on the Warsaw bourse, whose total
capitalization is now dlrs 20 billion, according to Rozlucki.
	   Despite currently weak markets, Poland decided to go ahead with
the sale, although at a price half of what analysts had anticipated
in early 1997.
	   The next step was finding an investor with experience in the
telecommunications sector and getting ``fair returns to the
budget,'' said Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz.
	   TPSA, former communist-style monopoly, badly needs investment to
boost efficiency and help increase the ratio of lines per citizen,
now among the lowest in Europe.

Ukraine's official unemployment rate grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's unemployment rate was 54 percent
higher in October than the same month last year, with 908,270
people officially registered as jobless, the State Statistics
Committee said Wednesday.
	   The figure represented an unemployment rate of 3.3 percent, up
from 3.2 percent in September and 2.1 percent last October.
	   Actual unemployment figures in this former Soviet republic are
believed to be much higher, as many Ukrainians do not formally
register as jobless and cash-strapped companies are sending others
on forced vacations. In many sectors of the economy, salaries have
not been paid for months.
	   Ukraine long has been in economic crisis, which became more
pronounced in the fall following economic turmoil in neighboring
Russia, Ukraine's main trade partner.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Cabinet gave preliminary
approval Wednesday to a major defense procurement package, South
Africa's largest since the fall of the heavily militarized
apartheid state in 1994.
	   The 29.77 billion-rand (dlrs 5.22 billion) package includes 28
Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British Aerospace of Sweden and
England, three submarines and four corvette warships from German
consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from Italian manufacturer
Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from British Aerospace.
	   The government said the finance minister and a Cabinet
subcommittee would carry out further negotiations with the
suppliers to finalize the deals.
	   The defense purchases are moving ahead despite criticism that
the country has no business spending so much on arms when so many
of its people are stuck in poverty. But proponents say South
Africa, the main military power in the region, needs to maintain
readiness.
	   The contracts have attracted intense bidding from international
manufacturers despite strings attached. The government is requiring
that countries wishing to sell weapons must invest an amount equal
to the purchase price into high technology industry here.
	   Swedish Ambassador Paul Heineback said he expected ``very
tough'' negotiations over Sweden's investment, but added, ``I'm
quite confident there will be final agreement.''
	   The government placed the costs of the Gripen jets at 10.875
billion rand (dlrs 1.91 billion), the largest component of the
procurement.
	   The price of the corvettes was 6 billion rand (dlrs 1.05
billion), and 5.212 billion rand (dlrs 914.4 million) for the subs,
4.728 billion rand (dlrs 838.6 million) for the Hawks, and 2.168
billion rand (dlrs 380.4 million) for the Agusta helicopters.
	   The package would also include four maritime helicopters from
GKN Westland of the United Kingdom valued at 787 million rand (dlrs
138 million).
	   The government said a Cabinet sub-committee had recommended that
a proposal to buy tanks ``not be considered at this time.''

Switzerland swallows irritation and keeps open invitation to
</HEADLINE>
Netanyahu &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swiss political reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government decided Wednesday
that it will still welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu next week even though he took part in a ceremony in
Jerusalem honoring Americans and Israelis who campaigned against
Swiss banks.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu's participation in the Knesset ceremony Tuesday
casts a shadow over the visit to Switzerland,'' said government
spokesman Achille Casanova.
	   But the governing Federal Council, or cabinet, will tell
Netanyahu of the irritation of the Swiss people and their
government and discuss with him problems that beset the relations
between the two countries, Casanova said.
	   Netanyahu is to co-chair a high-level Swiss-Israeli economic
forum Nov. 25.
	   The decision split the four parties that share in the coalition
Swiss government. The centrist Radical Democrats and left of center
Social Democrats approved, but the other two parties said the
regretted it.
	   The conservative Swiss People's Party said it hoped Netanyahu
apologizes, and the right-of-center Christian People's Party said
it expects Swiss officials to speak publicly of their displeasure.
	   Casanova said top Swiss officials also will bring up the Middle
East peace process in their talks with Netanyahu.
	   In the Jerusalem ceremony Netanyahu honored Edgar Bronfman,
President of the World Jewish Congress; former U.S. Senator Alfonse
D'Amato; U.S. Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat; and New
York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi role in negotiating settlement a
settlement with Swiss banks last August.
	   The banks agreed to pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors
and their heirs to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks
by Jews and others trying to avoid Nazi confiscation.
	   The Swiss government remains angry with Bronfman for what it
considers were unfair attacks and in particular for remarks earlier
this year about ``total war'' on the Swiss.
	   D'Amato used his chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee
for repeated attacks on Switzerland. And Hevesi threatened Swiss
banks with economic sanctions when it appeared negotiations over
settling the accounts were breaking down.
	   Netanyahu also acknowledged the efforts of the Swiss government
in its handling of the affair.
	   ``I think Switzerland has shown important leadership,''
Netanyahu said. ``It has in many ways shown the way for other
European countries to confront responsibly, in a serious way the
problems of the past.''
	   Although neutral Switzerland stayed out of the war, it has been
accused by Jewish groups of profiting from the Holocaust and acting
as banker to the Nazis.

German authorities check 25 supermarkets for food tampering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German authorities said Wednesday they
were checking Nestle products at 25 outlets of a supermarket chain
in southern Germany for tampering in connection with an extortion
attempt against the food company.
	   According to Frankfurt police spokesman Manfred Feist, someone
threatened to poison products with the Nestle brand name, as well
as those of its subsidiaries Alete, Maggi and Thomy, in Grosso
supermarket outlets in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria.
	   Nestle and its subsidiaries produce a variety of products from
soups to cereals to baby foods.
	   State police in Stuttgart said 100 police officers were checking
Nestle products of all 25 Grosso markets in that region, which had
already been removed from shelves by the outlets as a precaution
after Nestle received a warning on Monday.
	   At least 29 products had been removed because it could not be
determined without further investigation if they had been
manipulated or damaged in shipment, police said.
	   Customers had thus far not turned in any suspicious products
with tampered packaging and no injuries have been reported, a
police statement said.
	   According to police, Nestle had received a warning on Monday,
which said poisoned products had been placed on supermarket shelves
in Baden-Wuerttemberg on Saturday.
	   Those involved in the blackmail attempt are asking for payment
amounting to several million marks (more than dlrs 1 million), the
statement said.
	   In the past weeks, investigators did find food products tainted
with small amounts of insecticides outside the Baden-Wuerttemberg
state area, the statement said.
	   However, those products had been clearly marked with a skull and
crossbones to indicate they had been tampered with, police said.
All of those products were believed found and removed from market
shelves and no injuries were reported, the statement said.
	   However, the latest products under investigation were not marked
as having been manipulated, the statement said. Thus far no
poisoned products have been found.
	   On Tuesday, police said they had arrested a man who tried to
extort 25 million marks (dlrs 15 million) in diamonds from Nestle
in a blackmail plot stretching back to 1996.

Central Nairobi powerless after construction accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Most of central Nairobi was without
electric power Wednesday when a truck dumping rubble in the
capital's outskirts knocked over a major electric pylon, a Kenya
Power and Lightning Co. spokesman said.
	   ``Some contractors knocked down a pylon at a place where they
dump stones,'' said Migwi Theuri, KPL public relations officer.
	   Repair crews were at the site, but KPL officials expected it may
take up to two days to repair the high voltage line. Meanwhile,
engineers were trying to supply electricity through alternative
power lines, but KPL said its resources were limited.
	   Meanwhile, frustrated consumers kept calling KPL's emergency
services, traffic snarled in the central business district and
scores of shops without auxiliary generators were plunged into
darkness on a grey, rainy day.

France refuses to extradite alleged British spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with details on how much spy got for selling secrets,
jail term faced in Britain, arguments by Shayler's lawyers.
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French appeals court on Wednesday rejected a
British request to extradite a former MI5 intelligence agent and
ordered David Shayler to be freed, judicial sources said.
	   Shayler, 32, faced being charged under Britain's Official
Secrets Acts and up to two years in prison if he had been deported
by French authorities who had arrested him on Aug. 1 at Scotland
Yard's request.
	   The former spy admitted that he sold information on Britain's
MI5 domestic intelligence agency to a London newspaper for 20,000
pounds (dlrs 33,400).
	   At the time of his arrest, Home Secretary Jack Straw said that
Shayler had access to highly sensitive information.
	   The French court's reason for letting Shayler go was not made
public. The former spy was to be released from French custody later
Wednesday, the judicial sources said.
	   Shayler's lawyers argued that the British extradition request
had a ``political character'' and was therefore prohibited under
French law. The French government cannot go against a court ruling
and order Shayler to be turned over to the British.
	   Shayler was arrested in France after he reportedly considered
releasing information about an alleged British plot to kill Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, which the British government denies.
	   Shayler worked for MI5 internal security service from 1994 until
1997. He fled to France last year after selling stories about the
agency's operations to a British newspaper.
	   Libya also had asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Until his arrest, Shayler had been living with his girlfriend in
a remote part of rural France.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with quotes from Sharon,
Palestinian negotiator. Trims. No Pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials resumed
long-suspended talks about a final peace treaty on Wednesday, while
snags threatened implementation of the land-for-peace accord signed
last month.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian negotiator
Mahmoud Abbas met at Israel's Foreign Ministry to discuss an agenda
for full-scale talks, expected to begin by the end of the month.
	   ``We are starting today to negotiate the permanent agreement,''
Sharon told reporters. ``I think that we have to look to the
future. Looking to the past will not help us.''
	   Abbas told reporters he expected Israel to carry out its first
withdrawal under the U.S.-brokered agreement on Friday.
	   ``Now we will discuss the future, and that is what is
important,'' he said.
	   Alone except for a translator, the two sat across from each
other in the second-floor of a barracks-like building in the
Foreign Ministry complex.
	   The final status negotiations are to deal with the question of
borders and Palestinian demands for statehood, in addition to
refugees, water, Jewish settlements and the status of Jerusalem.
	   The meeting was a sign the peace process was moving again after
a series of disputes.
	   Still, disagreements persist, the latest over the first group of
Palestinian prisoners Israel was to release. Palestinians
complained that 150 of the 250 to be set free were ordinary
criminals and not political prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an ongoing effort by Jewish settlers
to expand areas they control.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli soldiers chased Jewish settlers off a
hilltop near the West Bank settlement of Kedumim near Nablus. About
30 settlers camped on the site Tuesday, declaring they were
establishing a new community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said settler Shoshi Nor after coming down from the hill he
and the others had occupied.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by building
access roads to settlements that will be surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after the Israeli withdrawals.
	   Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said the expansion of settlements and the confiscation of
Palestinian land ``cannot be accepted'' and ``is an obvious
violation of the agreement.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet has
scheduled a meeting Thursday to examine Palestinian steps required
under the accord. A go-ahead from the Cabinet would set in motion
an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, probably
on Friday.
	   By a wide margin, Israel's 120-member Knesset endorsed the
accord Tuesday, negotiated in a marathon summit in Maryland and
signed at the White House Oct. 23. The dovish opposition Labor
Party provided the margin of approval in the 75-19 vote, with nine
abstentions.
	   Most of the ``no'' votes came from Netanyahu's own coalition.
Five members of his Cabinet voted against the accord and others
were absent.
	   Right-wingers maintain the troop withdrawal endangers Jewish
settlers in the West Bank. They also complain the government has
not presented detailed maps of areas to be handed over to the
Palestinians.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening on May 5, 1996.
	   The interim framework, including the accord signed last month,
is set to expire on May 4, 1999.
	   ``At the end of final status talks, we see the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital, because final
status negotiations are about borders and refugees, Jerusalem and
settlements,'' Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference to rifles by Arafat, led Netanyahu
to suspend withdrawal Monday.
	   On Tuesday, Arafat reiterated his commitment to negotiations,
which the Israelis accepted as a retraction and lifted their
suspension threat.
	   The first Israeli pullback involves giving the Palestinians
civilian rule over 2 percent of West Bank land now under full
Israeli control. An area amounting to 7.1 percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from joint Israeli-Palestinian control to full
Palestinian rule.

Heiress attends 10th anniversary memorial for mother's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKORPIOS, Greece (AP) _ Athina Roussel, the heiress to the
Onassis shipping fortune, on Wednesday attended a memorial service
on the family's private island to mark the 10th anniversary of her
mother's death.
	   The 13-year-old granddaughter of the late shipping mogul
Aristotle Onassis placed 38 roses on her mother's grave,
representing Christina Onassis' age at the time of her death.
	   Her father, Thierry Roussel, accompanied her to the Ionian Sea
island of Skorpios, said family spokesman Alexis Mantheakis.
	   Located 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of Athens, Skorpios
was a jet-set playground during Onassis' heyday in the 1960s, and
the place where he married Jacqueline Kennedy.
	   Onassis, his son Alexander, and Christina are all buried on the
island, which Athina will inherit when she comes of age. Although
Athina has visited the island before, it was the first time she
attended a memorial service for her mother.
	   Athina was to return to Geneva, Switzerland, later Wednesday for
school, but her father will remain in Athens where he is locked in
a bitter court fight with the trustees of his daughter's estate.
	   French-born Roussel is battling for management of the dlrs 600
million fortune that Athina stands to inherit on her 18th birthday.
	   The four Greek trustees administering the inheritance have sued
Roussel for slander, perjury and other charges after he lost a
court case in which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement.

U.N.: malnourishment stunts 65 percent of NKorea children
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Years of food shortages have led to 65 percent of
North Korean children under seven being stunted, United Nations
experts said Wednesday.
	   A survey carried out in September and October also showed 16
percent of children are acutely malnourished, with a body weight
too low for their height.
	   That figure, which reflects ongoing shortages, is exceeded in
Asia only by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka.
	   Eighteen teams, each headed by a foreign official from the World
Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund or the European Union,
carried out the joint study.
	   They measured the weight and height of 1,800 children aged six
months to seven years in homes randomly selected by the agencies
from areas to which aid agencies have access. Those areas cover
around 70 percent of the population.
	   It was the first ``technically sound survey'' of the problem,
UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters.
	   The most alarming findings came in children aged between one and
two, 30 percent of whom were acutely malnourished.
	   At that age, ``malnutrition can permanently impair physical and
intellectual growth,'' said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director for
the region.
	   ``It is important that the government takes this into serious
consideration as it has repercussions for the future of the
country.''
	   Children in North Korea's three largest cities _ Pyongyang,
Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their counterparts
elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished.
	   Boys were almost twice as badly affected as girls. ``We really
don't know why,'' Cheng-Hopkins said.
	   U.N. agencies last week said North Korea must import at least a
million tons of food in the coming months to meet the population's
minimum needs.
	   Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic
downturn have heavily damaged North Korea's crop production and
capacity to import food.
	   The number of children who are short for their age suggests
problems going back seven years, maybe more, Cheng-Hopkins said.
	   The closed, communist nation turned to the international
community for help for the first time in 1995.
	   Previous difficulties in getting figures from North Korea make
it hard to judge whether the situation is improving, but anecdotal
evidence suggests progress has been made, Madi said.
	   Although international food aid has staved off a catastrophic
situation, things can only improve if people get access to clean
water and sanitation, she added.
	   The agencies hope to carry out further surveys ``periodically,''
according to Cheng-Hopkins.

Foreign investment in Ukraine tops dlrs 700 million in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Foreign investments in Ukraine totaled dlrs
705.2 million in the first nine months of 1998, more than 40
percent higher than the same period last year, the State Statistics
Committee said Wednesday.
	   As of Nov. 1, the amount of direct foreign investment Ukraine
has attracted since independence in 1991 stood at dlrs 2.6 billion,
it said.
	   Despite the increase, the volume of foreign investment drawn by
this former Soviet republic of 50 million people is significantly
smaller than that in its smaller neighbors in Eastern Europe.
	   Foreign businessmen have complained of Ukraine's complicated
bureaucratic procedures, corruption and frequently changing
legislation, which have discouraged them from expanding their
activities in the country.
	   Many also have been driven away by the recent economic crisis in
Russia and its heavy toll on the economies of fellow ex-Soviet
republics.
	   The United States has been Ukraine's largest foreign investor to
date with dlrs 481.3 million, followed by the Netherlands with dlrs
258.8 million.
	   Germany has invested dlrs 216.8 million in Ukraine, Britain dlrs
185.2 million and South Korea dlrs 184.2 million, the committee
said.
	   Most of the foreign money was channeled to Ukraine's food
industry, domestic trade and the machine-building sector.

New German leader pushes return to Berlin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder formally
decided Wednesday to press ahead with the German government's plan
to return to Berlin next year, even though his new offices won't be
ready.
	   A government review of the move listed major delays in
construction, eight years after lawmakers narrowly voted to shift
the capital east from sleepy Bonn to the prewar seat of power.
	   But the report said parliament will be able to move into the
overhauled Reichstag building, at the former site of the Berlin
Wall, next September as scheduled, officially launching the
``Berlin Republic.''
	   ``There will be improvisation and temporary solutions, but we
will start on time,'' Franz Muentefering, the government minister
in charge of the move, said after Schroeder's Cabinet endorsed his
report.
	   Muentefering denied reports of cost overruns, saying the move's
20 billion mark (dlrs 12 billion) budget stands. He blamed former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government for letting building plans
slide.
	   Delays mainly affect the new chancellery, lawmakers' offices and
the government press office, he said.
	   The chancellery will be ready in October 2000, six months later
than once planned, Muentefering said. Schroeder will govern in the
meantime from a building in central Berlin once used by East German
communist rulers.
	   To underline the firm timetable, the Cabinet will meet once a
month in Berlin starting Wednesday until Schroeder moves
permanently next fall.
	   Next Monday, the staff of President Roman Herzog, Germany's head
of state, will become the first government agency to start working
exclusively from Berlin, 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Bonn.
	   Berlin reclaimed its historic role as capital after the Wall
fell in 1989 and east and west Germany merged the following year.
	   The move from Bonn, the provincial Cold War capital that
symbolized a nation chastened by the Nazis' defeat in World War II,
involves about 6,500 civil servants, including nearly 700
lawmakers.
	   Schroeder, Germany's first chancellor without personal
experience of the war, has shown few qualms about moving to what
was the capital of Nazi Germany.
	   ``Schroeder has always made clear that he views the decision in
favor of Berlin as a future-oriented one, and that he will like
being there,'' Muentefering said.

SAfrica settles on Parreira as new national coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Brazil's Carlos Alberto
Parreira is South African soccer's top choice to coach the national
team, officials said Wednesday.
	   Parreira, who coached Saudi Arabia at the 1998 World Cup finals,
is coming for an interview on Friday, said Molefi Oliphant,
president of the South African Football Association.
	   ``If he's good for the job, that's it,'' Oliphant told The
Associated Press. ``He's one of the best coaches in the world, even
if Saudi Arabia didn't perform well.''
	   The Saudis were one of the first teams to go out of the finals.
	   Former SAFA executive director Danny Jordaan, who now heads
South Africa's World Cup bid for 2006, said Parreira will be
offered the job.
	   Oliphant said the ``ideal'' would be a four-year contract to
bring the team through next year's World Cup finals.
	   Bafana Bafana has been without a coach since their early ouster
in France, shortly after which Philippe Troussier lost the job.
	   Parreira coach the Brazilians to their record fourth World Cup
victory in 1994.

Moldovan transportation unions protest unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ About 5,000 drivers and other public
transport workers marched through a central square in Moldova's
capital Wednesday to protest salaries that haven't been paid for
months and falling living standards.
	   The government owes 30 million lei (dlrs 4 million) in back
wages to 18,500 drivers and transport workers. Some workers haven't
been paid for up to seven months.
	   The average salary in this former Soviet republic of 4.3 million
people is 250 lei (dlrs 33).
	   Drivers are demanding that the government cancel free public
transportation for schoolchildren, pensioners and war veterans,
saying that causes losses of 20 million lei (dlrs 2.6 million) a
year.
	   The head of the transportation union, Boris Rajnievski, said the
drivers will go on strike, paralyzing the country's transportation
network, if their demands are not met by Dec. 1.

Parliament votes to issue treasury notes to cover debt to Gazprom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Threatened by a cold winter without
heating, Moldova's parliament voted Wednesday to issue dlrs 90
million in treasury bonds to cover debts to Russia's natural gas
monopoly.
	   The International Monetary Fund said it would cut off loans to
this former Soviet republic if it went ahead with the treasury
notes, which the government has already approved.
	   Last week, the head of Russia's gas giant Gazprom told Moldova's
President Petru Lucinschi that he would stop the supply of natural
gas to Moldova this winter if Moldova didn't pay some of its debts.
	   Moldova owes dlrs 614 million to Gazprom, the main supplier of
natural gas to the country. The secessionist republic of
Trans-Dniester owes about two-thirds of the total debt.
	   The treasury notes will be issued for a nine-year period with a
7.5 percent annual interest rate. The first two years are
interest-free.
	   Gazprom also threatened to back away from a joint venture
between Moldova, Trans-Dniester and Gazprom.
	   A group of IMF officials from Washington led by Richard Hasse
last week said the treasury bills would prevent Moldova from paying
back its foreign debts of dlrs 1.3 billion. Hasse said the IMF
would stop a dlrs 35 million tranche of a loan in January if
Moldova issued treasury notes.
	   Moldova's Finance Minister Anatol Arapu told IMF officials that
the government would hike natural gas prices to cover the cost of
the treasury bills.

France set to introduce tough anti-doping law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS `using' in second graf, newspaper item in final grafs

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the aftermath of the scandal-plagued Tour de
France, French lawmakers are expected Wednesday to pass one of the
world's toughest anti-doping laws.
	   The legislation would create a powerful doping prevention
committee, order federations to show that they are acting to stamp
out the use of illegal drugs, and punish individuals found
prescribing, supplying, facilitating, encouraging and using such
substances.
	   Three legal experts, three medical or scientific representatives
and three sports officials would make up the nine-member committee.
	   It would have the power to impose specific penalties, and
stiffen sanctions where it believes that sports federations have
failed to crack down on doping.
	   The credibility of the system rests not only on its ability to
test individual athletes, but also to control federations that are
too lax, said Jean-Claude Nery, an official at the Culture
Ministry.
	   Under the bill, adopted by the French Senate in May and expected
to be passed by the National Assembly on Wednesday, the Ministry of
Sports will have the right to carry out raids on premises and order
athletes to undergo medical examinations.
	   Sports federations must also discipline offenders and make an
official report on infractions within five months of an offense.
	   Furthermore, the government will only issue sports licenses to
authorities that have a certificate showing that they are combating
doping.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet, who has made the fight
against doping her central policy since coming into office in June
1997, admits that clamping down on doping will be a long, hard
struggle.
	   ``There will need to be a battle from day to day to reverse the
flow,'' Buffet said before presenting the bill.
	   ``We cannot believe that once the law has been passed and
applied, we have dealt with the problem,'' she said.
	   Buffet also said that she would give details of the law to the
next meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in an
attempt to promote a more coherent international anti-doping
policy.
	   The doping controversies at the Tour de France, during which the
Festina team was expelled for admitting to the use of the
performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO), gave new impetus
to the fight against banned drugs in France.
	   But other sports have also been hit by drug scandals.
	   In 1997, former soccer internationals Cyrille Pouget and Vincent
Guerin, as well as Antoine Sibierski and Dominique Arribage, were
suspended after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid
nandrolone.
	   Stephane Paille, who plays for Scottish team Heart of
Midlothian, was suspended after testing positive for amphetamines.
	   And French international goalkeeper Bernard Lama was suspended
from his club Paris-Saint Germain after testing positive for
cannabis.
	   On Tuesday, French daily Liberation said that an internal report
from France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS),
``Doping and Sports,'' identified widespread doping in French
sports, particularly among adolescents and at small sports clubs.
	   The last official government study, in 1992, found only 69
positive doping cases among 8,000 tests.
	   But the newspaper quotes an unnamed CNRS official as saying that
the problem is far more widespread.
	   ``We are very concerned because we can see death lurking at the
end of the race,'' he said.
	   With growing commercial pressures, ``the door is open to
commercialization of sports, to corruption and cheating,'' the
report said.

Italian Gasoline Station Operators To Strike In December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The three unions representing Italy's gasoline
station operators on Wednesday threatened to strike for five days
in December.
	   The unions asked their members to shut down stations from 7 p.m.
on December 1 to 7 a.m. on December 4, and again from 7 p.m. on
December 15 to 7 a.m. on December 19.
	   The government wants to close 7,000 of the 28,000 gasoline
stations in Italy because they no longer meet Italian and European
Union safety standards. The unions agreed to the closures in
exchange for financial and regulatory commitments from the Ministry
of Industry. But now the unions now say the ministry isn't living
up to its side of the bargain.

Ukrainian government approves plan for additional budget revenues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government will sell state-owned
hotels and tax mobile telephone users under a plan aimed at
boosting budget revenues through 1999, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The government plan, approved earlier in the week, sets a target
of 2.7 billion hryvna (dlrs 787 million at the current rate) in
additional budget revenues and 1.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 379
million) in payments to the state Pension Fund.
	   To achieve that goal, the government plans to force debtor
companies to pay at least 30 percent of their debts to the state,
and threatens to seize or sell debtors' properties to do so, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   The Cabinet also would seek to privatize several
energy-producing companies and the Ukrtelecom telecommunications
monopoly, a move that has long been in the works, and to sell
several state-run hotels in the capital Kiev and the cities of
Odessa and Lviv.
	   A 1 percent Pension Fund tax would be introduced on deals
involving the purchase and sale of real estate, Interfax reported.
	   Mobile telephone users would be taxed 10 hryvna (dlrs 2.9) a
month, casinos would pay an additional fixed tax on each gambling
table or machine, and an income tax would be introduced for
pensioners whose allowance is especially high.
	   Most of the planned revenues are to be used for paying back
wages and pensions and various social subsidies.
	   The government owes 3.84 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) in
back wages and social subsidies and another 2.08 billion hryvna
(dlrs 606 million) in unpaid pensions.
	   In turn, the state is owed more than 8 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.3
billion) in unpaid taxes. But government efforts to force the
reluctant _ and often financially struggling _ debtor companies to
pay have yielded little result so far.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Four days after escaping from prison using
bedsheets tied together, a Russian accused of kidnapping a young
man and leaving him to die in a pit in the woods was re-arrested in
Berlin on Wednesday.
	   Sergei Serov, 38, was arrested in an apartment in eastern Berlin
just as he was shaving his head _ apparently for a disguise, police
said.
	   The person living in the apartment had found Serov shivering on
the street the night before and invited him in out of pity, police
said.
	   The next morning the renter became suspicious that his house
guest might be Serov, whose picture was all over newspapers and
television.
	   He called police, who surrounded the building and sent a special
commando team in to arrest the man. Authorities said Serov was
taken to a Berlin prison hospital, where he was being treated for
minor injuries under heavy security.

New political party set up to reduce Britain's links with Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A millionaire businessman launched a new political
party Wednesday aimed at reducing Britain's involvement with the
European Union and warding off adoption of the single European
currency.
	   Geoff Southall said his Democratic Party would produce policies
on all issues affecting the country, not just Europe.
	   ``It just so happens that the major stumbling block to returning
to democracy in this country is the European issue and most British
people don't want monetary union and rule from Brussels,'' said
Southall, a former election agent for the late billionaire Sir
James Goldsmith, who had set up his own anti-European Union party.
	   Southall, a 58-year-old electronics engineer who owns a
manufacturing company, refused to say how much money he would
invest in the party, saying he did want to be accused of ``buying
democracy.''
	   Tony Blair's Labor government says it favors entry into the euro
early in the next century, although polls show most Britons are
suspicious of the new currency, which will be launched in 11
European Union countries on Jan. 1.
	   The Conservative Party, which was in power 18 years until a
crushing defeat in May 1997 elections, says it will not sign up for
the euro for a decade.
	   Goldsmith's Referendum Party folded after the 1997 elections
because Britain's predominantly two-party system makes it difficult
for smaller parties to win seats.

NATO commander stresses need for quick settlement in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ NATO's top commander in Europe warned
Wednesday that diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting settlement in
Kosovo must advance quickly because the cease-fire there is shaky
and could collapse within months.
	   ``Despite all our best efforts ... we probably have only a
two-to-four month window of relative peace,'' U.S. Gen. Wesley
Clark said in Portugal. ``We must use this respite to achieve a
just and durable political settlement.''
	   Independence-minded ethnic Albanians and government security
forces are preparing for further confrontation in the southern Serb
province, Clark said at a Lisbon meeting of the Atlantic Treaty
Association, which groups various official bodies from NATO
countries.
	   ``The Albanian Kosovars are strengthening their force, they're
organizing, they're achieving greater discipline, and they're
preparing for what could happen if the political solution doesn't
appear.
	   ``No doubt the other side, the Serbs, are doing the same
thing,'' he said.
	   As part of the deal struck Oct. 12 by U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, up to 1,800
unarmed civilian verifiers are to be sent to Kosovo. They are to
ensure Milosevic abides by the agreement.
	   A French-commanded extraction force, based in neighboring
Macedonia, will be ready to rescue the verifiers if they come under
threat.
	   The force ``will have response times measured in everything from
minutes and hours up to days,'' depending on needs, according to
Clark, who said he will lead the extraction force's chain of
command.

Austria expanding random checks to screen illegal aliens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria is expanding random checks of
foreigners to stem the influx of illegal aliens after the abolition
of border controls under the Schengen agreement, government
officials said Wednesday.
	   The decision was made after a meeting of senior police officials
from Italy, Bavaria and Austria after hundreds of foreigners,
including many Kurds, tried to cross from Germany into Italy via
Austria.
	   Some 200 of 600 Kurds trying to enter Italy via the Brenner Pass
have been turned back since Saturday by the Italians because they
had no residence permits. They wanted to demonstrate in Rome for
their underground leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is under arrest in
Italy.
	   Austria was forced to respond because of the border tightening,
said Rudolf Gollia, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
	   The illegal aliens were to be taken into Italy by German and
Polish man smugglers, the Vienna newspaper Die Presse reported
Wednesday.
	   It described them as a ``byproduct'' of the current Kurdish
problem. Thousands of supporters of Ocalan are currently in or on
their way to Rome to strengthen support for their leader, whom
Turkey wants extradited.
	   After the abolition of border controls this year under the
Schengen accord, random checks of foreigners traveling in Austria
will be expanded under a new law to be enacted early next year.
However, Gollia made clear the new controls are being introduced
now.
	   Up to now, those controls were limited to an area of 30
kilometers (20 miles) behind the border. In the future they will be
made on all international auto routes and rail links.

Nine Christians slain in northern Pakistani city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Unidentified men Wednesday slaughtered
nine members of a Christian family _ including an infant _ with
knives in northern Pakistan for allegedly practicing black magic.
	   Police said the killers slashed to death the entire family of
John A. Sabir in the northern city of Nowshero, 45 kilometers (30
miles) east of Peshawar, capital of the Northwest Frontier
province.
	   Three of this grandchildren under 10 were killed, including a
seven-month-old infant.
	   The killers inscribed on the walls with the blood of the victims
that ``a chapter of black magic has ended,'' police said.
	   Religious minorities in Pakistan often complain of persecution
and attacks by the extremist Muslim religious groups.
	   Police said they are investigating the case, but have no clues
so far about the motive of the killings.

EBRD considers loan to Russia to finance gold production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development may grant loans to Russia to finance the production of
up to 50 tons of gold, officials said Wednesday.
	   ``We are talking with the (Russian) Finance Ministry, but the
talks are in an initial stage and it would be too early to talk
about any concrete amounts,'' said Julia Silberman, EBRD
spokeswoman in London.
	   The bank may finance the production of up to 50 tons of gold,
said German Kuznetsov, Deputy Finance Minister and head of the
State Reserve for Precious Metals and Stones (Gokhran), according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   He did not say when the financing might come.
	   Silberman said it was too early to say what form the possible
loan would take.
	   Central Bank officials have said they plan to boost the bank's
gold reserves, and tie the amount of rubles in circulation to the
amount of gold in the bank's vaults.
	   This year, Russia's gold output will total around 120 tons, a
fraction less than in 1997 when in it 121.3 tons, Kuznetsov said
recently.

Bail denied for U.S. born teen-ager held for three months in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ A military court judge on Wednesday
rejected a defense request for bail for an American-born teenager
held for three months on charges of membership in the Islamic
militant group Hamas.
	   Lt. Col. Yoram Chaniel also ordered a delay in the trial of
18-year-old Hashem Mufleh after prison officials failed to deliver
him to the court from a jail in the Israeli town of Ashkelon.
	   Mufleh's trial is now scheduled to begin Dec. 9.
	   Chaniel allowed a witness to testify despite objections from
defense attorney Jonathan Kuttab, who argued that no proceedings
should be held without his client.
	   A classmate and fellow prisoner who was not identified told the
court that Mufleh attended religious study sessions under the
auspices of the Islamic Bloc student group, an organization which
Israel has outlawed.
	   Alia Mufleh, 24, a sister of Mufleh, denied that her brother was
a member of Hamas and dismissed the charges against him as
``ridiculous.''
	   ``The charges mean nothing - since when is it illegal to have
religious lessons or post articles?'' Alia said, speaking through a
wire fence as she waited outside the military court grounds.
	   Mufleh's mother Itaf, wearing a white head scarf and long beige
dress, stood next to her, clutching her blue American passport as
she spoke of her hopes for the release of her son.
	   A charge sheet issued by the military court contains seven
charges against Mufleh, including membership in Hamas, throwing an
object in the direction of moving vehicles, distributing Hamas
leaflets and participating in a demonstration commemorating Hamas
bomb-maker Mohyedin Sharif, who was killed in a murky circumstances
earlier this year.
	   Mufleh has been in jail since being arrested at Ben Gurion
Airport in Tel Aviv on Aug. 18 as he was boarding a flight to the
United States with his mother. His family said he had planned to
begin studies at a community college in Gallup, New Mexico, where
his father lives.
	   Mufleh has lived with his mother for 16 years in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, which is under control of the Palestinian
autonomy government.
	   According to Mufleh's family, during his first month in prison
Mufleh was deprived of sleep and subjected to loud music, tied in a
contorted position for hours and had a hood placed over his head
for long periods.
	   A few days after Mufleh's arrest, the U.S. State Department
protested his detention, his interrogation and the conditions under
which he was being kept. His family said that because of the
intervention of U.S. officials in Israel, Mufleh's prison
conditions have since improved.
	   U.S. Consul Todd Haskell was present in court Wednesday to
monitor the proceedings.
	   Earlier this month several Arab American and human rights groups
launched a campaign to press for Mufleh's release.

Officials evacuate two towns as Mexican volcano rumbles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Officials were evacuating two
villages in southern Mexico ahead of a feared eruption of the
nation's most explosive volcano.
	   Troops and police moved a total of about 175 people from Yerba
Buena in Colima state and from Juan Barragan in Jalisco state,
according to civil defense officials. Both villages are about five
miles (eight kilometers) from the Colima Volcano's crater.
	   The 12,700-foot (3,870-meter) volcano, about 280 miles (450
kilometers) west of Mexico City, erupted in 1991 and again in 1994.
	   Javier Velasco, technical secretary of civil defense for Colima,
called the measure a ``preventive evacuation.''
	   Volcanologists have recorded 7,000 small tremors at the volcano
and have detected chemical changes in waters near the mountain.
	   About 300,000 people live within 25 miles (40 kilometers) of the
volcano's peak, and Colima city, the capital of Colima state, is
within 20 miles (32 kilometers) of the peak.
	   In 1991, a dome rose to 100 feet (30 meters) above the crater
before collapsing. Lava solidified high on the slopes of the
volcano and hot rocks shot from the crater set some brush fires. A
more violent eruption occurred in 1913.
	   Volcanologists consider Colima to be the most dangerous volcano
in Mexico. It has staged violent eruptions several times in recent
centuries, and 4,000 years ago experienced a major explosion.

Albania plays to scoreless draw against Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania played to a scoreless draw
against Greece Wednesday, gaining another point in Group 2 of the
2000 European Championship.
	   After three games, Latvia tops the group with six points, Greece
is second with five, followed by Norway and Slovenia with four
each. Georgia has three, while Albania remains at the bottom with
two.
	   The game was Albania's first official sports event since that
country slipped into chaos following an armed uprising in 1997.
	   Encouraged by most of the 15,000 spectators that packed Tirana's
Qemal Stafa stadium, Albania went on the attack from the start to
create major problems for Greece's defense.
	   The hosts came close to opening the score on two occasions in
the first half, but striker Alban Bushi lost both.
	   Bushi's first came when he took advantage of a moment of
confusion between Nikos Dabitzas and goalie Ilias Atmatzidis at the
edge of the Greek area. He gained the ball, but his lob went wide
in the 23rd minute.
	   One minute later, his shot from close range hit Atmatzidis' left
upright.
	   Costas Frantzeskos missed a major scoring opportunity for Greece
in the first half when, face-to-face with goalie Fotaq Strakosha,
he shot wide in the 25th.
	   The second period saw Greece becoming more aggressive, losing at
least three scoring opportunities. The most important ones came in
the 62nd and 86th minutes, when shots by Demis Nikolaidis and
Grigoris Georgatos hit Strakosha's bars.
	   Albania flubbed its biggest chance in the 66th when Atmatzidis
made a key save to a shot by Igli Tare from three meters (yards).

Berlin's 1936 Olympic stadium to undergo major overhaul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin's crumbling Olympic stadium, built by the
Nazis for the 1936 Games, will be restored and turned into a
state-of-the-art multipurpose arena that will be ready as a
potential site for the 2006 World Cup.
	   The Berlin city government will decide Dec. 1 which of the two
firms will be given the go-ahead to renovate the vast stadium. The
two companies _ one from Hamburg and Berlin and the other from
Stuttgart _ have been shortlisted from 10 bidders.
	   Estimates for the cost of the project published Wednesday in
Berlin newspapers range from at least 450 million marks (dlrs 270
million) for the cheaper proposal to up to 700 million marks (dlrs
420 million) for the more expensive bid.
	   Both projects involve movable bleachers that would reduce or
increase the seating capacity at will. For soccer matches, the
stadium would have a capacity of about 77,000, roughly the current
number of seats. For athletics, it would be able to accommodate
about 67,000.
	   Germany is bidding to stage the 2006 World Cup and several of
the country's big stadiums need extensive and expensive overhauls.
	   The Berlin stadium is listed as a historic monument.
	   While Hitler hoped the stadium would provide a grand stage for
showcasing the Nazis' perceptions of racial supremacy, American
star Jesse Owens made a mockery out of the Nazi theories by
sweeping the sprint and long jump gold medals.
	   The stadium is now home to the Bundesliga soccer club Hertha
Berlin. City authorities turned down a proposal to make the stadium
a soccer-only arena.
	   The federal government, which is moving to Berlin from Bonn, has
pledged about 100 million marks (dlrs 60 million) to the project,
with the city also providing a similar sum. The rest will come from
private investors.

Britain's highest court to rule on Pinochet immunity Nov. 25
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court will announce next week
whether former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has immunity
from arrest and can leave Britain, officials said Wednesday.
	   The five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, headed by Lord
Justice Gordon Slynn, will present its judgment on Nov. 25, which
coincides with the general's 83rd birthday.
	   Spanish authorities, who want to extradite Pinochet to face
charges of genocide, murder and torture during his 1973-90 rule,
and British prosecutors had appealed a High Court ruling saying he
has immunity from arrest under English law as a former head of
state.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 on the Spanish warrant while in a
London hospital bed recuperating from back surgery.
	   On Tuesday, a British court ordered the former dictator to
appear in court Dec. 2 and also said the British government must
decide by then _ if the Lords rule against him _ whether
extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
ousted Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Pinochet remains under police guard in Grovelands Priory, a
north London hospital. New bail conditions agreed upon Tuesday say
he can be moved, but must remain under guard.
	   Lawyers say he now is fit enough to leave the hospital.
	   By tradition in the House of Lords, the judges enter the chamber
together and present their judgment in the form of a speech.
	   There usually is a leading judgment, but each judge can spell
out individually the reason for his decision on a particular legal
point. Judges who dissent give separate judgments.
	   The Lords, who can decide by a 3-2 majority, ended the six-day
appeal hearing Nov. 12.

Ombudsman criticizes police and justice officials for EU summit

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The national ombudsman Wednesday
ruled that police and justice officials overstepped their authority
by arresting and deporting demonstrators during a June 1997
European Union summit.
	   Ombudsman Marten Oosting said officials were more interested in
having the summit run smoothly than they were in sticking to the
letter of the law.
	   Protesters used the summit to spotlight issues ranging from
squatters' rights to the high level of unemployment in Europe.
Although the protests were mainly peaceful, there were a number of
violent clashes between riot police and demonstrators during the
two-day summit.
	   About 350 people were arrested and taken into protective custody
to prevent riots during the meeting of 15 European Union heads of
state.
	   Citing a little-used law known as Article 140, police arrested
demonstrators on suspicion of membership of an organized crime
gang.
	   Oosting did not comment on the mass arrests using Article 140,
since protesters have filed an official complaint at an Amsterdam
court and an appeal in the case is pending.
	   Police also arrested and handcuffed 150 Italian protesters
before they could get off a train in Amsterdam. They were taken to
a local prison and later deported along with another 100 non-Dutch
protesters arrested in the city center.
	   Oosting said the detention and deportation of non-Dutch
demonstrators violated their basic right to protest and broke Dutch
law which stipulates that EU residents cannot be deported.
	   City spokeswoman Janneke Zumpolle said the arrest of Italian
protesters was necessary since they were unruly and noisy in the
train. She said 1,350 other Italians on the train were allowed to
demonstrate.
	   Statements issued by the national ombudsman, a state-appointed
watchdog of public standards, are not legally binding.

Polish actor dies in Lithuania following mugging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Kazimierz Zaklukiewicz, a leading
Polish stage actor, has died after being beaten by two teen-agers
in an apparent mugging.
	   Zaklukiewicz, 47, was in the Lithuanian capital performing with
a Polish theater group, when he was attacked last Wednesday by two
youths who beat him with a club.
	   He died of head injuries on Tuesday night.
	   The two youths arrested in connection with the attack will be
charged with murder, prosecutors said. The attackers reportedly
robbed Zaklukiewicz of the equivalent of about dlrs 30, the Baltic
News Service reported.

Health officials say smoking on the rise in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 40 percent of Ukraine's
working-age population is smoking and the habit is on the rise amid
women and young people, the Health Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Up to 120,000 Ukrainians die every year of tobacco-related
diseases in this nation of 50 million people, it said.
	   Some 41.4 percent of the working-age population of 29 million,
or 12 million people, are smokers, health authorities said in a
report carried by the independent UNIAN news agency. It did not
indicate figures for smokers of all ages.
	   More than 90 percent of male and nearly 70 percent of female
smokers acquired the habit before the age of 24, health officials
said.
	   The report noted that the smoking rate has been rising steadily
among women and young people over the past 20 years, although no
figures were provided.
	   Tobacco advertising has been limited in Ukraine, but few
restaurants and bars have separate non-smoking sections, and health
activists lack the funding for serious anti-smoking campaigns.

All goes normal as U.N. resumes monitoring of Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ When U.N. weapons inspectors went back to
work Wednesday, it was so normal it seemed as if the last two weeks
of high tension never happened.
	   The six vehicles from the U.N. Special Commission investigating
Iraq's hidden arms pulled out of UNSCOM's headquarters on Baghdad's
eastern edge. Accompanying them were a half dozen cars full of
Iraqi escorts _ a sign that Iraq was cooperating.
	   The weapons inspectors would not talk to reporters and TV crews,
as usual. And their spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not say
where the inspectors were going or what tasks they would perform.
	   ``The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center has resumed
full-range activities,'' was her succinct _ and bureaucratic _
announcement of the return to work.
	   In fact, the inspectors went back to the job only after the
United States and Britain threatened air strikes against Iraq
unless it removed its restrictions on the inspectors.
	   Iraq backed down Saturday as air and missile attacks were about
to be unleashed.
	   On Wednesday, the first evidence came that Iraq was cooperating
as promised in its Saturday statement. It provided the escorts
necessary under Iraq-U.N. agreements; in the past it has denied
escorts to block inspections.
	   Ms. Cross would not say how things went after the inspectors
returned from work. They were expected to limit their first visits
to sites where they have installed cameras and sensors for
long-term monitoring.
	   The surprise checks that in the past created clashes with Iraq
will come later, Ms. Cross has said. These are visits to sites
where it's suspected Iraq has hidden material related to chemical
and biological weapons programs or long-range missiles.
	   Iraq suspended U.N. weapons monitoring activities on Oct. 31,
and UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
investigates Iraq's nuclear programs, pulled out their inspectors
last week.
	   Eighty inspectors from UNSCOM and six from the IAEA returned
Tuesday. Another six inspectors returned to Baghdad from the Gulf
state of Bahrain on Wednesday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted. Iraq says that it has
already complied with the U.N. demands.
	   One reason Iraq accepted the inspectors back was to get a
promised U.N. Security Council review of how well it has lived up
to resolutions on its most dangerous weapons.
	   Iraq wants the review to lead to a quick lifting of U.N.
sanctions, but both the United States and Britain have resisted any

Congo's Kabila says he's ready to negotiate with Rwanda, Uganda

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila said
Wednesday he was ready to enter immediate talks with Rwanda and
Uganda on ending their support for the three-month rebellion in his
country.
	   However, Kabila gave no indication of softening his negotiating
stance. He stressed that any talks would center on setting a date
for the departure of the neighboring countries from Congo, and
accused the two countries of ``pillaging'' his nation.
	   ``We'll hold talks with them so that they can leave our
country,'' Kabila told reporters after a meeting with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   ``From our point of view, this is a case of aggression, with
Congo as the victim,'' he said, adding that negotiations would show
the world that Rwanda and Uganda were motivated by the desire to
plunder Congo's mineral wealth.
	   The anti-Kabila offensive has made steady gains in both northern
Congo and in the southern, mineral-rich provinces of Eastern Kasai
and Katanga.
	   Kabila ruled out any talks with the Congolese rebels _ a
coalition of Tutsi fighters, former soldiers and former Kabila
allies _ who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The rebellion broke out Aug. 2, and Kabila has relied heavily on
the support of his regional allies, including Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Angola and Chad.
	   Kabila accused South Africa of taking ``a dubious stance''
towards the conflict in Congo, and of leaning towards support for
the rebellion.
	   South Africa ``supports the aggressors through ambiguous
statements and doesn't draw a distinction between the aggressors
and those who are legitimately defending Congo's independence and
sovereignty,'' he said.
	   Kabila met with Dos Santos to discuss continued Angolan military
support for the fight against the rebels trying to oust him.
	   However, Dos Santos is increasingly concerned about the mounting
threat at home from the former rebel group UNITA which recently
attacked remote villages in contravention of the country's 1994
peace pact, and unconfirmed reports say Luanda is considering
withdrawing its troops from Congo.
	   Dos Santos declined to answer questions from journalists.
	   Kabila left Luanda two hours before his scheduled departure.

Miners protest industry reforms discussed by parliament

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Some 300 miners from a leftist union on
Wednesday protested in front of the parliament building in Warsaw
against planned closure of mines and demanded pay increases.
	   The demonstration came while parliament was discussing drastic
reforms of Poland's inefficient mining industry.
	   Parliament speaker Maciej Plazynski came out to talk to the
protesters from the southern industrial region of Silesia, after
they threw fire crackers and chanted ``close the government not the
mines,'' and ``Balcerowicz must go.''
	   Leszek Balcerowicz is Polish finance minister and deputy prime
minister and the author of stringent economic reform plans, that
among other things, call for cutting inefficient jobs to make
losing enterprises profitable.
	   Parliament was debating the plan to restructure the coal mining
industry, which has 7 million zlotys (dlrs 2 million) debt. The
plan calls for reducing production from 137 million tons last year
to 112 million tons by 2002. Some 245,000 jobs are to be reduced
over the next three years to 138,000, and wage increases are to be
limited.
	   The program would cost 15 billion zlotys (dlrs 4.3 billion),
according to government estimates.

IAPA report: In U.S., press freedom has been `turned on its head'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With IAPA-Publishers Elected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) _ The Inter American Press
Association reported Wednesday that freedom of the press in the
United States has been ``turned on its head.''
	   As part of a series of reports from IAPA countries across the
Western Hemisphere, American media delegates meeting in this
Atlantic resort reported that the question today in the United
States is ``whether the media is too free.''
	   ``This has come about because of revulsion over the detailed
coverage of the Monica Lewinsky sex saga and what were seen as
excesses in covering the O.J. Simpson trial,'' the IAPA report
said.
	   It added that U.S. news coverage was entangled in a series of
scandals while pursuing the Lewinsky story, but that public opinion
of the press had risen in the polls since the earlier days of the
story.
	   The report quoted John Seigenthaler, founder of the First
Amendment Center, as saying Americans are living in the ``age of
public distrust of the media.'' It noted the firing of several
journalists during the past year for fabricating stories while
working for prestigious newspapers.
	   Robert Giles, who heads the Media Studies Centers in New York,
was quoted as saying in the report that ``there have been more mea
culpas this year than at any time in history.''
	   The 54th annual IAPA conference that ended Wednesday involved
hundreds of newspaper publishers from across the Americas.

Serbian president turns down unofficial U.S. peace plan

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's president on Wednesday
rejected a U.S.-drafted plan for Kosovo's future as giving too much
power to ethnic Albanians, the overwhelming majority in the Serbian
province.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic criticized the latest U.S.
proposal, which reportedly would give Kosovo virtual self-rule.
	   ``It does not respect full equality of all ethnic communities in
Kosovo,'' Milutinovic said in a speech to local Serb officials who
attended the meeting at his behest.
	   Milutinovic also warned that Kosovo Albanian rebels seeking
independence would be ``neutralized'' if they continue what he
called attacks on government forces. The guerrillas say they are
only responding to government attacks.
	   A draft proposal by U.S. mediator in Kosovo, Christopher Hill,
published Wednesday in an Albanian-language paper, envisages almost
no Serbian control of the province. Instead the province would be
under partial jurisdiction of the Yugoslav federation, made up of
Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Milutinovic rejected such a plan as contravening Serbia's
``territorial integrity.''
	   The draft said Kosovo would have its own president, courts,
government and parliament. Only defense, foreign affairs, customs,
foreign trade and monetary policy would be in the hands of the
Yugoslav federation.
	   Kosovo's many ethnic communities would share power according to
ethnic structure _ giving Kosovo's 90-percent Albanian majority the
clear advantage _ and solving disputed internal issues in the
Kosovo Supreme Court. If the dispute remains unresolved it would go
to the European courts.
	   Disputes with Serbia and the federation would be solved in a
special court, which would include representatives of Yugoslavia,
Kosovo and the international community.
	   The reported plan seems to push Kosovo further away from Serbia
and bring it closer to becoming a de-facto third republic in the
Yugoslav federation.
	   Milutinovic indicated that Serbia was willing to tolerate
``democratic self-rule through parliamentary, executive and
judicial bodies and a local police,'' he said. But such self-rule
could come only ``within Serbia,'' he said.
	   Milutinovic insisted that Serbs and even tinier minorities like
ethnic Turks should have equal clout to ethnic Albanians, who make
up 90 percent of the province, Milutinovic said.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, trying to find a peace formula,
discussed the American draft on Tuesday with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, whose support is crucial to the success of any
agreement. An uneasy cease-fire has for the most part ended eight
months of fighting between them and a joint force of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces.
	   A top ethnic negotiator in the camp of moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova indicated Tuesday his side could settle for
less than independence. Fehmi Agani said giving Kosovo the same
rights as Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia would be
acceptable, if such status were respected by Serbia.
	   But it was unclear whether the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
would agree to any deal short of the independence they have been
fighting for. The guerrillas said they would give their opinion
next week.
	   Agani and others close to Rugova have rejected Milutinovic's
offer for direct talks without foreign mediation as a cheap
publicity stunt. The ethnic Albanians have so far rejected 16 such
invitations for talks by the Serbian government.

France refuses to extradite former British spy

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A former M15 intelligence agent walked out of La
Sante prison on Wednesday a free man, hours after a French appeals
court rejected a request by Britain to extradite the one-time spy.
	   David Shayler, 32, faced being charged under Britain's Official
Secrets Acts and up to two years in prison if he had been deported
by French authorities who had arrested him on Aug. 1 at Scotland
Yard's request.
	   Instead, the court ordered Shayler freed from La Sante prison in
southern Paris, judicial sources said.
	   Shayler's two brothers hugged him as Shayler emerged from the
prison carrying two cardboard boxes with his personal belongings.
	   ``I am glad to be out of prison. I shouldn't have had to spend
four months in prison for criticizing MI5,'' he said. ``It's a very
happy day for me and for civil liberties and a very sad and
embarrassing one for MI5 and the government.''
	   The former spy admitted that he sold information on Britain's
MI5 domestic intelligence agency to a London newspaper for 20,000
pounds (dlrs 33,400).
	   At the time of his arrest, Home Secretary Jack Straw said that
Shayler had access to highly sensitive information.
	   The French court's decision for letting Shayler go was not made
public, nor it's reason for doing so.
	   Shayler's lawyers argued that the British extradition request
had a ``political character'' and was therefore prohibited under
French law. The French government cannot go against a court ruling
and order Shayler to be turned over to the British.
	   Shayler was arrested in France after he reportedly considered
releasing information about an alleged British plot to kill Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, which the British government denies.
	   Shayler worked for MI5 internal security service from 1994 until
1997. He fled to France last year after selling stories about the
agency's operations to a British newspaper.
	   Libya also had asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Until his arrest, Shayler had been living with his girlfriend in
a remote part of rural France.
	   In London, the Home Office said it was up to French prosecutors
to decide whether to further appeal the court ruling.
	   The British Government would be keeping in close touch with
French authorities, said a spokeswoman.

Israel-Palestinian talks on final settlement resume

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the Mideast peace accord was
moving forward, Israel and the Palestinians resumed long-suspended
talks on a lasting peace treaty Wednesday and agreed to formally
reopen those negotiations with a ceremony next week.
	   Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas, who met with his counterpart
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said that Israel would carry
out the first stage of a long-overdue West Bank troop withdrawal
Friday and release 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``Palestinian and Israeli security officials will meet Thursday
to discuss the maps and preparations for the redeployment,'' Abbas
told The Associated Press. They will also complete paper-work for
the opening of the Palestinian airport.
	   According to the Wye River peace agreement signed by the two
sides in Washington last month, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank in three stages in exchange for
Palestinian security and anti-terror measures.
	   In final status talks, Sharon and Abbas, also known as Abu
Mazen, will tackle the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab
conflict including permanent borders, refugees, water, Jewish
settlements and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.
	   ``We are starting today to negotiate the permanent agreement,''
Sharon told reporters at the start of the meeting. ``I think that
we have to look to the future. Looking to the past will not help
us.''
	   Alone except for a translator, the two men sat across from each
other in the second-floor of the barracks-like buildings in
Israel's Foreign Ministry complex.
	   Afterwards, Abu Mazen told the AP they discussed on-going work
between negotiating committees on the economy, a Palestinian
seaport and future Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``Within a week there will be an opening ceremony for the
resumption of the final status talks, it will be in the Palestinian
autonomous areas,'' Abu Mazen said.
	   The Palestinians were also preparing to issue Wednesday a list
of rules and regulations regarding weapons. Israel insisted as part
of the peace agreement that Palestinian forces disarm militants and
others carrying illegal weapons in territory under their control.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet is
to convene Thursday to review Palestinian progress in the accord
before giving the final go ahead for the first withdrawal from 2
percent of land in the northern West Bank.
	   The Cabinet was also expected to discuss a dispute over the
prisoner release. Palestinian officials complained that 150 of the
250 prisoners to be freed were ordinary criminals and not political
prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an on-going effort by Jewish settlers
to take-over more West Bank land.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a rocky hilltop near the
Jewish settlement of Kedumim on Wednesday. About 30 settlers camped
on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were establishing a new
community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied. Eleven settlers were detained for
questioning, according to Israeli police.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by
confiscating Arab-owned land to build access roads to settlements
that would be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory after
the Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``This is an obvious violation of the agreement,'' said Ahmed
Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996
and is slated to be completed by the end of the interim framework,
including the Wye accord, on May 4, 1999.
	   Earlier, Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio, ``At the end
of final status talks, we see the creation of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as the capital.''
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference of armed conflict by Arafat, led to
a mini-crisis Monday when Netanyahu placed the withdrawal on a
one-day suspension until Arafat retracted the statement.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Kazimierz Zaklukiewicz, a leading
Polish stage actor, has died of head injuries after being beaten by
two teen-agers.
	   Zaklukiewicz, 47, was in the Lithuanian capital performing with
a Polish theater group when he was attacked last week by two youths
who beat him with a club. He died Tuesday night.
	   The two youths arrested in connection with the attack will be
charged with murder, prosecutors said. The attackers reportedly
robbed Zaklukiewicz of the equivalent of dlrs 30, the Baltic News
Service reported.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ When U.N. weapons inspectors went back to
work Wednesday, it was so normal it seemed as if the last two weeks
of high tension never happened.
	   The six white vehicles from the U.N. Special Commission
investigating Iraq's hidden arms pulled out of UNSCOM's
headquarters on Baghdad's eastern edge. Accompanying them were a
half dozen cars full of Iraqi escorts _ a sign that Iraq was
cooperating.
	   The weapons inspectors would not talk to reporters and TV crews,
as usual. And their spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not say
where the inspectors were going or what tasks they would perform.
	   ``The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center has resumed
full-range activities,'' was her succinct _ and bureaucratic _
announcement of the return to work.
	   In fact, the inspectors went back to the job only after the
United States and Britain threatened air strikes against Iraq
unless it removed its restrictions on the inspectors.
	   Iraq backed down Saturday as air and missile attacks were about
to be unleashed.
	   On Wednesday, the first evidence came that Iraq was cooperating
as promised in its Saturday statement. It provided the escorts
necessary under Iraq-U.N. agreements; in the past it has denied
escorts to block inspections.
	   In New York, Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman at U.N. headquarters for
the weapons inspectors, told The Associated Press in a phone call
from Baghdad that teams went out ``on routine inspection.''
	   He said: ``They did not report any problems.''
	   Buchanan declined to give any details on how many inspectors
went into the field, where they went or when they returned.
	   Asked about his expectations for Iraqi cooperation in the
future, he said, ``We will wait and see.''
	   The inspectors were expected to limit their first visits to
sites where they have installed cameras and sensors for long-term
monitoring.

U.N. says malnourishment afflicts millions of North Korean
</HEADLINE>
children &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of
millions of North Korean children, with two-thirds of children
under age seven suffering malnourishment, U.N. experts said
Wednesday.
	   Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic
downturn have heavily damaged North Korea's crop production and
capacity to import food in the closed, communist nation.
	   A survey carried out in September and October also showed that
16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished,
with a body weight too low for their height.
	   That figure, which reflects ongoing shortages, is exceeded in
Asia only by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka.
	   Eighteen teams, each headed by a foreign official from the World
Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund or the European Union,
carried out the study.
	   They measured the weight and height of 1,800 North Korean
children from infants up to age seven in homes randomly selected in
areas where aid agencies have access. Those areas cover around 70
percent of the population.
	   It was the first ``technically sound survey'' of the problem,
UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters.
	   The most alarming findings were for toddlers aged one to two, 30
percent of whom were acutely malnourished.
	   At that age, ``malnutrition can permanently impair physical and
intellectual growth,'' said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director for
the region.
	   Children in North Korea's three largest cities _ Pyongyang,
Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their counterparts
elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys were almost
twice as badly affected as girls.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In the first major arms deal
by post apartheid South Africa, the government on Wednesday gave
preliminary approval to a 29.77 billion-rand (dlrs 5.22 billion)
package of jet fighters, submarines and other equipment.
	   The proposal includes 28 Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British
Aerospace of Sweden and England, three submarines and four corvette
warships from German consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from
Italian manufacturer Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from
British Aerospace.
	   Critics say it's wrong for the rainbow nation to spend so much
on weapons given the country's problems with poverty and 34 percent
unemployment.
	   Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Njongonkulu Ndungane has said
the money is ``desperately needed for reconstruction and
development'' after decades of apartheid rule that systematically
denied the non-white majority good housing, education and jobs.
	   But defense officials say the package will generate 65,000 new
jobs and a transfer of technology resulting from 110 billion rand
(dlrs 19.3 billion) in investments promised by the countries
selling the arms.
	   The new equipment is needed to replace obsolete armaments from
the heavily militarized apartheid government that left power after
the first democratic elections in 1994, said Deputy Defense
Minister Ronnie Kasrils in an SABC radio interview on Wednesday.
	   South Africa can ``go into the next century with a new defense
force capable ... of protecting our sovereignty and people,''
Kasrils said.
	   As an increasingly dominant regional military power, other
African countries are also looking to South Africa for help in
brokering the continent's ongoing conflicts.
	   The contracts attracted intense bidding despite strings
attached. The government is requiring that countries wishing to
sell weapons must invest an amount at least equal to the purchase
price into high technology industry here.
	   Government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said the finance minister
and a Cabinet subcommittee would negotiate further with the
suppliers over the coming weeks and possibly reduce the number of
items being purchased.
	   Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has raised questions about the
affordability, local newspapers reported this week.
	   Swedish Ambassador Paul Heineback said he expected ``very
tough'' negotiations over Sweden's investment, but added, ``I'm
quite confident there will be final agreement.''
	   The government placed the costs of the Gripen jets at 10.875
billion rand (dlrs 1.91 billion), the largest component of the
procurement.
	   The price of the corvettes was 6 billion rand (dlrs 1.05
billion), and 5.212 billion rand (dlrs 914.4 million) for the subs.
The German consortium includes Thyssen AG, Blohm and Voss AG and
Preussag AG.
	   The package would also include 4.728 billion rand (dlrs 838.6
million) for the Hawks; 2.168 billion rand (dlrs 380.4 million) for
	   the Agusta helicopters; and 787 million rand (dlrs 138 million)
for four maritime helicopters from GKN Westland of the United
Kingdom.

Greece says it has nothing to do with Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Wednesday told Turkey it had
nothing to do with a Kurdish rebel leader held in Italy, and called
on its neighbor to solve its domestic problems instead of issuing
threats of war.
	   ``I repeat, Greece has no involvement in this issue,'' said
government spokesman Yannis Nikolaou. ``Turkey must find a way to
solve its internal problems and not consider them an item for
export or the blame of others.''
	   Abdullah Ocalan, whose outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
has waged a 14-year guerrilla war in Turkey, was arrested last week
in Rome, where he is now seeking political asylum.
	   Turkey, pressing for the extradition of its most wanted man,
Tuesday accused Greece and Cyprus of ``playing with fire'' by
harboring Ocalan's allies.
	   ``We see their relations with the PKK, which has designs on
Turkey's territorial integrity, as very dangerous and which could
have irreparable repercussions '' for Greeks and Greek Cypriots,
the Turkish foreign ministry said.
	   During a visit to Turkey last month, Premier Costas Simitis
personally reassured his Turkish counterpart that Greece had no
ties with the PKK. The latest charges were angrily denied here.
	   ``Ankara is in a total state of confusion,'' the foreign
ministry said.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Yannos Kranidiotis also berated Turkey's
ambassador here during a Wednesday meeting.
	   Greece has appeared keen to stay out of the Ocalan affair,
despite growing domestic pressure. Earlier this month, 109 deputies
from the 300-member parliament signed an open invitation for Ocalan
to visit.
	   Local media and politicians have called for Greece's active
opposition to Ocalan's extradition to Turkey, where he could face
the death penalty.
	   ``It seems the Turkish side fails to understand that in Greece
citizens, let alone members of parliament, have absolute freedom to
express their opinion,'' the foreign ministry said.
	   But Ocalan on Wednesday also tried to drag Greece into the fray,
likening the plight of the Kurds to that of Greeks in Asia Minor
and Cyprus.
	   ``(Turkey's) objective is to clear Kurds out of southeast Turkey
just as they did to Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks,'' he said in
an interview with Italy's La Repubblica newspaper. ``They have the
same designs in Cyprus.''
	   He was referring to Turkey's 1974 invasion and occupation of
northern Cyprus, following an abortive Athens-backed coup by Greek
Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.

Officials: unemployment in Russia 11.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unemployment in Russia has reached 11.5 percent,
with 8.4 million people out of jobs, according to estimates by the
State Statistics Committee released Wednesday.
	   That is a 4.7 percent increase since October, the committee
said.
	   The official unemployment rate is only 2.5 percent, or 1.8
million people, the committee said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Many Russians do not register as unemployed, often because they
don't want to waste time on the procedure for the sake of
negligible benefits. The statistics committee apparently included
these people in the larger estimate.
	   Many of those who are officially employed are in fact also out
of work, as idle factories and troubled companies send scores of
employees on forced vacations.

Ex-Soviet Jewish heroes to have state allowances cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ They served time in Soviet prisons and Siberian
labor camps for teaching Hebrew and encouraging immigration to
Israel. Now, a group of former Soviet dissidents said Wednesday
that Israel has forgotten them.
	   Five Soviet refuseniks, so-named because they were refused
permission to go to the Jewish state, told a news conference that
the meager stipends they were receiving were being cut by the
government. They demanded full state pensions.
	   ``Thousands went around with our names engraved on their wrists,
but as soon as we reached Israel, we became people of the past,''
said Ida Nudel, 67, a former Russian refusenik, who spent four
years in Siberian exile for agitating on behalf of Jewish
prisoners.
	   Nudel is one of 850 ``prisoners of Zion'' living in Israel,
members of the Jewish underground, mostly from the former Soviet
Union, who risked their lives and freedom to protest human rights
violations.
	   Nudel, who reached Israel at the age of 57, said she expected
Israel to take better care of her and her colleagues, many of whom
arrived elderly or worn out from years of hard labor in prison and
had little chance of employment.
	   ``I came without language, without a profession,'' said Nudel.
	   Nudel, who is retired and lives on income from writing and
prizes received years ago, gets dlrs 250 each month from the Jewish
Agency.
	   The stipend is calculated on the basis of her four years in
exile in Siberia but does not take into account the full 17 years
she spent as an activist.
	   ``I gave up everything to work in the underground,'' she said,
adding that a pension would symbolize government recognition of her
contribution.
	   Last summer, in response to lobbying efforts by Nudel and
others, Israel b'Aliyah, a party headed by former refusenik Natan
Sharansky, now the trade minister, passed a law giving former
prisoners of Zion a government stipend.
	   But under the new arrangement, most people will actually receive
less money than they got from the Jewish Agency.
	   ``It's a grant; it's not a pension,'' said Roman Bronfman, the
chairman of Israel b'Aliyah.
	   Bronfman acknowledged that those who received money from the
Jewish Agency would take a cut in benefits. But he said the new
legislation would help a far larger group, about 2,000, not just
the 200 currently receiving grants from the Jewish Agency.
	   He said the amount of money hadn't been determined yet, but it
would be a few hundred dollars per month on average.
	   Former prisoners of Zion said the new stipend neither honors
their struggle nor pays the bills.
	   ``We are not beggars,'' said Victor Brailovsky, who was jailed
in Russia for creating a Jewish newspaper. ``We just want to get
what we deserve.''
	   Other former Soviet activists attending the news conference were
Yosef Begun, Vladamir Slepak and Yosef Mendelevich.

Asylum seekers dumped on street by Dutch volunteers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARNHEM, Netherlands (AP) _ More than 120 asylum seekers,
including 20 babies, were left without a roof over their heads
Wednesday when a voluntary group that said it could no longer
afford to take care of them.
	   As temperatures dropped, the refugees sat in buses or huddled
around fires outside an asylum seeker's camp near the central Dutch
city of Nijmegen.
	   Although the camp had 500 free beds, it was not allowed to house
the refugees, who fled to the Netherlands from countries all around
the world, because the Dutch government has already refused to
grant them asylum.
	   Because the refugees had already had asylum applications
rejected in other European Union nations before entering the
Netherlands, they have no right to stay in this country.
	   ``We can do no more. Our hands are empty,'' a spokeswoman for
the Arnhem group that turned the refugees out told Dutch television
news. The spokeswoman, identified only as I. Loeter, said her group
wanted to bring the refugees' plight to the public's attention.
	   Dutch parliament called an emergency late-night sitting
Wednesday to discuss the matter. The refugees were heading to a
Salvation Army center to seek shelter for the night.
	   Providing accommodation for asylum seekers in this overcrowded
nation reached crisis point recently when the government had to
pitch tents because all other refugee centers were full. The move
provoked a storm of protest, but while the protest has died down,
the tents remain.
	   Through September, 31,466 refugees applied for permission to
stay in the Netherlands this year _ a 30 percent increase from the
same period a year ago.

Germany agrees to 50-million-mark Jordanian debt relief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany on Wednesday agreed to forgive a
50-million- mark (dlrs 30 million) debt owed by Jordan as a
goodwill gesture toward the Arab kingdom.
	   A German Embassy statement said the debt relief agreement
covered the last trunch of 169.5 million marks (dlrs 102 million)
in debts owed to Germany accumulated by Jordan in the 1980s.
	   The statement did not disclose details of the agreement, saying
only that Jordan must spend at least half of the amount forgiven on
environmental protection and projects designed to alleviate
poverty.
	   Germany is one of Jordan's main European donors, contributing
more than dlrs 500 million to various water and education projects
since 1990.
	   Wednesday's debt-relief agreement was reached by visiting German
President Roman Herzog, who arrived in Jordan on Tuesday on the
third leg of a Middle East tour that has taken him to Israel and
Palestinian territories.
	   Accompanied by his wife Christine and a business delegation,
Herzog held talks with Crown Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent
while King Hussein, the Jordanian monarch, is away in the United
States for medical treatment.
	   Herzog also toured several German-financed projects and was
scheduled to visit historical and biblical sites before he flies on
Thursday.

USA (Stanford) vs. Canada (Edmonton) in race for 2001 championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After six editions in Europe and one in Asia, the
World Athletics Championships appear headed to North America for
the first time in 2001.
	   But will they go to the United States or Canada?
	   Stanford, the prestigious university in Palo Alto, Calif., and
Edmonton, capital of the Canadian province of Alberta, are the
favorites in the race for track and field's showcase event.
	   Paris and New Delhi, India, are also in the running for what is
considered the third biggest international sports event behind the
Olympics and the World Cup.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation will select the
winner Thursday in Monte Carlo, Monaco.
	   New Delhi has little chance of winning in the secret vote by 27
members of the IAAF Council. But Paris can't be counted out,
especially if Stanford and Edmonton cancel each other out.
	   Logic says it's time for the championships to go to North
America after Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991), Stuttgart
(1993), Goteborg (1995), Athens (1997) and Seville (1999).
	   ``I think it's going to go to North America,'' Nick Petredis,
chairman of the 2001 Partnership that is trying to secure the bid
for Stanford, said Wednesday. ``I just can't make a call which
way.''
	   This is Stanford's third bid after previous attempts for the
1997 and 1999 championships.
	   The IAAF's powerful Italian president, Primo Nebiolo, has
repeatedly stressed his desire to hold the championships in the
United States.
	   While America produces some of the world's greatest track and
field stars, the sport _ apart from during the Olympics _ continues
to founder in the United States from lack of public interest,
sponsors, funds and television coverage.
	   ``It is a very important event we need as a rallying point for
youth to showcase the sport, like the (1994) World Cup did for
soccer,'' Petredis said. ``We need to bring up the profile of the
sport in the U.S.''
	   Other strong selling points for Stanford are its location _ in
the popular San Francisco Bay Area _ and the prospect of a
lucrative American television deal.
	   The championships would be held in 86,000-seat Stanford Stadium,
with an adjacent nine-lane warmup track. The athletes' village
would be located 800 yards away from the warmup track, while hotels
in nearby San Jose would accommodate officials and visitors.
	   Petredis, a San Jose attorney, said the bid was backed by a
``significant amount'' of public money. He described the bid as
financially ``bulletproof,'' even though there are no government
guarantees.
	   ``Our position is that is not a proper use of money in the
U.S.,'' he said. ``We present a financially very sound bid that
will feature a unique insurance cover that guarantees our revenue.
We feel like we have done better than a government guarantee.''
	   In the past, the IAAF awarded a dlrs 7 million grant to cities
organizing the championships. But that stopped after Goteborg in
1995, leaving organizers to finance the event entirely on their
own.
	   Financial issues could be crucial in Thursday's decision.
	   ``You don't like to find problems when you arrive a year or a
few months from the championships,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri
said. ``It's important to be sure you choose a city with financial
capacity and organization.''
	   The Edmonton bid has broader and more high-profile support than
Stanford.
	   The Canadians sent a 27-member delegation to Monaco, headed by
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. Stanford sent five people.
	   The province has promised financial backing for the
championships, which would be held at Commonwealth Stadium, home of
the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos.
	   Even though Edmonton is a relatively small, out-of-the-way
place, the city believes it has the edge based on experience.
	   Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth Games, 1983 University
Games and 1996 world figure skating championships. Another Alberta
city, Calgary, held the 1984 Winter Olympics.
	   In the end, it could all come down to politics in the highly
political world of the IAAF.
	   ``It's no different than the Olympics,'' said Dale Schulha, a
member of the Edmonton bid committee. ``When you look at major
games like this that have world impact, there are a lot of
factors.''
	   The IAAF will also select the site of the less prestigious world
indoor championships of 2001. The candidates are Budapest, Hungary;
Lisbon, Portugal, and Borlange, Sweden.

Portuguese farmers send police on wild pig chase in protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Farmers sent police on a wild pig chase
Wednesday as they staged a second protest to demand tighter
restrictions on pork imports and increased government aid.
	   The farmers _ calling themselves the ``Movement of Bankrupt
Farmers'' _ released some 90 pigs at main avenues in Lisbon and two
inland cities before daybreak causing traffic havoc.
	   In Leiria, some 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital
Lisbon, the animals had the words ``Hunger'' and ``Misery'' written
across their backs while farmers also distributed pamphlets
demanding that ``the government feed (the pigs). We no longer
can,'' the national news agency Lusa reported.
	   A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said the government was
working on a solution to meet the farmers' demands, but gave no
details.
	   The movement staged its first protest Saturday, setting dozens
of squealing pigs loose outside the Agriculture Ministry, in
Lisbon.
	   Most of the pigs were rounded up by police Wednesday although
two were killed when they were accidentally run over by farmers.
	   Pork farmers have also held protests in France and Spain this
month to denounce plunging prices and demand more government aid.

Swiss to publish names of account holders whose assets were pooled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government said Wednesday it
will publish in January the names of some 580 mostly East Europeans
whose unclaimed assets were pooled into a humanitarian fund.
	   Applications for compensation will be processed by the Swiss
foreign ministry. The compensation paid will be the value of the
account with interest at a rate of 3.5 percent per year.
	   In 1962, Swiss financial institutions were required to register
with the government deposits unclaimed since the end of World War
II.
	   The government issued a decree transferring assets for which no
entitled owner could be found into a central fund. The money was
later used by Swiss humanitarian organizations.
	   In some cases, no search for the account holders was made.
	   ``These concerned assets of less than 1,000 Swiss francs (dlrs
730 at 1998 rates) as well as assets of people whose domicile or
nationality was unknown or their final residence was in the then
Communist countries of Eastern Europe,'' the government said in a
statement.
	   In the case of the latter, searches were not made ``because it
was feared that those affected would otherwise be subjected to
material and immaterial hardship by their home countries,'' it
continued.
	   The 3.5 percent interest rate was devised to reflect a fair
increase in the value of the deposits, taking into account that the
money was used only for humanitarian purposes and that no one
profited from holding it, officials said.
	   The list will be published and posted on the Internet. Account
holders and their heirs will be able to contact Swiss embassies
abroad and an information center in Bern.
	   Tracing the owners is expected to cost some 3 million francs
(dlrs 2.19 million). Compensation could amount to 7 million francs
(dlrs 5.11 million) if all applications are approved, said
Marie-Marceline Kurmann, spokeswoman for the government's task
force on World War II.
	   The government said all cases, including those where heirs lived
in Western Europe, can be compensated.
	   But account owners who lived in Poland and Hungary will be
excluded as those countries have already been compensated for the
assets and are themselves searching for those affected, it added.
	   Following a historians' report, the government in February 1997
agreed in principle to compensate traceable owners as a
``solidarity gesture.''
	   Subsequent investigations, carried out as part of the response
to intense international criticism over Switzerland's wartime
record and especially that of its banks, uncovered far more dormant
accounts.
	   The Swiss Bankers Association last year published two lists of
account holders. In October 1997, it said it was ``confident that
the vast majority of dormant assets from the period prior to 1945
have been identified.''

Federation parliament against special ties with Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from U.S. envoy Gelbard in 5th graf, CORRECTS
president's title in 2nd graf and syntax in 3rd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Lawmakers in Bosnia's
Muslim-Croat Federation parliament sharply criticized Wednesday an
agreement on special ties with neighboring Croatia, calling it
dangerous for Bosnia's sovereignty.
	   The agreement was initiated by Croatia and defines military,
economic and other relations between it and the Muslim-Croat half
of Bosnia. Ejup Ganic, president of the federation, was to sign it
in the Croatian capital Zagreb on Monday.
	   But pressure from Muslim lawmakers, who fear it will grant
neighboring Croatia too much control over Bosnia, prevented Ganic
from signing the agreement.
	   ``This leads to the capitulation of Bosnia,'' said lawmaker
Irfan Ajanovic Wednesday.
	   Speaking in Vienna, Austria, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to
former Yugoslavia, said, ``We would fully expect the Muslims to
implement the agreement, and Bosnia would lose support and respect
of the United States government if they did not go through with the
agreement.'' Gelbard had been asked by the Croats to mediate the
accord.
	   Relations between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have been uneasy
since they fought each other in 1993-94. Croatia aided the Bosnian
Croats throughout the Bosnian war.
	   Ajanovic noted that the agreement also opens the door for the
Bosnian Serb half to establish similar ties with Yugoslavia, which
would represent the division of Bosnia. Under the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement, Bosnia was divided into the Serb republic and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Croatia remains a major financial backer of Bosnian Croats, and
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is considered their chief
decision-maker.
	   While Western officials believe the agreement would define
relations, specifying military and economic cooperation in a
transparent way, others argue that any military support from
Croatia would give Croats the upper hand.
	   However, agreeing to the special ties could allow Bosnia use of
Croatia's southern port of Ploce, which Croatia agreed in Dayton to
let Bosnia use for 99 years. Croatia has been reluctant to really
make this happen.
	   Pressed by the West, Zagreb agreed to allow Bosnia access to
Ploce under the condition of signing and ratifying of the
agreement.
	   No date has been set for the signing, but even if Ganic signs
the agreement, it still has to pass parliament before it becomes
official.

Central European countries discuss how to attract investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Officials from 16 European countries that
for the most part have been excluded from the European Union
gathered Wednesday to discuss how to attract more foreign
investment.
	   The three-day meeting of the Central European Initiative is
aimed at making sure the region isn't left behind its western
neighbors, financially and politically.
	   Nenad Porges, Croatia's economic minister, said it will show
``that central and southern European countries make up a specific,
separate European region, which is capable of competing with other
European countries in attracting foreign investments.''
	   Each country is to present its economic achievements and
problems at the summit, and some bilateral agreement are expected.
	   The countries' foreign ministers and premiers also will discuss
regional politics and security.
	   The group was formed in 1989 to boost cooperation between its
member countries, most of whom are struggling to overcome their
communist past.
	   The CEI countries are Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czech
Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Ukraine, Belarus, as well as
four former Yugoslav countries, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and
Macedonia. Today's Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro,
is not a member.
	   Italy and Austria are the only European Union members among
them. The other members hope those two can give them useful tips or
even lobby for their entry into European institutions.
	   Porges said the relatively low foreign investment results from
legislatures that don't match up to Western standards, the complex
process of privatizing state-owned industries and a failure to
promote their economies properly.
	   Excluding Italy and Austria, foreign investment into the other
14 CEI countries totaled only dlrs 3 billion in 1997.
	   Croatia alone nearly doubled its 1997 total in the first six
months of 1998, drawing dlrs 544 million in direct foreign
investments into Croatian companies, the country's national bank
reported Wednesday.

16,000 evacuated near Berlin due to WWII-era bombs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defusing completed successfully &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ State roads were closed, trains
halted and 16,000 people evacuated from their homes near Berlin on
Wednesday while experts defused two big U.S. bombs from World War
II.
	   The chemical fuses on the bombs _ designed to ignite not on
impact but hours later _ were still live and could have gone off at
any time, authorities said.
	   One 500 kilo (1,100-pound) bomb was unearthed during
construction on a park, and a 250 kilo (550-pound) bomb was found
during work on a golf course.
	   An evacuation order for about half of Oranienburg was issued at
8 a.m. and lasted for six hours while the bombs were defused.
	   The city, just north of Berlin in former East Germany, was a
center for arms production during World War II _ including enriched
uranium for Adolf Hitler's atomic bomb project _ and so a prime
target for Allied bombing raids.
	   More than 60 duds have been found there since a construction
boom started following German unification in 1990. None have
exploded in Oranienburg since 1991, when three people were injured
and 10 houses destroyed.
	   Many residents resent the constant evacuation orders _ a dozen
so far this year alone. In April, 10 residents were fined 1,000
marks (dlrs 625) each for refusing to leave their homes during a
defusing action. Among them was a mother who barricaded herself and
her two young children in their apartment.
	   About 100 kilometers (60 miles) east in Frankfurt an der Oder,
450 people were evacuated from their homes Wednesday while
authorities defused two World War II-era bombs.

Swiss to publish names of account holders whose assets were pooled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix category code &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government said Wednesday it
will publish in January the names of some 580 mostly East Europeans
whose unclaimed assets were pooled into a humanitarian fund.
	   Applications for compensation will be processed by the Swiss
foreign ministry. The compensation paid will be the value of the
account with interest at a rate of 3.5 percent per year.
	   In 1962, Swiss financial institutions were required to register
with the government deposits unclaimed since the end of World War
II.
	   The government issued a decree transferring assets for which no
entitled owner could be found into a central fund. The money was
later used by Swiss humanitarian organizations.
	   In some cases, no search for the account holders was made.
	   ``These concerned assets of less than 1,000 Swiss francs (dlrs
730 at 1998 rates) as well as assets of people whose domicile or
nationality was unknown or their final residence was in the then
Communist countries of Eastern Europe,'' the government said in a
statement.
	   In the case of the latter, searches were not made ``because it
was feared that those affected would otherwise be subjected to
material and immaterial hardship by their home countries,'' it
continued.
	   The 3.5 percent interest rate was devised to reflect a fair
increase in the value of the deposits, taking into account that the
money was used only for humanitarian purposes and that no one
profited from holding it, officials said.
	   The list will be published and posted on the Internet. Account
holders and their heirs will be able to contact Swiss embassies
abroad and an information center in Bern.
	   Tracing the owners is expected to cost some 3 million francs
(dlrs 2.19 million). Compensation could amount to 7 million francs
(dlrs 5.11 million) if all applications are approved, said
Marie-Marceline Kurmann, spokeswoman for the government's task
force on World War II.
	   The government said all cases, including those where heirs lived
in Western Europe, can be compensated.
	   But account owners who lived in Poland and Hungary will be
excluded as those countries have already been compensated for the
assets and are themselves searching for those affected, it added.
	   Following a historians' report, the government in February 1997
agreed in principle to compensate traceable owners as a
``solidarity gesture.''
	   Subsequent investigations, carried out as part of the response
to intense international criticism over Switzerland's wartime
record and especially that of its banks, uncovered far more dormant
accounts.
	   The Swiss Bankers Association last year published two lists of
account holders. In October 1997, it said it was ``confident that
the vast majority of dormant assets from the period prior to 1945
have been identified.''

Austria expanding random checks to screen illegal aliens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria is expanding random checks of
foreigners to stem the influx of illegal aliens after the abolition
of border controls under the Schengen agreement, government
officials said Wednesday.
	   The decision was made after a meeting of senior police officials
from Italy, Bavaria and Austria after hundreds of foreigners,
including many Kurds, tried to cross from Germany into Italy via
Austria.
	   Some 200 of 600 Kurds trying to enter Italy via the Brenner Pass
have been turned back since Saturday by the Italians because they
had no residence permits. They wanted to demonstrate in Rome for
their underground leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is under arrest in
Italy.
	   Austria was forced to respond because of the border tightening,
said Rudolf Gollia, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
	   The illegal aliens were to be taken into Italy by German and
Polish man smugglers, the Vienna newspaper Die Presse reported
Wednesday.
	   It described them as a ``byproduct'' of the current Kurdish
problem. Thousands of supporters of Ocalan are currently in or on
their way to Rome to strengthen support for their leader, whom
Turkey wants extradited.
	   After the abolition of border controls this year under the
Schengen accord, random checks of foreigners traveling in Austria
will be expanded under a new law to be enacted early next year.
However, Gollia made clear the new controls are being introduced
now.
	   Up to now, those controls were limited to an area of 30
kilometers (20 miles) behind the border. In the future they will be
made on all international auto routes and rail links.

Albania holds Greece to goalless draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Greece was held to a 0-0 draw by Albania
on Wednesday in the first international soccer game contest in the
Balkan country in two years.
	   The European Championship qualifier left Group 2 virtually
unchanged after three matches each with Latvia still leading with
six points, Greece in second with five and Albania at the bottom of
the six-nation group with two.
	   Norway and Slovenia have four each while Georgia has three.
	   The match was the first international soccer game in Albania
since a World Cup qualifier on Nov. 9 against Armenia.
	   In 1997, all sports activities were halted due to chaos and
lawlessness reigning in the country following the collapse of dodgy
investment schemes.
	   Encouraged by most of the 15,000 spectators that packed Tirana's
Qemal Stafa stadium, Albania went on the attack from the start to
create major problems for Greece.
	   The hosts created two viable scoring chances in the first half
but striker Alban Bushi failed to finish both.
	   Bushi's took advantage of a moment of confusion between Nikos
Dabitzas and goalkeeper Ilias Atmatzidis at the edge of the Greek
area. After settling the ball his lob went wide in the 23rd minute.
	   One minute later, his shot from close range hit Atmatzidis' left
post.
	   Costas Frantzeskos missed a major opportunity for Greece in the
first half when, one-on-one with keeper Fotaq Strakosha, he shot
wide in the 25th.
	   The second half saw Greece more aggressive, creating but wasting
at least three scoring opportunities. The best chances came in the
62nd and 86th minutes, when shots by Demis Nikolaidis and Grigoris
Georgatos hit the post.
	   Albania flubbed its biggest chance in the 66th when Atmatzidis
made a key save to a shot by Igli Tare from 3 meters (yards).

Inter American Press Association condemns obstacles to free press
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) _ The new president of the Inter
American Press Association vowed Wednesday to step up pressure on
governments to solve the killings of journalists and remove
roadblocks to a free press.
	   The IAPA, made up of hundreds of newspaper publishers from the
Americas and the Caribbean, ended its 54th annual assembly
Wednesday by noting an ``alarming increase'' in journalist
killings: 26 during the year.
	   ``I will try to find solutions to the deaths of journalists,''
said Jorge E. Fascetto, of Diario Popular in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. ``Through the years, hundreds have been killed but few
of these cases have been solved.''
	   Closing IAPA's 54th annual convention at this Atlantic resort,
he also pledged to oppose legislative attempts to bridle
journalists in countries throughout the western hemisphere.
	   Colombia led the list with 13 journalists slain, followed by
Brazil, 4; Mexico, 3; and Guatemala and Peru with two deaths each.
	   ``These numbers are shocking. The most basic and savage means of
limiting freedom of the press, murdering the messenger, is a
horrible reminder for all of us that freedoms so precious can also
be fragile,'' Fascetto said in issuing IAPA's conclusions.
	   Also elected to one-year terms were First Vice President Tony
Pederson, of the Houston Chronicle, Texas; Danilo Arbilla of the
weekly newspaper Busqueda in Montevideo, Uruguay, as second vice
president; John Simpson, the daily USA Today, of Arlington,
Virginia, as treasurer; Jack Fuller, of the Chicago Tribune
newspaper, as secretary; and Julio E. Munoz, as executive director.
They will serve a 1-year term.
	   IAPA said it was redoubling efforts to oppose proposed
legislation in several countries that would hinder freedom of the
press, and court awards of larger monetary damages against
journalists.
	   ``There remains the feeling that in many countries, public
sentiment is turning against freedom of the press and the public
does not understand the clear relationship between democracy and a
free press,'' IAPA concluded.
	   The IAPA also awarded:
	   _ The Grand Prize for Press Freedom posthumously to German
Ornes, editor and publisher of El Caribe, Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic. Ornes, who died April 14, opposed threats to free speech
in the Dominican Republic for five decades, challenging one
dictator after another.
	   _ Feature Writing Award: Sebastian Rotella of the Los Angeles
Times for a series on Latin American affairs examining cultures of
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Peru.
	   _ Opinion Award, Susana Barciela of The Miami Herald for op-ed
pieces on how changes in welfare and immigration laws impact south
Florida residents.
	   _ News Coverage Award: Joshua Hammer, to Newsweek magazine for
coverage of the 1997 hostage crisis in Lima, Peru.
	   _ Inter-American Relations: Spanish-language daily La Opinion in
Los Angeles for a series on changes in U.S. immigration law.
	   _ Cartoon Award: Jose Varela of El Nuevo Herald, Miami, for
assorted cartoons.
	   _ Human Rights and Service to the Community Award: Tania Urias,
Osmin Monge and Ricardo Guevara of El Diario de Hoy, San Salvador,
El Salvador, for a series on the elderly, women's rights, prison
life and child abuse.
	   _ News-in-Depth Award: El Comercio, Quito, Ecuador, for
investigative reports on the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram and
last days in office.
	   _ Photography Award: to Luiz Morrier of Jornal do Brasil of Rio
de Janeiro for a photo of a policeman stomping on the head of a
young boy.

Macedonia to allow NATO force on its territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - Two senior NATO officials arrived in
Macedonia Tuesday as the country prepared to formally allow the
deployment of NATO's rapid reaction force to assist international
monitors in neighboring Kosovo.
	   U.S. Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief of NATO's Allied
Forces Southern Europe, and French Gen. Marcel Valentin met
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and the likely future premier,
Ljubco Georgievski.
	   Macedonia's outgoing government said Wednesday it could not give
a formal go-ahead for the NATO deployment on its territory before
the country's new government is formed. Incumbent ex-Communists
lost last month's elections to a conservative center-right
coalition.
	   But sources close to Georgievski said his new government, to be
formed by the end of this month, will invite a French-commanded
extraction force designed to rescue any of some 2,000 unarmed
verifiers if they come under threat in Kosovo, a Serbian province
in neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   On Tuesday, NATO formally requested Macedonia's permission to
deploy the force - about 1,800 soldiers with tanks and helicopters
- on its territory.
	   President Gligorov said in a statement Wednesday that he
received NATO Secretary General Javier Solana's request for the
deployment, adding he supports such a move because of the
``humanitarian aspect of the mission'' and Macedonia's ``strategic
plans toward NATO.''
	   Last Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to
Macedonia, warning that Macedonia's consent to serve as a base for
``any military action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to
long-term interests of the two countries'' and their good
relations.
	   On Wednesday, Macedonia handed a counter-protest to Yugoslavia,
saying the deployment of foreign troops is the country's internal
matter.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered deal struck Oct. 12, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic allowed the civilian verifiers to be
sent to Kosovo. They are to ensure Milosevic abides by the
agreement and NATO's rapid reaction force is intended to rescue the
verifiers in case of trouble.
	   Macedonia was the only former Yugoslavia republic which seceded
without bloodshed from the six-republic federation in 1991.

State issues new orders to seize white-owned farms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government issued new orders to
seize 841 mostly-white owned farms for handing over to landless
blacks, farmers' leaders said Wednesday.
	   The owners have begun receiving compulsory acquisition documents
covering a total of about 2.2 million hectares (5.3 million acres)
of land signed by Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai, said Nick
Swanepoel, head of the Commercial Farmers' Union.
	   Swanepoel said the orders were dated Nov. 12 and contradicted
government assurances that 118 farms already acquired by the state
would be resettled by black families before more seizures took
place.
	   ``This is not what we believed would happen after the
cooperation between ourselves and the Ministry of Agriculture. I
certainly didn't expect this,'' Swanepoel said.
	   The farmers' organization, representing some 4,000 whites who
own about one third of the nation's productive land, was seeking
urgent meetings with Kangai and President Robert Mugabe, he said.
	   Last November, the government released a list of about 1,500
farms it wanted to nationalize. But in September, at a conference
with international donors, officials agreed to a two-year
``inception period'' to resettle 118 properties that owners
conceded to the state.
	   Donors and Western financial institutions are concerned that the
land seizure could disrupt food production and bring further harm
to the nation's crumbling economy.
	   A national strike on Wednesday shut down businesses and
factories around the country to protest soaring prices and alleged
government mismanagement of the economy.
	   Several squatter occupations of farms took place after Mugabe
last month vowed to seize land now and pay compensation for it
later. The government has argued that whites don't deserve
compensation for the land taken from blacks in the colonial era.
	   About 60 squatters armed with machetes and guns have occupied a
wheat farm about 55 kilometers (34 miles) east of Harare for 10
days. Squatters hoisted ruling party flags, lit fires and pounded
on tribal drums at night, demanding that the owner, Rob Brown, hand
over his property.
	   Police said they were powerless to intervene until Brown
acquired an eviction notice from the courts in Harare.
	   Many of the squatters are militant veterans of the bush war that
ended white rule in the former British colony of Rhodesia, as
Zimbabwe was known before Independence in 1980
	   Some 70,000 black families have been resettled on former
white-owned farms, but some of the seized farms were taken by
politicians and their cronies.

Congo's Kabila says he's ready to negotiate with Rwanda, Uganda

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila said
Wednesday he was ready to enter immediate talks with Rwanda and
Uganda on ending their support for the three-month rebellion in his
country.
	   However, Kabila gave no indication of softening his negotiating
stance. He stressed that any talks would center on setting a date
for the departure of the neighboring countries from Congo, and
accused the two countries of ``pillaging'' his nation.
	   ``We'll hold talks with them so that they can leave our
country,'' Kabila told reporters after a meeting with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   ``From our point of view, this is a case of aggression, with
Congo as the victim,'' he said, adding that negotiations would show
the world that Rwanda and Uganda were motivated by the desire to
plunder Congo's mineral wealth.
	   The anti-Kabila offensive has made steady gains in both northern
Congo and in the southern, mineral-rich provinces of Eastern Kasai
and Katanga.
	   Kabila ruled out any talks with the Congolese rebels _ a
coalition of Tutsi fighters, former soldiers and former Kabila
allies _ who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The rebellion broke out Aug. 2, and Kabila has relied heavily on
the support of his regional allies, including Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Angola and Chad.
	   Kabila accused South Africa of taking ``a dubious stance''
towards the conflict in Congo, and of leaning towards support for
the rebellion.
	   South Africa ``supports the aggressors through ambiguous
statements and doesn't draw a distinction between the aggressors
and those who are legitimately defending Congo's independence and
sovereignty,'' he said.
	   Kabila met with Dos Santos to discuss continued Angolan military
support for the fight against the rebels trying to oust him.
	   However, Dos Santos is increasingly concerned about the mounting
threat at home from the former rebel group UNITA which recently
attacked remote villages in contravention of the country's 1994
peace pact, and unconfirmed reports say Luanda is considering
withdrawing its troops from Congo.
	   Dos Santos declined to answer questions from journalists.
	   Kabila left Luanda two hours before his scheduled departure.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ It was back to work for U.N. weapons
inspectors in Iraq on Wednesday after a showdown halted their
efforts for more than two weeks and forced them to leave the
country temporarily.
	   About six U.N. vehicles, accompanied by half a dozen Iraqi cars,
set off Wednesday from U.N. headquarters in the eastern outskirts
of Baghdad to sites that are being monitored.
	   ``The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center has resumed
full-range activities,'' Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for U.N.
inspectors in Iraq, told The Associated Press.
	   She would not say where the monitors were heading or reveal what
disarmament activity they intended to carry out.
	   In New York, Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman at U.N. headquarters for
the weapons inspectors, said the teams went out ``on routine
inspection.''
	   ``They did not report any problems,'' he said.
	   Asked about his expectations for Iraqi cooperation in the
future, he said, ``We will wait and see.''
	   The inspectors are likely to limit their visits to sites where
they have already installed cameras and sensors for long-term
monitoring.
	   The real challenge will come later, when they begin surprise
checks on sites where they suspect Iraq has been hiding material
related to banned chemical and biological weapons programs or
long-range missiles.
	   Iraq suspended U.N. weapons monitoring activities on Oct. 31.
	   The United States and Britain threatened airstrikes against Iraq
unless it removed its restrictions on the inspectors of the U.N.
Special Commission. Iraq backed down as air and missile attacks
were about to be unleashed.
	   The United Nations pulled out its inspectors last week and the
International Atomic Energy Agency, whose experts were allowed to
go ahead with the monitoring of suspected nuclear sites, were also
withdrawn.
	   The inspectors, 80 from UNSCOM and six from the IAEA, returned
Tuesday after Iraq agreed to let them resume work. Another six
inspectors left Bahrain for Baghdad on Wednesday.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi
forces overran Kuwait in 1990 can be lifted. Iraq says that it has
already complied with the U.N. demands, and the sanctions are
devastating the economy.
	   Once the inspectors report they are able to work effectively,
the U.N. Security Council has pledged to conduct a review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   While many in the West feel Iraq might balk when the inspections
get serious, a scientific adviser to President Saddam Hussein
insisted Tuesday that he expected no trouble during the renewed
search for arms.
	   In an interview with CNN, Gen. Amer al-Saadi said Iraq would
cooperate as long as rules set out in the agreement signed between
Iraq and the United Nations to end a confrontation in February are
followed.
	   Al-Saadi said that agreement made clear how both sides should
deal with the inspections.

Federal prosecutors say extreme-leftist Turk arrested in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ The chief federal prosecutor's office
said Wednesday that an extreme-leftist Turk suspected of being a
leader in a terrorist organization has been arrested in Germany.
	   The office in Karlsruhe identified the suspect only as
43-year-old Mesut D.. It said he was arrested Tuesday during
searches at 11 homes and two clubs allegedly frequented by members
of the extreme-leftist Karatas wing of the banned Turkish extremist
group Devrimci Sol.
	   The homes were located in North-Rhine Westphalia, Lower Saxony,
Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria state. The two clubs were in Cologne
and Stuttgart. Mostly propaganda material was confiscated, the
statement said.
	   It said that Mesut D. is suspected of being a leader of the
group in the Cologne area.
	   The Interior Ministry banned Karatas and its rival splinter
group, Yagan, on Aug. 13, saying they finance their activities
largely by blackmailing Turkish residents and businesses in
Germany.
	   Both groups split off from Devrimci Sol in 1992 and have long
used violence and murder to gain dominance in Germany, home to some
2 million Turks.
	   Both have a combined membership of about 1,300 and have adopted
Devrimci Sol's goal of overthrowing the Turkish government to
replace it with a Marxist regime, according to the ministry.
	   In June several Karatas members were arrested for suspected
blackmail, murder and attempted murder in Germany.
	   Prosecutors at the time said the leader of the Karatas wing
ordered members to attack and sometimes kill Yagan wing members and
Turks unwilling to contribute money. They also blame the group for
arson attacks against Turkish businesses in Germany.
	   Germany banned Devrimci Sol in 1983.

French weekly fined for publishing false interview with bodyguard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court on Wednesday ordered a weekly
magazine to pay 70,000 francs (dlrs 12,500) in damages to bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones for publishing an interview he says never took
place.
	   Voici, which said it acted in ``good faith'' when publishing the
interview but may have been misled, was ordered to publish the
court ruling in its next edition.
	   ``Publishing the court ruling does not imply that Prisma Press
(Voici owners) acknowledges that the accusations are true,'' Voici
lawyer Luc Brossellet said in an telephone interview.
	   Brossellet said that Voici, at the time of publication, had
every reason to believe the interview was authentic.
	   ``Perhaps, and I emphasize perhaps, we were misled,'' he said.
	   The story appeared in the July 6 edition of Voici, a magazine
specializing in the private lives of royalty, celebrities and
socialites.
	   Rees-Jones' lawyer, Christian Curtil, said the ruling set a
legal precedent because it forced the weekly to ``acknowledge its
mistake.''
	   The bodyguard was the sole survivor of the crash that killed
Princess Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul on
Aug. 31, 1997 in a Paris traffic tunnel.

Amsterdam court bans extreme-right party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam District Court Wednesday
permanently banned one of the country's most notorious
extreme-right political parties.
	   The Center Party '86 was outlawed because its party platform and
its propaganda material incite discrimination against foreigners,
said Stijna den Haan of the Amsterdam public prosecutor's office.
	   The ruling marked the first time a party has been banned in the
politically tolerant Netherlands since the post World War II
outlawing of a Dutch branch of Hitler's National Socialist _ or
Nazi _ Party.
	   CP '86, whose party slogan is ``Our Own People First,'' is one
of a handful of small far-right political parties in the
Netherlands. It holds no seats in Parliament, but has, in the past,
held a few seats in local municipalities. It lost the last of those
local seats in elections earlier this year.
	   Ex-CP '86 chairman Stewart Mordaunt reacted somberly to the
news.
	   He said while party membership stood at about 500 a few years
ago, membership has long been dwindling and the party was already
pronounced dead earlier this year when they were banned from having
bank accounts to receive funds.

Government accuses defiant Lords of abusing power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 2-4 with Blair and opposition leader clash in
Commons; shortens pvs; timing of Lords vote uncertain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Already under a political death sentence in its
present form, Britain's unelected House of Lords has repeatedly
blocked a bill to change the voting system for European Parliament
elections in what the Labor Party government calls ``an abuse of
power.''
	   The Lords were expected to reject the bill for the fifth
straight time Wednesday in an unprecedented show of defiance that
Prime Minister Tony Blair blames on hereditary peers _ aristocrats
who overwhelmingly support the opposition Conservative Party.
	   In angry exchanges in the House of Commons before the Lords'
vote, Blair taunted Conservative leader William Hague with
``wrapping himself in the ermine of hereditary peers.''
	   ``This is no longer about the (voting) system, it's about the
hereditary Tory peers in the House of Lords,'' Blair said, shouting
above jeers from Conservative lawmakers.
	   Hague, referring to Blair's plan to turn the Lords into an
all-appointed chamber, charged him with seeking to ``expand the
power of your own clique of cronies at the expense of the power of
the people.''
	   Another defeat would kill the bill and would be used by Labor as
a major argument for its plan to abolish the 600-year-old right of
hereditary peers to vote in the Lords.
	   On Tuesday, the Lords rejected the bill by a 261-198 vote.
Wednesday's vote was the last chance to get the bill passed as the
current parliamentary session ends this week.
	   Queen Elizabeth II is due to open the new session Tuesday by
reading out the legislative program for the coming year _ likely to
include a bill to strip the hereditary peers of voting rights.
	   The government can get a measure rejected by the Lords passed
automatically in the next session of Parliament.
	   But reintroducing the bill in the new session would be too late
to set up the voting system _ which critics say gives too much
power to party machines _ for European Parliament elections in
July.
	   The new system, involving constituency boundary changes, could
not then be in place until 2004 elections.
	   Conservative opponents, both lifetime and hereditary peers, are
supported by dozens of peers with no party affiliation, some Labor
rebels, and senior Church of England bishops who have seats in the
upper chamber.
	   But Blair's aides said that without the votes of Tory hereditary
peers, the measure would have passed by 36 votes on Tuesday.
	   The bill provides that instead of voting for a single candidate
in each district, voters choose a party. The party would then
allocate seats to its nominees, with the number of seats based on
the proportion of the overall vote won by each party.
	   The system is used France, Germany, Greece, Spain and Portugal.
But British opponents say the measure deprives voters of the right
to choose a candidate and allows party apparatchiks to control who
gets elected.

Dutch singer takes his own piano on Africa adventure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch singer-songwriter Robert
Berger is tuning his flatbed truck and his piano as he prepares to
set off with both on a trip to West Africa.
	   The 48-year-old musician leaves for Gambian capital Banjul later
this month with his trusty piano and a sofa loaded on the back of
his truck, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported Wednesday.
	   He plans to help finance the 7,500-kilometer (4,650-mile) trip
by giving concerts from the back of the Mercedes truck wherever he
stops for the night.
	   The idea came from his friend Ruud Schollaardt, who's tagging
along for the ride.
	   When Schollaardt suggested driving to Africa, Berger agreed _ on
one condition: ``Only if I could keep on playing,'' he told De
Telegraaf.
	   The three-week trek will take them though southern Europe, then
Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, and finally, Gambia.
	   Berger is not sure if his piano will survive the trip, which
includes 2,600 kilometers (1,612 miles) across the Sahara.
	   ``I can do a little tuning. We'll see if it still plays by the
time we get to Banjul.''

Former White House press secretary joins consulting firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Mike McCurry, the former White House press
secretary known as a witty and cool intermediary between the
president and the media, announced Wednesday he is officially
joining the private sector.
	   McCurry will become managing partner of a newly formed venture
called The Public Strategies Group, an international lobbying and
public relations organization.
	   ``I look forward to bringing my experiences from the White
House, the State Department and the political arena to the private
sector,'' McCurry said. ``I'm especially excited about heading up a
new venture, such as PSG, which allows us to combine our
communications, public affairs and government affairs skills under
one roof.''
	   McCurry left his post as White House press secretary on Oct. 1,
after 539 briefings on matters ranging from presidential scandal to
the financial turmoil in Asia. Television cameras captured many of
those briefings, a practice McCurry brought to the White House from
his former post as State Department spokesman.
	   A week before he left the president's employ, McCurry said he
planned to ``work on my golf game, slow down, enjoy my family, make
some money and continue to add to the debate about Washington and
how we communicate about Washington.''

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Most industries and businesses across
Zimbabwe shut down Wednesday as workers heeded calls for the second
in a series of one-day strikes to protest economic policies.
	   Troops and riot police backed by helicopters patrolled townships
around Harare and the main provincial centers.
	   In Harare, troops guarded bus stations after the government said
it would protect employees wishing to show up for work, but only a
few state-owned buses and private taxi vans were operating.
	   There were no reports of violence.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions is demanding price
reductions and wage raises to meet cost of living increases, citing
government mismanagement as the cause of economic hardships.
	   ``The strike has had overwhelming support by the workers,'' said
Morgan Tsvangirai, who heads the group. ``We want to show this
arrogant government they cannot continue to ignore our demands.''
	   Heavy overnight rain and continuing drizzle left most suburbs
almost deserted.
	   Banks, supermarkets and offices in downtown Harare remained
closed.
	   ``It's very quiet out here, even quieter that last week,''
Alphious Kamhuka, a resident of the western Glen View township of
Harare.
	   A one-day national stay-away called by the main labor federation
last Wednesday was rated 95 percent effective by independent
monitoring groups.
	   Most factories in western Harare didn't attempt to open their
gates this Wednesday also.
	   ``There's more activity on a normal Sunday when firms around
here run weekend shifts,'' said clothing maker Colin Wilson.
	   Residents and businesses in the second city of Bulawayo and the
eastern border town of Mutare, where one striker was shot dead
during demonstrations by strikers last Wednesday, reported similar
conditions.
	   The trade union group, representing 90 percent of the nation's
labor unions, called for the stay-away after talks with the
government Monday failed to avert it.
	   A 67 percent hike in gasoline prices that boosted commuter fares
and food production costs triggered the most recent industrial
actions.
	   Unrest over worsening economic hardships is posing the most
serious threat yet to President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled the
former Rhodesia since it gained independence from Britain and
became Zimbabwe in 1980.
	   The government blames the gasoline price hike on an 80 percent
Zimbabwe currency drop against the U.S. dollar in the past year.
	   Labor groups say the state is wasting resources keeping 8,000
troops in Congo to support embattled President Laurent Kabila and
should concentrate instead on reviving the crumbling economy.

Halard-Decugis advances to quarters with straight-set victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) _ Second-seeded Frenchwoman Julie
Halard-Decugis defeated Australia's Nicole Pratt Wednesday to
become the first player to advance into the quarterfinals of the
10th Volvo Women's Open.
	   Halard-Decugis, ranked No. 27 by the WTA Tour, was undeterred by
high heat and humidity in her 6-1, 7-5 victory.
	   ``Everyone coming from Europe will struggle under such
conditions,'' the 28-year-old Halard-Decugis sais. ``Besides, I am
coming here after taking part in an indoor tournament, so it is not
easy for me to play here.''
	   Halard-Decugis who used powerful forehand and crosscourt shots
to wrap up the match in an hour and 22 minutes, is the title
favorite after the departure of top seed and defending champion
Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in the first round on Monday.
	   Eighth-seeded Wang Shi-ting of Taiwan battled from the baselines
with Japan's Yuka Yoshida, making it to the last eight with a 6-2,
7-5 victory.
	   In other matches, American Kristina Brandi rallied to ease past
Laurence Courtois of Belgium 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, and Taiwanese-American
Meilen Tu took three sets to eliminate Adriana Gersi of the Czech
Republic 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
	   In first-round doubles, Benjamas Saengaram of Thailand and
Japan's Shinobu Asagoe defeated Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus and
Australian Louise Pleming 5-7, 7-6(7-5), 7-5.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may be headed toward disintegration and an
end of democracy if the deepening economic crisis is not resolved,
a top Cabinet official said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   The government says that to keep the economy from crumbling, it
needs to reschedule Russia's huge foreign debt payments and receive
foreign aid that was frozen months ago. But international creditors
have not given any sign that they will grant either request.
	   If the government fails to stabilize the economic situation,
``we will be facing a national catastrophe that would write off the
free-market economy, democracy and the territorial integrity of
Russia,'' Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said.
	   He warned that inflation would spiral out of control next year
unless the government reaches an agreement with its creditors to
reschedule some of the dlrs 17 billion in foreign debt payments due
in 1999.
	   ``If we succeed in restructuring just a half of this amount, we
will manage to keep the impact on inflation and industrial output
within reasonable limits,'' he said in an interview with the
business daily Kommersant.
	   Russia's impoverished regions, frustrated at mounting debts owed
by the federal government, are already defying Moscow.
	   The president of the impoverished southern republic of Kalmykia,
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, said Wednesday he would push for secession
because of the federal government's failure to deliver subsidies to
the region.
	   Governor Alexander Lebed of the vast Siberian region of
Krasnoyarsk ignored federal government orders Tuesday by blocking
shipments of nuclear waste into his region and demanding
pre-payment in hard currency for future consignments.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. Over the past month, the number of Russians living below
the official poverty line reached 42 million, or 29 percent of the
population, compared to 31 million (21 percent) a year ago, the
State Statistics Committee said.
	   The official poverty line is just 644 rubles (less than dlrs 40)
a month per person.
	   The government is pushing the International Monetary Fund for
more money, saying it is vital to paying off the huge domestic and
foreign debts.
	   A mission from the IMF was back in Moscow on Wednesday for talks
on the possibility of releasing the next installment of a dlrs 22.6
billion aid package, frozen in after Russia devalued the ruble and
defaulted on some debts in August.
	   Visiting IMF officials said they expected little from the
current round of talks.
	   Meanwhile, the economy has continued to contract, with
industrial output falling 11 percent compared to October 1997, the
statistics committee said.
	   Despite IMF warnings, Russia has also started printing money to
help its ailing banks and pay some debts, which many analysts warn
will trigger hyperinflation.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that Russia has
printed 8 billion rubles (dlrs 470 million) since Oct. 1, the
Interfax news agency reported.

	   LONDON (AP) _ After an international investigation into
pedophile networks, British police on Wednesday charged seven men
with conspiring to distribute indecent images of children on the
Internet.
	   They will appear before magistrates in Hastings, southern
England, on Jan. 7.
	   Codenamed ''Cathedral'', the British-led investigation in
September targeted alleged pedophiles in 12 countries.
	   Twelve people were arrested in Britain during the operation.

Six bodies discovered in a school yard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MODRICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Forensic teams from the three
Bosnian entities, accompanied by foreign experts, discovered
Wednesday a large grave holding six bodies in a school yard in
Serb-held northern Bosnia.
	   The bodies were found in Modrica under a rubbish heap in a
corner of the abandoned elementary school ``Sutjeska'', just a few
hundred meters from the main police station and a court building.
	   Escorted by Norwegian peacekeepers, local and U.N. police, the
forensic experts found the bodies, believed to be Muslims and
Croats from Modrica, who were killed by Bosnian Serbs in summer
1992, the first year of the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   ``According to witnesses, we expect to find more bodies in other
places in this town,'' said pathologist Jill Gould from Physicians
for Human Rights, an international organization based in Boston.
	   The discovered bodies were found wrapped in plastic sheets and
placed in the grave. The remains will be reburied in the
neighboring town of Odzak, which is on Muslim-Croat territory.
	   According to Amor Masovic, the head of the state-run Commission
for Missing People, the commission has discovered 107 mass graves
and exhumed about 3,500 bodies, mostly Muslims, since summer 1996..

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In the streets and in Parliament, Turks
rallied behind their leaders Wednesday in their tough stand on
Abdullah Ocalan: No relenting in Turkey's demand for the Kurdish
rebel chief's extradition. No negotiating with the rebels.
	   The Kurdish chief's supporters in Europe showed equal fervor.One
set himself on fire with gasoline Wednesday outside the military
hospital in Rome where Ocalan is believed to be held; others among
the 500 Kurdish protesters camped out there rushed to extinguish
the flames with blankets.
	   Ocalan, leader of a 14-year-old militant movement fighting for
Turkish Kurd autonomy, was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport as
soon as he stepped off a flight. Italy is weighing his request for
political asylum.
	   Turkey's government offered its people free use of fax machines
Wednesday to send protests to the Italian government to press for
his return. Thousands of Turks gathered outside the Italian Embassy
in Ankara for a second day, burning Italian flags and demanding
extradition.
	   Although Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government is on
the brink of collapse over mafia scandals, it was clear Wednesday
that support for the tough line on Ocalan crossed all political
lines.
	   ``No government of the Turkish Republic will ever .. sit on the
table with the monster that has blood on his hands,'' Yilmaz
declared in Parliament, drawing overwhelming applause from allies
and opponents alike.
	   The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party
has killed 37,000.
	   The military has always drawn strong public support in the war
against the rebels despite thousands of losses. No anti-war
movement has evolved. Turkey has never responded to Ocalan's calls
for cease-fires in the past nor to Ocalan's claims now to have
renounced violence.
	   ``We have abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace
accord,'' Ocalan told the daily newspaper La Repubblica. ``My
presence here testifies to a change in the strategy of the Kurdish
national movement.''
	   ``We want to be recognized as Kurds through the introduction of
democratic laws,'' Ocalan said in another interview with L'Unita
newspaper.
	   Turkey is trying Ocalan in absentia on capital crimes. Italy
refuses to extradite people facing the death penalty and appears
unlikely to grant Turkey's request.
	   Turkey's prime minister said Italy's response to the extradition
request would be a test of its commitment to combat terrorism.
	   ``If it does not pass this test successfully it will become an
accomplice to all the murders the (rebels) have committed until
now,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema rejected the accusation, telling
a news conference in Rome: ``Italy doesn't justify terrorism and
doesnt' want to be an accomplice.''
	   D'Alema appealed for backing from Italy's European allies,
saying it was more than an Italian-Turkish problem.
	   There are 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out in Turkey, Syria,
Iran and Iraq and hundreds of thousands more in Europe. Turkey does
not recognize its 12 to 15 million Kurds as an official minority,
which would give them the right to teach and broadcast in their own
language.

Justin Rose shoots 6-over 78 in poor start for tour card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of day's play

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Justin Rose, who finished fourth at the
British Open as a 17-year-old amateur, shot a 6-over-par 78
Wednesday in the first round of European tour qualifying school.
	   Since turning pro after the British Open, Rose has missed the
half-way cut in all eight tournaments he's played.
	   A total of 181 players are entered in the qualifying school _
being held at the San Roque and Sotogrande clubs _ with the top 35
receiving tour cards.
	   Spain's Carlos Rodiles had the top round at San Roque with a
4-under 68, and fellow Spaniard Francis Valera and Henrik Nystrom
of Sweden had 6-under 66 to lead play at neighboring Sotogrande.
	   American Mac O'Grady, a former regular on the U.S. tour and Seve
Ballesteros' one-time coach, shot a 3-over 75 at San Roque as the
47-year-old tries for his European Tour card.
	   With Wednesday's poor start, Rose must now focus on making the
cut to 75 players after four rounds Saturday. The final two rounds
of the six-round event are Sunday and Monday.
	   Rose three-putted five times on the San Roque course and
admitted that part of his game had deserted him.
	   ``I hit the ball reasonably well,'' he said. ``But my putting
let me down. This is a marathon, though, and I'm not out of it for
sure.''
	   ``It's disappointing because I knew that if you can keep double
bogeys and three putts down to a minimum, then you're going to do
well.''

UEFA moves meeting from Jerusalem over security concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Citing the political situation in the
Middle East, European soccer's governing body on Wednesday moved a
meeting of its governing executive committee away from Jerusalem.
	   The meeting on Dec. 10 and 11 will instead be held in
Switzerland, UEFA said in a statement. A final venue has yet to be
chosen.
	   The executive committee is expected to give final approval to
the reform of UEFA's European club competitions.
	   UEFA has already canceled the European Under-18 Championships
qualifying tournament, scheduled to take place in Israel this week,
because of security concerns.
	   Also Wednesday, UEFA said senior officials had a ``very fruitful
meeting'' with Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, discussing the
effects on soccer of European Union legislation.
	   ``There was a common understanding that it is necessary for
football to be treated in accordance with its specific character by
EU institutions,'' said UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner.
	   Klima later criticized the effects of EU rules on soccer, UEFA
noted.

Jayasinghe to run in Bangkok, but will it count?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW throughout to clarify that Jayasinghe is not under IAAF
ban, date for hearing not fixed, No Pickup

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan sprint star Susantika
Jayasinghe is a strong candidate for gold medals at next month's
Asian Games. Whether she would be able to keep them may be a matter
for a doping arbitration committee.
	   The sport's governing body, the IAAF, cleared up confusion on
Wednesday by stating that Jayasinghe would be able to compete in
Bangkok even though she hasn't yet been completely cleared of a
doping allegation.
	   Sri Lankan officials expressed doubts on her participation after
they interpreted a letter from the IAAF Doping Commission to mean
that Jayasinghe was under an IAAF ban.
	   She tested positive in March for the steroid Nandralone-19,
although she was cleared by the Sri Lankan federation after it
heard her explanation.
	   The IAAF's action came after a protest from China, which said
the federation should reconsider the ban on several Chinese
athletes if Jayasinghe were allowed to take part.
	   According to IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri, the Doping
Commission could recommend to the IAAF Council on Friday that
Jayasinghe's case be referred to an arbitration panel.
	   If such a recommendation is made and is accepted by the council,
a date for the hearing would be set later. The process could take
several months.
	   According to the IAAF, until a final verdict is made, Jayasinghe
is free to compete. But, if the arbitration panel believes a
suspension is appropriate, it can impose retroactive sanctions _
including annulment of previous performances.
	   Jayasinghe, 23, is Sri Lanka's best hope in the 100- and
200-meter races in Bangkok. She has gone through two doping tests
this year but was cleared.
	   The Sri Lankan, who won a 200-meters silver medal at last year's
World Championship in Athens, tested positive for Nandralone-19 in
an out-of-competition test in March.
	   Jayasinghe denied taking Nandralone-19 and said she only took a
drug to control her menstrual cycle. She said she was set up by
frustrated Sri Lankan sports officials and government ministers
after she resisted their amorous advances.
	   A three-member panel of Sri Lanka's Amateur Athlete Association
cleared her by a split 2-1 verdict.

Fiat-UNIDO pact to help car parts makers in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Italy's auto giant Fiat signed a
cooperation agreement with U.N. officials on Wednesday aimed at
helping Indian companies produce car parts up to international
standards.
	   Turin-based Fiat is to invest dlrs 1 billion in India by the end
of the century under the pact signed with the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization, UNIDO said.
	   Fiat needed an industrial system to provide car parts and help
it expand its global market, said Paolo Monferino, the company's
executive vice president. The car manufacturer hopes to increase
its percentage of sales outside Italy from the current 40 percent
to 60 percent by 2000.
	   It already has plants in Kurla and Ranjangaon that manufacture
the Palio and Siena models, selling 400,000 cars annually in India
_ 3 percent of the market.
	   Indian Permanent Secretary T.R. Prasad welcomed both Fiat's
commitment and UNIDO's role as broker.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In the first major arms deal
by post apartheid South Africa, the government on Wednesday gave
preliminary approval to a 29.77 billion-rand (dlrs 5.22 billion)
package of jet fighters, submarines and other equipment.
	   The proposal includes 28 Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British
Aerospace of Sweden and England, three submarines and four corvette
warships from German consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from
Italian manufacturer Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from
British Aerospace.
	   Critics say it's wrong for the rainbow nation to spend so much
on weapons given the country's problems with poverty and 34 percent
unemployment.
	   Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Njongonkulu Ndungane has said
the money is ``desperately needed for reconstruction and
development'' after decades of apartheid rule that systematically
denied the non-white majority good housing, education and jobs.
	   But defense officials say the package will generate 65,000 new
jobs and a transfer of technology resulting from 110 billion rand
(dlrs 19.3 billion) in investments promised by the countries
selling the arms.
	   The new equipment is needed to replace obsolete armaments from
the heavily militarized apartheid government that left power after
the first democratic elections in 1994, said Deputy Defense
Minister Ronnie Kasrils in an SABC radio interview on Wednesday.
	   South Africa can ``go into the next century with a new defense
force capable ... of protecting our sovereignty and people,''
Kasrils said.
	   As an increasingly dominant regional military power, other
African countries are also looking to South Africa for help in
brokering the continent's ongoing conflicts.
	   The contracts attracted intense bidding despite strings
attached. The government is requiring that countries wishing to
sell weapons must invest an amount at least equal to the purchase
price into high technology industry here.
	   Government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said the finance minister
and a Cabinet subcommittee would negotiate further with the
suppliers over the coming weeks and possibly reduce the number of
items being purchased.
	   Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has raised questions about the
affordability, local newspapers reported this week.
	   Swedish Ambassador Bo Heinebaeck said he expected ``very tough''
negotiations over Sweden's investment, but added, ``I'm quite
confident there will be final agreement.''

Yeltsin cancels December visit to India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 3rd graf with Kremlin later saying Yeltsin's
visit not officially canceled. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Kremlin said Wednesday that President Boris
Yeltsin has canceled a state visit next month to India, a
development likely to raise new concern about the health of the
ailing Russian leader.
	   A presidential press official said Yeltsin would be replaced by
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but gave no further details.
	   However, a Kremlin press official later said that Yeltsin had
asked Primakov to go but had not officially canceled his own visit,
and it remained unclear whether Yeltsin would go.
	   Yeltsin, who has been plagued by poor health for years, fell ill
in early October with what was described as bronchial problems. He
has since spent most of his time at a government rest home outside
Moscow and is rarely seen in public.
	   Yeltsin met Tuesday with visiting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder at the Kremlin. The Russian leader looked fit and spoke
clearly, but slowly. He did not attend a press conference later
with Schroeder.
	   Kremlin officials said Yeltsin would meet next week in Moscow
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Opposition parties insist that Yeltsin is no longer fit enough
to run the country. The president has been out of sight during
Russia's economic crisis, leaving day-to-day running of the
government to Primakov.
	   Yeltsin, 67, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996 and has
suffered various illnesses since. The president insists his health
is fine and he will serve out the rest of his term, which ends in
2000.

	   PARIS (AP) _ An afternoon telephone call catches the director of
a Parisian wine-tasting organization at an off-moment -- during an
annual delivery of the light, fruity red wine being uncorked around
the world.
	   ``Excuse me,'' said Alain Sajalle, director of the Center for
Wine Tasting, out-of-breath from lugging wine crates off a truck.
``We're in the middle of an enormous delivery of Beaujolais
Nouveau.''
	   This year's Beaujolais Nouveau was making its debut around the
world at 12:01 a.m. Thursday local time. Beaujolais Nouveau appears
annually on the third Thursday of November.
	   Some 55 million bottles of the light red have been produced this
year. About half of them are expected to stay in France. The other
half were being shipped to places ranging from Brazil to China.
	   In Paris, the annual tasting of the light, red wine is still an
event many look forward to, despite a Beaujolais backlash that
began several years ago.
	   In the 1970s and 1980s, the market savvy union of Beaujolais
wine-growers turned the local product into a global hit, sending
cases around the world by plane, train and ship to be served on the
same day.
	   But by the early 1990s, some folks were tiring of the publicity
campaign. They began grumbling that Beaujolais Nouveau was nothing
more than a ``piquette'' -- a cheap wine with a bite.
	   Now, people have begun to appreciate Beaujolais for what it is:
a fun, festive wine with no great aspirations.
	   ``For a while, a lot of people thought Beaujolais was just a
fad,'' said Mylene Bru, an oenologist in the southern city of
Narbonne. ``But people like Beaujolais. They like its simplicity.
``It's accessible, and there's something democratic about it.''
	   Beaujolais Nouveau is made from gamay grapes picked less than
two months before the wine is released. The grapes are grown in
granite-rich soil in Beaujolais, just south of Burgundy.
	   This year's Beaujolais is reportedly ``silky and fruity.'' Last
year's aroma of banana and wild strawberries has been replaced with
a bouquet of ripe fruits.

Opposition leader from Equatorial Guinea seeks Spanish court probe
</HEADLINE>
into President Obiang &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An exiled opponent of Equatorial Guinea's
President Teodoro Obiang on Wednesday petitioned Spain's National
Court to investigate crimes allegedly committed by Obiang, news
reports said.
	   Severo Moto, who has lived in Spain since 1986, presented a
denouncement to the court detailing allegations against Obiang of
torture and other crimes, National Spanish Radio reported.
	   Obiang has governed the tiny former Spanish colony in West
Africa since 1979 when he overthrew his uncle Francisco Macia
Nguema. He has been widely accused of human rights violations.
	   Moto's center-right Progressive Party is one of several groups
that have been pressing for Obiang to introduce democratic reforms.
	   He was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 1985 by a military
court for attempting to overthrow Obiang, but international
pressure helped secure his release and he moved to Spain as a
political refugee.
	   The Madrid-based court must now decide whether to admit Moto's
petition and open a probe.
	   National Court investigations into human rights abuses in Chile
and Argentina underpinned the detention in London last month of
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, as a first step towards
his possible extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   Equatorial Guinea, a country of 400,000 inhabitants wedged
between Cameroon and Gabon, gained independence from Spain in 1968.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied
Wednesday in front of Pakistan's parliament in support of
legislation to impose strict Islamic law in the country.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif introduced a constitutional
amendment in August to scrap remaining British laws in Pakistan and
replace them with laws based on Koran, which ``prescribe what is
right and to forbid what is wrong.''
	   Dozens of police in riot gear stretched barbed wire across the
road to stop demonstrators from advancing toward parliament, where
a Senate session was underway.
	   The legislation has jolted the opposition parties, human rights
groups and the non-Muslim minorities who say it will undermine
constitutional freedoms, impartial institutions, and create
religious divisions among various Muslim sects.
	   Militant Sunni groups are battling Shiite Muslim extremists in a
conflict that has killed dozens in recent months.
	   Sunni groups demand that Pakistan be declared a Sunni state and
enforce their version of Islamic law. Shiites, who comprise less
than 15 percent of the population, oppose this.
	   Sharif earlier urged the religious leaders and extremist Muslim
groups to build pressure on opposition parties for the passage of
this amendment.
	   On Wednesday, supporters of Jamaat Ahle-e-Sunnat (Party of
Sunnis) carried dozens of large banners and green flags inscribed
with Arabic verses from Koran _ the Muslim holy book.
	   Demonstrators chanted slogans against senators opposing the
amendment, which gives the government power to enforce religious
edicts. Those rules oblige people to pray five times a day and pay
annual tithing.
	   ``We are here for the enforcement of Islamic system,'' Allama
Syed Riaz Hussain, chief of the party, told his supporters.
	   The National Assembly (lower house), where Sharif enjoys an
absolute majority, passed the amendment in September. The Senate
must approve the amendment for it to become law, but its passage is
uncertain since Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League holds less than a
two-thirds majority.
	   Sharif has lobbied religious leaders and militant Muslim
organizations to build pressure on senators.
	   Hussain said his party will hold rallies nationwide to mobilize
public opinion against the opposition.
	   In a speech Monday, Sharif said he wants his country's justice
system to be like that of the hard-line Taliban Islamic militia in
neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Under Taliban rules women are barred from education and work
outside their houses, all kinds of light entertainment including
music are banned. Men must grow beards and criminals are subjected
to amputations and public executions.
	   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday accused Sharif of
fanning religious and sectarian feelings, saying they would lead
the country toward anarchy.
	   She said Sharif was exploiting the name of Islam for his
political ends.
	   The amendment is against the ideal of Pakistan's founder
(Jinnah) and is a conspiracy against the country, she said.

Macedonia to allow NATO force on its territory
</HEADLINE>

new grafs 5-6. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - Two senior NATO officials arrived in
Macedonia Wednesday as the country prepared to formally allow the
deployment of NATO's rapid reaction force to assist international
monitors in neighboring Kosovo.
	   U.S. Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief of NATO's Allied
Forces Southern Europe, and French Gen. Marcel Valentin met
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and the likely future premier,
Ljubco Georgievski.
	   Macedonia's outgoing government said Wednesday it could not give
a formal go-ahead for the NATO deployment on its territory before
the country's new government is formed. Incumbent ex-Communists
lost last month's elections to a conservative center-right
coalition.
	   But sources close to Georgievski said his new government, to be
formed by the end of this month, will invite a French-commanded
extraction force designed to rescue any of some 2,000 unarmed
verifiers if they come under threat in Kosovo, a Serbian province
in neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   In Lisbon, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in
Europe, warned Wednesday that diplomatic efforts to secure a
lasting settlement in Kosovo must advance quickly because the
cease-fire there is shaky and could collapse within months.
	   ``Despite all our best efforts ... we probably have only a
two-to-four month window of relative peace,'' Clark told a
conference here. ``We must use this respite to achieve a just and
durable political settlement'' in the southern Serb province.
	   On Tuesday, NATO formally requested Macedonia's permission to
deploy the force - about 1,800 soldiers with tanks and helicopters
- on its territory.
	   President Gligorov said in a statement Wednesday that he
received NATO Secretary General Javier Solana's request for the
deployment, adding he supports such a move because of the
``humanitarian aspect of the mission'' and Macedonia's ``strategic
plans toward NATO.''
	   Last Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to
Macedonia, warning that Macedonia's consent to serve as a base for
``any military action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to
long-term interests of the two countries'' and their good
relations.
	   On Wednesday, Macedonia handed a counter-protest to Yugoslavia,
saying the deployment of foreign troops is the country's internal
matter.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered deal struck Oct. 12, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic allowed the civilian verifiers to be
sent to Kosovo. They are to ensure Milosevic abides by the
agreement and NATO's rapid reaction force is intended to rescue the
verifiers in case of trouble.
	   Macedonia was the only former Yugoslavia republic which seceded
without bloodshed from the six-republic federation in 1991.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the Mideast peace accord was
moving forward, Israel and the Palestinians resumed long-suspended
talks Wednesday on a lasting peace treaty and agreed to formally
reopen those negotiations next week.
	   Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas, who met with his counterpart
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said that Israel would carry
out the first stage of a long-overdue West Bank troop withdrawal
Friday and release 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``Palestinian and Israeli security officials will meet Thursday
to discuss the maps and preparations for the redeployment,'' Abbas
told The Associated Press. They will also complete paperwork for
the opening of the Palestinian airport.
	   According to the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank
in three stages in exchange for Palestinian security and antiterror
measures.
	   In final status talks, Sharon and Abbas, also known as Abu
Mazen, will tackle the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab
conflict including permanent borders, refugees, water, Jewish
settlements and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.
	   ``We are starting today to negotiate the permanent agreement,''
Sharon told reporters at the start of the meeting. ``I think that
we have to look to the future. Looking to the past will not help
us.''
	   Alone except for a translator, the two men sat across from each
other in the second-floor of the barracks-like buildings in
Israel's Foreign Ministry complex.
	   Afterwards, Abu Mazen told the AP they discussed ongoing work
between negotiating committees on the economy, a Palestinian
seaport and future Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``Within a week there will be an opening ceremony for the
resumption of the final status talks, it will be in the Palestinian
autonomous areas,'' Abu Mazen said.
	   The Palestinians were also preparing Wednesday to issue a list
of regulations on weapons. Israel insisted as part of the peace
agreement that Palestinian forces disarm militants and others
carrying illegal weapons in territory under their control.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet is
to convene Thursday to review Palestinian progress in the accord
before giving the final go ahead for the first withdrawal from 2
percent of land in the northern West Bank.
	   The Cabinet was also expected to discuss a dispute over the
prisoner release. Palestinian officials complained that 150 of the
250 prisoners to be freed were ordinary criminals and not political
prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an ongoing effort by Jewish settlers
to take over more West Bank land.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a rocky hilltop near the
Jewish settlement of Kedumim on Wednesday. About 30 settlers camped
on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were establishing a new
community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied. Eleven settlers were detained for
questioning, according to Israeli police.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by
confiscating Arab-owned land to build access roads to settlements
that would be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory after
the Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``This is an obvious violation of the agreement,'' said Ahmed
Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996
and is slated to be completed by the end of the interim framework,
including the Wye accord, on May 4, 1999.
	   Earlier, Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio, ``At the end
of final status talks, we see the creation of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as the capital.''
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference of armed conflict by Arafat, led to
a mini-crisis Monday when Netanyahu placed the withdrawal on a
one-day suspension until Arafat retracted the statement.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Greece was held to a 0-0 draw by Albania
on Wednesday in the first international soccer game contest in the
Balkan country in two years.
	   The European Championship qualifier left Group 2 virtually
unchanged after three matches each with Latvia still leading with
six points, Greece in second with five and Albania at the bottom of
the six-nation group with two.
	   Norway and Slovenia have four each while Georgia has three.
	   The match was the first international soccer game in Albania
since a World Cup qualifier on Nov. 9 against Armenia.
	   In 1997, all sports activities were halted due to chaos and
lawlessness reigning in the country following the collapse of dodgy
investment schemes.
	   Encouraged by most of the 15,000 spectators that packed Tirana's
Qemal Stafa stadium, Albania went on the attack from the start to
create major problems for Greece.
	   The hosts created two viable scoring chances in the first half
but striker Alban Bushi failed to finish both.
	   Bushi's took advantage of a moment of confusion between Nikos
Dabitzas and goalkeeper Ilias Atmatzidis at the edge of the Greek
area. After settling the ball his lob went wide in the 23rd minute.
	   One minute later, his shot from close range hit Atmatzidis' left
post.
	   Costas Frantzeskos missed a major opportunity for Greece in the
first half when, one-on-one with keeper Fotaq Strakosha, he shot
wide in the 25th.
	   The second half saw Greece more aggressive, creating but wasting
at least three scoring opportunities. The best chances came in the
62nd and 86th minutes, when shots by Demis Nikolaidis and Grigoris
Georgatos hit the post.
	   Albania flubbed its biggest chance in the 66th when Atmatzidis
made a key save to a shot by Igli Tare from 3 meters (yards).

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases following ambush

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday following a guerrilla
ambush near an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, security
officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the deserted
village of Aqmata, some 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of this
southern market town.
	   The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a stronghold of
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and is frequently used to
launch attacks against Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed that the air
force attacked targets in the area.
	   The afternoon raid came a few hours after Hezbollah detonated a
roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was traveling near the
Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two miles) north of the
Israeli border.
	   Hezbollah, in a statement, said the bombing caused casualties
among the Israeli troops. But security officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said there was still no word of
causalities from the noontime attack.
	   The Israeli air attack comes at a time of heightened tension in
the volatile region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near the
Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   On Tuesday night, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile
at guerrillas who had attacked a military post in the occupied
zone.
	   The Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a pro-Syrian and pan-Arab
group, claimed responsibility Wednesday for the attack with rockets
and machine guns on the Israeli Baraachit outpost, about 10
kilometers (six miles) from the Israeli border.
	   The group said one of its guerrillas, Taleb Abu Riya, 29, was
killed and another one was wounded in the late-night attack.
	   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla warfare to oust Israeli troops and
their Lebanese militia allies from the enclave Israel set up in
1985 to protect its northern territory from cross-border attacks.

Six bodies discovered in a school yard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MODRICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Forensic teams from the three
Bosnian entities, accompanied by foreign experts, on Wednesday
discovered a large grave holding six bodies in a school yard in
Serb-held northern Bosnia.
	   The bodies were found in Modrica under a rubbish heap in a
corner of the abandoned elementary school ``Sutjeska'', just a few
hundred meters (yards) from the main police station and a court
building.
	   Escorted by Norwegian peacekeepers, local and U.N. police, the
forensic experts found the bodies, believed to be Muslims and
Croats from Modrica, who were killed by Bosnian Serbs in summer
1992, the first year of the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   ``According to witnesses, we expect to find more bodies in other
places in this town,'' said pathologist Jill Gould from Physicians
for Human Rights, an international organization based in Boston.
	   The discovered bodies were found wrapped in plastic sheets and
placed in the grave. The remains will be reburied in the
neighboring town of Odzak, which is on Muslim-Croat territory.
	   According to Amor Masovic, the head of the state-run Commission
for Missing People, the commission has discovered 107 mass graves
and exhumed about 3,500 bodies, mostly Muslims, since summer 1996..

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sixth-seeded Mary Pierce joined Steffi Graf in
the quarterfinals of the Chase Championships on Wednesday, beating
South Africa's Amanda Coetzer 6-1, 6-0.
	   Graf reached the last eight Tuesday night with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4,
6-1 victory over the third-seeded Jana Novotna.
	   Pierce was overpowering in every aspect of the game as she
rushed into the next round, where she will face No. 2 Martina
Hingis.
	   Coetzer, at 1.58 meters (5-foot-2) one of the smallest players
on the WTA Tour, relies on quickness, speed and grit to overcome
her lack of height. Against Pierce, none of those worked.
	   Pierce had the firepower from all sides, unloading huge
groundstrokes and hitting winners all over the court. She took
charge at the start and never gave Coetzer a chance. Pierce won the
opening four games while losing only nine points.
	   Coetzer then rallied from a 15-40 deficit to break Pierce, the
only game she won. In the entire match, Coetzer won only 26 points.

Opposition leader from Equatorial Guinea seeks Spanish court probe
</HEADLINE>
into President Obiang &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An exiled opponent of Equatorial Guinea's
President Teodoro Obiang on Wednesday petitioned Spain's National
Court to investigate crimes allegedly committed by Obiang, news
reports said.
	   Severo Moto, who has lived in Spain since 1986, presented a
denouncement to the court detailing allegations against Obiang of
torture and other crimes, National Spanish Radio reported.
	   Obiang has governed the tiny former Spanish colony in West
Africa since 1979 when he overthrew his uncle Francisco Macia
Nguema. He has been widely accused of human rights violations.
	   Moto's center-right Progressive Party is one of several groups
that have been pressing for Obiang to introduce democratic reforms.
	   He was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 1985 by a military
court for attempting to overthrow Obiang, but international
pressure helped secure his release and he moved to Spain as a
political refugee.
	   The Madrid-based court must now decide whether to admit Moto's
petition and open a probe.
	   National Court investigations into human rights abuses in Chile
and Argentina underpinned the detention in London last month of
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, as a first step towards
his possible extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   Equatorial Guinea, a country of 400,000 inhabitants wedged
between Cameroon and Gabon, gained independence from Spain in 1968.

Amsterdam court bans extreme-right party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam District Court Wednesday
permanently banned one of the country's most notorious
extreme-right political parties.
	   The Center Party '86 was outlawed because its party platform and
its propaganda material incite discrimination against foreigners,
said Stijna den Haan of the Amsterdam public prosecutor's office.
	   The ruling marked the first time a party has been banned in the
politically tolerant Netherlands since the post World War II
outlawing of a Dutch branch of Hitler's National Socialist _ or
Nazi _ Party.
	   CP '86, whose party slogan is ``Our Own People First,'' is one
of a handful of small far-right political parties in the
Netherlands. It holds no seats in Parliament, but has, in the past,
held a few seats in local municipalities. It lost the last of those
local seats in elections earlier this year.
	   Ex-CP '86 chairman Stewart Mordaunt reacted somberly to the
news.
	   He said while party membership stood at about 500 a few years
ago, membership has long been dwindling and the party was already
pronounced dead earlier this year when they were banned from having
bank accounts to receive funds.

Britain's highest court to rule on Pinochet immunity Nov. 25

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court will announce next week
whether former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has immunity
from arrest and can leave Britain, officials said Wednesday.
	   The five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, headed by Lord
Justice Gordon Slynn, will present its judgment on Nov. 25, which
coincides with the general's 83rd birthday.
	   Spanish authorities, who want to extradite Pinochet to face
charges of genocide, murder and torture during his 1973-90 rule,
and British prosecutors had appealed a High Court ruling saying he
has immunity from arrest under English law as a former head of
state.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 on the Spanish warrant while in a
London hospital bed recuperating from back surgery.
	   On Tuesday, a British court ordered the former dictator to
appear in court Dec. 2 and also said the British government must
decide by then _ if the Lords rule against him _ whether
extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   In a letter Wednesday, the human rights group Amnesty
International urged Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has the final
say, to approve any extradition warrant granted by a British
magistrate ''so that the guilt or innocence of Gen. Pinochet can be
determined by a court of law.'' France and Switzerland also seek
his extradition.

Yeltsin apparently cancels December visit to India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede, UPDATES with quote from spokesman, attempts to
reach Indian embassy in grafs 4-6. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin has asked his prime minister to
travel to India in his place next month, the Kremlin said
Wednesday, raising new concern about the health of the ailing
Russian leader.
	   However, a Kremlin official later said the Russian president had
not yet officially canceled his own visit, and it remained unclear
whether Yeltsin might still go.
	   One presidential press official said Primakov would go in
Yeltsin's place.
	   But later Wednesday, another Kremlin press official quoted a
statement by Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakhushkin: ``The president
has asked Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to make the visit. But
along with this, we are not saying that this visit has been
canceled. It is planned for December.''
	   The Indian embassy in Moscow would not say whether or not
Yeltsin was still making the trip.
	   The Kremlin is often vague or contradictory when it comes to the
sensitive subject of Yeltsin's condition.
	   Yeltsin, who has been plagued by poor health for years, fell ill
in early October with what was described as bronchial problems. He
has since canceled some foreign trips and spent most of his time at
a government rest home outside Moscow, and he's rarely seen in
public.
	   Yeltsin met Tuesday with visiting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder at the Kremlin. The Russian leader looked fit and spoke
clearly, but slowly. He did not attend a press conference later
with Schroeder.
	   Kremlin officials said Yeltsin would meet next week in Moscow
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Opposition parties insist that Yeltsin is no longer fit enough
to run the country. The president has been out of sight during
Russia's economic crisis, leaving day-to-day running of the
government to Primakov.
	   Yeltsin, 67, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996 and has
suffered various illnesses since. The president insists his health
is fine and he will serve out the rest of his term, which ends in
2000.

Constitutional Court rules abortion law unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Constitutional Court ruled that
Hungary's abortion law, which practically allows abortion on
demand, is unconstitutional and will be cancelled as of June 30,
2000, the state news agency MTI reported Wednesday.
	   The 19-month interval apparently is designed to achieve the
broadest possible consensus in the population and give parliament a
chance to draft, debate and enact new legislation.
	   The court ruled that the present law, which was enacted in 1991,
failed to respect the rights of the fetus by allowing a pregnant
woman to merely claim that she could not raise her child.
	   The new legislation will have to spell out what circumstances
would qualify as an obstacle to raising the child and also provide
counselling to pregnant women seeking an abortion.
	   The Constitutional Court ruled that the state's duty to protect
life extends to the fetus, but at the same time it cannot disregard
the woman's right to self-determination.

Netanyahu tells Cyprus Israel did not act against it
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office Wednesday regarding two Israelis accused of
spying in Cyprus was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation
the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   Netanyahu's office said the premier met with the Cypriot
ambassador to Israel after reviewing an internal investigation
regarding the spy charges.
	   Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men
in custody in Nicosia, Cyprus are Mossad agents.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey.'' There was
no indication from the statement that the two men could have worked
independently of the government.
	   The two Israelis, who enter Cyprus on false passports, were
arrested Nov. 6 in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi. Police
found surveillance equipment and recording devices in the apartment
the two men had rented.
	   Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said that shortly before their
arrest, the two had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence
institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.'' Police officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men were believed
to be spying on behalf of Turkey, which has close relations with
Israel but not with Cyprus.
	   Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the
island, are interested in gaining information on the planned
deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Cypriot officials have said that if the two men turn out to be
Mossad agents, it would deeply affect relations between the two
countries.
	   In September 1997, Israeli Mossad agents were caught in Jordan
trying to assassinate a political figure in the militant Hamas
group. The incident strained Israeli-Jordanian relations.

Imprisoned Nazi war criminal: `Now, let me die in peace'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Convicted Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke started
his life prison sentence for a World War II massacre with a single
message to the world, Italian newspapers reported Wednesday: ``Now,
let me die in peace.''
	   Paramilitary police transferred the 86-year-old Priebke to a
military prison in Rome on Tuesday, a day after Italy's highest
appeals court upheld his sentence. The former SS captain entered
Forte Boccea prison with his head held high.
	   ``I am the last prisoner of war,'' Priebke declared. ``My
prosecutors have carried out their vendetta to the end.''
	   The court also upheld the life sentence of Priebke's
co-defendant, former SS Maj. Karl Haas, 87.
	   A military court convicted them in March in the 1944 massacre of
335 people at the Ardeatine Caves on the outskirts of Rome. The
massacre was in retaliation for a bombing by Italian resistance
fighters that killed 33 German soldiers.
	   Both men said in their trial that they were following orders
from Adolf Hitler and had no other choice.

Air France strike grounds flights for second day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with union threatening more strikes, estimate on
Tuesday's disruption

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France flights were again severely disrupted
Wednesday as flight attendants completed a two-day strike, and a
major union threatened more walkouts.
	   The flight attendants are demanding the company scrap a two-tier
salary scheme under which staff hired since December 1995 earn less
than their counterparts.
	   They also want contracts which map out career development and
working conditions in greater detail.
	   The Union of Civil Aviation Flight Attendants (UNAC), the
largest of six unions to call this week's strike, said Wednesday in
a statement that unless their demands are met, ``there will be a
hardening of the conflict, and serious disruption of traffic in
coming days.''
	   Air France had said it would guarantee 55 percent of long-haul
flights and 60 percent of short and medium-distance flights during
the strike.
	   But UNAC claimed that some 75 percent of flights were grounded
Wednesday.
	   A 10-day pilots strike in early June cost Air France one billion
francs (dlrs 166 million) before the main pilots union accepted an
offer of stock in exchange for salary freezes.
	   The strike coincided with the arrival of hundreds of thousands
of people to watch the World Cup soccer championships.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.

Gonzalez wins AL MVP for second time in three seasons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Juan Gonzalez was voted the American League's
Most Valuable Player today, overwhelmingly defeating Nomar
Garciaparra and Derek Jeter to win the award for the second time in
three seasons.
	   Gonzalez, who had the most RBIs in the AL in 49 years and led
Texas its second AL West title in three seasons, received 21
first-place votes and seven seconds for 357 points in balloting by
the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
	   Garciaparra, who helped Boston win the AL wild card, got five
firsts, seven seconds and seven thirds and had 232 points.
	   Jeter, one of four players on the World Series champion New York
Yankees to receive votes, had two firsts, six seconds and three
thirds, finishing with 180 points.
	   Gonzalez, who beat Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez 290-287 to
win the MVP two years ago, hit .318 with 45 homers and 157 RBIs,
the most in the AL since Ted Williams and Vern Stephens each had
159 for Boston in 1949.
	   ``He's a great, great hitter,'' Mark McGwire said. ``But you
know, the sad thing, if somebody said, `Who was the 1996 MVP in the
American League?' I bet you nobody really knows _ Juan Gonzalez.
Every year, year in, year out, he just puts up the numbers. It just
seems like he doesn't get the notoriety he should.''
	   Gonzalez had 101 RBIs at the All-Star break, becoming only the
second player to top the century mark going into the All-Star game
(Hank Greenberg had 103 in 1935).
	   By the final week of July, he had 116 RBIs in 105 games,
bringing up talk he could challenge the record of 190, set by Hack
Wilson in 1930.
	   ``It's not impossible,'' Gonzalez said then. ``I just need to
stay healthy and keep working hard.''
	   But then he was slowed by hamstring problems, and the chance to
reach that record disappeared.
	   Garciaparra, a unanimous choice as the 1997 AL Rookie of the
Year, hit .323 with 35 homers and 122 RBIs. Jeter, a unanimous pick
as the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year, batted .324 with 19 homers and
84 RBIs, providing solid and sometimes spectacular play at
shortstop from start to finish.
	   Mo Vaughn and Ken Griffey Jr. tied for fourth in the voting with
135 points each, followed by Manny Ramirez (127), Bernie Williams
(103), Albert Belle (96), Rodriguez (92) and Ivan Rodriguez (60).
	   Gonzalez gets a $250,000 bonus for winning the award. Also
getting bonuses were Garciaparra ($75,000) and Ivan Rodriguez
($50,000).

Swedish court ruling could increase criticism of
</HEADLINE>
anti-discrimination laws &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A court ruled Wednesday that an
automobile repair shop could not be found guilty of discrimination
despite hiring an inexperienced white man over an experienced black
applicant.
	   The case in the Labor Court could increase already-strong
criticism that Sweden, despite its image of racial tolerance, has
an insufficient anti-discrimination law.
	   Current law states that an employer can be found guilty only if
it can be shown that the employer intended to discriminate.
	   ''The big stumbling-block was that I did not succeed in showing
that the employer probably chose to discriminate,'' Discrimination
Ombudsman Margareta Wadstein, who brought the case to the labor
court, was quoted as saying by the news agency TT.
	   The small repair shop had advertised last year for a mechanic.
The two prime job candidates were a white man and a Ugandan
immigrant who now holds Swedish citizenship.
	   Both had similar training in auto mechanics, but the black man
had five months of work experience, while the other candidate had
none. The court ruled that the plaintiff did not succeed in proving
that the black man was not hired because of his race.
	   The ruling comes at a time when Sweden has become increasingly
sensitive about racial questions. A study submitted to the
parliament last year said Sweden's large number of immigrants are
not being integrated into society successfully, suffering from
higher-than-average unemployment and increasingly living in
outlying suburbs where an ever-fewer number of native Swedes live.
	   Meanwhile, open signs of anti-immigrant sentiment are
increasing. A black politician in the town of Varberg resigned this
month, saying he had repeatedly received threating telephone calls,
and a firebomb was tossed Monday at a building housing refugees in
the town of Flen.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Police planned to charge eight men
Wednesday with stealing more than 450 Japanese cars and hiding them
in a thick tropical forest in Puerto Rico.
	   Investigators said the stash of cars, which was discovered
Tuesday near northern Toa Baja, is worth more than dlrs 5 million.
About 150 cars were being dismantled for parts. The others had
already been stripped, and many were burned to destroy evidence of
theft.
	   Japanese cars are especially prized by thieves in Puerto Rico,
who use ignition assemblies, identification plates and parts from
cheaper models to change the identity of expensive sport-utility
vehicles and luxury models preferred by drug dealers.
	   The alleged ring had been stealing cars for about four years,
said Jose Caldero, head of the police department's stolen vehicles
bureau.
	   He said police were also investigating parts stores and
junkyards that bought the stolen parts. Investigators believe the
thieves took ``orders'' from mechanics for expensive items like
engine computers, airbags, seats and body panels.

Court case to oust Jehovah's Witnesses delayed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with comment from defense lawyer,
details. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Moscow judge told prosecutors Wednesday they had
not fully prepared their case for banning Jehovah's Witnesses from
operating in Russia, and delayed the trial until February.
	   The civil trial marks the first time prosecutors have applied
Russia's controversial religion law in court to try to disband
religious groups. Prosecutors argue that the Jehovah's Witnesses
destroy families, foster hatred and drive their members to insanity
and suicide.
	   The trial opened in September but was delayed until Tuesday. In
Wednesday's proceedings, defense lawyers complained that the
prosecution was withholding evidence instead of presenting it to
the defense before using it in court.
	   The prosecution ``continues to spring material and information
on the defense in what is sometimes called in Western law 'trial by
ambush,''' said John Burns, a lawyer in the case specializing in
international human rights.
	   The defense asked for a half-day delay for the prosecution to
submit all its evidence, and to prepare a response to it.
	   However, Judge Yelena Prokhorycheva put off the trial until Feb.
9.
	   ``It's clear that at the end of the day (the judge) was now
going to demand that the prosecution adhere to what legal procedure
requires in Russia,'' Burns said.
	   Prosecutors, who refused to comment on the case, say in their
complaint that the Jehovah's Witnesses Moscow delegation should be
disbanded and its activities prohibited under a religion law passed
last year that gives the government the right to disband any
religious group it thinks is inciting hatred or intolerant
behavior.
	   Western leaders say the law, designed to strengthen the Russian
Orthodox Church and restrict foreign religions and cults that many
Russians consider dangerous, contradicts Russia's constitutional
right to freedom of religion.
	   If banned, the Jehovah's Witnesses would no longer have the
right to express their beliefs publicly, hold worship services,
rent property, or distribute literature.
	   Galina Pominova, a pensioner at the trial, said her daughter, a
Jehovah's Witness, had left her family in poverty.
	   ``My daughter breaks the law in that she doesn't work and
doesn't pay taxes to the Pension Fund,'' she said. ``So other
people's children support me, but not my own. How can that not
break a law?''
	   In this week's proceedings, prosecutors said the group destroys
families because the Jehovah's Witness practice of not celebrating
national holidays creates rifts between family members, and their
general refusal of blood transfusions threatens lives.
	   Defense lawyers countered that Jehovah's Witnesses are not
forced to practice their religion, and stressed that the case
violates the Russian Constitution and the European Convention on
Human Rights.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be the fifth-largest Christian
group in Russia, with about 10,000 members in Moscow and more than
250,000 across the country.
	   Russian officials have not strictly implemented the religion
law. They have not kicked out all religious groups that haven't
been in Russia for more than 15 years, though they have used the
law to deny return visas to missionaries and pastors.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases following ambush

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday after a rebel ambush near
an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the deserted
village of Aqmata, 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of this
southern market town.
	   The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah is a stronghold of
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and is frequently used to
launch attacks against Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
southern Lebanon.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed that the air
force attacked area targets.
	   The afternoon raid came a few hours after Hezbollah detonated a
roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was traveling near the
Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two miles) north of the
Israeli border.
	   Hezbollah, in a statement, said the bombing caused casualties
among the Israeli troops. But security officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said there was still no word of
causalities from the noontime attack.
	   The Israeli air attack comes at a time of heightened tension in
the volatile region following a Hezbollah roadside bombing near the
Israeli border Monday which killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded four others, two of them seriously.
	   The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a
year.
	   On Tuesday night, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile
at guerrillas who had attacked a military post in the occupied
zone. There were no casualties.
	   The Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a pro-Syrian and pan-Arab
group, claimed responsibility Wednesday for the attack with rockets
and machine guns on the Israeli Baraachit outpost, about 10
kilometers (six miles) from the Israeli border.
	   The group said one of its guerrillas, Taleb Abu Riya, 29, was
killed and another one was wounded in the late-night attack.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their Lebanese militia allies from the enclave Israel set up in
1985 to protect its northern territory from cross-border attacks.

Regional leader calls for secession from Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The young millionaire leader of a southern
republic has threatened to secede from Russia, prompting a quick
warning of retaliation from the Kremlin on Wednesday.
	   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, 36, the elected president of Kalmykia, went
on Russian television Tuesday night to say he would push for
secession because of the federal government's failure to deliver
subsidies to the impoverished region.
	   Ilyumzhinov reiterated his threat in an interview with the
Interfax news agency on Wednesday. ``We shall urge Moscow to give
us the status of an associated member (internally autonomous), or
just secede from Russia,'' he said.
	   Ilyumzhinov's bid appeared aimed at getting more federal funds
rather than open rebellion, but his statement was likely to
strengthen separatist trends in the Russian regions because of the
country's economic crisis. He indicated he might settle for greater
financial autonomy.
	   Kalmykia is a barren region along the Caspian Sea with a
population of 317,000 people. Kalmyks, descendants of Mongol nomads
who settled in the region in the 17th century, now account for
nearly half of the region's population.
	   It drew a quick response from President Boris Yeltsin, who on
Wednesday ordered an emergency session of the presidential Security
Council to address the issue and draw up a response.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Echo Moscow radio
that the session is likely to be held next week.
	   ``The president is concerned with such statements,'' Yakushkin
said. ``In the current difficult socio-economic situation, such
statements threaten to destabilize the country's political
stability.''
	   Later Wednesday, Ilyumzhinov backtracked a bit, saying that he
did not mean a political secession and was using the term loosely
in an attempt to draw attention to the region's economic woes.
	   ``The official position of the leadership and people of the
republic is to be in the Russian Federation,'' Ilyumzhinov said in
an interview with Russia's ORT television station.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's president on Wednesday
rejected a U.S. draft plan for Kosovo's future, saying it gives too
much power to ethnic Albanians, the overwhelming majority in the
Serbian province.
	   ``It does not respect full equality of all ethnic communities in
Kosovo,'' Serbian President Milan Milutinovic told local Serb
officials. The U.S. proposal reportedly would have given Kosovo
virtual self-rule.
	   Milutinovic also warned that ``terrorist groups'' _ the
government's label for ethnic Albanian rebels _ would be
``neutralized by security forces,'' if they continue what he called
attacks on government forces. The guerrillas say they are only
responding to attacks on them.
	   He said Kosovo Albanians could have self-rule but must remain
part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. The rebels
have been fighting for independence for the province.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed last month to end
his crackdown in the province. Hundreds were killed and tens of
thousands forced to flee their homes before an uneasy cease-fire
was reached.
	   ``The form is clear _ democratic self-rule within the republic
of Serbia,'' Milutinovic said, adding that this would give Kosovo
its own parliament, government, judicial system and police.
	   However, a draft version of the plan proposed by the top U.S.
mediator in Kosovo, Christopher Hill envisages almost no Serbian
control of the province, while leaving it under partial
jurisdiction of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Milutinovic rejected the plan, published Wednesday in an
Albanian-language paper, as contravening Serbia's ``territorial
integrity.''
	   Under the U.S. draft, Kosovo would have its own president,
courts, government and parliament. Only defense, foreign affairs,
customs, foreign trade and monetary policy would be in the hands of
the Yugoslav federation.
	   Kosovo's many ethnic communities would share power according to
their numbers _ giving Kosovo's 90-percent Albanian majority the
clear advantage.
	   Disputes over internal issues would be resolved in the Kosovo
Supreme Court. If the issue remained unresolved it would go to
European courts.
	   Under the plan, disputes with Serbia and the Yugoslav federation
would be solved in a special court, which would include
representatives of Yugoslavia, Kosovo and the international
community.
	   Hill, trying to find a peace formula, discussed the plan Tuesday
with the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas, whose support is
crucial to any agreement. An uneasy cease-fire has for the most
part ended eight months of fighting.
	   A top ethnic Albanian negotiator and adviser to Kosovo Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova indicated Tuesday his side might settle for
less than full independence. The ethnic Albanians have boycotted
direct talks with Milutinovic.
	   But it was unclear whether the secessionist rebels would agree
to any deal short of the independence. The guerrillas said they
would evaluated the plan by next week.

Consumer campaign warns some foods and medicines don't mix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The kidney transplant recipient drank
grapefruit juice after taking his daily pill and became confused
and began trembling. The heart attack survivor thought taking
high-dose Vitamin E with his medicine would better protect his
heart, until he began bleeding.
	   Everyday foods and vitamins can sometimes dangerously interact
with the prescription drugs used by 85 million Americans and
over-the-counter medicines taken by countless others, warns a new
consumer campaign that lists what foods and drugs do not mix.
	   ``You open up any bathroom cabinet in America and you'll see the
same thing: medicine, and lots of it,'' said Linda Golodner,
president of the National Consumers League. But eat the wrong food
with certain medicines, she said, and ``you may end up in the
emergency room.''
	   Doctors are supposed to warn patients what drugs not to mix. But
potential problems from mixing medicine with other substances, from
foods and alcohol to herbal supplements, aren't as well publicized.
	   So the consumers league, with help from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, published a brochure Wednesday listing drug-food
combinations patients should avoid.
	   Some examples:
	   _Never drink grapefruit juice less than two hours before or five
hours after taking heart drugs called calcium channel blockers,
like Procardia. The mix sometimes kills.
	   _Grapefruit juice taken with cyclosporin, which fights organ
rejection in transplant recipients, can cause confusion and
trembling.
	   _High doses of Vitamin E thin blood. Taken by heart patients on
the popular blood thinner Coumadin, the mix increases the risk of
serious bleeding.
	   _Coumadin users also shouldn't splurge on foods high in Vitamin
K, like broccoli, spinach and turnip greens, which reduce the
drug's effectiveness.
	   _Antidepressants called MAO inhibitors can cause a potentially
fatal blood pressure rise when taken with foods high in the
chemical tyramine, such as cheese and sausage.
	   _Drinking coffee or colas with certain antibiotics such as Cipro
or the ulcer drugs Tagamet, Zantac and Pepcid can increase caffeine
levels, causing the jitters and stomach irritation.
	   _Don't overload on bananas or take potassium supplements with
heart drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as Capoten and Vasotec. It
can cause harmful potassium buildup.
	   _Too much caffeine increases the dose of theophylline, a
bronchodilator, causing nausea, palpitations or seizures.
	   _Grapefruit juice should never be taken with antihistamines,
either prescription versions such as Claritin and Allegra or
over-the-counter types such as Benadryl. It can cause serious heart
problems.

Asylum seekers dumped on street by Dutch volunteers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 6th graf with most refugees being given bed for the
night; EDITS lead to conform; REMOVES extraneous word in lead. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ARNHEM, Netherlands (AP) _ More than 120 asylum seekers,
including 20 babies, were left without a roof over their heads for
most of Wednesday when a voluntary group said it could no longer
afford to take care of them.
	   As afternoon temperatures dropped, the refugees sat in buses or
huddled around fires outside an asylum seeker's camp near the
central Dutch city of Nijmegen.
	   Although the camp had 500 free beds, it was not allowed to house
the refugees, most of them from Bosnia and Kosovo, because the
Dutch government has already refused to grant them asylum.
	   Because the refugees had already had asylum applications
rejected in other European Union nations before entering the
Netherlands, they have no right to stay in this country.
	   ``We can do no more. Our hands are empty,'' a spokeswoman for
the Arnhem group that turned the refugees out told Dutch television
news. The spokeswoman, identified only as I. Loeter, said her group
wanted to bring the refugees' plight to the public's attention.
	   Late Wednesday, 110 of the refugees were given beds for the
night in a Salvation Army hostel. The remaining 13 sought shelter
elsewhere.
	   Dutch parliament called an emergency late-night sitting
Wednesday to discuss the matter.
	   Providing accommodation for asylum seekers in this overcrowded
nation reached crisis point recently when the government had to
pitch tents because all other refugee centers were full. The move
provoked a storm of protest, but while the protest has died down,
the tents remain.
	   Through September, 31,466 refugees applied for permission to
stay in the Netherlands this year _ a 30 percent increase from the
same period a year ago.

Judge-ordered probe shows Diana received proper care
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A medical inquiry ordered by the judge in the
Princess Diana case shows the princess was treated properly, and
was doomed from the start by her injuries, judicial sources said
Wednesday.
	   In a 10-page report sent Tuesday to Judge Herve Stephan, a
medical expert says that no matter what care is administered,
Diana's main wound _ a torn pulmonary vein _ ``is regularly
fatal.''
	   ``The care administered conformed to current medical
knowledge,'' said the expert, Dr. Dominique Lecomte, head of the
Medical-Legal Institute of Paris.
	   The judicial source, who saw the report, spoke to The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity.
	   Diana died at a hospital a few hours after her Mercedes crashed
in the Alma traffic tunnel on Aug. 31, 1997. Her boyfriend, Dodi
Fayed, and driver Henri Paul died instantly.
	   The princess was first treated at the scene, in accordance with
French practice, and then taken to the hospital. Some American
doctors said later she would have had a better chance had she been
rushed right away to the hospital.
	   France's health minister has conceded there is a debate within
the French medical establishment over on-site treatment, but said
that in Diana's case, the debate was moot because her injuries
doomed her from the start.
	   The doctor's report said Diana's heart had been ``displaced in
the thoracic cage,'' leading to the ripped pulmonary vein and fatal
hemorrhaging.
	   ``It is rare that patients with such a lesion arrive at the
hospital alive,'' Dr. Lecomte wrote, according to the judicial
source, who saw the report.
	   ``There is no case in world medical literature in which a
patient with such a (severe) injury of the pulmonary vein has
survived.''
	   Diana arrived at the hospital at 2 a.m., an hour and a half
after the car crash. She died two hours later, after doctors had
tried everything to save her, including internal heart massage.
	   The report by Dr. Lecomte is the last one to have been requested
by Stephan; others included technical tests on the Mercedes and an
examination of the carbon monoxide in driver Paul's blood.
	   Lawyers for the various parties in the case will now have the
right to request further tests, before Stephan can make his final
conclusions.
	   The judge hopes to have the case wrapped up by the end of the
year.

Canadian kidnappers could be released within two weeks from Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Two Canadians convicted of
kidnapping a Brazilian businessman in 1989 to help fund El
Salvador's rebels, could be released from prison in the next two
weeks, a justice official said Wednesday.
	   David Spencer, 35, and Christine Lamont, 39, may finally take
advantage of a transfer agreement between Brazil and Canada, said
Justice Secretary Sandra Valle, who visited Spencer in prison
Tuesday.
	   The two Canadians were sentenced _ along with five Chileans, two
Argentines and one Brazilian _ to 26 to 28 years in prison for the
1989 abduction of Abilio Diniz, owner of Brazil's largest
supermarket chain.
	   Diniz was dragged from his Mercedes-Benz on his way to work and
taken away in a station wagon disguised as an ambulance. He was
kept in a small underground cell for six days before police freed
him unharmed.
	   At their trial, the ten claimed to be political prisoners since
they belonged to a leftist group that wanted to funnel a dlrs 30
million ransom to Salvadoran guerrillas, who were then waging war
against the nation's right-wing government.
	   Spencer and Lamont initially claimed they were not involved in
the kidnapping but later admitted their participation.
	   The ten convicted kidnappers also alleged they have been
tortured and deined their rights in their nine years at Sao Paulo's
Carandiru Penitentiary, allegations Brazilian authorities deny.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed a prisoner transfer
agreement in April, but Spencer and Lamont rejected it since
Brazil's congress hadn't approved similar treaties with Chile and
Argentina to free their colleagues. Justice Secretary Valle says
Spencer is now willing to leave the country and must convince
Lamont.
	   In Sao Paulo, Judge Otavio Augusto Machado de Barros, who
negotiated with the prisoners in April, said the complexity of a
case has prolonged their release.
	   ``It's taken longer than we thought, but we are on the verge of
a decision for some of the prisoners,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   On Monday, Spencer and Lamont began a hunger strike, accusing
authorities of reneging on the April agreement. Earlier this year,
they fasted for 16 days to press for their eventual release.
	   Spencer and Lamont say they will only drink water until Cardoso
approves their expulsion and grants the lone Brazilian a full
pardon.
	   ``They won't stop the hunger strike with new promises,'' said
federal deputy Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, a member of a congressional
human rights commission. ``The case is now in the hands of
President Cardoso.''

Hungarian court rules abortion law unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Constitutional Court ruled that
Hungary's abortion law, which practically allows abortion on
demand, is unconstitutional and will be canceled as of June 30,
2000, the state news agency MTI reported Wednesday.
	   The 19-month interval apparently is designed to achieve a broad
consensus and give parliament a chance to draft, debate and enact
new legislation.
	   The court ruled that the present law, which was enacted in 1991,
failed to respect the rights of the fetus by letting a pregnant
woman merely claim that she could not raise her child.
	   The new legislation will have to spell out the circumstances
that prevent raising the child and also provide counseling to
pregnant women seeking an abortion.
	   The Constitutional Court ruled that the state's duty to protect
life extends to the fetus, but at the same time it cannot disregard
the woman's right to self-determination.

OSCE to open office in Turkmenistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Europe's security and human rights watchdog is
opening an office in the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan
early next year, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Officials with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe arrived in Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital, on Wednesday to
work out details for opening the mission.
	   The OSCE office will be headed by Paul Ulman, former Austrian
ambassador to the OSCE, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, who has led the
impoverished central Asian nation since Soviet times, has resisted
moves toward genuine elections, a free press and economic reforms.
	   The OSCE, based in Vienna, Austria, was set up in 1975. It is
active in many former Soviet republics.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the Mideast peace accord was
moving forward, Israel and the Palestinians resumed long-suspended
talks on a lasting peace treaty Wednesday and agreed to formally
reopen those negotiations with a ceremony next week.
	   Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas, who met with his counterpart
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said that Israel would carry
out the first stage of a long-overdue West Bank troop withdrawal
Friday and release 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``Palestinian and Israeli security officials will meet Thursday
to discuss the maps and preparations for the redeployment,'' Abbas
told The Associated Press. They will also complete paper-work for
the opening of the Palestinian airport.
	   Palestinian police also made public announcements Wednesday,
listing the rules and regulations for owning weapons. Israel
insisted as part of the peace agreement that Palestinian forces
disarm militants and others carrying illegal weapons in territory
under their control.
	   The weapons decree, which threatened jail terms and fines of up
to dlrs 4,000 for anyone caught with illegal arms, was read out on
Palestinian TV and radio broadcasts. Palestinian forces will begin
illegal weapons searches Dec. 6.
	   According to the Wye River peace agreement signed by the two
sides in Washington last month, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank in three stages in exchange for
Palestinian security and anti-terror measures.
	   In final status talks, Sharon and Abbas, also known as Abu
Mazen, will tackle the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab
conflict including permanent borders, refugees, water, Jewish
settlements and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.
	   ``We are starting today to negotiate the permanent agreement,''
Sharon told reporters at the start of the meeting. ``I think that
we have to look to the future. Looking to the past will not help
us.''
	   Alone except for a translator, the two men sat across from each
other in the second-floor of the barracks-like buildings in
Israel's Foreign Ministry complex.
	   Afterwards, Abbas told the AP they discussed on-going work
between negotiating committees on the economy, a Palestinian
seaport and future Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``Within a week there will be an opening ceremony for the
resumption of the final status talks, it will be in the Palestinian
autonomous areas,'' Abbas said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet is
to convene Thursday to review Palestinian progress in the accord
before giving the final go ahead for the first withdrawal from 2
percent of land in the northern West Bank. Israel TV said
Netanyahu's office was already studying Palestinian actions
Wednesday, ahead of the vote.
	   The Cabinet was also expected to discuss a dispute over the
prisoner release. Palestinian officials complained that 150 of the
250 prisoners to be freed were ordinary criminals and not political
prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an on-going effort by Jewish settlers
to take-over more West Bank land.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a rocky hilltop near the
Jewish settlement of Kedumim on Wednesday. About 30 settlers camped
on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were establishing a new
community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied. Eleven settlers were detained for
questioning, according to Israeli police.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by
confiscating Arab-owned land to build access roads to settlements
that would be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory after
the Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``This is an obvious violation of the agreement,'' said Ahmed
Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996
and is slated to be completed by the end of the interim framework,
including the Wye accord, on May 4, 1999.
	   Earlier, Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio, ``At the end
of final status talks, we see the creation of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as the capital.''
	   Palestinian threats to unilaterally declare an independent
state, coupled with a reference of armed conflict by Arafat, led to
a mini-crisis Monday when Netanyahu placed the withdrawal on a
one-day suspension until Arafat retracted the statement.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reigning African champions Egypt held a near
full-strength Norway to a 1-1 draw and dominated play for most of
the first half in a friendly match played here Wednesday.
	   The Pharaohs, as the Egyptian national side is known, took the
lead in the 37th minute when striker Hossam Hassan, a veteran of
Egypt's 1990 World Cup campaign, capitalized on a blunder by Norway
keeper Frode Grodas.
	   Hassan intercepted a shot by the goalie with his head just
outside the box. Chased by two Norway defenders, the 32-year-old
Hassan raced ahead and shot low to the right of the advancing
Grodas.
	   Chelsea and Norway striker Tor Andre Flo leveled the score with
a header 18 minutes into an unexciting second half.
	   Egypt, however, looked the more threatening side for most of the
match, with its host of European exiles squandering several scoring
chances with poor finishing.
	   Wednesday's friendly is part of the Norwegians' preparations for
Euro 2000 qualifiers. It is in Group II with Greece, Latvia,
Albania, Slovenia and Georgia. Their next qualifying match is away
to Greece in March next year.

Rothenberg out, Kraft steps in to buy San Jose club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Former U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg has bowed out of his announced purchase of the San Jose
Clash, and New England Revolution owner Jonathan Kraft has replaced
him, U.S. Major League Soccer announced Wednesday.
	   Despite previous announcements that Rothenberg's deal _ which
included Japanese advertising firm Dentsu as a partner _ was all
but complete, the Asian financial crisis repeatedly delayed and
eventually canceled the sale.
	   Kraft Sports Group, which also owns the New England Patriots pro
gridiron team, will take operating control of the Clash immediately
and, when closed, the purchase will be in excess of the dlrs 25
million price Rothenberg's group had agreed to, MLS commissioner
Doug Logan said.
	   ``In the short- and long-term, I'm delighted to get
reaffirmation from Jonathan Kraft of (his) long-term belief in this
league,'' Logan said.
	   Rothenberg's purchase was to be a combination of cash and his
and Dentsu's ``non-operating holdings'' in MLS. Kraft's purchase
will be strictly a cash deal, Logan said.
	   Kraft's purchase was negotiated ``in the course of the last
week,'' Logan said, but he would not discuss any other details of
the deal.
	   Rothenberg, who was in Zurich, Switzerland, for a series of FIFA
meetings, was quoted in MLS' news release as ``disappointed.''
	   Kraft's ownership of San Jose puts seven of the league's 12
teams in the hands of three families. The Hunt family owns both the
Columbus Crew and Kansas City Wizards, and Philip Anschutz last
month purchased the Los Angeles Galaxy to add to the Colorado
Rapids and MLS Cup champion Chicago Fire.
	   MetroMedia executives John Kluge and Stuart Subotnick own the
New York-New Jersey MetroStars and have an option to purchase an
expansion club in the New York area by the end of 1999.
	   Logan said he has no problem with multiple ownership in MLS.
	   ``It's the right four guys,'' he said.
	   Rothenberg will retain his non-operating stock in the league and
Logan said he hoped the former head of the 1994 World Cup would be
able to put together another bid to buy one of the three-year-old
league's other teams.
	   Two clubs, the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Dallas Burn, are league
operated, and the league is expected to add two expansion teams for
the 2000 season.

	   The breast milk of women who smoke smells like cigarettes,
researchers found.
	   They speculated that the breast-fed babies of these women may
learn to like the taste of tobacco this way and may be more likely
to smoke when they grow up.
	   The research examined whether the odor and, by implication, the
flavor of breast milk change after a woman smokes.
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine as a letter to the editor from Julie A. Mennella and Gary
K. Beauchamp of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.
	   They looked at breast milk samples taken from five women after
they smoked one or two cigarettes in a 20-minute period.
	   A panel of seven adults who sniffed the milk was more likely to
identify the samples collected 30 minutes to an hour after smoking
as smelling ``stronger'' or ``more like cigarettes'' than samples
taken later.
	   Previous studies have shown that breast milk can carry nicotine.
	   ``The knowledge that the milk of mothers who smoke smells and
may taste like cigarettes provides an additional reason to avoid
smoking,'' the researchers said.

Senate confirms postal workers' rights to free shares in privatized
</HEADLINE>
telecommunications &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish upper house of parliament on
Wednesday approved giving postal workers free shares in the
country's biggest privatization thus far, the state-owned
telecommunications monopoly.
	   The 100-member senate voted 70-1 with 17 abstentions to support
the government plan to make Poczta Polska employees eligible for
free shares of Telekomunikacja Polska SA.
	   But the senate limited to 40 percent the number of free shares
available to postal workers. The remaining 60 percent of free
shares are for employees of TPSA. The two companies were separated
in 1991 as part of restructuring.
	   The bill still needs the approval of President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   TPSA shares available to the general public began selling on the
stock exchange on Wednesday at 16.9 zlotys (dlrs 4.9) per share.
	   In September, TPSA employees threatened a strike if postal
workers were to get free shares. It will increase the number of
eligible employees from 75,000 to 180,000 and cut down the original
estimates of getting 60,000 zloty (dlrs 16,200) worth of free
shares per person.
	   Average monthly salary in Poland is about dlrs 300.
	   TPSA, which has 8 million subscribers, is practically a monopoly
in this nation of 39 million.
	   Proceeds from the sale of Telekomunikacja Polska SA, valued by
analysts at more than dlrs 8 billion, will be used to cover budget
deficits, reform of the social security system and further
privatization.
	   As of Oct. 19, the government began selling 15 to 25 percent of
the telephone company's shares, a volume that could eventually
double shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and make it the largest
exchange in central Europe.
	   Fifteen percent are to be distributed to employees free of
charge.
	   TPSA earned a net profit of 970 million zloty (dlrs 262 million)
last year.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In the streets and in Parliament, Turks
rallied behind their leaders Wednesday in their tough stand on a
Kurdish rebel chief detained in Italy: No relenting in their demand
for his extradition. No negotiating with the rebels.
	   Abdullah Ocalan's supporters in Europe showed equal fervor. One
of about 500 Kurds camped outside the military hospital in Rome
where Ocalan is believed to be held set himself on fire with
gasoline Wednesday, crying out Ocalan's name.
	   Through an aide, Ocalan later appealed to followers to stop such
fiery protests, which have left several Kurd inmates in Turkish
prisons hospitalized and killed one protester in Moscow. ``Such
actions are very generous but aren't necessary,'' lawyer Luigi
Saraceni told the Kurds.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a bloody, 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's
southeast.
	   He was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport as soon as he stepped
off a flight. Italy is weighing his request for political asylum
and expected to reject Turkey's request for his extradition.
	   Turkey's government offered its people free use of fax machines
Wednesday to send protests to the Italian government to press for
his return.
	   Thousands of Turks gathered outside the Italian Embassy in
Ankara for a second day, burning Italian flags and demanding
extradition.
	   Although Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government is on
the brink of collapse over mafia scandals, it was clear Wednesday
that support for the tough line on Ocalan crossed all political
lines.
	   ``No government of the Turkish Republic will ever .. sit at the
table with the monster that has blood on his hands,'' Yilmaz
declared in Parliament, drawing overwhelming applause from allies
and opponents alike.
	   The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party
has killed 37,000.
	   The military has always drawn strong public support in the war
against the rebels despite thousands of losses. No anti-war
movement has evolved. Turkey has never responded to Ocalan's calls
for cease-fires in the past nor to Ocalan's claims now to have
renounced violence.
	   ``We have abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace
accord,'' Ocalan told the daily newspaper La Repubblica. ``My
presence here testifies to a change in the strategy of the Kurdish
national movement.''
	   ``We want to be recognized as Kurds through the introduction of
democratic laws,'' Ocalan said in another interview with L'Unita
newspaper.
	   Turkey is trying Ocalan in absentia on capital crimes. Italy
refuses to extradite people facing the death penalty.
	   Turkey's prime minister said Italy's response to the extradition
request would be a test of its commitment to combat terrorism.
	   ``If it does not pass this test successfully it will become an
accomplice to all the murders the (rebels) have committed until
now,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema rejected the accusation, telling
a news conference in Rome: ``Italy doesn't justify terrorism and
doesnt' want to be an accomplice.''
	   D'Alema appealed for backing from Italy's European allies,
saying it was more than an Italian-Turkish problem.
	   There are 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out in Turkey, Syria,
Iran and Iraq and hundreds of thousands more in Europe. Turkey does
not recognize its 12 to 15 million Kurds as an official minority,
which would give them the right to teach and broadcast in their own
language.

Causes hereditary deafness among Ashkenazi Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JANET McCONNAUGHEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ A newly discovered genetic mutation appears
to cause nearly all cases of hereditary deafness among Jews of
Eastern European descent.
	   The find _ and a previously known mutation discovered on the
same gene _ could lead to prenatal screening that could help
parents find out whether their child is going to be deaf.
	   The discovery also sheds light on the workings of the inner ear,
and could lead to new genetic treatments for hearing problems.
	   ``It's something we're very excited about, and I think many of
our patients will be excited about it, too,'' said Kathleen Arnos,
director of genetic counseling at Gallaudet University in
Washington, the United States' only liberal arts university for
deaf people.
	   Many people want to know why they or their children are deaf,
she said, and ``it was previously very difficult to identify the
cause. We'd say, `We think it's genetic, but we're not sure.'''
	   Knowing ahead of time that a child will be deaf would let
parents teach the youngster from birth, rather than wasting
precious months or years before recognizing the problem. And it
would give them time to decide whether they want their child taught
lip-reading, sign language or both.
	   The finding was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine. Bronya Keats of LSU Medical Center coordinated the
research at four American centers and one in Belgium.
	   The mutation was first found in three families, one of whom had
come to LSU. Researchers then looked for it in DNA of New York
Ashkenazi Jews who had participated in genetic testing for other
studies.
	   Scientists look for genetic problems among groups such as New
York's Ashkenazis and Louisiana's Cajuns because it is easier to
find them among people who tend to marry within their own group.
	   The deafness mutation was found in a relatively high number _
more than 4 percent _ of the Ashkenazi Jews studied. It is believed
to be far rarer in the general population.
	   Both parents would have to carry the mutation for the child to
be deaf. There is a 1-in-4 chance that any child of such a couple
would be deaf.
	   Another mutation on the same gene is thought to cause up to half
of all childhood deafness in people of Northern European ancestry.
	   In both Ashkenazi Jews and Northern Europeans, about 1 in 1,000
children is born with serious hearing problems.
	   The fact that both mutations are on a gene that makes a protein
called connexin 26 may give a hint to the molecular basis of
hearing, Karen P. Steel of England's Medical Research Council
Institute of Hearing Research wrote in an accompanying editorial.
	   Connexin 26 is involved in the links that let small molecules
pass between cells. Once scientists figure out just how the protein
works in the ear, they may be able to find a way to replace it or
make another protein do its work, Keats said.
	   The gene is a small one, making it easy to check. This has led
to a hot debate over whether it is ethical to use it for prenatal
testing, Steel wrote.
	   A survey mailed to readers of British Deaf News found that a few
_ less than 2 percent of the 897 who sent in the survey _ would
abort a fetus if they knew the child would be deaf.
	   Only 217 were interested in genetic counseling, and 72 percent
of those people wanted to be able to prepare for their child's
language needs, researcher Anna Middleton of St. James Hospital in
Leeds, England, told the National Society of Genetic Counselors
last month in Denver.
	   So far, 10 genes for deafness have been identified since
mid-1997.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II will meet privately with
President Bill Clinton in January in a trip that will take the
pontiff to Mexico City and St. Louis, the Vatican said Wednesday.
	   The two men will talk Jan. 26 in a room at an Air National Guard
hangar when the pope arrives at St. Louis' international airport.
	   The Jan. 22-28 trip will take the pope first to Mexico City. He
will speak to Catholic clerics from the Americas and visit
President Ernesto Zedillo on Jan. 23 at the presidential palace.
	   After meeting with Clinton and speaking with sick children from
Cardinal Glennon's Children's Hospital on Jan. 26, the pope will
deliver a homily at a morning mass at St. Louis' Trans-World Dome
on Jan. 27.
	   He heads home to Rome later that evening.
	   John Paul has met several times in the past with Clinton, a
Baptist.

Coast guards detain 22 suspected illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ Coast guards on Wednesday detained 22
would-be illegal immigrants to Spain and were looking for an
estimated 30 others along the southern Spanish coast, news reports
said.
	   The immigrants were crossing the Mediterranean Sea separating
North Africa from Spain in a small fishing boat that apparently ran
out of fuel and called for help from a passing merchant vessel, the
state-owned news agency EFE reported quoting police sources in this
southern city.
	   The merchant boat informed the coast guards that the fishing
vessel was full of suspected illegal immigrants from North Africa
heading for Spain's southern coastline, EFE said.
	   The authorities later detained 22 of the disembarked passengers
along close to the shore, and initiated a search for the rest, the
agency reported.
	   Fleeing poverty at home, thousands of people make the hazardous
crossing between North Africa and Spain every year. Most travel in
overcrowded single-motor boats, and many are believed to drown.

Fiat and Russian automaker delay launch of joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Italian auto giant Fiat and Russian automaker GAZ
will delay a launch of their joint car plant in Russia until
mid-1999 instead of later this year because of the country's
economic problems, a GAZ spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Spokesman Alexei Barkalov insisted that the dlrs 840 million
project would not be scrapped altogether.
	   ``We had to reassess our plans and deadlines because of the
financial crisis,'' Barkalov told Dow Jones Newswires. ``There
aren't any plans to cancel the joint venture.''
	   Fiat officials said they weren't surprised by the delay, but
added that their investment plans remained on track.
	   Russia has been in deep recession since mid-August, when the
government defaulted on its treasury debt and devalued the ruble,
sending the cost of imports soaring.
	   Assembling cars in Russia from imported parts has become too
expensive, Barkalov said.
	   ``We are changing our tactics now, so that we can use as many
Russian-made parts as possible when we launch production next
spring or summer,'' Barkalov said.
	   The new car company, called Nizhegorodmotors, is expected to
produce 150,000 Fiat-designed cars annually by 2004 at a price of
slightly more than dlrs 10,000 per car, Barkalov said.
	   Fiat and GAZ each will hold a 40 percent stake in
Nizhegorodmotors, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) will hold the remaining 20 percent.

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities have discovered the remains
of 25 children in a western state capital and fear some were
victims of satanic rituals.
	   The bodies _ almost all of them skeletons _ were found in two
searches in Pereira, a city of 700,000 people about 110 miles (175
kilometers) from Bogota.
	   Liquor bottles were found beside many of the victims, two of
whom were tied to trees and apparently tortured, Luis Fernando
Henao of the mayor's office told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

	   ``It's a chilling thing,'' Mayor Luis Alberto Duque said in a
radio interview. ``The big concern is we don't know what it's all
about.''
	   Twelve of the victims were found Tuesday in a riverbed below a
city highway. Searchers rappelled down a ravine to reach the site
after workers fixing electrical lines spotted what they believed
were animal bones, said state prosecutor Elena Osorio.
	   The other remains were discovered last week, scattered in
underbrush in a city lot, after a child came across a skull.
	   Many of the skeletons were incomplete and investigators
estimated the number of dead by counting skulls. Forensic experts
believe the oldest of the victims was 16 and at least half were 10
or under, Osorio said.
	   Authorities were considering a a range of motives, from possible
``social cleansing'' of suspected juvenile delinquents by vigilante
squads to satanic cults.
	   ``It's a city where satanism is widely practiced, and there's
alot of talk that children are used in rituals,'' said Henao.

Gov't spokesman says Ouyahia will `very probably' resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The government of Prime Minister Ahmed
Ouyahia will ``very probably'' resign after presenting Parliament
with the annual report of its work, likely in December, government
spokesman Hamraoui Habib Chawki said Wednesday.
	   The spokesman, who is also culture minister, said he could not
provide an exact date, not knowing how long it would take the
Parliament to complete its current agenda.
	   There have long been rumors over an eventual resignation of
Ouyahia, and they increased after President Liamine Zeroual
announced in September that he would cut short his five-year term
which normally ends in the year 2000.
	   Early presidential elections are now set for sometime in April.
	   Ouyahia, prime minister since January 1996, has not denied
rumors over his own reported plans to run for the presidency.
	   Names of numerous potential candidates have circulated
unofficially. In the past, it has been the army which determines
the nation's president, drawn from military ranks. Zeroual is a
retired general.

Brazil's economy rallying back, but many fear poor will be left out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The announcement of a financial aid
package for Brazil has worked its magic on financial markets _ but
many here now worry budget cuts required by the International
Monetary Fund will fall disproportionately on the poor.
	   Brazil's stock markets rallied 12 percent over three straight
sessions following Friday's announcement of the long awaited dlrs
41.5 billion rescue package.
	   The country's foreign reserves have stabilized since the
beginning of November, after losing some dlrs 30 billion since
mid-August,.
	   Foreign investment is postive for the first time in months and
interest rates, hiked to near 50 percent a year at the height of
the crisis, are coming down slowly.
	   But all of this has come at a price.
	   To qualify for the aid, the government announced plans to save
41.4 billion reals, (dlrs 34.8 billion) in 1999 and 8.6 billion
reals (dlrs 7.3 billion) of this are expected to come out of
education, health and other public programs.
	   ``The government cut some important assistance to the needy,''
said Senator Ramez Tebet of Mato Grosso do Sul state, who heads the
budget committee. ``We know we are living in a delicate time and
that we have to make cuts but some of these cuts are worrisome.''
	   Tebet said the new budget called for sharp cuts to low-income
housing subsidies, drought aid for the impoverished northeast and
agrarian reform which seeks to distribute land to the landless.
	   Brazil has one of the poorest land distributions in the world,
with about 20 percent of the population holding 88 percent of the
land, while the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent.
	   ``What could spell problems is the cuts in land reform, where
there were significant cuts and where the government faces a very
organized opposition,'' said Roberio Costa, senior economist with
Citibank.
	   That opposition is organized by the Landless Rural Workers
Movement which promotes large-scale invasions of land it considers
unproductive as a way of pressuring the government to speed up
agrarian reform.
	   The movement has invaded four farms since the government
announced the cuts and threatens to invade another 22 before the
week is out.
	   Costa believes that although the plan should provoke a recession
pushing unemployment beyond already record levels of around 8
percent according to official figures _ independent economists
believe employment is closer to 20 percent _ Brazil is unlikely to
experience social upheaval similar to Indonesia.
	   While Indonesia experienced a negative growth of around 15
percent, Brazil is only expected to experience negative growth next
year between 1.5 and 3 percent, Costa said.

Land Reform group invade regional banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Members of an agrarian reform
movement have stormed the doors of bank agencies in two northern
cities to pressure authorities to release already approved credits
for reform.
	   ``There is so much red tape that even when the money is released
there is more red tape,'' Landless Rural Workers Movement spokesman
Nilton Vianna told the Associated Press Wednesday.
	   The invasions occurred at branch offices of the state-run Banco
do Nordeste in the cities of Vitoria da Conquista and Itabuna in
the northern state of Bahia, said Vianna.
	   The movement often sends its members to invade large fallow
holdings owned by wealthy ranchers. The say such invasions are
necessary in a nation where some 90 percent of Brazil's arable land
is owned by 20 percent of the population while the poorest 40
percent owns just 1 percent.
	   Movement leaders say they will authorize more bank sit-ins if
the federal government fails to release monies to buy seeds for the
next planting season.
	   ``We hope that after these bank sit-ins, the money will come in
15 days,'' said Admar Bogo, a Bahia organizer.

Researcher claims piece of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The evidence is no larger than a match head. Yet, if scientists
are right, it bears witness to the cataclysm that wiped out the
dinosaurs.
	   Geophysicist Frank Kyte of the University of California at Los
Angeles has found what he said is the first known fragment of the
gigantic, rocky asteroid that scientists believe slammed into Earth
65 million years ago.
	   The fragment contains high concentrations of iridium, a rare
metal, as well as iron, nickel and chromium at levels peculiar to
extraterrestrial objects. Kyte said the most reasonable explanation
is that it came from the asteroid.
	   Other scientists said the geochemical analysis shows that the
rock chip probably did originate from space. But whether it was
shed from the asteroid that doomed the dinosaurs remains open to
debate, they said.
	   An analysis of the fragment was published in Thursday's issue of
the journal Nature.
	   The coarse-grained fleck was pulled from the floor of the
Pacific Ocean in a thin layer of the planet's crust known as the
K/T boundary. Scientists believe the layer formed from the debris
that settled back to Earth after being blown into the atmosphere by
the asteroid.
	   Other researchers have found grit in the K/T boundary that might
have been part of the pulverized asteroid, but the traces were too
small to analyze conclusively.
	   ``This is the first object recovered from the K/T boundary that
is unarguably meteoric,'' Kyte said. ``My personal interpretations
will be subject to review. But in the end we will learn more about
one of the worst days in the history of the Earth.''
	   If the K/T boundary is the smoking gun indicating a cataclysmic
event, the fragment could be a bullet fired by the gun, Kyte said.
	   The doomsday rock is thought to have eliminated 70 percent of
all plant and animal species and changed the course of evolution.
	   ``The K/T asteroid was something like six miles (ten kilometers)
across, and it got blasted into pieces that would fit on the head
of a pin,'' said Jeff Pleschia, a crater specialist with the U.S.
Geological Service in Flagstaff, Arizona.
	   The K/T boundary is nearly devoid of signs of past life, but is
full of blasted quartz crystals, iridium and other traces
suggesting the planet absorbed a tremendous blow from a space
object. Fossils of dinosaurs and many other creatures found in the
older, lower rock layers are not present in the higher, more recent
strata, suggesting a mass extinction.
	   Kyte first displayed the rock chip at a scientific meeting at
NASA three years ago. Even though it was found in the K/T boundary,
critics suggested it might be just a stray fleck of interplanetary
debris.
	   Since then, Kyte has used an electron microscope and other
high-resolution equipment to examine the fragment's molecular
structure.
	   Kyte's analysis buttresses the theory proposed in 1980 by
geologist Walter Alvarez of the University of California at
Berkeley that the dinosaurs vanished because of a collision with a
huge asteroid or comet.
	   At first, the theory had few supporters. But in 1989, scientists
found evidence of a 180-mile (290-kilometer)-wide crater gouged out
of the Earth on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
	   What species didn't die in the immediate blast probably
struggled to survive in an extended period of global cooling and
environmental havoc.
	   In 1997, researchers drilling into sediment off the Florida
coast said they found the ``smoking gun'' of the asteroid collision
_ a thin reddish stripe that was called the ``fireball layer.''
	   Direct proof is hard to come by, however. According to some
estimates, up to 99 percent of the asteroid vaporized on impact
with a force greater than all of the nuclear weapons ever made. The
rest was scattered for thousands of miles _ 5,000 miles (8,046
kilometers) in the case of this fragment.
	   ``The older something is, the harder it becomes to find a piece
of the original,'' Pleschia said. ``It is incredibly painstaking
work. You would have to be incredibly lucky to find a fist-sized
chunk of this asteroid.''

Northern town building house for Russian Santa Claus

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Father Frost, Russia's version of Santa Claus,
will now have a place to hang his red coat.
	   The northern Russian town of Veliky Ustyug is building a house
for Father Frost _ his first _ where children will be able to track
him down for requests, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Local officials and a timber company in Veliky Ustyug formed a
joint company Wednesday that will build a house for the bearded
gift-bearer and help handle his correspondence.
	   The home should be ready to receive visitors later this year, in
time for the New Year's holiday, when Father Frost, or Dyed Moroz,
brings gifts to Russian children.
	   The idea to put the house in Veliky Ustyug, 800 kilometers (500
miles) northeast of Moscow on the Sukhona River, was first floated
by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, ITAR-Tass said.

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Belgium, co-organizer and automatic qualifier
for the European Championships 2000, struggled to a goalless draw
against the part-timers of Luxembourg Wednesday, a result which is
bound to increase criticism of coach Georges Leekens.
	   What was expected to be a session of target practice turned into
a struggle for Belgium, which was fielding a young and
inexperienced team in the exhibition game.
	   Luxembourg is last in Euro 2000 qualifying Group 5 after losses
against Poland and England.
	   Belgium had made wholesale changes to the team since this
summer's disappointing World Cup and counted on Johan Walem of
Udinese to push the team forward and orchestrate the attack. It
didn't happen.
	   On a frozen pitch, Belgium failed to create many chances against
a well-organized Luxembourg defense.
	   Luxembourg, relying on a plucky team of part-timers, almost went
ahead in the 67th minute when forward Paolo Amodio exploited a
Belgian defensive error and broke through on his own but he put his
shot wide.
	   It was Belgium's first game since it tumbled out of the first
round of the World Cup without a single win to its credit. Leekens
has weeded out a slew of veterans but youth failed to turn
Belgium's fortunes around Wednesday.
	   Lineups :
	   Luxembourg : Paul Koch; Laurent Deville, Nico Funck, Jeff
Strasser, Vanek, Marc Birsens; Jeff Saibene, Luc Holtz , Manuel
Cardoni, Patrick Posing, Marcel Christophe (58, Paolo Amodio).
	   Belgium : Ronald Gaspercic; Eric Deflandre (72, Tjorven De
Brul), Glen De Boeck, Gordan Vidovic, Nico Van Kerckhoven (60, Davy
Oyen); Philippe Clement, Christiaan Janssens, Johan Walem; Sven
Vermant, Gert Claessens, Bob Peeters (60, Mbo Mpenza).

Gonzalez wins AL MVP for second time in three seasons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Juan Gonzalez was voted the American League's
Most Valuable Player on Wednesday, overwhelmingly defeating Nomar
Garciaparra and Derek Jeter to win the award for the second time in
three seasons.
	   Gonzalez, who had the most RBIs in the AL in 49 years and led
Texas to its second AL West title in three seasons, received 21
first-place votes and seven seconds for 357 points in balloting by
the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
	   ``This is a great moment for everybody, for the whole team and
the organization,'' Gonzalez said in a conference call from Puerto
Rico.
	   Garciaparra, who helped Boston win the AL playoff wild card, got
five firsts, seven seconds and seven thirds and had 232 points.
	   Jeter, one of four players on the World Series champion New York
Yankees to receive votes, had two firsts, six seconds and three
thirds, finishing with 180 points.
	   Gonzalez beat Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez 290-287 to win
the MVP two years ago.
	   ``The first time was too tight,'' said Gonzalez, the first Latin
American native to win two MVPs.
	   And it could be a Latin American sweep if Sammy Sosa beats Mark
McGwire on Thursday for the NL MVP.
	   ``I'm waiting for tomorrow's results ... and praying for
Sammy,'' Gonzalez said.
	   Gonzalez hit .318 with 45 homers and 157 RBIs, the most in the
AL since Ted Williams and Vern Stephens each had 159 for Boston in
1949.
	   Gonzalez had 101 RBIs at the All-Star break, becoming only the
second player to top the century mark going into the All-Star game
(Hank Greenberg had 103 in 1935).
	   By the final week of July, he had 116 RBIs in 105 games,
bringing up talk he could challenge the record of 190, set by Hack
Wilson in 1930.
	   ``It's not impossible,'' Gonzalez said then. ``I just need to
stay healthy and keep working hard.''
	   But then he was slowed by hamstring problems, and the chance to
reach that record disappeared.
	   Garciaparra, a unanimous choice as the 1997 AL Rookie of the
Year, hit .323 with 35 homers and 122 RBIs. Jeter, a unanimous pick
as the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year, batted .324 with 19 homers and
84 RBIs, providing solid and sometimes spectacular play at
shortstop from start to finish.
	   Mo Vaughn and Ken Griffey Jr. tied for fourth in the voting with
135 points each, followed by Manny Ramirez (127), Bernie Williams
(103), Albert Belle (96), Rodriguez (92) and Ivan Rodriguez (60).
	   Gonzalez gets a dlrs 250,000 bonus for winning the award. Also
getting bonuses were Garciaparra (dlrs 75,000) and Ivan Rodriguez
(dlrs 50,000).

Hungary defeats Switzerland 2-0 in exhibition game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary scored two goals in the first
seven minutes to beat Switzerland 2-0 in an exhibition match
Wednesday before 4,000 fans braving near-freezing weather at
Ferencvaros stadium.
	   In the very first minute, Janos Hrutka headed Istvan Pisont's
long shot to Gyoergy Korsos, who fired the ball into the net from
three meters (yards).
	   Six minutes later, left winger Gabor Egressy passed to the
right, where Jozsef Seboek headed it in from five meters (yards)
for 2-0.
	   The Swiss regrouped and concentrated more, bent on at least
stopping the host team, but were not able to score themselves.
	   The Hungarian defense stoold their ground on home turf, stopping
all Swiss offensives, although in the 34th minute the visitors
nearly scored when Raphael Wicky fired from 14 meters, but the ball
went just wide of the right goal post.
	   ``The Swiss played arrogantly,'' was how Gyoergy Mezei, a former
all-stars player, saw it on state TV, commenting on the first half.
	   The Hungarians were more cautious - and slower - in the second
half, while the Swiss were more aggressive but failed failed to
score.
	   In the 72nd minute, Sebastien Jeanneret headed the ball just
over the net from two meters (yards).
	   Lineups:
	   Hungary: Gabor Kiraly, Vilmos Seboek, Gyoergy Korsos, Janos
Hrutka, Janos Matyus, Pal Dardai, Istvan Pisont (Robert Waltner,
88th), Jozsef Somogyi, Jozsef Seboek (Miklos Herczeg, 75th) Miklos
Feher, Gabor Egressy
	   Switzerland: Andreas Hilfiker (Marco Pascolo, 46th min), Ciriaco
Sforza (Johann Lonfat, 46th min), Sebastien Jeanneret, Stephane
Henchoz, Johann Vogel (Francesco di Jorio, 85th), Marc Hodel, David
Sesa, Raphael Wicky, Patrick Buehlmann, Frederick Chassot
(Alexander Rey, 56th), Stephane Chapuisat.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was decorated
Wednesday with Spain's Grand Cross of Civil Merit.
	   Johnson received the honor from Deputy Prime Minister Francisco
Alvarez Cascos on the second day of a trade and cultural mission to
Spain at the head of a delegation of state tourism officials and
business leaders.
	   Cascos, who visited New Mexico in April, said the decoration
recognized the governor's efforts to build on bilateral historical
ties that stretch back four centuries.
	   He also called for more cultural and commercial exchange between
Spain and New Mexico in the future.
	   Agreements to broaden student exchange programs at both the
university and secondary school levels are expected to be signed by
the delegation before it leaves Spain Saturday.
	   The agenda also includes meetings with Culture Minister
Esperanza Aguirre and Crown Prince Felipe.

Government accuses defiant Lords of abusing power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 2 and 3 with Lords turn down bill again; edits
to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Already under a political death sentence in its
present form, Britain's unelected House of Lords has repeatedly
blocked a bill to change the voting system for European Parliament
elections in what the Labor Party government calls ``an abuse of
power.''
	   By a vote of 212-183, the Lords rejected the bill for the fifth
straight time Wednesday in an unprecedented show of defiance that
Prime Minister Tony Blair blames on hereditary peers _ aristocrats
who overwhelmingly support the opposition Conservative Party.
	   The government said will make no further attempt to have it
passed before the current parliamentary session ends on Thursday,
effectively killing off the bill.
	   In angry exchanges in the House of Commons before the Lords'
vote, Blair taunted Conservative leader William Hague with
``wrapping himself in the ermine of hereditary peers.''
	   ``This is no longer about the (voting) system, it's about the
hereditary Tory peers in the House of Lords,'' Blair said, shouting
above jeers from Conservative lawmakers.
	   Hague, referring to Blair's plan to turn the Lords into an
all-appointed chamber, charged him with seeking to ``expand the
power of your own clique of cronies at the expense of the power of
the people.''
	   The latest defeat will be used by Labor as a major argument for
its plan to abolish the 600-year-old right of hereditary peers to
vote in the Lords.
	   On Tuesday, the Lords rejected the bill by a 261-198 vote.
	   Queen Elizabeth II is due to open the new session of Parliament
on Tuesday by reading out the legislative program for the coming
year _ likely to include a bill to strip the hereditary peers of
voting rights.
	   The government can get a measure rejected by the Lords passed
automatically in the next session of Parliament.
	   But reintroducing the bill in the new session would be too late
to set up the voting system _ which critics say gives too much
power to party machines _ for European Parliament elections in
July.
	   The new system, involving constituency boundary changes, could
not then be in place until 2004 elections.
	   Conservative opponents, both lifetime and hereditary peers, are
supported by dozens of peers with no party affiliation, some Labor
rebels, and senior Church of England bishops who have seats in the
upper chamber.
	   But Blair's aides said that without the votes of Tory hereditary
peers, the measure would have passed by 36 votes on Tuesday.
	   The bill provides that instead of voting for a single candidate
in each district, voters choose a party. The party would then
allocate seats to its nominees, with the number of seats based on
the proportion of the overall vote won by each party.
	   The system is used France, Germany, Greece, Spain and Portugal.
But British opponents say the measure deprives voters of the right
to choose a candidate and allows party apparatchiks to control who
gets elected.

Yugoslavia beats Ireland 1-0 in Euro 2000 qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Predrag Mijatovic scored in the 64th
minute to give Yugoslavia a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Ireland in
their Euro 2000 qualification soccer match Wednesday.
	   Star striker Mijatovic profited from a mistake by Steve
Staunton, who missed a cross into his penalty area and the Yugoslav
striker scored on a sliding shot into the right corner of the Irish
goal from close range.
	   Yugoslavia started the match with several swift attacks as
free-kick specialist from Lazio Rome Sinisa Mihajlovic tested Irish
goalkeeper Shay Given twice. Real Madrid's Mijatovic failed to
connect one of Mihajlovic's crosses in the 34th minute from a close
distance.
	   But the well-organized Irish defense, led by Manchester United's
Roy Keane, withstood all of the Yugoslav attacks, and their
midfield started controlling the European Championship
qualification game in the second part of the first half.
	   The only serious Irish attack in the first half came in the 9th
minute when Dennis Irwin fired from some 20 meters, but the ball
went wide.
	   In the 50th minute, an Irish appeal for a penalty was turned
down by Swedish referee Karl Erik Nilsson when Jason McAteer
appeared to have been brought down by Yugoslav goalkeeper Ivica
Kralj.
	   The Yugoslavs switched into a higher gear at the start of the
second half, and Mijatovic's fierce shot zoomed past Given and his
right goal post in the 60th minute.
	   The threat of NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia over clashes in the
province of Kosovo forced UEFA to postpone the Oct. 10 game between
the two teams in Belgrade. When tensions eased, the match was given
the go-ahead for Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslavs were playing their first qualifying game of the
competition, while the Irish already have six points from victories
over Croatia (2-0) and Malta (5-0). Macedonia and Malta complete
qualification Group 8.
	   ``It was tough, the Irish played well, but we deserved this
victory,'' said Yugoslav coach Milan Zivadinovic after the match
ended at the Red Star stadium in front of some 35,000 fans.
	   Lineups:
	   Yugoslavia - Ivica Kralj; Jovan Stankovic, Goran Djorovic, Dejan
Stankovic, Sinisa Mihajlovic, Miroslav Djukic, Slavisa Jokanovic,
Vladimir Jugovic (Nenad Grozdic, 85th minute), Predrag Mijatovic,
Savo Milosevic (Ljubinko Drulovic, 76th) Dragan Stojkovic (Darko
Kovacevic, 45th.)
	   Ireland - Shay Given; Dennis Irwin, Gary Breen, Kenny
Cunningham, Steve Staunton, Jason McAteer (Keith O'Neill 80th,) Roy
Keane, Mark Kinsella, Alan McLoughlin (David Connolly, 72nd),

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In the streets and in Parliament, Turks
rallied behind their leaders Wednesday in their tough stand on a
Kurdish rebel chief detained in Italy: No relenting in their demand
for his extradition. No negotiating with the rebels.
	   Abdullah Ocalan's supporters in Europe showed equal fervor. One
of about 500 Kurds camped outside the military hospital in Rome
where Ocalan is believed to be held set himself on fire with
gasoline Wednesday, crying out Ocalan's name.
	   Ocalan ordered his followers to stop such fiery protests, which
have left several Kurd inmates in Turkish prisons hospitalized with
burns and killed one protester in Moscow.
	   ``If you want to prove your loyalty, you must quit such actions
immediately,'' he said in a statement read to followers.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a bloody, 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's
southeast.
	   He was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport as soon as he stepped
off a flight from Russia, which denied him asylum. Italy is
weighing his asylum request and expected to reject Turkey's request
for his extradition.
	   Turkey's government offered its people free use of fax machines
Wednesday to send protests to the Italian government to press for
his return. Thousands of Turks gathered outside the Italian Embassy
in Ankara for a second day, burning Italian flags and demanding
extradition.
	   Although Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government is on
the brink of collapse over mafia scandals, it was clear Wednesday
that support for the tough line on Ocalan crossed all political
lines.
	   ``No government of the Turkish republic will ever .. sit at the
table with the monster that has blood on his hands,'' Yilmaz
declared in Parliament, drawing overwhelming applause from allies
and opponents alike.
	   The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party
has killed 37,000. The military has always drawn strong public
support in the war against the rebels despite thousands of losses.
	   Turkey has never responded to Ocalan's calls for cease-fires. In
Italy, he insists that he has now renounced violence.
	   ``We have abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace
accord,'' Ocalan told the daily newspaper La Repubblica. ``My
presence here testifies to a change in the strategy of the Kurdish
national movement.''
	   Yilmaz said Italy's response to the extradition request would be
a test of its commitment to combat terrorism.
	   ``If it does not pass this test successfully, it will become an
accomplice to all the murders the (rebels) have committed until
now,'' he told Parliament.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema rejected the accusation, telling
a news conference in Rome: ``Italy doesn't justify terrorism and
doesn't want to be an accomplice.''
	   ``The Italian government will respect the laws of our country
and isn't disposed to submit to intimidation,'' D'Alema said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Ocalan had renounced terrorism repeatedly in the past, only to
later renege.
	   He called Turkey the logical place to send Ocalan because it was
the only country to pursue extradition. ``The vast majority of the
terrorist acts committed by this man was against Turkish citizens
on Turkish soil,'' he added.
	   There are 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out in Turkey, Syria,
Iran and Iraq and hundreds of thousands more in Europe. Turkey does
not recognize its 12 to 15 million Kurds as an official minority,
which would give them the right to teach and broadcast in their own
language.

	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ Germany rallied in the second
half-time to salvage a 1-1 draw against the Netherlands in an
exhibition match Wednesday.
	   Olaf Marschall scored for Germany in the 52nd minute after
Michael Reiziger had given the Dutch a well-deserved lead in the
22nd.
	   While the Netherlands, a semifinalist at the World Cup,
dominated the fast-moving first half, Germany raised its game in
the second half that had slowed to a typical exhibition-game pace.
	   For both teams, it was a test in their buildup for the 2000
European Championship.
	   Germany, the reigning champion, has to qualify, while the
Netherlands has an automatic berth as co-host with Belgium.
	   German coach Erich Ribbeck, like his Dutch colleague Frank
Rijkaard in his third match since taking the job, recalled
37-year-old veteran Lothar Matthaeus to the post of libero.
Matthaeus raised his German record of national team appearances to
130, having made his debut in 1980, also against the Dutch.
	   While Ribbeck relied on his veterans, Rijkaard was forced to
bring in two rookies, defender Marc van Hintum of Vitesse Arnheim
and striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of PSV Eindhoven.
	   The Dutch were without four injured stars _ striker Dennis
Bergkamp of Arsenal, Juventus midfielder Edgar Davids, Inter Milan
midfielder Aron Winter and midfielder Ronald de Boer of Ajax
Amsterdam.
	   Both teams had three players in the starting lineups who were
not at the World Cup.
	   The Dutch tested German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn in the seventh
minute when Marc Overmars sent a long-range, low shot but Kahn dove
to his right side to palm the ball away.
	   With the Dutch dominating the match, van Nistelrooy failed to
beat Kahn after intercepting a disastrous back pass by Andreas
Moeller.
	   But in the 22nd, Reizinger strolled through the midfield and
when no German challenged him, the Barcelona defender fired from 25
meters (yards). Kahn got his hands on the spinning ball but could
not hold it and it bounced into the net.
	   The Germans began regrouping late in the first half and
Marschall came close with a header in the 40th. The Dutch replied
immediately but Patrick Kluivert and Overmars wasted point-blank
opportunities.
	   The Germans began the second half with more resolve and
Marschall got the equalizer when he latched onto a long, looping
pass from Matthaeus that split the Dutch defense and slotted the
ball under Edwin van der Sar.
	   In the closing minutes, Kahn foiled Michael Mols from close
range with a reflex save.
	   Fearing fan violence, authorities stepped up security for the
match between two bitter neighboring rivals but police reported no
incidents before the game.
	   Seven German hooligans, all known to police, were detained at
the railway station and eight more in nearby Dortmund, while seven
Dutchmen were turned away at the border.
	   Organizers withdrew 7,000 tickets still available for the match
at the urging of the police, to avoid rival fans mixing together on
the stands.
	   That left 45,000 fans watching the match in nearly freezing
weather at the Parkstadion.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany: Oliver Kahn; Lothar Matthaeus (Carsten Ramelow, 70),
Jens Nowotny (Marko Rehmer, 46), Christian Woerns; Thomas Strunz
(Dietmar Hamann, 86), Jens Jeremies, Joerg Heinrich, Mario Basler
(Alexander Zickler, 72), Andreas Moeller; Oliver Bierhoff, Ulf
Kirsten (Olaf Marschall, 21).
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar; Michael Reiziger (Kees van
Wonderen, 67), Jaap Stam, Frank de Boer, Marc van Hintum; Jeffrey
Talan (Dries Boussatta, 73), Clarence Seedorf, Philip Cocu, Marc
Overmars (Peter van Vossen, 81); Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick
Kluivert (Michael Mols, 46).

American football world mourns Ewbank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Namath comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, Ohio (AP) _ Only two days before he died, Weeb Ewbank
watched the New York Jets-Indianapolis Colts National Football
League game from the owner's box at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
	   How fitting.
	   Ewbank, who coached both teams to national prominence and league
championships, died Tuesday at his home. He was 91.
	   Ewbank's death followed by four days the passing of a New York
contemporary, Red Holzman, who coached the New York Knicks to two
championships in 1970 and 1973 while Ewbank was leading the New
York Jets.
	   The cause of Ewbank's death was not released immediately. The
Hall of Famer was hospitalized briefly last year for a heart
problem.
	   Ewbank was the only coach to win titles in the American Football
League and National Football League. He earned championships in two
of pro football's most memorable games _ the 1969 Super Bowl with
the Jets and the 1958 NFL title with the Baltimore Colts.
	   ``Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most
dramatic of accomplishments,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
said. ``He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro
football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the
background and let the players take the credit.''
	   Ewbank guided Joe Namath and the Jets over heavily favored
Baltimore 16-7 in the third Super Bowl, giving the AFL its first
title over the more established NFL.
	   ``All of us knew he didn't have much time because of his age,
but it's still a shock and takes everything out of you,'' Namath
said Wednesday. ``I don't know how else to deal with it other than
to say it is like you see a football and jam it with a nail and the
air comes out. That is how you feel. You feel very empty, something
is gone and you are afraid it is not going to be back and it won't.
	   ``It is an awful feeling and you miss him a great deal
already.''
	   In 1958, Ewbank coached Johnny Unitas and the Colts to a 23-17
overtime win over the New York Giants. Often called ``The Greatest
Game Ever Played,'' it was credited with making pro football one of
the most popular American sports.
	   ``He was just a fine gentleman, to me the best coach I ever
played for,'' Unitas told the New York Post. ``I've always been
indebted to him for letting me come to Baltimore to play football
for him.''
	   Ewbank also led the Colts over the Giants 31-16 for the title in
1959.
	   He posted a 130-129-7 record during 20 seasons as a pro coach.
He coached the Colts from 1954 to 1962 and the Jets from 1963 to
1973.
	   Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula said Ewbank ``helped shape my
coaching philosophy.''
	   ``When I replaced him as head coach of the Colts, many of the
things I did in Baltimore and then in Miami I learned from him,''
Shula said.
	   ``I greatly admired Weeb,'' Jets board chairman Leon Hess said.
``He was a man who knew everything there was to know about football
organization and player motivation.''
	   Don Maynard, the Jets' star receiver under Ewbank, said the
coach treated his players like family.
	   ``On Saturdays, he'd let you bring your kids to the workouts,''
Maynard recalled from his home in El Paso, Texas. ``He also let you
bring your friends to the dressing room after the game. I remember
I brought Charlie Pride and Willie Nelson in.''
	   Born Wilbur Charles Ewbank, the native of Richmond, Indiana,
lived with his wife, Lucy, in Oxford. He is survived by his wife,
three daughters, eight grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
	   Despite health problems that included an artificial hip, Ewbank
still followed football closely in his later years. He watched NFL
games every weekend, usually with his wife. Ewbank was a guest of
the Jets' organization Sunday and saw the Indianapolis Colts rally
past New York 24-23.
	   In addition to coaching in two of pro football's most memorable
title games, Ewbank coached the Jets in the famous ``Heidi'' game
in 1968 _ played exactly 30 years ago Tuesday _ and the first
Monday night game in 1970.
	   Ewbank retired after the 1973 season, coaching his last game on
Dec. 16, the day O.J. Simpson broke Jim Brown's single-season
rushing mark and the 2,000-yard plateau for the season on a snowy
day at Shea Stadium.
	   He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton,
Ohio, in 1978.

Grains, soybeans rise sharply on export hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes for new export business.
	   The U.S. Agriculture Department indicated Tuesday that it likely
will buy more grain for donation to needy countries than the 2.5
million metric tons estimated earlier as it tries to help farmers
get rid of bumper crops.
	   Corn and wheat also were supported by bad weather in Australia
and Argentina, which raised the potential for sharply reduced
production there.
	   Soybean futures rose amid expectation for a increase in soybean
oil exports as the price of a competing vegetable oil, palm oil,
moves higher. Increased exports would come at a time of weaker
soybean oil processing.
	   Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to dlrs 2.93 a bushel;
December corn rose 2 1-4 cents to dlrs 2.21 1-4 a bushel; December
oats were unchanged at dlrs 1.11 a bushel; January soybeans rose 2
1-2 cents to dlrs 5.84 a bushel; while the expiring November
contract rose 6 1-4 cents to dlrs 5.79 a bushel.

Credit rating downgrade another blow to troubled theater company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Livent Inc., the troubled Canadian theater
company, may have to consider filing for bankruptcy protection,
according to officials of two credit-rating agencies that have
downgraded the company's debt rating.
	   The company's problems have been in the spotlight since
co-founder Garth Drabinsky, producer of ``Ragtime,'' ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman'' and other hit musicals, was suspended in August
after an investigation by Livent's new managers led to allegations
of financial irregularities.
	   Drabinsky and business partner Myron Gottlieb have denied any
wrongdoing. Livent's new management team is headed by former Walt
Disney executive Michael Ovitz and New York investment banker Roy
Furman.
	   Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday's
downgrades reflect uncertainty about Livent's ability to pay its
debts amid speculation that it might soon seek protection from
creditors in U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy courts.
	   ``It's looking more and more like they will have no alternative
to filing'' for bankruptcy protection, said Russ Solomon, a vice
president at Moody's in New York.
	   Livent's board of directors met Tuesday in Toronto to discuss
their financial dilemma and issued a brief statement saying they
``were carefully exploring the company's options.''
	   Analysts say one alternative to seeking bankruptcy protection
would be selling the company, but Livent's management has
acknowledged having difficulty getting a clear picture of its
financial condition.
	   Moody's, in a statement, said it was concerned about the
``multitude'' of class action lawsuits filed against Livent and
``evidence of a fundamental deterioration of the company's business
performance.''
	   Ed Lawrence, a director at Standard and Poor's in Toronto, said
Livent's credit ratings were dropped from single-B plus to
triple-C, a sign that its ability to meet its debts is ``very
vulnerable.''
	   Filing for bankruptcy protection would give Livent time to come
up with a restructuring plan aimed at preventing the company from
being devoured by its creditors.

Swedish court ruling could increase criticism of
</HEADLINE>
anti-discrimination laws &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A court ruled Wednesday that an
automobile repair shop could not be found guilty of discrimination
despite hiring an inexperienced white man over an experienced black
applicant.
	   The case in the Labor Court could increase already-strong
criticism that Sweden, despite its image of racial tolerance, has
an insufficient anti-discrimination law.
	   Current law states that an employer can be found guilty only if
it can be shown that the employer intended to discriminate.
	   ``The big stumbling-block was that I did not succeed in showing
that the employer probably chose to discriminate,'' Discrimination
Ombudsman Margareta Wadstein, who brought the case to the labor
court, was quoted as saying by the news agency TT.
	   The small repair shop had advertised last year for a mechanic.
The two prime job candidates were a white man and a Ugandan
immigrant who now holds Swedish citizenship.
	   Both had similar training in auto mechanics, but the black man
had five months of work experience, while the other candidate had
none. The court ruled that the plaintiff did not succeed in proving
that the black man was not hired because of his race.
	   The ruling comes at a time when Sweden has become increasingly
sensitive about racial questions. A study submitted to the
parliament last year said Sweden's large number of immigrants are
not being integrated into society successfully, suffering from
higher-than-average unemployment and increasingly living in
outlying suburbs where an ever-fewer number of native Swedes live.
	   Meanwhile, open signs of anti-immigrant sentiment are
increasing. A black politician in the town of Varberg resigned this
month, saying he had repeatedly received threating telephone calls,
and a firebomb was tossed Monday at a building housing refugees in
the town of Flen.

Macedonia to allow NATO force on its territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from NATO's top commander in Europe in
new grafs 5-6. &QL; 
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - Two senior NATO officials arrived in
Macedonia Wednesday as the country prepared to formally allow the
deployment of NATO's rapid reaction force to assist international
monitors in neighboring Kosovo.
	   U.S. Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief of NATO's Allied
Forces Southern Europe, and French Gen. Marcel Valentin met
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and the likely future premier,
Ljubco Georgievski.
	   Macedonia's outgoing government said Wednesday it could not give
a formal go-ahead for the NATO deployment on its territory before
the country's new government is formed. Incumbent ex-Communists
lost last month's elections to a conservative center-right
coalition.
	   But sources close to Georgievski said his new government, to be
formed by the end of this month, will invite a French-commanded
extraction force designed to rescue any of some 2,000 unarmed
verifiers if they come under threat in Kosovo, a Serbian province
in neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   In Lisbon, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in
Europe, warned Wednesday that diplomatic efforts to secure a
lasting settlement in Kosovo must advance quickly because the
cease-fire there is shaky and could collapse within months.
	   ``Despite all our best efforts ... we probably have only a
two-to-four month window of relative peace,'' Clark told a
conference here. ``We must use this respite to achieve a just and
durable political settlement'' in the southern Serb province.
	   On Tuesday, NATO formally requested Macedonia's permission to
deploy the force - about 1,800 soldiers with tanks and helicopters
- on its territory.
	   President Gligorov said in a statement Wednesday that he
received NATO Secretary General Javier Solana's request for the
deployment, adding he supports such a move because of the
``humanitarian aspect of the mission'' and Macedonia's ``strategic
plans toward NATO.''
	   Last Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to
Macedonia, warning that Macedonia's consent to serve as a base for
``any military action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to
long-term interests of the two countries'' and their good
relations.
	   On Wednesday, Macedonia handed a counter-protest to Yugoslavia,
saying the deployment of foreign troops is the country's internal
matter.
	   As part of a U.S.-brokered deal struck Oct. 12, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic allowed the civilian verifiers to be
sent to Kosovo. They are to ensure Milosevic abides by the
agreement and NATO's rapid reaction force is intended to rescue the
verifiers in case of trouble.
	   Macedonia was the only former Yugoslavia republic which seceded
without bloodshed from the six-republic federation in 1991.

	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Indian security forces and Muslim rebels
clashed in several areas of Kashmir on Wednesday, killing at least
17 people, officials said.
	   At least six guerrillas died in fighting in the mountainous
region of Charri Pathri, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) northeast
of Jammu. One soldier also died.
	   In Chandmarh, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Jammu,
three militants were killed in another clash, and at least seven
rebels were killed in other fighting throughout the region, said
army spokesman Maj. P. Purushottam.
	   Meanwhile, six villagers trying to salvage metal from a military
ammunition dump in the village of Khundroo were killed in an
explosion Tuesday when they ignored soldiers' warnings to stay
clear, Purushottam said. Three others were injured.
	   Soldiers had set two blasts to destroy the old ammunition, 65
kilometers (40 miles) south of the capital Srinagar, Purushottam
said. But they were overpowered by dozens of village scrap dealers
who rushed onto the dump and accidentally set off the blast.

Officials evacuate two towns as Mexican volcano rumbles

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout. New comment from government,

 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AP) _ Hundreds of people were evacuated
from the flanks of a feared volcano in west-central Mexico on
Wednesday as experts predicted an eruption was likely within days.
	   Volcanologists have recorded thousands of small tremors at the
12,700-foot (3,850-meter) Volcan del Fuego _ Spanish for Volcano of
Fire _ and have detected chemical changes in waters near the
mountain 280 miles (450 kms) west of Mexico City.
	   ``Something bigger could occur,'' said Jesus Muniz Murgia,
research coordinator for the University of Colima's volcano
research center. Already, ``blocks of stone can be seen falling
from the summit'' because of the tremors, Muniz said.
	   The mountain also is commonly known as the Colima Volcano _
though that name sometimes includes the taller but extinct Nevado
de Colima volcano 3 miles (5 kms) to the north.
	   Volcanologists say Colima is one of the most active and most
dangerous volcanoes in North America.
	   Troops and police moved a total of about 240 people from Yerba
Buena in Colima state and from Juan Barragan in Jalisco state,
according to civil defense officials. The two villages are about 5
miles (7 kms) from the crater.
	   The federal Interior Secretariat issued a bulletin here assuring
that ``the only risks'' immediately foreseen were landslides of
glowing rock, lava flows and ``light rains of ash on nearby
communities.''
	   Muniz said the most probable eruption would be ``a flow of lava
and incandescent rock which would probably flow down the west side
of the volcano. It is less likely that it would be explosive.''
	   But Jim Luhr, a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution,
said the activity might indicate more serious eruptions later.
	   ``Many of us believe that Colima is entering a stage of activity
which will probably _ we don't know when _ terminate with a large
explosive eruption like the one that occured in 1913,'' he said.
	   That blast blew out windows in towns several miles away and
blanketed the largest nearby city, Ciudad Guzman, with several
inches of ash. Some experts say that eruption left ash deposits
some 130 feet (40 meters) deep on the volcano's sides.
	   ``Frankly, I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen
there,'' Luhr said.
	   Some 300,000 people live within 25 miles (40 kms) of the
volcano's peak, and Colima city, the capital of Colima state, is
within 20 miles (35 kms) of the peak.
	   The volcano had a massive, Mount St. Helens-like eruption about
4,000 years ago and has had several violent outbursts in recent
centuries.
	   More recently, in 1991, a dome rose to 100 feet (30 meters)
above the crater before collapsing. Lava solidified high on the
slopes of the volcano and hot rocks shot from the crater set some
brush fires. The volcano also erupted in 1994.

	   MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AP) _ Hundreds of people were evacuated
from the flanks of a feared volcano in west-central Mexico on
Wednesday as experts predicted an eruption was likely within days.
	   Volcanologists have recorded thousands of small tremors at the
12,700-foot (3,850-meter) Volcan del Fuego _ Spanish for Volcano of
Fire _ and have detected chemical changes in waters near the
mountain 280 miles (450 kms) west of Mexico City.
	   ``Something bigger could occur,'' said Jesus Muniz Murgia,
research coordinator for the University of Colima's volcano
research center. Already, ``blocks of stone can be seen falling
from the summit'' because of the tremors, Muniz said.
	   The mountain also is commonly known as the Colima Volcano _
though that name sometimes includes the taller but extinct Nevado
de Colima volcano 3 miles (5 kms) to the north.
	   Volcanologists say Colima is one of the most active and most
dangerous volcanoes in North America.
	   Troops and police moved a total of about 240 people from Yerba
Buena in Colima state and from Juan Barragan in Jalisco state,
according to civil defense officials. The two villages are about 5
miles (7 kms) from the crater.
	   The federal Interior Secretariat issued a bulletin here assuring
that ``the only risks'' immediately foreseen were landslides of
glowing rock, lava flows and ``light rains of ash on nearby
communities.''
	   Muniz said the most probable eruption would be ``a flow of lava
and incandescent rock which would probably flow down the west side
of the volcano. It is less likely that it would be explosive.''
	   But Jim Luhr, a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution,
said the activity might indicate more serious eruptions later.
	   ``Many of us believe that Colima is entering a stage of activity
which will probably _ we don't know when _ terminate with a large
explosive eruption like the one that occured in 1913,'' he said.
	   That blast blew out windows in towns several miles away and
blanketed the largest nearby city, Ciudad Guzman, with several
inches of ash. Some experts say that eruption left ash deposits
some 130 feet (40 meters) deep on the volcano's sides.
	   ``Frankly, I don't think anyone knows what's going to happen
there,'' Luhr said.
	   Some 300,000 people live within 25 miles (40 kms) of the
volcano's peak, and Colima city, the capital of Colima state, is
within 20 miles (35 kms) of the peak.
	   The volcano had a massive, Mount St. Helens-like eruption about
4,000 years ago and has had several violent outbursts in recent
centuries.
	   More recently, in 1991, a dome rose to 100 feet (30 meters)
above the crater before collapsing. Lava solidified high on the
slopes of the volcano and hot rocks shot from the crater set some
brush fires. The volcano also erupted in 1994.

Ex-Soviet Jewish heroes to have state allowances cut

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ They served time in Soviet prisons and Siberian
labor camps for teaching Hebrew and encouraging immigration to
Israel. A group of former Soviet dissidents said Wednesday that
Israel has forgotten them.
	   Five Soviet prisoners of Zion, so-named because they suffered
imprisonment or banishment because of their efforts to immigrate to
Israel, told a news conference that the meager stipends they were
receiving were being reduced by the government.
	   They demanded full state pensions for the 850 ``prisoners of
Zion'' living in Israel.
	   Ida Nudel, who reached Israel at the age of 57, said she
expected Israel to take better care of her and her colleagues, many
of whom arrived elderly or worn out from years of hard labor in
prison and had little chance of employment.
	   ``I came without language, without a profession,'' said Nudel,
67, who spent four years in Siberian exile for agitating on behalf
of Jewish prisoners.
	   Nudel, who is retired and lives on income from writing and
prizes received years ago, gets dlrs 250 each month from the Jewish
Agency, a quasi-governmental body that handles some of Israel's
immigration administration.
	   The stipend is calculated on the basis of her four years in
exile in Siberia but does not take into account the full 17 years
she spent as +an activist.
	   ``I gave up everything to work in the underground,'' she said,
adding that a pension would symbolize government recognition of her
contribution.
	   Last summer, in response to lobbying efforts by Nudel and
others, Israel b'Aliyah _ the immigrants' rights party headed by
former Soviet Jewish activist Natan Sharansky _ passed a law giving
former prisoners of Zion a government stipend.
	   But under the new arrangement, most people will actually receive
less money than they got from the Jewish Agency.
	   ``It's a grant; it's not a pension,'' acknowledged Roman
Bronfman, the chairman of Israel b'Aliyah.
	   Bronfman said the new legislation would help a far larger group,
about 2,000, not just the 200 currently receiving grants from the
Jewish Agency.
	   Former prisoners of Zion said the new stipend neither honors
their struggle nor pays the bills.
	   ``We are not beggars,'' said Victor Brailovsky, who was jailed
in Russia for creating a Jewish newspaper. ``We just want to get
what we deserve.''
	   Other former Soviet activists attending the news conference were
Yosef Begun, Vladamir Slepak and Yosef Mendelevich.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the Mideast peace accord was
moving forward, Israel and the Palestinians resumed long-suspended
talks on a lasting peace treaty Wednesday and agreed to formally
reopen those negotiations with a ceremony next week.
	   Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas, who met with his counterpart
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said that Israel would carry
out the first stage of a long-overdue West Bank troop withdrawal
Friday and release 250 Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``Palestinian and Israeli security officials will meet Thursday
to discuss the maps and preparations for the redeployment,'' Abbas
told The Associated Press. They will also complete paper-work for
the opening of the Palestinian airport.
	   Palestinian police also made public announcements Wednesday,
listing the rules and regulations for owning weapons. Israel
insisted as part of the peace agreement that Palestinian forces
disarm militants and others carrying illegal weapons in territory
under their control.
	   The weapons decree, which threatened jail terms and fines of up
to dlrs 4,000 for anyone caught with illegal arms, was read out on
Palestinian TV and radio broadcasts. Palestinian forces will begin
illegal weapons searches Dec. 6.
	   According to the Wye River peace agreement signed by the two
sides in Washington last month, Israel is to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages in exchange
for Palestinian security and anti-terror measures.
	   In final status talks, Sharon and Abbas, also known as Abu
Mazen, will tackle the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab
conflict including permanent borders, refugees, water, Jewish
settlements and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.
	   ``We are starting today to negotiate the permanent agreement,''
Sharon told reporters at the start of the meeting. ``I think that
we have to look to the future. Looking to the past will not help
us.''
	   Alone except for a translator, the two men sat across from each
other in the second-floor of the barracks-like buildings in
Israel's Foreign Ministry complex.
	   Afterwards, Abbas told the AP they discussed committees
negotiating the economy, a Palestinian seaport and future Israeli
withdrawals.
	   ``Within a week there will be an opening ceremony for the
resumption of the final status talks, it will be in the Palestinian
autonomous areas,'' Abbas said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bitterly divided Cabinet is
to convene Thursday to review Palestinian progress in the accord
before giving the final go ahead for the first withdrawal from 2
percent of land in the northern West Bank. Israel TV said
Netanyahu's office was already studying Palestinian actions
Wednesday, ahead of the vote.
	   The Cabinet was also expected to discuss a dispute over the
prisoner release. Palestinian officials complained that 150 of the
250 prisoners to be freed were ordinary criminals and not political
prisoners as promised.
	   Also causing friction was an the effort by Jewish settlers to
take-over more West Bank land.
	   Israeli soldiers chased settlers off a rocky hilltop near the
Jewish settlement of Kedumim on Wednesday. About 30 settlers camped
on the site Tuesday, declaring that they were establishing a new
community there.
	   ``We are trying to keep the land from being given to the
enemy,'' said Shoshi Nor, one of the Kedumim settlers, after coming
down from the hill they occupied. Eleven settlers were detained for
questioning, according to Israeli police.
	   Israel's government has also angered Palestinians by
confiscating Arab-owned land to build access roads to settlements
that would be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory after
the Israeli withdrawals.
	   ``This is an obvious violation of the agreement,'' said Ahmed
Tibi, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The Sharon-Abbas meeting is the first official session over a
final status agreement since the ceremonial opening in May 5, 1996
and is slated to be completed by the end of the interim framework,
including the Wye accord, on May 4, 1999.

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ Germany rallied in the second
half-time to salvage a 1-1 draw against the Netherlands in an
exhibition match Wednesday.
	   Olaf Marschall scored for Germany in the 52nd minute after
Michael Reiziger had given the Dutch a well-deserved lead in the
22nd.
	   While the Netherlands, a semifinalist at the World Cup,
dominated the fast-moving first half, Germany raised its game in
the second half that had slowed to a typical exhibition-game pace.
	   For both teams, it was a test in their buildup for the 2000
European Championship.
	   Germany, the reigning champion, has to qualify, while the
Netherlands has an automatic berth as co-host with Belgium.
	   German coach Erich Ribbeck, like his Dutch colleague Frank
Rijkaard in his third match since taking the job, recalled
37-year-old veteran Lothar Matthaeus to the post of libero.
Matthaeus raised his German record of national team appearances to
130, having made his debut in 1980, also against the Dutch.
	   ``I was really worried after the first 20 minutes, we were under
a lot of pressure. But we were able to improve later in the game,''
Ribbeck said.
	   While Ribbeck relied on his veterans, Rijkaard was forced to
bring in two rookies, defender Marc van Hintum of Vitesse Arnheim
and striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of PSV Eindhoven.
	   The Dutch were without four injured stars _ striker Dennis
Bergkamp of Arsenal, Juventus midfielder Edgar Davids, Inter Milan
midfielder Aron Winter and midfielder Ronald de Boer of Ajax
Amsterdam.
	   ``I was very pleased with my team in the first half,'' Rijkaard
said. ``After the interval, we were not up to our usual standard.''
	   Both teams had three players in the starting lineups who were
not at the World Cup.
	   The Dutch tested German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn in the seventh
minute when Marc Overmars sent a long-range, low shot but Kahn dove
to his right side to palm the ball away.
	   With the Dutch dominating the match, van Nistelrooy failed to
beat Kahn after intercepting a disastrous back pass by Andreas
Moeller.
	   But in the 22nd, Reizinger strolled through the midfield and
when no German challenged him, the Barcelona defender fired from 25
meters (yards). Kahn got his hands on the spinning ball but could
not hold it and it bounced into the net.
	   The Germans began regrouping late in the first half and
Marschall came close with a header in the 40th. The Dutch replied
immediately but Patrick Kluivert and Overmars wasted pointblank
opportunities.
	   The Germans began the second half with more resolve and
Marschall got the equalizer when he latched onto a long, looping
pass from Matthaeus that split the Dutch defense and slotted the
ball under Edwin van der Sar.
	   In the closing minutes, Kahn foiled Michael Mols from close
range with a reflex save.
	   Fearing fan violence, authorities stepped up security for the
match between two bitter neighboring rivals but police reported no
incidents before the game.
	   Seven German hooligans, all known to police, were detained at
the railway station and eight more in nearby Dortmund, while seven
Dutchmen were turned away at the border.
	   Organizers withdrew 7,000 tickets still available for the match
at the urging of the police, to avoid rival fans mixing together on
the stands.
	   That left 45,000 fans watching the match in nearly freezing
weather at the Parkstadion.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany: Oliver Kahn; Lothar Matthaeus (Carsten Ramelow, 70),
Jens Nowotny (Marko Rehmer, 46), Christian Woerns; Thomas Strunz
(Dietmar Hamann, 86), Jens Jeremies, Joerg Heinrich, Mario Basler
(Alexander Zickler, 72), Andreas Moeller; Oliver Bierhoff, Ulf
Kirsten (Olaf Marschall, 21).
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar; Michael Reiziger (Kees van
Wonderen, 67), Jaap Stam, Frank de Boer, Marc van Hintum; Jeffrey
Talan (Dries Boussatta, 73), Clarence Seedorf, Philip Cocu, Marc
Overmars (Peter van Vossen, 81); Ruud van Nistelrooy, Patrick
Kluivert (Michael Mols, 46).

Remains of 25 children found, satan worship investigated

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout quoting mayor casting doubts on possible
satanic cult involvement; changes overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities have discovered the remains
of 25 murdered children in a state capital in western Colombia.
	   The bodies _ almost all of them skeletons _ were found in two
searches in Pereira, a city of 700,000 people about 110 miles (175
kilometers) from Bogota.
	   ``It's very distressing and disturbing...it's truly a mystery,''
Mayor Luis Alberto Duque told the Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Prosecutors and other town officials said motives they were
considering ranged from possible ``social cleansing'' of suspected
juvenile delinquents by vigilantes, to satanic cults.
	   ``It's a city where satanism is widely practiced, and there's
alot of talk that children are used in rituals,'' said mayor's aide
Luis Fernando Henao. Liquor bottles were found beside many of the
victims, two of whom were tied to trees and apparently tortured, he
said.
	   The mayor said, however, that accounts linking the deaths to
cults had ``in a high percentage been ruled out.''
	   Twelve of the victims were found Tuesday in a riverbed below a
city highway. Searchers rappelled down a ravine to reach the site
after workers fixing electrical lines spotted what they believed
were animal bones, said state prosecutor Elena Osorio.
	   The other remains were discovered last week, scattered in
underbrush in a city lot, after a child came across a skull.
	   Many of the skeletons were incomplete and investigators
estimated the number of dead by counting skulls. Forensic experts
believe the oldest of the victims was 16 and at least half were 10
or under, Osorio said.

Rose mulls lawsuit against baseball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Rose, angered that commissioner Bud Selig
hasn't ruled on his request for reinstatement, is thinking about
suing U.S. Major League Baseball if he's turned down.
	   Rose, who agreed in August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban,
applied for reinstatement on Sept. 26, 1997. Baseball's career hits
leader is ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in
force.
	   ``They made a big thing out of the fact that I went to one of
the Reds' minor league games and talked to the players in the
clubhouse _ and the Reds asked me to do that,'' Rose said in the
January issue of Sport Magazine. ``It took baseball 20 minutes to
put out a statement about that, that I may have violated the
agreement and they were threatening to fine the Reds a
quarter-million dollars, which they never did.
	   ``Yet now I applied for reinstatement under the agreement over a
year ago and I don't hear from them. I don't want to have to go to
court against them again, and I won't do anything until I'm told
one way or another, then we'll see. All I'm telling you is, whoever
is gonna say no, they're gonna have to give me and you and
everybody else a good reason.''
	   Then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giammati pushed for the lifetime
ban after he concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati
Reds while he was the team's manager.
	   Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the National League's MVP in 1973,
said he should be allowed to work for a team again.
	   ``I'm a teacher. I can make baseball a better sport,'' he said.
``And they need me. I'm amazed at how baseball is being played now.
Guys get to the big leagues too fast and there are no
fundamentals.''
	   Rose pleaded guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false
income taxes by failing to report dlrs 354,968 in income from
autograph appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. He repaid
the IRS dlrs 366,041 in back taxes, interest and penalties, and
served five months at a federal prison in Marion, Illinois. Rose
then spent three months in a halfway house and performed 1,000
hours of community service.

Inzaghi scores twice, but Spain rallied for 2-2 draw with Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Filippo Inzaghi scored his first two goals
for Italy's national team Wednesday night but a late penalty kick
lifted Spain into a 2-2 draw in a friendly match that both coaches
used to experiment with their lineups.
	   After disappointing World Cups, both countries switched coaches
and revamped their rosters with an eye to the 2000 European
Championships. There was little continuity, particularly in
defense, Wednesday with liberal substitutions on both sides.
	   Italy went ahead in the 14th minute, when Inzaghi chested down
fellow forward Francesco Totti's precise pass, split two defenders,
and rocketed a rising blast into the roof of the net from 10 meters
(yards) out.
	   Real Sociedad winger Francisco De Pedro brought Spain level in
the 33rd, when he was left unmarked and headed Michel Salgado's
cross inside the near post.
	   Inzaghi, who plays for two-time Italian League champion Juventus
of Turin, made it 2-1 in the 74th. With his back to the net, the
slender striker took midfielder Damiano Tommasi's through-ball,
turned quickly and fired a left-footed shot into the net.
	   Raul Gonzalez fixed the final score with eight minutes left,
slotting in a penalty kick.
	   There was no fan trouble at Arechi Stadium, site of the Nov. 3
Fiorentina-Grasshoppers UEFA Cup game suspended at halftime when an
explosive device tossed from the stands injured an off-field
official. Fiorentina was kicked out of the cup because of the
incident.
	   Wednesday's game already had been slated for Salerno, near
Naples, to raise money for victims of mudslides that killed more
than 100 people in the region in May.
	   Spain coach Jose Antonio Camacho's revamped roster featured just
three players who were members of the country's World Cup squad
this summer, while Italy's Dino Zoff had to do without several top
strikers who are injured, including Alessandro Del Piero, Christian
Vieri and Roberto Baggio.
	   Italy's Christian Panucci left in the last minute of the first
half with a cut on his right ankle. The defender, who plays for
Spanish club Real Madrid, received four stitches.

Hungary defeats Switzerland 2-0 in exhibition game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary scored two goals in the first
seven minutes to beat Switzerland 2-0 in an exhibition match
Wednesday before 4,000 fans braving near-freezing weather at
Ferencvaros stadium.
	   In the first minute, Janos Hrutka headed Istvan Pisont's long
shot to Gyoergy Korsos, who fired the ball into the net from three
meters (yards).
	   Six minutes later, left winger Gabor Egressy passed to the
right, where Jozsef Seboek headed it in from five meters (yards)
for 2-0.
	   The Swiss regrouped and concentrated more, bent on at least
stopping the host team, but were not able to score themselves.
	   The Hungarian defense stoold their ground on home turf, stopping
all Swiss offensives, although in the 34th minute the visitors
nearly scored when Raphael Wicky fired from 14 meters, but the ball
went just wide of the right goal post.
	   ``The Swiss played arrogantly,'' was how Gyoergy Mezei, a former
all-stars player, saw it on state TV, commenting on the first half.
	   The Hungarians were more cautious - and slower - in the second
half, while the Swiss were more aggressive but failed failed to
score.
	   In the 72nd minute, Sebastien Jeanneret headed the ball just
over the net from two meters (yards).
	   Lineups:
	   Hungary: Gabor Kiraly, Vilmos Seboek, Gyoergy Korsos, Janos
Hrutka, Janos Matyus, Pal Dardai, Istvan Pisont (Robert Waltner,
88th), Jozsef Somogyi, Jozsef Seboek (Miklos Herczeg, 75th) Miklos
Feher, Gabor Egressy
	   Switzerland: Andreas Hilfiker (Marco Pascolo, 46th min), Ciriaco
Sforza (Johann Lonfat, 46th min), Sebastien Jeanneret, Stephane
Henchoz, Johann Vogel (Francesco di Jorio, 85th), Marc Hodel, David
Sesa, Raphael Wicky, Patrick Buehlmann, Frederick Chassot
(Alexander Rey, 56th), Stephane Chapuisat.

England beats Czechs 2-0 as Wright, Anderton, Merson team up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Thirty-five-year-old Ian Wright set up
first-half goals by Darren Anderton and Paul Merson as England beat
the Czech Republic 2-0 Wednesday in an exhibition, taking some
pressure off beleaguered coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   England, widely criticized for picking up only four points in
its three European qualifiers, made the most of the friendly
despite the absence of injured forwards Alan Shearer and Michael
Owen.
	   The Czechs, unbeaten in nine games, controled the early play
with precise passing as Pavel Kuka hit the crossbar in the 9th
minute on a shot lobbed perfectly over the head of England
goalkeeper Nigel Martyn.
	   But Anderton's goal in the 22nd changed the flow when he slotted
home a 16-meter (yard) shot that beat Czech goalkeeper Pavel Kouba
to his left.
	   Anderton capitalized on a cross from Wright, who made a strong
run down the left and then left-footed the ball into the area for
Anderton.
	   Paul Merson, 30, made it 2-0 in the 39th, and again it was the
35-year-old Wright setting up the goal. Wright sent a long cross
from left wing into the box, with Dion Dublin heading it on to
Merson, who scored from 8 meters (yards).
	   The second half was as wide open as the first with England
pressing to score. One of the best chances came in the 67th when
Wright reached high with his right leg to control a pass and then
shot from 15 meters (yards) with the same leg.
	   The West Ham forward went off three minutes later with a minor
leg injury pickup on the play.
	   Lee Hendrie, who came on in 76th for Merson to pick up his first
cap for England, nearly got his first goal on a sharp-angled,
left-footed shot from the left wing that just sailed wide
	   The Czechs lead European Group 9 with three wins in three
matches. England, in Group 5, has only four points in three mathes,
trailing both Sweden and Poland with six in two games.
	   The teams:
	   England: Nigel Martyn; Sol Campbell, Martin Keown, Rio
Ferdinand, Graeme Le Saux, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Darren
Anderton, Dion Dublin, Ian Wright (Robbie Fowler 70th), Paul Merson
(Lee Hendrie 76th)
	   Czech Republic: Pavel Kouba; Radek Latal, Votava, Jiri Novotny,
Tomas Repka, Patrik Berger, Jiri Nemec, Karel Poborsky, Pavel Kuka,
Vladimir Smicer, Radek Bejbl.

Bail denied for U.S. born teen-ager held for three months in Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli military court on Wednesday
rejected a request for bail for a U.S.-born teenager held for three
months on charges of membership in the Islamic militant group
Hamas.
	   Presiding judge Lt. Col. Yoram Chaniel also ordered a delay in
the trial of 18-year-old Hashem Mufleh after prison officials
failed to deliver him to the court from a jail in the Israeli town
of Ashkelon.
	   Mufleh's trial is now scheduled to begin Dec. 9.
	   Chaniel allowed a witness to testify despite objections from
defense attorney Jonathan Kuttab, who argued that no proceedings
should be held without his client.
	   A classmate and fellow prisoner who was not identified told the
court that Mufleh attended religious study sessions under the
auspices of the Islamic Bloc student group, an organization which
Israel has outlawed.
	   Alia Mufleh, 24, a sister of Mufleh, denied that her brother was
a member of Hamas and dismissed the charges against him as
``ridiculous.''
	   ``The charges mean nothing _ since when is it illegal to have
religious lessons or post articles?'' Alia said, speaking through a
wire fence as she waited outside the military court grounds.
	   Mufleh's mother Itaf, wearing a white head scarf and long beige
dress, stood next to her, clutching her blue American passport as
she spoke of her hopes for the release of her son.
	   A charge sheet issued by the military court contains seven
charges against Mufleh, including membership in Hamas, throwing an
object in the direction of moving vehicles, distributing Hamas
leaflets and participating in a demonstration commemorating Hamas
bomb-maker Mohyedin Sharif, who was killed in a murky circumstances
earlier this year.
	   Mufleh has been in jail since being arrested at Ben Gurion
Airport in Tel Aviv on Aug. 18 as he was boarding a flight to the
United States with his mother. His family said he had planned to
begin studies at a community college in Gallup, New Mexico, where
his father lives.
	   Mufleh has lived with his mother for 16 years in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, which is under control of the Palestinian
autonomy government.
	   According to Mufleh's family, during his first month in prison
Mufleh was deprived of sleep and subjected to loud music, tied in a
contorted position for hours and had a hood placed over his head
for long periods.
	   A few days after Mufleh's arrest, the U.S. State Department
protested his detention, his interrogation and the conditions under
which he was being kept. His family said that because of the
intervention of U.S. officials in Israel, Mufleh's prison
conditions have since improved.
	   U.S. Consul Todd Haskell was present in court Wednesday to
monitor the proceedings.
	   Earlier this month, several Arab American and human rights
groups launched a campaign to press for Mufleh's release.

Government reinstates customs chief, defusing racial clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Guyanese government on Wednesday
reinstated the customs department chief it suspended six years ago,
defusing a racially-charged standoff with public employees.
	   Customs comptroller Clarence Chue reported to work at his office
in downtown Georgetown Wednesday morning. Earlier this month, an
appeals court cleared him of corruption accusations that led to his
suspension in 1992.
	   Chue's case became a rallying point for government workers of
African descent, who claim rampant racism within the administration
of President Janet Jagan.
	   The president's People's Progressive Party is mainly supported
by Guyanese of East Indian descent in this English-speaking nation
in northern South America.
	   Last week, hundreds of black workers smashed through the gates
of the Customs headquarters and stormed the building to demand
Chue's reinstatement.
	   The government resisted and responded by locking out customs
workers. Tons of imported goods piled up on Georgetown's waterfront
awaiting inspection.
	   On Wednesday, the Public Service Commission ordered that Chue be
given his job back.
	   Guyana has been plagued by frequent ethnic clashes. Bombings and
violent demonstrations by Afro-Guyanese swept through Georgetown
earlier this year to protest the re-election of Jagan's party on
Dec. 15.
	   The violence subsided only after the Caribbean Community helped
strike a peace agreement between Jagan and the People's National
Congress, which is supported by Afro-Guyanese.
	   The truce calls for the government to toughen laws against
racial discrimination and rewrite the constitution to better
balance power among the races.

Cuban official says growth lower than projected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba's economy will grow by only about 1
percent this year, well below the 2.5-3.5 percent growth officials
had expected, the country's foreign investment minister said
Wednesday.
	   The government's Prensa Latina news agency, monitored here,
reported comments that Minister Ibrahim Ferradaz had made on a
visit to Madrid, Spain.
	   Ferradaz said the economy had been hurt by falling prices for
Cuban exports such as sugar and nickel, as well as a drought
followed by the floods of Hurricane Georges.
	   The new projection would give 1998 the slowest economic growth
since 1994, when the economy was just starting to recover from 35
percent drop in gross domestic product caused by the collapse of
most of its socialist trading partners.
	   GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 1995, 7.8 percent in 1996 and 2.5
percent in 1997.
	   The growth was aided by Cuban efforts to attract foreign
investment, the legalization of private use of dollars and a
booming tourism industry. Holding it back have been a series of
dismal sugar harvests and still-sluggish performance by the
dominant state sector.
	   Cuba hopes to attract 2 million tourists by the year 2000 and 7
million by the year 2010.
	   The independent Spanish news agency Europa Press quoted Ferradaz
as saying 50,000 new hotel rooms are needed on the island to reach
a total of 80,000. He set a target of 5,000 new hotel rooms per
year over the next decade.

Israel arrests Palestinians suspected of shooting Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli security forces have arrested a number
of Palestinians in connection with the August killing of two Jewish
settlers in the West Bank, the army spokesman's office said
Wednesday.
	   The arrests took place at night before dawn Wednesday in the
Palestinian village of Tel near the Jewish settlement of Yitzhar in
the northern West Bank, where the shooting took place.
	   The army said a mobile telephone belonging to the victims, was
found in the possession of those arrested. In addition, the army
found two mortar-bombs, two home-made pipe-bombs, a revolver, clips
of ammunition and materials for making explosive charges, the army
statement said.
	   The statement did not say how many Palestinians were arrested.
	   The two settlers were ambushed while on a routine security
patrol of their settlement and shot at close range in the head.
They died instantly.

Agency says U.S. diplomats ill-equipped to deal with foreigners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a report that could be its last, a tiny
commission said American diplomats are ill-equipped to deal with
foreigners, foreign news media and nongovernmental organizations.
	   The report, released by the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public
Diplomacy Wednesday, urged the government to use its skills to
``inform, understand and influence'' increasingly important foreign
publics and train ambassadors in communicating effectively with
them.
	   ``The commission is amazed and troubled that State Department
professional diplomats can currently spend their entire careers
without receiving any training in how to understand or deal with
public attitudes, the press or nongovernmental organizations,''
said the report.
	   It said the State Department's National Foreign Affairs Training
Center has traditionally given no attention to preparing foreign
service officers for interaction with foreign individuals who are
not government officials and institutions that are not connected to
the host government.	   
	   Members of the commission said they hoped that ``Publics and
Diplomats in the Global Communications Age'' would not be their
last report. The commission was wiped out in the omnibus spending
bill approved by Congress last month that endorsed the merger of
the U.S. Information Agency into the State Department and is slated
to die when the merger takes place or on Oct. 1, 1999, at the
latest.
	   The 50-year-old commission is responsible for assessing public
diplomacy policies and programs of the USIA, other U.S. foreign
affairs agencies and U.S. missions abroad. The bipartisan agency
consists of seven members appointed by the president who serve
without pay and a full-time staff of four.
	   Staff director Jonathan Owen said the commission should be
allowed to continue to do its work. ``As an independent citizens
advisory group its voice has been heard,'' he said. ``We feel that
it plays an important role.''
	   Its report Wednesday followed recent studies by two Washington
think tanks, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and
the Henry L. Stimson Center, that also called for reforming
American diplomacy.
	   In its report, the advisory commission recommended doubling
funding for overseas public opinion polling to dlrs 10 million a
year.
	   ``What people in other nations think about the United States
matters, and what they then do as a result of those thoughts is
vitally important for our nation's interests,'' said the report.
	   In its report, the commission also said:
	   _The State Department and the USIA should establish a reserve
corps of trained public diplomacy specialists for deployment during
crises.
	   _Up to dlrs 5 million should be allocated for public diplomacy
during crises, including expanded international radio and
television broadcasts.
	   _The president should establish a permanent interagency
coordinating body for international public information.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Petre Mitu scored a try, two penalties
and three conversions as Romania gained a narrow 27-23 victory over
Georgia Wednesday gain a place in the rugby union World Cup.
	   The result means that Georgia, who led 6-3 at half time, has
lost both its third round games and that Ireland and Romania, with
one win each, will qualify for next year's championship.
	   Gabriel Brezoianu and Gheorghe Solomie also crossed the Georgian
line at Lansdowne Road.
	   Achiko Kavtarachvili and Tsabadze both scored tries for Georgia,
who lost 70-0 to Ireland on Saturday. Malkaz Urdjukachvili
converted then both and kicked two penalties and Kakhaber
Matchitidze kicked another.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was decorated
Wednesday with Spain's Grand Cross of Civil Merit.
	   Johnson received the honor from Deputy Prime Minister Francisco
Alvarez Cascos on the second day of a trade and cultural mission to
Spain by a delegation of tourism officials and business leaders
from the southwestern U.S. state.
	   Cascos, who visited New Mexico in April, said the decoration
recognized the governor's efforts to build on bilateral historical
ties that stretch back four centuries.
	   He also called for more cultural and commercial exchange between
Spain and New Mexico in the future.
	   Agreements to broaden student exchange programs at both the
university and secondary school levels are expected to be signed by
the delegation before it leaves Spain Saturday.
	   The agenda also includes meetings with Culture Minister
Esperanza Aguirre and Crown Prince Felipe.

Inzaghi scores two; Spain rallies for 2-2 draw with Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, ADDS lineups at bottom. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Filippo Inzaghi scored his first two goals
for Italy's national team Wednesday night but a late penalty kick
lifted Spain into a 2-2 draw in a friendly match both coaches used
to experiment with their lineups.
	   After disappointing World Cups, both countries changed coaches
and revamped their rosters with an eye to the 2000 European
Championships.
	   There was little continuity, particularly in defense, Wednesday
with liberal substitutions on both sides.
	   Italy went ahead in the 14th minute, when Inzaghi chested down
fellow forward Francesco Totti's precise pass, split two defenders,
and rocketed a rising blast into the roof of the net from 10 meters
(yards) out.
	   Real Sociedad winger Francisco De Pedro brought Spain level in
the 33rd, when he was left unmarked and headed Michel Salgado's
cross inside the near post.
	   Inzaghi, who plays for Italian League champion Juventus of
Turin, made it 2-1 in the 74th. With his back to the net, the
slender striker took midfielder Damiano Tommasi's through-ball,
turned quickly and fired a left-footed shot into the net.
	   ``It's really satisfying, because I really wanted to score for
the national team,'' Inzaghi said. ``The bad thing is that we
wanted to win.''
	   Raul Gonzalez fixed the final score with eight minutes left,
slotting in a penalty kick.
	   There was no fan trouble at Arechi Stadium, site of the Nov. 3
Fiorentina-Grasshoppers UEFA Cup game suspended at halftime when an
explosive device tossed from the stands injured an off-field
official. Fiorentina was kicked out of the cup because of the
incident.
	   Wednesday's game already had been slated for Salerno, near
Naples, to raise money for victims of mudslides that killed more
than 100 people in the region in May.
	   Spain coach Jose Antonio Camacho's roster featured just three
players who were members of the squad that tumbled out of this
summer's World Cup in the first round.
	   Italy's Dino Zoff, who took over the team after it lost in the
World Cup quarterfinals, had to do without several top strikers who
are injured, including Alessandro Del Piero, Christian Vieri and
Roberto Baggio.
	   ``I would say it was a tougher game than we thought it would be,
but Spain is good,'' Zoff said. ``We did some good things up front
and risked a lot on defense, but that's normal with all the
changes.''
	   Italy's Christian Panucci left in the last minute of the first
half with a cut on his right ankle. The defender, who plays for
Spanish club Real Madrid, received four stitches.
	   Captain Paolo Maldini made his 95th appearance for the Azzurri,
moving alone into second place all-time behind Zoff's record 112
caps.
	   The lineups:
	   Italy _ Angelo Peruzzi; Christian Panucci (substitute: Moreno
Torricelli, 45th), Giuseppe Favalli (Gianluca Pessotto, 61st),
Fabio Cannavaro, Paolo Maldini; Diego Fuser (Damiano Tommasi,
46th), Eusebio Di Francesco, Dino Baggio (Luigi Di Biagio, 46th),
Demetrio Albertini (Enrico Chiesa, 46th); Filippo Inzaghi,
Francesco Totti.
	   Spain _ Santiago Canizares (Antonio ``Toni'' Jimenez, 84th);
Michel Salgado, Sergi Barjuan, Marcelino Elena, Francisco ``Paco''
Jemez; Vincente Engonga (Juan Carlos Valeron, 46th), Joseba
Etxeberria (Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia Lara, 46th) , Bittor Alkiza
(Ivan Huelguera, 46th), Francisco Jose De Pedro (Agustin Aranzabal,
64th); Ismael Urzaiz (Juan Gines Sanchez, 80th), Raul Gonzalez.
	   Referee _ Fernand Meese, Belgium.

Iraqi opposition groups invited to Foreign Office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a bid to unite opponents of Saddam Hussein,
Britain said Wednesday it will host a meeting of Iraqi opposition
groups next week. The United States announced had held talks with a
key opposition figure.
	   The Foreign Office said London-based representatives of more
than a dozen opposition groups have been asked to meet Derek
Fatchett, a minister at the Foreign Office, on Monday.
	   ``The international community as a whole could only all welcome
Saddam Hussein's disappearance from the scene,'' said a Foreign
Office spokesman, speaking anonymously.
	   But he stressed that the current objective on both sides of the
Atlantic is to get Saddam to comply with U.N. resolutions and stick
to undertakings he gave at the weekend in agreeing to allow U.N.
weapons to do their work.
	   The United States announced that Ahmed Chalabi, who heads the
Iraqi National Congress, had met with Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk Wednesday.
	   The meeting was held ``in the context of the president's
statement that we will support the opposition,'' Andrew Steinfeld,
a State Department press officer said. ``We are looking forward to
a day when someone else governs Iraq.''
	   The Congress is an umbrella group in London that seeks to unite
numerous groups opposed to President Saddam Hussein.
	   At one time, it succeeded in bringing together Shiite Muslim
groups, former ruling party officials and Kurdish guerrillas who
sought autonomy in northern Iraq.
	   But the broad coalition crumbled over the years, hampered by
internal divisions, a lack of resources and what the group saw as
wavering U.S. support.
	   Calling off a U.S. military attack on Iraq last weekend,
President Clinton declared the administration would back opposition
groups _ a promise echoed by Blair.
	   The Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was not prepared to
provide large amounts of money for opposition groups groups, and
instead would concentrate on finding common ground.
	   The meeting was one of a series designed to ''encourage'' the
opposition to take a more united view on how a democratic Iraq
might develop, said the spokesman.

Yugos down Irish 1-0 in Euro 2000; England beats Czechs, Germany
</HEADLINE>
held by Dutch and Italians tie Spaniards in friendlies &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pedrag Mijatovic fired Yugoslavia to a hard-earned
1-0 victory over Ireland Wednesday as his team marked its delayed
start to the European Championships with a victory and ended the
Irish winning streak.
	   In one of five Euro 2000 matches to be played before the
competition takes a mid-winter break, the Real Madrid star hit the
winner in the 65th minute as the group-leading Irish lost for the
first time after impressive wins over World Cup semifinalist
Croatia and Malta.
	   The game was delayed a month before of the threat of NATO air
strikes on military targets in Yugoslavia over the Kosovo conflict.
	   The other eye-catching games Wednesday were friendlies, with the
1996 European champion Germany held 1-1 at home by the Netherlands,
England downing Euro '96 runner up Czech Republic 2-0 and Italy and
Spain tying 2-2.
	   In Gelsenkirchen, Michael Reiziger fired the Dutch ahead after
22 minutes before Olaf Marshall leveled for the home team in the
52nd.
	   German coach Erich Ribbeck recalled veteran sweeper Lothar
Matthaeus, who made his international debut against the Dutch back
in 1980 while the visitor was without four injured stars _ striker
Dennis Bergkamp of Arsenal, Juventus midfielder Edgar Davids, Inter
Milan midfielder Aron Winter and midfielder Ronald de Boer of Ajax
Amsterdam.
	   Germany, despite being reigning champion, has to qualify for
Euro 2000, while the Netherlands has an automatic berth as co-host
with Belgium.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle had been under fire for a series of
three poor performances all in the European Championship. But his
team raced into a 2-0 half time lead even without leading strikers
Alan Shearer and Michael Owen and finished strong too.
	   Darren Anderton side-footed England ahead in the 22nd minute and
Paul Merson fired the second just before halftime, both coming from
crosses by 35-year-old striker Ian Wright.
	   Italy was forced to play without injured Alessandro Del Piero
and Pierluigi Casiraghi but still had Filippo Inzaghi, who scored
twice in Salerno for his first goals in international colors.
	   After Inzaghi had fired the home team ahead, Francisco De Pedro
leveled for the Spaniards before half time. The Juve star regained
the lead for the Italians but Raul Gonzalez, the lone Real Madrid
star on the Spanish starting lineup, levelled with a penalty eight
minutes from the end.
	   In other Euro 2000 quyalifying games, Albania was held 0-0 at
home by Greece in Group 2, Northern Ireland was kept to 2-2 by
Moldova 3, Cyprus gained a 1-0 win at point-less San Marino in
Group 6 and Macedonia gained a 2-1 win at last place Malta in Group
8.
	   The game against Greece was Albania's first official sports
event since that country slipped into chaos following an armed
uprising in 1997.
	   The result meant that Greece missed a chance to replace Latvia
as Group 2 leader. After three games, Latvia tops the group with
six points, Greece is second with five, followed by Norway and
Slovenia with four each. Georgia has three, while Albania remains
at the bottom with two.
	   Northern Ireland twice hit back from a goal down against Moldova
in Belfast to force a tie. Iain Dowie canceled out Vladimir
Gaidamasciuc's 22nd minute strike and, after Ion Tistimitanu had
regained the lead for the visitor, Neil Lennon netted another for
home team six minutes later.
	   That result means Moldova gained its first point and Northern
Ireland moved above Germany into third place behind Finland and
Turkey, even though the Germans have a game in hand.
	   In another exhibition game, African champion Egypt held near
full-strength Norway to a 1-1 tie in Cairo, Hossam Hassan, a
veteran of Egypt's 1990 World Cup campaign, firing the home team
ahead and Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo heading the equalizer.
	   Goals in the first six minutes by Janos Hrutka and Jozsef Seboek
gave Hungary a 2-0 victory over Switzerland in Budapest.
	   Despite the fact they fielded a young and inexperienced team and
were away from home, the Belgians, who co-host the Euro 2000
championship and don't need to qualify, will be ashamed that they
failed to beat Luxembourg and were held to a 0-0 tie.

Diagnosis, treatment of attention deficit still uncertain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Doctors still don't know the best way to treat
or even diagnose attention deficit disorder in children _ even
though more than a million U.S. children now take powerful drugs to
control their hyperactive behavior, according to the National
Institutes of Health.
	   In a report issued Wednesday, a panel of experts selected by the
NIH called attention deficit disorder a ``profound problem'' that
may affect 3 percent to 5 percent of all American schoolchildren
and costs schools more than dlrs 3 billion.
	   But a consistent, proven method of diagnosing and treating the
disorder remains elusive, the experts said.
	   ``There is no current validated diagnostic test for'' the
disorder, said Dr. David J. Kupfer, a University of Pittsburgh
psychiatry professor and chairman of the panel.
	   Some treatments are effective in the short term _ principally
drugs such as Ritalin _ but no studies have examined their effect
on children who take them for more than 14 months, Kupfer said.
	   Attention deficit disorder, or ADD, also known as attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, usually is diagnosed in school-age
children, often as the result of a child's disruptive behavior.
	   Symptoms include the inability to sit still for reading, study
or even to watch television. Often a child cannot play in group
games and will act on inappropriate impulses.
	   Yet defining precisely what constitutes ADD is difficult, said
Dr. Mark Vonnegut, a pediatrician and panel member.
	   ``The diagnosis is a mess,'' Vonnegut said, ``but we all believe
we are dealing with a serious core problem.''
	   For professionals who spend much time around children, he said,
``these kids stick out like a sore thumb.''
	   Nonetheless, Janis Ferre of the Utah Governor's Council for
People with Disabilities, also on the panel, said there's wide
inconsistency in how a diagnosis is made. ``This results in
over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis,'' she said.
	   Panel member Donald A. Berry of Duke University Medical Center
said he thought Ritalin and other powerful, mind-altering drugs are
prescribed too often for children, criticizing the lack of studies
on the drugs' long-term effects.
	   ``There is no gold standard for therapy, so it is difficult to
look at the prescribing practice and say what is appropriate or not
appropriate,'' said panel member Dr. Robert S. Baltimore of the
Yale University School of Medicine.
	   The president of a leading advocacy group, Children and Adults
with Attention Deficit Disorders, said she was pleased the report
confirms ``that ADD is a serious disorder with potentially
devastating consequences whose effects extend into adulthood.'' But
the report clearly shows the need for ``a more consistent system
for diagnosis and for treatment,'' said the official, Mary
Robertson.

New Zealand interest rates at record low level
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Wholesale interest rates, the key
to the cost of home and business loans, have fallen to the lowest
level recorded in New Zealand in the wake of an easing of monetary
conditions by the Reserve Bank.
	   Wholesale interest rates fell back nearly 0.5 percent to just
under 4.3 percent late Wednesday _ the lowest point since 1970,
when the bank started keeping records of the 90-day bill trade.
	   The kiwi dollar dropped almost half a US cent to US53 by the end
of the trading day Wednesday.
	   The reductions followed the bank's sanctioning of an easy of
monetary conditions because the outlook for the international and
New Zealand economies had weakened. New Zealand's economy has been
in recession since the first (March) quarter of 1998.
	   Banking sector economists predicted floating home mortgage rates
could soon fall toward 6 percent from the present level of just
under 7 percent, and may remain low for the next two years.
	   The Reserve Bank easing of interest rates came less than an hour
after United States interest rates were cut by 25 points to 4.75
percent. The US rate cut was widely expected, as the central bank
moved to stave off the risk of a recession around the world.
	   New Zealand's wholesale rates could stay under 5 percent for the
next two
	   years, according to the bank's projections, but some economists
doubt that and say the Reserve Bank may have to start tightening
again early in 2000.
	   The Reserve Bank's move was sparked by a weaker than expected
economy and
	   concerns the bounce-back will not be as strong as predicted.
Just 0.3 percent growth is now predicted for the final (December)
quarter of 1998.

Luxembourg, Belgium play scoreless tie in the exhibition game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Belgium, co-organizer and automatic qualifier
for the European Championships 2000, struggled to a goalless draw
against the part-timers of Luxembourg Wednesday, a result which is
bound to increase criticism of coach Georges Leekens.
	   What was expected to be a session of target practice turned into
a struggle for Belgium, which was fielding a young and
inexperienced team in the exhibition game.
	   Luxembourg is last in Euro 2000 qualifying Group 5 after losses
against Poland and England.
	   Belgium had made wholesale changes to the team since this
summer's disappointing World Cup and counted on Johan Walem of
Udinese to push the team forward and orchestrate the attack. It
didn't happen.
	   On a frozen pitch, Belgium failed to create many chances against
a well-organized Luxembourg defense.
	   Luxembourg, relying on a plucky team of part-timers, almost went
ahead in the 67th minute when forward Paolo Amodio exploited a
Belgian defensive error and broke through on his own but he put his
shot wide.
	   It was Belgium's first game since it tumbled out of the first
round of the World Cup without a single win to its credit. Leekens
has weeded out a slew of veterans but youth failed to turn
Belgium's fortunes around Wednesday.
	   Lineups :
	   Luxembourg : Paul Koch; Laurent Deville, Nico Funck, Jeff
Strasser, Vanek, Marc Birsens; Jeff Saibene, Luc Holtz , Manuel
Cardoni, Patrick Posing, Marcel Christophe (58, Paolo Amodio).
	   Belgium : Ronald Gaspercic; Eric Deflandre (72, Tjorven De
Brul), Glen De Boeck, Gordan Vidovic, Nico Van Kerckhoven (60, Davy
Oyen); Philippe Clement, Christiaan Janssens, Johan Walem; Sven
Vermant, Gert Claessens, Bob Peeters (60, Mbo Mpenza).

	   TA' QALI, Malta (AP) _ Macedonia scored twice early in the
second half and held on to edge Malta 2-1 Wednesday night in a
Group 8 qualifying match for Euro 2000.
	   Igor Nikolovski put the visitors ahead in the 49th minute,
slamming in a cross from captain Toni Micevski. Srdjan Zaharievski
doubled the advantage with a long-range shot 13 minutes later.
	   Nikolovski had nearly given Macedonia an early lead, but his
shot in the sixth minute of play went off Malta 'keeper Mario
Muscat and then hit the post before being cleared.
	   Malta, which last won in international play 16 years ago, pulled
one goal back through Paul Sixsmith in the 69th.
	   Macedonia also beat Malta 4-0 at home Sept. 6.

	   Malta _ Mario Muscat; Paul Sixsmith, David Camilleri, Michael
Spiteri, Darren Debono; John Buttigieg, Carmel Busuttil, Nicholas

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reigning African champions Egypt held a near
full-strength Norway to a 1-1 draw and dominated play for most of
the first half in a friendly match played here Wednesday.
	   The Pharaohs, as the Egyptian national side is known, took the
lead in the 37th minute when striker Hossam Hassan, a veteran of
Egypt's 1990 World Cup campaign, capitalized on a blunder by Norway
keeper Frode Grodas.
	   Hassan intercepted a shot by the goalie with his head just
outside the box. Chased by two Norway defenders, the 32-year-old
Hassan raced ahead and shot low to the right of the advancing
Grodas.
	   Chelsea and Norway striker Tor Andre Flo leveled the score with
a header 18 minutes into an unexciting second half.
	   Egypt, however, looked the more threatening side for most of the
match, with its host of European exiles squandering several scoring
chances with poor finishing.
	   Wednesday's friendly is part of the Norwegians' preparations for
Euro 2000 qualifiers. It is in Group II with Greece, Latvia,
Albania, Slovenia and Georgia. Their next qualifying match is away
to Greece in March next year.

Yugoslavia beats Ireland 1-0 in Euro 2000 qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Predrag Mijatovic scored in the 64th
minute to give Yugoslavia a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Ireland in
their Euro 2000 qualification soccer match Wednesday.
	   Star striker Mijatovic profited from a mistake by Steve
Staunton, who missed a cross into his penalty area and the Yugoslav
striker scored on a sliding shot into the right corner of the Irish
goal from close range.
	   Yugoslavia started the match with several swift attacks as
free-kick specialist from Lazio Rome Sinisa Mihajlovic tested Irish
goalkeeper Shay Given twice. Real Madrid's Mijatovic failed to
connect one of Mihajlovic's crosses in the 34th minute from a close
distance.
	   But the well-organized Irish defense, led by Manchester United's
Roy Keane, withstood all of the Yugoslav attacks, and their
midfield started controlling the European Championship
qualification game in the second part of the first half.
	   The only serious Irish attack in the first half came in the 9th
minute when Dennis Irwin fired from some 20 meters, but the ball
went wide.
	   In the 50th minute, an Irish appeal for a penalty was turned
down by Swedish referee Karl Erik Nilsson when Jason McAteer
appeared to have been brought down by Yugoslav goalkeeper Ivica
Kralj.
	   The Yugoslavs switched into a higher gear at the start of the
second half, and Mijatovic's fierce shot zoomed past Given and his
right goal post in the 60th minute.
	   The threat of NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia over clashes in the
province of Kosovo forced UEFA to postpone the Oct. 10 game between
the two teams in Belgrade. When tensions eased, the match was given
the go-ahead for Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslavs were playing their first qualifying game of the
competition, while the Irish already have six points from victories
over Croatia (2-0) and Malta (5-0). Macedonia and Malta complete
qualification Group 8.
	   ``It was tough, the Irish played well, but we deserved this
victory,'' said Yugoslav coach Milan Zivadinovic after the match
ended at the Red Star stadium in front of some 35,000 fans.
	   Lineups:
	   Yugoslavia - Ivica Kralj; Jovan Stankovic, Goran Djorovic, Dejan
Stankovic, Sinisa Mihajlovic, Miroslav Djukic, Slavisa Jokanovic,
Vladimir Jugovic (Nenad Grozdic, 85th minute), Predrag Mijatovic,
Savo Milosevic (Ljubinko Drulovic, 76th) Dragan Stojkovic (Darko
Kovacevic, 45th.)
	   Ireland - Shay Given; Dennis Irwin, Gary Breen, Kenny
Cunningham, Steve Staunton, Jason McAteer (Keith O'Neill 80th,) Roy
Keane, Mark Kinsella, Alan McLoughlin (David Connolly, 72nd),
Damien Duff, Niall Quinn (Tony Cascarino, 72nd).

	   SERRAVALLE, San Marino (AP) _ Milenko Spolgaric tallied in the
41st minute to lead Cyprus past San Marino 1-0 Wednesday night in a
Group 6 Euro 2000 qualifier between two sides comprised mostly of
amateur players.
	   Spolgaric outjumped a group of players in front of the net to
head home a long free kick from the left flank.
	   It was a sometimes ill-tempered match that had seven players
shown yellow cards.
	   Cyprus picked up its second qualifying victory, following its
3-2 upset of Spain in September, a result that cost longtime
Spanish coach Javier Clemente his job.
	   San Marino has lost all of its qualifying games.
	   The lineups:
	   San Marino _ Federico Gasperoni; Mirco Gennari, Simone
Bacciocchi, William Guerra, Vittorio Valentini, Mauro Marani;
Riccardo Muccioli, Pier Domenico Della Valle, Ivan Matteoni; Paolo
Montagna, Andrea Ugolini.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In a bid to unite opponents of Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein, Britain said Wednesday it will host a meeting of
Iraqi opposition groups next week. The United States announced had
held talks with a key Iraqi opposition figure.
	   The Foreign Office said London-based representatives of more
than a dozen opposition groups have been asked to meet Derek
Fatchett, a minister at the Foreign Office, on Monday.
	   ``The international community as a whole could only all welcome
Saddam Hussein's disappearance from the scene,'' said a Foreign
Office spokesman, with customary anonymity.
	   But he stressed that the current objective on both sides of the
Atlantic is to get Saddam to comply with U.N. resolutions and stick
to undertakings he gave at the weekend in agreeing to allow U.N.
weapons inspectors to do their work.
	   The United States announced that Ahmed Chalabi, who heads the
Iraqi National Congress, had met with Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk Wednesday.
	   The meeting was held ``in the context of the president's
statement that we will support the opposition,'' Andrew Steinfeld,
a State Department press officer said. ``We are looking forward to
a day when someone else governs Iraq.''
	   The Congress is an umbrella group in London that seeks to unite
numerous groups opposed to President Saddam Hussein.
	   At one time, it succeeded in bringing together Shiite Muslim
groups, former ruling party officials and Kurdish guerrillas who
sought autonomy in northern Iraq.
	   But the broad coalition crumbled over the years, hampered by
internal divisions, a lack of resources and what the group saw as
wavering U.S. support.
	   Calling off a U.S. military attack on Iraq last weekend,
President Clinton declared the administration would back opposition
groups _ a promise echoed by Blair.
	   The Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was not prepared to
provide large amounts of money for opposition groups, and instead
would concentrate on finding common ground.
	   The meeting was one of a series designed to ``encourage'' the
opposition to take a more united view on how a democratic Iraq
might develop, said the spokesman.

Portugal defeats Israel 2-0 in exhibition game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SETUBAL, Portugal (AP) _ A goal in the final minute by
substitute Simao Sabrosa, who was making his debut, lifted Portugal
a 2-0 win over Israel in a mostly uneventful exhibition game
Wednesday.
	   A goal in the sixth minute by defender Fernando Couto had put
the home side into the lead.
	   Sabrosa, 19, used his pace to pierce the Israeli defense and
chip the ball over keeper Nir Davidovitz.
	   Earlier, a Rui Costa free-kick on the left of the Israeli
penalty area hit the wall and ballooned into the air, Davidovits
slipped, and Couto charged in unmarked to tap the ball over the
line.
	   The visitor played defensive tactics, stacking its midfield and
defense, leaving Eyal Bercovic and Ronen Harazi to mastermind some
inspired counter-attacks.
	   Harazi shot just over the Portuguese bar after 12 minutes.
	   Costa and Luis Figo worked hard to create chances for the
Portuguese, but Ricardo Sa Pinto was a lonely figure up front and
was unable to break free of his marker.
	   Portugal was more vigorous in attack after bringing on Sabrosa
and Pauleta for the second half.
	   Avi Nimni was active down the left flank for Israel, and Harazi
continued to menace the Portuguese goal, shooting narrowly wide
after 64 minutes.
	   Dani Carvalho tested Davidovitz with a long-range shot, and
Shitrit sprinted into the Portuguese area but hit just off target
in the dying minutes.
	   Lineups:
	   Portugal: Vitor Baia (Pedro Espinha 45th), Abel Xavier, Paulo
Madeira, Fernando Couto, Paulinho Santos, Paulo Sousa (Dani
Carvalho 78th) , Luis Figo (Pauleta 45th), Paulo Bento, Ricardo Sa
Pinto, Rui Costa (Simao Sabrosa 45th), Sergio Conceicao (Jorge
Couto 65th).
	   Israel: Nir Davidovitz, Allon Harazi, Ran Ben-Shimon, Itzik
Benado, Amir Shelach, Najwan Grayev, Tal Banin, Yossi Abuksis
(Telesnikov 63rd), Eyal Bercovic, Avi Nimni Yossi Banion 78th),
Ronen Harazi (Shitrit 74th).

Troubled theater company fires founder, files for bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with firing of Drabinksky, bankruptcy
filing, more details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Troubled Canadian theater company Livent Inc.
fired its flamboyant co-founder, Garth Drabinsky, on Wednesday and
filed for protection from its creditors in a U.S. bankruptcy court.
	   The company said it is considering seeking similar protection in
Canada.
	   Livent's problems have been in the spotlight since Drabinsky,
producer of ``Ragtime,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and other hit
musicals, was suspended in August after an investigation by
Livent's new managers led to allegations of financial
irregularities.
	   Drabinsky and business partner Myron Gottlieb have denied any
wrongdoing. Livent's new management team is headed by former Walt
Disney executive Michael Ovitz and New York investment banker Roy
Furman.
	   The news of the firing and bankruptcy filing came a day after
two credit-rating agencies, Standard and Poors and Moody's Investor
Services, downgraded the company's debt rating.
	   There had been increasingly serious concerns about Livent's
ability to pay its debts.
	   Livent's board of directors met Tuesday in Toronto to discuss
their financial dilemma and issued a brief statement saying they
``were carefully exploring the company's options.''
	   Analysts had said one alternative to seeking bankruptcy
protection would be selling the company, but Livent's management
had acknowledged having difficulty getting a clear picture of its
financial condition.
	   Moody's, in a statement, said it was concerned about the
``multitude'' of class action lawsuits filed against Livent and
``evidence of a fundamental deterioration of the company's business
performance.''
	   Ed Lawrence, a director at Standard and Poor's in Toronto, said
Livent's credit ratings were dropped from single-B plus to
triple-C, a sign that its ability to meet its debts is ``very
vulnerable.''
	   Filing for bankruptcy protection is expected give Livent time to
come up with a restructuring plan aimed at preventing the company
from being devoured by its creditors.

UEFA moves meeting from Jerusalem over security concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Citing the political situation in the
Middle East, European soccer's governing body on Wednesday moved a
meeting of its governing executive committee away from Jerusalem.
	   The meeting on Dec. 10 and 11 will instead be held in
Switzerland, UEFA said in a statement. A final venue has yet to be
chosen.
	   The executive committee is expected to give final approval to
the reform of UEFA's European club competitions.
	   UEFA has already canceled the European Under-18 Championships
qualifying tournament, scheduled to take place in Israel this week,
because of security concerns.
	   Also Wednesday, UEFA said senior officials had a ``very fruitful
meeting'' with Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, discussing the
effects on soccer of European Union legislation.
	   ``There was a common understanding that it is necessary for
football to be treated in accordance with its specific character by
EU institutions,'' said UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner.
	   Klima later criticized the effects of EU rules on soccer, UEFA
noted.

Investigators: Fracture on freighter's deck led to sinking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) _ A fracture along the deck of the
grain carrier Flare may have caused it to snap in half and sink in
stormy seas, killing 21 crewmen, federal investigators said
Wednesday.
	   In issuing the interim findings of their investigation into the
January sinking, the investigators warned that up to 14 ships of
similar age and design around the world could be vulnerable to the
same defect.
	   The fracture ran along the starboard side of the deck at one of
the ports used for loading grain, said Bill McOnie, the Canadian
government's lead investigator. An underwater inspection by a
remote-control camera confirmed the location of the crack.
	   ``This may be a failure point in other vessels and we certainly
don't want a second Flare,'' McOnie said Wednesday from Dartmouth,
Nova Scotia.
	   McOnie said the cause of the fracture was not known.
	   Four crewmen survived when the Montreal-bound freighter sank in
the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Cypriot-owned and registered ship was
built in 1972.
	   A draft report on the cause of accident is expected in December.

Olsen signs deal to stay coach in Valerenga
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Former national coach for Norway Egil
``Drillo'' Olsen signed a three-year contract as the head coach
with the elite division team Valerenga on Wednesday.
	   Valerenga was the worst team in the Norwegian league in August
when Olsen was brought in. The team finished seventh among 14 teams
and qualified for the quarterfinal of the European Cup Winners Cup.
	   ``There are many reasons for choosing to continue in Valeranga.
One of them is that I can do what I know best, soccer. A whole team
wants me, and I have to grab the chance,'' Olsen told Norwegian
news agency NTB.
	   Olsen has been criticized for boring and destructive soccer, but
Olsen remains undaunted.
	   ``There has been objections against me in soccer-Norway. It
surprises me a little, but it just inspires me,'' Olsen said. ``It
will not be boring for those with a great engagement and knowledge
about soccer.''

Brazil's Cruzeiro to face Argentina's San Lorenzo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Cruzeiro hopes young star
Fabio Junior will give them the edge in Thursday's Mercosur Cup
semifinal first leg against San Lorenzo of Argentina.
	   Junior, 20, with his shaven head and eye for goals, has been
likened to his predecessor at the club, Ronaldo, and multi-million
dollar price tags are being attached to him by the media.
	   The striker does not like the comparisons with the superstar and
his coach Levir Colpi insists Ronaldo is a more prodigious talent.
This match will give others a chance to decide.
	   Colpi is deciding on whether Marcelo Ramos or Alex Alves play up
front with Junior. He also has to choose whether Caio or Muller
will line up in the four-man midfield.
	   Cruzeiro remain in the Brazilian championship after finishing
eighth in the first phase.
	   San Lorenzo, however, were knocked out of the Argentinian
championship after losing Sunday.
	   Yet both teams look well matched. The played each other twice in
the first phase of this cup competition, each winning once, 2-1.
	   The Argentinian team have their own dangerous striker in Biaggio
and are shrewdly managed by Alfio Basile.
	   The second leg is in Buenos Aires. The winners will face
Palmeiras in the final after the Brazilian club beat Olimpia of
Paraguay Tuesday.
	   Possible line-ups:
	   Cruzeiro: Dida, Gustavo, Marcelo Djian, Gottardo, Gilberto,
Marcos Paulo, Djair, Valdo, Caio, Marcelo Ramos, Fabio Junior.
	   San Lorenzo: Campagnuolo, Adrian Gonzales, Cordoba, Morel,
Basavilbaso, Montenegro, Rivadero, Saric, Franco, Biaggio, Coria.

to her first season on tour when Annika Sorenstam won last year's
LPGA Tour Championship in a three-way playoff.
	   On Thursday, she's paired in the final group with Sorenstam in
the season-ending tournament _ with an outside chance of adding
player of the year to the rookie of the year title she long ago
tucked away.
	   To say the least, it's been quite a debut season for the
21-year-old, who went from medalist in tour qualifying school to
win two majors and become a hero in her native South Korea.
	   ``It is a special year,' Pak said.
	   Pak could make it even a bit more special with a victory in the
PageNet Tour Championship, which features the tour's top 30 money
winners going after the dlrs 215,000 first prize.
	   Though Sorenstam already has locked up the season money title
and scoring crown, Pak could move past her and win the Rolex Player
of the Year title with a win on the Desert Inn Country Club course
on the Las Vegas Strip.
	   Even finishing first or second in 13 of the 14 pro tournaments
she played in South Korea couldn't prepare Pak for the success she
has had in her first year on the LPGA tour.
	   ``At the start of the season I had to learn many things about
the golf course and the country,'' Pak said. ``I thought two to
three years to just keep working and practicing.''
	   Pak has not only had to learn to adapt to a new country, she has
had to learn to deal with being a celebrity in her native land.
	   She was hospitalized earlier this month with the flu and
exhaustion in a whirlwind return South Korea, where she received
the nation's second highest sports medal from President Kim
Dae-jung.
	   Pak, who has won four tournaments and is second behind Sorenstam
on the money list with winnings of dlrs 862,170, came back to play
last week in the made-for-television Wendy's Three-Tour
Championship outside Las Vegas.
	   Almost overlooked in the hoopla has been another great year by
Sorenstam. The Swede has locked up the money title with more than
dlrs 1 million in earnings, is leading the player of the year race
and is well ahead in the Vare Trophy scoring average.
	   Sorenstam, like Pak, won four tournaments this year, but did not
win any majors.
	   ``The majors are the tournaments I want to win,'' Sorenstam
said. ``People remember you if you win majors. I wanted to make
things happen this year and I didn't play as well as I had in other
events. I think I was trying too hard.''
	   Sorenstam, seeking her second straight player of the year award,
is also looking to make a bit of LPGA history.
	   No woman golfer has ever averaged less than 70 strokes a round
through an entire year. But Sorenstam is averaging 69.88 a round
coming into the final tournament on a course that has proved
friendly to players in the past.
	   ``It's very special to have a final event where all the awards
are on the line,'' Sorenstam said. ``It's just a very special
tournament, where you get the best of the best. The venue is quite
a fun place in a high-rolling city. And it has a wonderful golf
course.''
	   Sorenstam's win here last year was her sixth of the season and
she set a money winning record on the tour.
	   ``So much is at stake in this tournament and you have a chance
to make history,'' she said.
	   Sorenstam's sister, Charlotta, will play in the tournament for
the first time, after finishing 30th on the money list. So will
44-year-old Dale Eggeling, who finished 31st but got into the field
because Tammie Green is eight months pregnant and withdrew.
	   ``I've got to go buy Tammie Green and her husband the biggest
baby gift I can find,'' Eggeling said.

Van Gundy on waiting: `I'm professionally bored'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Day 141 of the National Basketball Association
lockout found Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy rehabbing a Harlem
brownstone, praising the Pacers and trying to adhere to the rule
that prohibits him from speaking about players by name.
	   Wednesday was another day of waiting, wondering and trying to
make good use of the idle time that has been one of the byproducts
of the 4 1/2-month old lockout.
	   The opposing sides met for two hours Tuesday and agreed to have
a bargaining session Friday that will include the full owners' and
players' negotiating teams.
	   For Van Gundy and Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld, the
extra free time meant lending a hand on one of the team's community
relations projects _ rehabilitating a gutted three-story building
in a poor neighborhood.
	   Stepping away from his task of installing metal wall supports,
Van Gundy summed up his feelings on a day when he should have been
in Denver for the second game of a nine-day, six-city road trip.
	   ``Bored, yeah. Professionally bored,'' he said.
	   Reporting to his office five days a week, Van Gundy has been
watching videotapes of new acquisition Marcus Camby and reviewing
players the Knicks might want to pursue as free agents.
	   ``I watched all of last year's games a couple times,'' he said.
	   Van Gundy also has kept in touch with other members of the
coaching fraternity, with one notable exception.
	   Asked if he had spoken to Miami Heat coach Pat Riley, his former
mentor with whom he had a falling-out during the first round of the
playoffs last season, Van Gundy squirmed and tried to avoid
responding before finally answering ``No.''
	   To a question of whether a shortened season might benefit the
more established teams, Van Gundy said it's a matter of who comes
back in shape.
	   ``The thing I read about Indiana is that their team is ready to
go. They've got 11 or 12 guys working together each and every day,
and I think that team will definitely have a jump on all the other
teams because they are more committed.
	   ``They showed they were more committed last year and they're
showing their commitment now. What they're doing is a great
indicator of where they're at,'' Van Gundy said. ``For our team, I
haven't heard those reports.''
	   Grunfeld, who spoke to several players last week when the league
temporarily lifted its ban on contacting players, said doctors have
told him Patrick Ewing's surgically repaired wrist is 100 percent
healthy.
	   ``I wouldn't say I'm bored, but everybody is curious. As this
time of the year we're used to having competition,'' Grunfeld said.
	   So far, the first seven weeks of the season have been scrapped
and the chances are dwindling for a settlement that would allow for
the NBA season to start before Christmas. Teams now know they can
expect a 60- or 50-game season, and there's a growing anticipation
that a short season _ if there is one _ could produce a heightened
competitiveness.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling that the Mideast peace accord was
moving forward, Israel and the Palestinians resumed long-suspended
talks on a lasting peace treaty Wednesday and agreed to formally
reopen those negotiations with a ceremony next week. Palestinian
official Mahmoud Abbas, who met with his counterpart Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said that Israel would carry out the
first stage of a long-overdue West Bank troop withdrawal Friday and
release 250 Palestinian prisoners. ``Palestinian and Israeli
security officials will meet Thursday to discuss the maps and
preparations for the redeployment,'' Abbas said. They will also
complete paper-work for the opening of the Palestinian airport.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton plans to prod Japan during
his Asia trip to act decisively to revive its sputtering economy
and boost recovery throughout Asia. Gripped by its worst economic
recession since World War II, Japan remains the key to protecting
American prosperity, the president said as he left the White House
on Wednesday for a five-day economic mission to Asia. Beginning
Thursday, he plans stops in Tokyo; Seoul, South Korea; and Guam,
the U.S. Pacific territory that has been hit hard by Japan's
recession. (CLINTON-ASIA)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In the streets and in Parliament, Turks
rallied behind their leaders Wednesday in their tough stand on a
Kurdish rebel chief detained in Italy: No relenting in their demand
for his extradition Abdullah Ocalan's supporters in Europe showed
equal fervor. Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
which has fought a bloody, 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in
Turkey's southeast. He was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport as
soon as he stepped off a flight from Russia, which denied him
asylum. Italy is weighing his asylum request and expected to reject
Turkey's request for his extradition. (TURKEY-KURDS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. House Republicans endorsed Rep. Bob
Livingston on Wednesday to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker and
gave Rep. Dick Armey another two years as majority leader. In an
upset, Rep. J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only black Republican in
the House, was elected chairman of the party conference. Watt's
election was a victory for the party's conservative wing. Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas had no opposition for another term as party whip,
the third-ranking leadership post. The majority leader looks after
the running of the House on a day-to-day basis and tries to move
legislation that has broad party support to a vote. The party whip
tries to ensure that members show up when there are votes, don't
desert the party and join the opposition Democrats or abstain. The
party conference chairman leads meetings at which party policy is
discussed. (US-REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities have discovered the remains
of 25 murdered children in a state capital in western Colombia. The
bodies _ almost all of them skeletons _ were found in two searches
in Pereira, a city of 700,000 people about 110 miles (175
kilometers) from Bogota. Prosecutors and other town officials said
motives they were considering ranged from possible ``social
cleansing'' of suspected juvenile delinquents by vigilantes, to
satanic cults. (COLOMBIA-CHILDREN MASSACRED)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology shares led a modest blue-chip
advance, but most stocks fell Wednesday amid a mixed reaction to
the latest interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Dow
Jones industrial average erased an early 29-point deficit and rose
nearly 55 points to 9,041, closing above 9,000 for the second time
in three days after a three month drought. The afternoon rebound by
the blue chips lifted most broad-market indexes, but declining
issues still outnumbered advancers overall by the closing bell. The
Nasdaq market posted the biggest gains as several computer-industry
bellwethers extended their rally and big-name Internet shares
sprinted higher yet again. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations on Wednesday
failed to take any dramatic action to halt Asia's worst economic
crisis in decades, approving only limited measures at a summit
beset by diplomatic squabbling. Opposition by Japan forced the
21-government Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to delay
action on what was to have been its centerpiece _ a deal to boost
trade by slashing tariffs on goods worth dlrs 1.5 trillion. The
United States accused Japan of failing to show leadership. APEC is
the region's top forum for dealing with economic problems and
issues requiring mutual aid. (APEC)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A rescue package to lift Brazil's
economy out of crisis has boosted the financial markets, sending
stocks rallying and helping stabilize foreign reserves. Since
Friday's announcement of a long-awaited dlrs 41.5 billion rescue
package by the International Monetary Fund and other international
donors, stocks have rallied 12 percent in Brazil over three
sessions. Sao Paolo's Bovespa index closed up 2.6 percent on
Wednesday, and is now at 8,547, nearly double its lows of
September. It's still well under its high of 12,299 of April. The
country's foreign reserves, down dlrs 30 billion since mid-August,
have stabilized since the beginning of November. Foreign investment
is positive for the first time in months and annual interest rates,
which soared to near 50 percent at the height of the crisis, are
coming down slowly. (BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may be headed toward disintegration and an
end of democracy if the deepening economic crisis is not resolved,
a top Cabinet official warned in an interview published Wednesday.
The government says that to keep the economy from crumbling, it
needs to reschedule Russia's huge foreign debt payments and receive
foreign aid that was frozen months ago. But international creditors
have not given any sign that they will grant either request. Deputy
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov warned that inflation would spiral
out of control next year unless the government reaches an agreement
with its creditors to reschedule some of the dlrs 17 billion in
foreign debt payments due in 1999. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In the first major arms deal
by post apartheid South Africa, the government on Wednesday gave
preliminary approval to a 29.77 billion-rand (dlrs 5.22 billion)
package of jet fighters, submarines and other equipment. The
proposal includes 28 Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British
Aerospace of Sweden and England, three submarines and four corvette
warships from German consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from
Italian manufacturer Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from
British Aerospace. Critics say it's wrong for the rainbow nation to
spend so much on weapons given the country's poverty and 34 percent
unemployment. (SOUTH AFRICA-DEFENSE CONTRACTS)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Troubled Canadian theater company Livent Inc.
fired its flamboyant co-founder, Garth Drabinsky, on Wednesday and
filed for protection from its creditors in a U.S. bankruptcy court.
The company said it is considering seeking similar protection in
Canada. Livent's problems have been in the spotlight since
Drabinsky, producer of ``Ragtime,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman''
and other hit musicals, was suspended in August after an
investigation by Livent's new managers led to allegations of
financial irregularities. The company said it is seeking protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and was considering
``appropriate protective action'' in Canada. (CANADA-LIVENT)

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Screen idol Alain Delon lost a bid Wednesday to
block publication of a biography.
	   A judge ruled that a ban imposed in August runs contrary to
freedom of expression because the final contents of the book are
uncertain.
	   The actor had won a temporary order against biographer Bernard
Violet. Delon was also seeking 400,000 francs (about dlrs 70,000)
in damages.
	   Delon, who has seen a synopsis of the book, accused the author
of being a ``spelunker of the garbage can'' to get information.
Among details from the synopsis published in a magazine were
Delon's reported ties to shady politicians, mob figures and
mercenaries.
	   Now 63, Delon was for decades a dashing leading man in dozens of
movies, including ``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court Wednesday ordered a weekly magazine
to pay 70,000 francs (dlrs 12,500) in damages to Princess Diana's
bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones for publishing an interview he says
never took place.
	   The magazine, Voici, was also ordered to publish the ruling in
its next issue.
	   At the time of publication in July, the magazine had every
reason to believe the interview was authentic, Voici lawyer Luc
Brossellet said.
	   ``Perhaps, and I emphasize perhaps, we were misled,'' he said.
	   Brossellet wouldn't say where the interview came from.
	   Rees-Jones was the sole survivor of the 1997 crash that killed
Diana, boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver.
	    &UR; ___
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch singer-songwriter Robert
Berger is tuning his flatbed truck and his piano as he prepares for
a trip to West Africa.
	   The 48-year-old musician leaves for Gambian capital of Banjul
later this month with his trusty piano and a sofa loaded on the
back of his truck, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported Wednesday.
	   He plans to help finance the 7,500-kilometer (4,650-mile) trip
by giving concerts from the back of the Mercedes truck wherever he
stops for the night.
	   The idea came from his friend Ruud Schollaardt, who's tagging
along for the ride.
	   When Schollaardt suggested driving to Africa, Berger agreed _ on
one condition: ``Only if I could keep on playing,'' he told De
Telegraaf.
	   The three-week trek will take them though southern Europe, then
Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, and finally, Gambia.
	   Berger is not sure if his piano will survive the trip, which
includes 2,600 kilometers (1,612 miles) across the Sahara.
	   ``I can do a little tuning. We'll see if it still plays by the
time we get to Banjul.''
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Moore's cameras can roll on city streets
in a truce with New York City's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
	   The city on Tuesday lifted a ban blocking the ``Roger and Me''
director from taping a TV satire.
	   ``I'm very happy they have reversed their position on this,''
Moore said.
	   ``I know once they stopped to think about the First Amendment
implications, they would do the right thing,'' he added, referring
to the part of the U.S. constitution that guarantees freedom of
speech.
	   Patricia Reed Scott, the head of Giuliani's film office, said
she blocked Moore's project because she had misunderstood a court
order requiring Moore to stay away from millionaire industrialist
Ira Rennert.
	   Rennert is a target of one segment of Moore's Bravo channel show
``The Awful Truth,'' which debuts in April.
	    &UR; ___
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Farmers sent police on a wild pig chase
Wednesday as they staged a second protest to demand tighter
restrictions on pork imports and increased government aid.
	   The farmers _ calling themselves the ``Movement of Bankrupt
Farmers'' _ released some 90 pigs at main avenues in Lisbon and two
other cities before daybreak causing traffic havoc.
	   In Leiria, some 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital,
the animals had the words ``Hunger'' and ``Misery'' written across
their backs while farmers also distributed pamphlets demanding that
``the government feed (the pigs). We no longer can,'' the national
news agency Lusa reported.
	   A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said the government was
working on a solution to meet the farmers' demands, but gave no
details.
	   Most of the pigs were rounded up by police Wednesday although
two were accidentally run over by farmers.

Troubled theater company files for bankruptcy protection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Drabinsky filing countersuit,
quotes, more details. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Troubled Canadian theater company Livent Inc.
fired its flamboyant co-founder, Garth Drabinsky, on Wednesday and
filed for bankruptcy protection in a U.S. bankruptcy court.
	   The company said it was considering seeking similar protection
in Canada.
	   Livent's problems have been in the spotlight since Drabinsky,
producer of ``Ragtime,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and other hit
musicals, was suspended in August after an investigation by
Livent's new managers led to allegations of financial
irregularities.
	   The company said it is seeking protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and was considering ``appropriate
protective action'' in Canada.
	   It also took steps to file a dlrs 225 million Canadian (dlrs 166
million U.S.) civil damage action against Drabinsky and his
partner, Myron Gottlieb, alleging they committed fraud in
connection with Livent financial management before the company was
sold in June.
	   The new management team is headed by former Walt Disney
executive Michael Ovitz and New York investment banker Roy Furman.
	   Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who were suspended in August, have
denied any wrongdoing. They said Wednesday they are filing
countersuits against Ovitz, Furman and others for damages totaling
dlrs 200 million Canadian (dlrs 130 million U.S.), accusing the new
owners of conspiring against them.
	   After a delay of several weeks, the company also issued restated
financial statements for 1996, 1997 and the first quarter of 1998.
The revision reduced net income for those periods by dlrs 61.7
million U.S., Livent said.
	   Trading in Livent stock has been halted since August, pending
the release of restated financial results. Several shareholder
lawsuits have been filed against the company.
	   The company said it needed bankruptcy protection ``to pursue a
comprehensive financial restructuring'' required because of
``serious accounting irregularities and inappropriate business
practices'' uncovered in August.
	   ``Livent's employees are justifiably outraged that the actions
of a few have forced us into this position,'' Furman said in a
statement.
	   Also filing for Chapter 11 protection were Livent's U.S. unit
and two subsidiaries, Livent Realty (New York) Inc. and Livent
Realty (Chicago) Inc., which operate theaters in those cities.
	   Drabinsky, a former movie-theater executive, founded Livent in
1990 and built it into one of the biggest live-theater production
companies in North America. Its Broadway productions have won 18
Tony awards.
	   But when the ownership change came in June, he was moved out of
administrative power and given the title of creative director.
	   Livent suffered a blow Tuesday when its debt ratings were
downgraded by Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.
	   Moody's, in a statement, said it was concerned about the
``multitude'' of class action lawsuits filed against Livent and
``evidence of a fundamental deterioration of the company's business
performance.''

Researchers find new source of global warming gas in Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK CALLAHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Scientists have found large amounts of a gas
linked to global warming in the Pacific Ocean's shallow waters,
suggesting that increased El Nino activity could stoke even greater
production of the gas.
	   The University of Hawaii researchers sampled seawater at a site
about 60 miles (100 kms) north of Hawaii that iss considered
representative of the deep-ocean waters that border the Pacific's
tropical zone.
	   They found three times more nitrous oxide than global models had
predicted _ and at relatively shallow depths that are influenced by
El Nino, the periodic warming of the Pacific.
	   ``This is really a double whammy. It's both a greenhouse gas and
an ozone-depleting gas,'' said John E. Dore, a former University of
Hawaii oceanic researcher who co-authored the study.
	   Atmospheric levels of nitrous oxide, a byproduct of the burning
of fossil fuels, are on the rise. The gas prevents the Earth from
radiating heat back to space and also depletes its protective ozone
layer.
	   In the Nov. 5 issue of the journal Nature, Dore and co-author
David Karl of the University of Hawaii report that they found high
nitrous oxide concentrations at about 900 feet (275 meters) of
water, the murky zone where sunlight gives way to oceanic blackness
	   Previous research has suggested that the Pacific subtropical
region, which covers about 8 million square miles (21 million sq.
kms), produces about 130,000 tons of nitrous oxide annually. But
that was based on the assumption that the gas was percolating
upward from much deeper waters _ about 2,500 feet (760 meters) _
where nitrous oxide readings are highest but static.
	   Dore said finding large amounts of the gas in much shallower
waters means that 400,000 tons of the gas _ three times the earlier
estimate _ is likely reaching the atmosphere.
	   If the University of Hawaii's research is extrapolated
worldwide, it suggests that Earth's subtropical oceans produce 6
million tons of nitrous oxide each year _ not the forecast 2
million tons.
	   Oceanic bacteria that consume organic nitrogen in search of
ammonia appear to be producing the nitrous oxide, also known as
laughing gas, as a byproduct of their feeding habits, the
researchers suggest.
	   High levels of nitrous oxide in shallow waters mean the recent
increase in El Nino activity could release even more of the gas
into the atmosphere as it stirs up the Pacific, said Scott Doney,
an oceanographer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo.
	   ``That has some pretty strong implications on the effects of
climate change and the mixing of the upper ocean with the
atmosphere,'' Doney said. ``If we continue to have periods of high
El Nino activity, presumably upwelling of water in this area would
be freeing more and more (nitrous oxide).''

	   CARVILLE, Louisiana (AP) _ A hospital that has cared for lepers
for a century is closing its doors. While some patients are
reluctant to leave, others embrace the chance to start life anew.
	   ``Some of them are afraid of change,'' said Jack Pendleton, who
married a fellow patient at the Hansen's Disease Center 38 years
ago.
	   As for the Pendletons, they are moving to Arizona. ``You won't
be able to see my dust,'' Ruth Pendleton said, chuckling.
	   The center, once known as a leprosarium, will close next year.
The property will be used as a boot camp for high school dropouts.
	   For now, leaving is optional, and those who choose to go, like
the Pendletons who are active and in their 60s, will be given a
federal stipend of dlrs 33,000 a year.
	   However, some staff members will stay on for three years,
allowing any of the 125 residents to remain if they wish. Most are
in their 70s, 80s, 90s, and center expects many to live out their
lives there, or to be moved to Baton Rouge, where a federal nursing
home and research center are to be set up.
	   Among those staying is Johnny Harmon, 86, who lived 36 years on
the outside before returning in 1990. ``My wife and I were getting
old and needed taking care of. So we came back,'' he says. ``We
can't get better attention. So why should we leave?''
	   Harmon, who had run a successful photography business, has spent
much of the last decade writing an autobiography, ``King of the
Microbes.'' Explaining the title, he said, ``Leprosy was the king
of the germs until AIDS came along and knocked it off the throne.''
	   While patients laud the care and attention they have received at
the center, they also remember the earlier years when life was
misery.
	   Mrs. Pendleton said the federal stipend cannot make up for what
she lost.
	   ``They robbed me of my mother and father. They kidnapped me,''
she said.
	   In 1949, at age 14, she was picked up at her home in Corpus
Christi, Texas, by a state health nurse and a deputy sheriff and
driven to the Carville center. ``Two others with the disease were
in the back seat of the car with me. They made us sit on a tarp.
They didn't want the disease to get on the seat,'' she recalled.
``Isn't that a joke!''
	   ``Everybody here has been kind,'' she said, ``But when you are
young and taken away, you don't understand much.''
	   For decades, scientists did not understand much about leprosy.
Even now, they do not know how one contracts the disease but,
thanks to a Norwegian named Hansen, they know the cause.
	   The villain is bacteria that affects the skin, nerves, eyes and
cooler parts of the body. Moving into cuts or burns, the bacteria
can spread beneath the skin and destroy muscle and bone.
	   With nothing to battle the disease, victims were disfigured.
	   Fear of leprosy's spread led to creation of the center, which
was no more than a warehouse for the dying when it opened in 1894.
The patients were cared for by a Roman Catholic order, Sisters of
Charity.
	   The first seven patients were barged up the Mississippi River at
night from New Orleans to the isolated and decaying plantation
known as Indian Camp, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Baton
Rouge.
	   The pre-Civil War house was refurbished, and by the 1930s the
330-acre (135-hectare) complex included more than 90 buildings and
3 1-2 miles (5 1-2 kilometers) of covered walkways and a nine-hole
golf course.
	   ``I first came in 1935 when this was truly a leper colony,''
Harmon said. ``There was no real effective medicine for the
disease. The government did all they could for you until you died.
A lot of people died here. The graveyard here is big.''
	   There are 700 graves at the center, which in 1921 was taken over
by the federal government and scientists began researching Hansen's
Disease.
	   A breakthrough came in 1941 when Guy Faget, a center director,
found that a sulfone drug similar to the one used to treat
tuberculosis controls Hansen's Disease and puts it into remission.
	   The drug, Promin, spread around the world. Still more effective
medicines followed, with much of the research done at the old
plantation complex. After just four doses, the disease is no longer
contagious. Even before the medicine and despite fear to the
contrary, the disease was not easily spread.
	   Success lessened the numbers of patients at all of the world's
centers, which have become caretaker facilities in recent years,
said Julia Elwood, a former patient who is public affairs director
at Carville.
	   ``It's sad in a way to close up,'' she said, ``because it's like
a home for so many.''

Thai scientists moving forward in battle against dengue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAKORN PATHOM, Thailand (AP) _ Thai researchers, using
sophisticated techniques once the exclusive domain of Western
scientists, have developed a vaccine against dengue, a
mosquito-borne disease that afflicts tens of millions of people
annually.
	   The vaccine developed at Mahidol University, west of Bangkok, is
still two to five years from commercial use.
	   But so-called ``Phase 2'' trials of the vaccine began last month
to find the optimum dosages, and it appears to be the best bet to
tackle a disease that has emerged in the past two decades to
threaten two-fifths of the world's population.
	   Little known outside the tropics, dengue is a viral infection
that can cause anything from mild headaches and fever to death from
shock and hemorrhage.
	   Diagnosis is difficult and so far there is no preventive
treatment or cure. About half a million people, 90 percent of them
children, are hospitalized each year by its most severe strain, and
24,000 die.
	   Epidemics of the disease in Asia, Africa and North America date
back at least 200 years, but it was only after World War II _
during which British soldiers in the Malay peninsula suffered from
its debilitating effects _ that it received much attention.
	   Dengue might have remained primarily a concern of the military
had not its more virulent form, dengue hemorrhagic fever _ DHF _
been recognized as a new disease in the Philippines in 1953.
	   By 1975 it had become a leading cause of hospitalization and
death among children in many countries, especially in Southeast
Asia.
	   Particularly dramatic has been its return in strength to areas
where it had been eradicated decades ago:
	   _ In the South Pacific, dengue reappeared in the early 1970s
after a 25-year absence.
	   _ By the 1980s, dengue epidemics had occurred in Taiwan and
China, and the countries of South Asia had experienced DHF
epidemics.
	   Dengue cases also increased dramatically in Africa, though that
continent has been spared DHF epidemics.
	   Its biggest comeback has been in the Americas, where the
disease, including DHF, can be found in at least 16 countries.
	   Epidemiologists believe the rapid spread of the disease can be
attributed to several factors: rapid population growth and
urbanization, leading to inadequate water supply and waste disposal
systems which give mosquitoes more opportunity to breed; increased
air travel, resulting in the rapid exchange and introduction of
dengue strains to far-flung population centers, and inadequate
mosquito control methods.
	   ``Classic'' non-fatal dengue remains a concern, especially for
travelers and the military. It struck significant numbers of U.S.
troops in Haiti in 1994-95, as well as in Somalia in 1992-93 and on
exercises in such places as Thailand.
	   ``Dengue can have a serious impact on a mission within the first
week of the arrival of troops in an endemic area,'' said a 1995
Pentagon memo. ``Other than food and waterborne illnesses, few
other diseases can attack so quickly and have as wide an impact on
our forces.''
	   Not surprisingly, the U.S. military has long been active in
seeking a dengue vaccine. The Department of Defense is involved in
projects taking four different approaches to the development of a
dengue vaccine.
	   Major projects to fight dengue are also being undertaken by
private and academic researchers in the United States, France and
Australia.
	   The Thai project, initiated in 1976 by the regional office of
the World Health Organization, chose to make a live attenuated
virus vaccine, an approach used successfully against poliomyelitis,
measles and mumps.
	   Using this method, in which the virus loses its disease-causing
properties while retaining the ability to stimulate the production
of antibodies, was at the time beyond the capabilities of
laboratories in most of the developing world. Local scientists
would be learning the technology at the same time.
	   There are four serotypes, or variants, of the dengue virus.
Infection by one fails to produce antibodies providing immunity
against any of the other serotypes. Studies actually suggest that
DHF occurs when a previously infected person falls prey to an
infection from a second serotype.
	   An effective vaccine therefore must be a four-in-one vaccine _
basically meaning the Thai researchers had to develop four separate
vaccines and then blend them.
	   ``Maybe it could have been accelerated a little but we were
careful because developing a live attenuated vaccine in a country
like Thailand, people tend to think that maybe it's a joke,'' says
Dr. Natth Bhamarapravati, director of Mahidol's Dengue Vaccine
Development Program.
	   Three or four years of laboratory work were followed by ``Phase
1'' clinical trials on humans to test for safety and immunogenicity
_ whether it produces antibodies or not.
	   After several sets of tests were judged a success, the Mahidol
researchers decided they needed a strategic partner.
	   Natth says they sought a vaccine manufacturer with the
scientific and technical capacity for mass production as well as
financial and managerial strength ``because we know that to develop
vaccine to public health use ... is a long haul.''
	   The university signed a contract with the French company Pasteur
Merieux Connaught, giving it a 20-year exclusive production and
marketing license worldwide. However, the contract also includes a
clause that says the vaccine would be affordable to children in
developing countries.
	   The deal, says Natth, provides for ``pretty generous'' payments
from the French company, noting also that Mahidol's development
costs were ``probably one-tenth or one-twentieth of what it takes
to do it in an industrial country.''
	   In an effort to stay at the cutting edge of medical technology,
says Natth, the Mahidol researchers are now also working in
collaboration with the U.S. Public Health Service on a
``second-generation'' dengue vaccine based on molecular biology
techniques.

Osteoporosis test recommended for women older than 65
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ All white women 65 and older should be tested
for osteoporosis if they are willing to get treatment, say new
guidelines from the National Osteoporosis Foundation.
	   Women of other races should follow that recommendation as well,
says foundation president Dr. Robert Lindsay. The guidelines focus
on post-menopausal white women because most data about osteoporosis
is from that group. It's also the group at highest risk for the
disease.
	   Osteoporosis puts people at risk of disabling fractures. The
foundation guidelines recommend a test of bone density in the hip.
	   They also recommend testing postmenopausal white women younger
than 65 who have at least one risk factor for the disease. Risk
factors include having had a bone fracture as an adult, poor health
or frailty, cigarette smoking, alcoholism, recurring falls, little
exercise and lifelong low calcium intake.

 &UR; Researchers: Chesapeake Bay has warmed over centuries
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Fossils found in Chesapeake Bay sediment
samples indicate the bay has been getting warmer over the
centuries, according to researchers.
	   The preliminary findings are part of a three-year study by the
U.S. Geological Survey.
	   Survey researchers took samples of the sediment on the bay
bottom near the Patuxent and Potomac rivers. The sediment cores
range from 10 to 40 feet (3 to 12 meters) long. Geologists estimate
they cover the past 1,000 to 9,000 years.
	   ``Anything you can imagine that lived in the bay is preserved in
those sediments,'' said agency researcher Thomas Cronin. ``We've
got a history book, and we're using different tools to read the
history.''
	   There's no easy way to measure water temperatures from past eras
and no way to pin a number on the degree of warming that might have
taken place.
	   But agency geologist Stacey Verardo estimated the changes by
counting and dating fossils left behind by warm-water-loving,
single-celled aquatic organisms called dinoflagellates. Over the
past 1,000 years, the tiny creature's numbers in bay sediments have
nearly doubled, Verardo said.

 &UR; Genes of typhus germ decoded
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have deciphered all the genetic
material of the germ that causes typhus fever. Ironically, the
finding gives new evidence that the lethal microbe shares an
evolutionary history with an important component of healthy cells.
	   The work defined the 1.1 million building blocks that make up
the genetic code for Rickettsia prowazekii. The germ is spread by
lice and causes epidemics of typhus fever, which differs from
typhoid fever, and is blamed for millions of deaths following each
world war.
	   The disease is still widespread in some areas of Africa, Asia
and Central and South America. It is treatable with antibiotics.
	   In the new work, analysis of the genetic details found that the
microbe is more closely related than any other studied so far to
mitochondria, the ``power plants'' of normal cells. The microbe and
mitochondria, both of which have their own genes, apparently share
an ancestor deep in evolutionary history, scientists said.
	   The work is reported in the Nov. 12 issue of the journal Nature
by scientists at the University of Uppsala in Sweden and the
University of South Alabama in Mobile.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Signaling system in animal brain may be shared by plants
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A key signaling system in the brain may also
exist in plants, suggesting its roots go back to before plants and
animals went their separate evolutionary ways, scientists say.
	   The finding may also help explain why plants produce substances
like nicotine, cocaine and caffeine that act on the brain,
researchers said.
	   In the plant Arabidopsis, a laboratory favorite, researchers
found genes resembling ones used by animals to make structures
called glutamate receptors. These are brain cell ``hitching posts''
for the substance glutamate. When glutamate binds to its receptors,
it relays a signal to the brain cells.
	   The scientists found evidence that Arabidopsis receptors are
part of a signaling system that helps the plant respond to light.
So maybe nicotine, cocaine and other plant substances that act on
other kinds of receptors in the brain are part of undiscovered
signaling systems in plants, the researchers said.
	   The work is reported in the Nov. 12 issue of the journal Nature
by Gloria Coruzzi, a plant molecular biologist at New York
University, and colleagues.

Muckraking newspaper, Cabinet minister collide in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ It started when a muckraking Sri
Lankan newspaper published the credit card number of a government
minister.
	   Since then, the clash between the government and newspaper in
the small island country has involved Japanese investors, Internet
porn, the FBI and a grandson of a former president.
	   On May 10, the Sunday Leader published the credit card number of
telecommunications minister Mangala Samaraweera along with a story
alleging Japanese investors in the country's telephone company were
paying his bills.
	   A government investigation found no wrongdoing, and the issue
rested there. Then, the Sunday Leader reported in June that someone
used Samaraweera's credit card number _ perhaps even Samaraweera
himself, the story insinuated _ to access World Wide Web porn
sites.
	   Samaraweera asked police to investigate whether the state-owned
Bank of Ceylon had leaked his credit card number to the newspaper.
He said the bank told him there had been 32 transactions on the
Internet since the credit card number was first published.
	   Anyone could have used Samaraweera's card number after it
appeared in the national newspaper. Because a majority of the Web
sites were based in the United States, Sri Lanka's Criminal
Investigation Department turned to the FBI.
	   The FBI traced the computers used to Colombo's J.R. Jayawardene
Cultural Center, named for the late Sri Lankan president and headed
by his grandson, Pradeep.
	   Samaraweera issued a statement saying Pradeep Jayawardene bore
some responsibility for how computers at his center were used.
Jayawardene denied involvement.
	   Samaraweera's Peoples Alliance party is a staunch rival of the
United National Party founded by the elder Jayawardene. As the
investigation progressed, the UNP sponsored a no-confidence motion
to try to push Samaraweera from office. The August motion was
defeated.
	   Meanwhile, Samaraweera has filed a dlrs 100 million defamation
suit against the newspaper, which is accustomed to being at the
center of trouble.
	   In June, the newspaper offered an dlrs 8,000 reward to anyone
with information on an attack on the home of its editor, Lasantha
Wickrematunga.
	   Attackers fired 30 bullets, shattering the windshields of two
cars and damaging doors and windows of his house in a Colombo
suburb. No one was injured.

Studies: Two drugs better than one for treating chronic hepatitis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIGITTE GREENBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved
considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections
than the standard single medicine.
	   Nearly 100 million people worldwide, including 4 million
Americans, are believed to be have hepatitis C. The virus is blamed
for about 10,000 deaths a year in the United States and is the
leading cause of chronic liver disease and the No. 1 reason for
liver transplants.
	   Until recently, interferon was the only treatment. Typically,
only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are
rid of all signs of the virus. Most patients treated with
interferon eventually relapse.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved a new approach, a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
It is being marketed as Rebetron by Schering-Plough, which paid for
two studies published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. T. Jake Liang of the National
Institutes of Health said the results show that ``combination
therapy represents an important advance.''
	   However, Liang cautioned that questions remain about how long
the benefits will last, as well as about such potentially serious
side effects as anemia. The combination can also produce birth
defects, so all users must take birth control during and after
treatment.
	   One of the studies, led by Dr. John G. McHutchison of the
Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California,
compared the effects of the combination with interferon alone in
the initial treatment of 912 patients. All signs of the virus
disappeared in 38 percent of patients who had been given both drugs
for 11 months, compared with 13 percent of those treated with only
interferon.
	   However, more patients who received the new therapy suffered
from side effects, which included difficulty breathing, sore
throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia and anorexia.
	   The second study, lead by Dr. Gary L. Davis of the University of
Florida College of Medicine, looked at 345 chronic hepatitis
patients who had already relapsed after interferon treatment. They
were randomly assigned to get either more interferon or the
two-drug combination.
	   When treatment stopped after six months, all signs of the virus
were gone in 82 percent on combination therapy, compared with half
on interferon alone. After another six months had gone by, the
virus was still undetectable in half of the combination patients,
compared with just 5 percent in the interferon group.

Police seize a ton of cocaine in highway chase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A trailer truck carrying a ton of
cocaine was seized after leading police on an 18-mile (30
kilometer) high-speed highway chase through an area dominated by
leftist guerrillas, Colombian police reported Wednesday.
	   The truck was captured Tuesday on the road between Florencia,
235 miles (380 kilometers) southwest of Bogota, and Neiva, a city
93 miles (150 kilometers) north, police said. The chase broke out
when the truck sped past a police roadblock.
	   The bulk of the cocaine was fully-processed, in hundreds of
packets hidden in a false roof built into the truck. Police said
they also found 73 pounds (33 kilograms) of unrefined cocaine in a
second vehicle.
	   The cocaine was seized occurred near a 16,200 square-mile
(42,000-sq. kilometer) southern region where army and police have
withdrawn to facilitate peace talks with leftist guerrillas
expected to begin soon.
	   Critics of the pullout have said it could lead to an increase in
drug shipments from the area _ a major cocaine-processing region.
The guerrillas have been accused of financing their operations with
cocaine profits.
	   In a separate capture near the same demilitarized zone, the army
said Wednesday it seized a truck carrying more than 3,000 gallons
(11,500 liters) of so-called ``precursor'' chemicals used to
process cocaine from the raw materials.
	   The chemicals were hidden in a shipment of horse feed, the army
said.
	   The military and the police did not connect either incident to
the guerrillas.

Key witness to Buenos Aires bombing located in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A key witness to an anti-Jewish
1992 bombing in Buenos Aires has been located in Brazil, TV Globo
reported Wednesday.
	   Argentinian justice officials have been trying to track down
Wilson dos Santos since last year, said the station. The Brazilian
national allegedly gave false testimony about the bombing of a
Jewish community building building in Buenos Aires which killed 86.
	   Santos was being under police protection and was ready to change
his testimony, TV Globo reported. It was not clear exactly where he
was found or where he was being protected.
	   ``His (Santos') statement will certainly accelerate the
(bombing) investigation,'' Brazil's Justice Minister Renan
Calheiros told the Agencia Estado news agency. ``He is being
protected and ready to make a statement.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ As President Andres Pastrana prepares
for peace talks with the hemisphere's oldest revolutionary,
Colombian prosecutors on Wednesday called for his arrest.
	   Arrest orders were issued for 68-year-old Manuel Marulanda, top
commander of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, his second-in-command and eight other top members of the
organization.
	   The FARC, Colombia's most powerful guerrilla army, has been
fighting the government since the 1960s.
	   Peace negotiations are expected soon, however, and both Pastrana
and Marulanda have indicated they want to personally inaugurate the
talks.
	   The warrants handed down Wednesday charge the guerrillas with
rebellion, multiple homicide, and kidnapping in an August 1996
attack on a southern army base in which 28 soldiers died and 60
were taken prisoner by the guerrillas, who later set them free.
	   Pastrana had no immediate comment on the arrest orders, however
defense minister Rodrigo Lloreda said the government was aware that
``dialogue does not mean impunity.''
	   The rebels including Marulanda, whose alias is ``sure shot'' and
whose real name prosecutors gave as Pedro Antonio Marin, were
already facing arrest orders for other guerrilla actions.
	   Prosecutors did not explain whether they would oppose
Marulanda's presence at the peace talks, but said they would
temporarily delay the new arrest orders against three of the rebels
whom the FARC have named as likely negotiators.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A Yale-educated businessman who is in
second place in Venezuelan presidential election polls on Wednesday
ruled out joining a pact with traditional parties to try to defeat
a former coup leader ahead in the polls.
	   Venezuela's two major political parties have been scrambling
this week to find a consensus candidate to oppose Hugo Chavez, the
front-runner in the Dec. 6 election.
	   But the businessman, 62-year-old independent Henrique Salas
Romer, said he ``won't be mixed up in making pacts, open or hidden,
or dividing up power, because Venezuela wants a president without
attachments.''
	   Many Venezuelans believe the traditional parties are responsible
for squandering the country's vast oil wealth.
	   Chavez, 44, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, is
provoking fear among the rich, many of whom think he will impose a
leftist dictatorship. Millions of poor Venezuelans see him as a
hero who will fight corruption and poverty.
	   Former Miss Universe Irene Saez, the candidate of the Social
Christian COPEI, and Luis Alfaro Ucero, who is backed by the
center-left Democratic Action, were meeting Wednesday to discuss a
possible anti-Chavez front.
	   Analysts say forming such a front may be difficult because of
divisions among those who oppose the former army paratrooper.
	   Saez's pact with Copei is seen as the main reason behind her
fall in the polls in recent months. Once the front-runner, she is
now in fourth place.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A mechanical flaw caused a
helicopter crash that killed the capital's popular mayor during a
flight to survey damage from Hurrican Mitch, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Mayor Cesar Castellanos died in the Nov. 1 crash while trying to
assess damage from the hurricane, which killed a reported 7,000
people in Honduras.
	   He had widely been considered a possible future presidential
candidate.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ The government Wednesday awarded
operation of power generation companies to three U.S.-based
companies in a partial privatization of the water and power system.
	   In 1997, the government split the state-run National Institute
of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification into eight companies.
	   On Wednesday, Americas Generation Corp., which includes U.S. and
Canadian investors, was awarded 49 percent of the Fortuna
hydroelectric company for dlrs 118.1 million.
	   Enron International Panama purchased 51 percent of the Bahia Las
Minas thermoelectric plant for dlrs 91.7 million. Aes Panama Energy
obtained 49 percent of the Bayano and Chiriqui hydroelectric plants
for dlrs 91.7 million.
	   Spain's Union Fenosa earlier purchased 51 percent of the
distribution companies Metro Oeste and Chiriqui for dlrs 211.9
million.
	   ___
	   ANTIGUA, Guatemala (AP) _ U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton
announced a dlrs 9.1 million donation on Wednesday to help
Guatemala's literacy programs.
	   ``Education is the key for a better future,'' Mrs. Clinton said
in a speech at Antigua Universidad de San Carlos.
	   Mrs. Clinton stressed the importance of literacy programs in a
country seeking to build a democracy after almost 40 years of civil
war.
	   Guatemalan Education Minister Arambala Castro thanked Clinton
for the donation, saying it would benefit 250,000 Guatemalans.
	   Mrs. Clinton has been touring Central America this week,
examining damage caused by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras and
Nicaragua and looking at social development in El Salvador and
Guatemala.

IMF head pushes for debt forgiveness for hurricane-torn Central

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund
said he is looking for ways the international community can best
help Central American nations recover and rebuild from the damage
of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Michel Camdessus on Wednesday repeated his call for helping the
two countries worst hit by the hurricane, Honduras and Nicaragua,
get relief from their giant international debts.
	   After suffering a catastrophe, ``the payment of a debt, already
excessive, becomes even more intolerable,'' Camdessus said at a
news conference in Panama City, where he was attending a meeting of
Latin American bankers.
	   Nicaragua owes more than dlrs 6 billion and Honduras about dlrs
4.3 billion. The two countries suffered billions of dollars in
damage caused by Mitch, which killed an estimated 10,000 people in
late October and early November.
	   Camdessus has proposed that about 80 percent of the countries'
debts be forgiven under a program for heavily indebted countries.
	   Several countries, including the United States, France and Cuba,
have said they will pardon some or all of the two countries debts.
	   Camdessus visited Nicaragua on Tuesday and will travel to
Honduras on Thursday. He said he is trying to make a rapid
evaluation of the countries' needs.
	   Mitch destroyed roads and bridges in Central America and wiped
out agricultural crops. Shortages of food, potable water and
medicine have raised fears that the region could suffer from
epidemics.
	   In Honduras on Wednesday, Cuban foreign minister Roberto Robaina
promised his country would send 2,000 doctors to Central America to
help hurricane victims. He also offered 500 scholarships for
Central Americans to study medicine in Havana.
	   ``Our support is modest, but it cannot be forgotten that it
comes from a poor country with great economic difficulties like
Cuba,'' he said.
	   Robaina was accompanied by 20 doctors and health specialists
when he arrived Tuesday. Another 103 doctors and 50 specialists
have been in Cuba since Nov. 3.
	   ``Central America can move ahead only with an integrated health
program supported by Latin America,'' Robaina said after meeting
with Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse. ``And with that
plan, we can save each year as many lives as those that were lost
in Hurricane Mitch.''

Koz, Nelson go back to school
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Kristina Koznick is the star, the
second-ranked slalom skier in the world. Tasha Nelson, however, has
been through a tornado, and that was what fascinated the audience
of about 175 elementary school children.
	   ``I thought it would be interesting, so that's why I had Tasha
tell them about it,'' Koznick said of the tornado episode. ``But
after she got started, I thought, `Oh, oh, that's all they'll want
to know about.'''
	   Koznick and Nelson, the top slalom skiers with the U.S. Ski
Team, came to Parley's Park Elementary to talk about the World Cup
ski races scheduled for Park City this week. After women's and
men's giant slaloms Thursday and Friday, Koznick and Nelson strut
their stuff Saturday in the women's slalom. The men's slalom winds
up the schedule on Sunday.
	   Koznick was fourth in last year's Park City slalom, at the time
a career-best finish. She went on to post four top-three finishes,
the best her first career World Cup victory at Are, Sweden.
	   Nelson, who grew up skiing with Koznick in Minnesota, is in her
third season and has yet to achieve the success of her friend, an
eight-year veteran.
	   But to a bunch of kids ranging from 6-9 years old, winning ski
races and competing in the Olympics is otherworldly. Tornadoes, on
the other hand, are something everybody knows about.
	   ``I was out by a horse barn and all of a sudden it got pitch
dark, black, and started pouring,'' Nelson said. ``The next thing I
knew I was in a hospital.''
	   There wasn't a sound from the kids, just a sea of staring eyes
as the story unfolded.
	   ``My brother said he saw me and the barn fly through the air and
land about 30 feet (0.9 meters) away. That's how I broke my leg.''
	   One of the kids gave Koznick a chance to get even by asking if
she'd ever been through a tornado.
	   Well, no, Koznick said, but if you're talking about injuries,
she had a story to relate. She said there were injuries to the body
and to the head.
	   The worst between the ears, she said, occurred last February
when she crashed out as one of the medal favorites in the Olympic
slalom at Nagano, Japan.
	   ``It was really tough, because everyone kept asking what
happened, why did you fall?' Here it was, the big day.
	   ``Imagine if you'd been training 19 years to do something. What
if you'd been studying 19 years for one test (oohs and aahs from
the kids), and then on that day ... It's kind of tough.''
	   Koznick, who turns 23 three days after her Saturday race, said
later that it took her about a week to shake off the Olympic
disappointment.
	   ``There were a couple of days where I'd just sit and feel sorry
for myself and cry,'' Koznick said. ``Then I told myself, `If
you're just going to sit and cry about it, you might as well just
quit.'
	   ``I've gone through a lot of things in my life and I know I'm a
strong person,'' she said. ``I'm proud of myself for being able to
bounce back. OK, I learned from it; now keep going.''
	   Winning at Park City, with all the Parley's Park Elementary
students cheering her on, would go a long way in soothing the
Olympics disappointment for Koznick. Why, they might even think
it's better than going through a tornado.

Caribbean export agency to open Cuba office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Caribbean Export Development
Agency will open an office in Havana next year to help businesses
in the region break into Cuba's market, a top official said in
Guyana Wednesday.
	   Earl Baccus, the agency's director, said Cuba's parliament has
approved legislation allowing the office to open Jan. 1.
Representatives from the agency have worked informally in the
country for several months.
	   Baccus was in Guyana to attend a two-day meeting of the
Caribbean Community-Cuba Joint Commission. The meeting will focus
on increasing trade and cooperation between Cuba and the 15 members
of the Caribbean Community trade group, and it will include an
exhibition of products that both sides want to export.
	   Bacchus said the agency sees export opportunities in Cuba's
tourism districts, where growing numbers of well-heeled European
and Canadian vacationers shop. Cubans themselves have little
expendable income, and food and consumer goods are rationed by the
government.
	   ``We are encouraging businessmen to concentrate on servicing the
growing tourism sector,'' Bacchus said. ``That's where the bulk of
the business will be, rather than with regular (consumer) goods.''
	   Baccus said the Havana office will give Caribbean businesses
advice on dealing with the Cuban government, utilities and local
trade groups.
	   Several large companies in the English-speaking Caribbean have
begun expanding in the communist island. Jamaica-based Sandals
Resorts is building a 1,000-room hotel in the Varadero tourist
district, and other Caribbean companies are now shipping soft
drinks and clothing to Havana.
	   Trade between Cuba and its Caribbean neighbors has averaged
about dlrs 300 million annually in the last three years.

Mexican Energy secretary says he expects oil cuts to be extended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's energy secretary said Wednesday he
was confident that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would follow Mexico's example and extend their
crude oil output cuts through the end of 1999.
	   Mexico's commitment, announced Friday, is part of a broad
exporters' pact adopted this year to try to boost dwindling oil
prices.
	   Energy Secretary Luis Tellez said he had been in contact with
individual members of OPEC, and those conversations have led to his
confidence about the extension.
	   Tellez said that if OPEC decides not to extend the cuts, Mexico
would reconsider its decision to maintain oil exports at 1.64
million barrels a day. The decision was announced in the
government's 1999 budget proposal, presented to Congress last week.
	   ``Mexico expects a positive response from OPEC, but if OPEC does
not extend its cuts, Mexico would change its export policy,''
Tellez said at a news conference. He did not elaborate.
	   Tellez also said despite recent volatility that pushed Mexico's
average crude export price below dlrs 10 per barrel, he expected
crude exports will meet the budgeted dlrs 11 per barrel projection
in 1999.
	   The Mexican government, which relies on oil exports for a third
of its revenue, has implemented wide-ranging austerity measures to
compensate for lost revenue as a result of plummeting global oil
prices.
	   Last weekend, it announced a 15 percent hike in gasoline prices,
prompting Mexican drivers along the U.S.-Mexico border to fill
their tanks in American gas stations, where prices are considerably
lower.
	   Questioned about the unpopular increase, Tellez said Mexico's
gasoline prices were still in the lower than those in other
countries, although higher than in the United States or Canada.
	   He said the 15 percent increase, plus an additional 1 percent
monthly increase from through December 1999, would add nearly dlrs
2 billion to federal government income next year.
	   The government has lost around dlrs 3.6 billion in 1998 as a
result of lower world oil prices, and has slashed its budget three
times.

Tiger Woods beats Vijay Singh with 17th hole birdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GORDON SAKAMOTO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POIPU, Hawaii (AP) _ Tiger Woods rolled in a 12-foot (3.6-meter)
birdie putt on the 17th hole and then watched match play opponent
Vijay Singh hit his second shot on the final hole into the ocean
Wednesday to capture the PGA Grand Slam of Golf.
	   The 2-up win for Woods, who gained entry into the exclusive
tournament thanks to a double victory in the majors by his buddy
Mark O'Meara, was worth dlrs 400,000.
	   It also made Woods the second alternate to win the dlrs 1
million tournament. Greg Norman, thanks to a double victory by Nick
Price, won the 1994 Grand Slam.
	   U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen took advantage of a bogey by O'Meara
on the 17th hole at the 6,957-yard (6,331-meter) Poipu Bay Resort
Course on the island of Kauai to take third place, 1-up.
	   Singh led for most of the championship match and was ahead by
two when Woods conceded the 12th hole.
	   But Singh, the PGA Championship winner, then had three
consecutive bogeys. Woods birdied the 427-yard (389-meter) 15th to
go 1-up.
	   Woods gave back the advantage on the next hole when he bogeyed,
but took the lead on the par-3 17th with his birdie putt as Singh's
25-foot (7.5-meter) effort hung on the lip of the cup.
	   In the third-place match, O'Meara, who won the Masters and
British Open, built a two-hole lead with seven holes to play.
However, the Masters and British Open winner went bogey-bogey over
the next two holes to square the match and then dropped back on the
17th.
	   The Grand Slam is limited to winners of the four majors.
	   O'Meara, by becoming the oldest player (41) to win two majors in
one year opened the way for Woods to join the quartet as the
alternate.
	   Woods, the only returnee in the four-man field from last year,
gained the extra spot by turning in the best performance by a
player in this year's majors.

Pierce, Graf, Hingis win Chase matches

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fifth-seeded Monica Seles struggled before
subduing Anna Kournikova 6-4, 6-3 Wednesday night in an
opening-round match at the Chase Championships.
	   The victory sent Seles into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 2
million, season-ending tournament, where she will take on red-hot
Steffi Graf.
	   Lindsay Davenport, the world's top-ranked player and seeded No.
1 in this elite, 16-player field, completed the first round when
she took on Sandrine Testud of France in a late match.
	   Earlier in the day, sixth-seeded Mary Pierce reached the
quarterfinals by beating South Africa's Amanda Coetzer 6-1, 6-0.
	   Seles began the match as if she was double-parked on Eighth
Avenue outside Madison Square Garden. Kournikova's only point in
the first three games came on when the left-hander from Sarasota,
Florida double-faulted.
	   But after that, Seles, a former top-ranked player who is in the
midst of a comeback, was locked in a fault-filled contest that
neither player seemed able to win. It was an error appropriately _
a backhand service return that sailed long _ that ended the match
as Seles held serve. In between, there were 10 breaks of service in
the 19 games.
	   Kournikova never was able to get her game together as she
continually double-faulted _ 16 in all, including five in one game.
	   Still, she hit enough winners to reveal the talent she does
have. Her groundstrokes were more crisp than those of Seles, and
they frequently left Seles just standing on one side of the court,
watching a winner sail past.
	   The 17-year-old Russian, making her Championships debut, also
exploited Seles' lack of mobility, winning several points with drop
shots.
	   But the veteran Seles, a three-time winner here in the Garden,
won the points that counted. Now she has a date with Graf, who
advanced into the quarterfinals on Tuesday by beating third-seeded
Jana Novotna 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1.
	   In her match, Pierce was overpowering in every aspect of the
game as she rushed into the next round, where she will face No. 2
Martina Hingis.
	   Coetzer, at 5-foot-2 (1.55-meter) one of the smallest players on
the Corel WTA Tour, relies on quickness, speed and grit to overcome
her lack of height. Against Pierce, none of those worked.
	   Pierce had the firepower from all sides, unloading huge
groundstrokes and hitting winners all over the court. She took
charge at the start and never gave Coetzer a chance. Pierce won the
opening four games while losing only nine points.
	   Coetzer then rallied from a 15-40 deficit to break Pierce, the
only game she won. In the entire match, Coetzer won only 26 points.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist. The top
eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's blue carpet.
The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Gen. Aurelio de Lyra Tavares, a
military leader and author, died Wednesday. He was 93.
	   Tavares was a member of Brazil's military junta in the 1960s and
held a number of senior army posts.
	   He also wrote several books on military subjects which earned
him a seat on Brazil's prestigious Academy of Literature.
	   Tavares had been sick for some months, said Maria Jose de Abril,
a spokeswoman for the academy. The exact cause of his death was not
clear.
	   He died at his home in Rio and his funeral took place Wednesday,
she said.

Japan's trade surplus rises for 19th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world
rose for a 19th straight month in October, surging 23.9 percent
compared to a year ago, the government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a measure of goods which pass
customs, grew to a non-seasonally adjusted 1.37 trillion yen (dlrs
11.33 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus was slightly higher than the 1.32 trillion yen (dlrs
10.93 billion) average forecast of Tokyo-based economists surveyed
by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States rose 31.9 percent on the year to 719.74 billion yen (dlrs
5.95 billion).
	   The steady climb in the surplus reflects consumers' reluctance
to spend amid Japan's worst recession in decades. That has cut
demand for imports and made Japanese manufacturers increasingly
reliant on sales overseas.
	   Japan has been under heavy pressure from trade partners such as
the U.S to boost domestic demand by putting its economy back on
track for recovery.
	   Before departing on a trip to Asia, President Bill Clinton said
in Washington on Wednesday that Japan must take decisive steps to
engineer a recovery.
	   Clinton was scheduled to arrive in Tokyo later Thursday and meet
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday.

U.N. inspectors more than Iraq expected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In imposing one of the most intrusive arms
control regimes on one of the world's most secretive societies,
U.N. inspectors set up their own intelligence unit, used spy plane
photographs and adopted other cloak-and-dagger tactics.
	   The commission has been hobbled by Iraqi defiance, but some say
there may never be another disarmament agency as aggressive as the
U.N. Special Commission.
	   UNSCOM, as it is known, certainly proved more than was expected
by Iraq, which grudgingly accepted the agency after its devastating
defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Judging by the past, the Iraqis assumed UNSCOM would be another
passive U.N. operation, depending on their good will to cooperate
or at least allow it to operate freely.
	   At first, even some U.N. officials expected Iraqi cooperation
and envisaged an end to the team's inspection work within six
months to a year.
	   Instead, the monitors who returned to work Wednesday are members
of a forceful team that has gotten little Iraqi help in trying to
unravel a murky web of dummy corporations and clandestine
factories, which formed the backbone of a weapons program that
produced enough poison and toxins to kill millions.
	   ``The Iraqis agreed (to UNSCOM), but they really didn't have
much of a choice,'' said Ian Kemp of the London-based Jane's
Defense Weekly. ``That is the major difference between what UNSCOM
is doing and all the other major (arms control) treaties.''
	   From its very start, UNSCOM was unique.
	   The CIA has cooperated closely with the commission. A member of
at least one spy agency briefed the first meeting of UNSCOM
officials, former inspectors have said.
	   About six months after UNSCOM was created it set up its own
intelligence unit to analyze information, some of which came from
spy agencies of various countries.
	   Intelligence became crucial as Iraq tried to mislead the
inspectors, who have few sources of information outside official
channels.
	   ``The United Nations does not have satellites, it does not have
signal intelligence capabilities and it doesn't have agents trained
in the field,'' noted Ken Pollack of the National Defense
University in Washington.
	   The inspectors do, however, have access to photographs from a
U-2 surveillance plane, which is flown by Americans.
	   Iraq has pointed to this close cooperation with foreign
intelligence agencies as evidence of the spying they have
repeatedly accused the inspectors of carrying out.
	   Those accusations intensified after one former U.N. inspector,
Scott Ritter, said he received key help from Israel in interpreting
U-2 photographs.
	   Tim Trevan, who served on the weapons inspection team from
1992-95, said the inspectors would not ``need to go to foreign
intelligence agencies if Iraq ... was not lying, cheating and
acting to thwart ... the regime.''
	   Clashes were inevitable as the inspectors worked to create the
most intrusive and thorough weapons control regime since Nazi
Germany and Imperial Japan were disarmed after World War II.
	   Those two nations were vanquished and occupied by massive allied
armies. The Gulf War ended with Saddam Hussein and his Baath Party
in power and in no mood to give up their most potent weapons.
	   ``UNSCOM, to be successful, has to depend on the cooperation of
the Iraqis,'' Kemp said, ``and if Iraq does not give that
cooperation, UNSCOM will never be entirely successful.''
	   Despite Iraqi efforts to block the inspectors, the mission has
accomplished major feats. UNSCOM has supervised the destruction of
huge amounts of Iraqi arms, including 125,000 gallons of chemical
weapons and a biological weapons factory.
	   But some say the mission, which was able to return to Iraq this
week only amid U.S. and British threats to use massive force, may
never be repeated.
	   ``UNSCOM ... was never intended to go chasing around the country
trying to find hidden stocks of chemical and biological agents and
missile parts,'' said retired Army Col. Daniel Smith of the Center
for Defense Information in Washington. ``I don't think you are
going to see another UNSCOM.''

Mark Taylor joins 100-test club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Who would have predicted 14 months
ago that Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor would be part of
the elite 100-test club on Friday?
	   Certainly not him.
	   In the last Ashes series, ``Tubby,'' as he is affectionately
known to his teammates, gave his test career one more innings after
18 months of continuous form slump.
	   He thought that if he failed in Birmingham in the first Ashes
test of 1997 in England, he'd put an end to his own misery.
	   But the innings of 129, after the first innings' seven, saved
Taylor to relive one of the touching stories of Australian cricket.
	   In the first test in Brisbane, Taylor will join former captain
Allan Border, David Boon, Steve Waugh and Ian Healy as only the
fifth Australian to play in 100 tests and the 19th over all.
	   Since making his test debut against the West Indies at the
Sydney Cricket Ground in 1988-89, Taylor became an integral part of
a team built by Border and then cricket boss Bob Simpson until
Taylor took over the reins from the former skipper in 1994.
	   Taylor is a product of Australian country cricket. Born in the
Riverina area of the southern New South Wales in 1964, he spent
most of his boyhood in Wagga Wagga, the famous sporting town which
also produced former fast bowler Geoff Lawson and Taylor's current
opening partner Michael Slater.
	   Like most country people, Taylor is easy going. He takes good
and bad, criticism and praise, with equal calm.
	   Taylor's Don Bradman-equaling unbeaten 334 against Pakistan in
October was honored by the Australian Cricket Board in its season
launch alongside Border, Boon, Dennis Lillee, Shane Warne,
wicketkeepers _ record holders past and present _ Rod Marsh and
Healy at Brisbane City Hall.
	   Taylor is the only Australian captain to win two test series
against the West Indies, and the only one to win in the Caribbean,
South Africa and in Pakistan.
	   Taylor burst onto the international scene in the 1989 Ashes
series with 839 runs at 83.90, the third highest aggregate ever.
	   Nine years later, as a left-handed opener, he stands third with
7,297, behind only Border (11,174) and Boon (7,422) in the
Australian run-getters' ladder.
	   It has been widely speculated that Taylor would retire after the
current series, but he says ``I don't really know,'' to questions
about him giving up the game.
	   ``Every series I'm taking one at a time at the moment. Things
have gone my way recently, so I'll see how I go this Ashes
series.''
	   Taylor says he likes batting in pressure situations.
	   ``It make me concentrate all the time,'' says Taylor.``I like it
when something is up for grabs. I prefer that situation to when I'm
cruising along.''
	   As a sure-handed fielder, he has grasped every opportunity that
has come his way. With 148 catches in 99 tests, Taylor is eight shy
of Border's world record of 156 in as many tests.
	   Taylor remains modest about all of his achievements.
	   ``There's been bad times in the past, now's a good time,'' he
says. ``Let's make sure I make good use of it.''

Japan sets the pace early at World Cup
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Japan's Yasuharu Imano made a
flying start on his World Cup debut Thursday, leading the two-man
team to an early lead in the 32-nation tournament at the Gulf
Harbor course.
	   Imano, yet to win in two seasons as a professional, shot an
8-under 64 to lead the individual standings. Teammate Mitsutaka
Kusakabe, also on debut, was less spectacular with a 70 on the new
6,288-meter (6,850-yard) course as Japan ended at 10-under 134.
	   Japan hit off in the first of 16 groups and Imano, 25, made an
immediate impact with six birdies in the opening nine to go out in
30. They got to 10-under after 14 but dropped back when Kusakabe
had a double bogey 5 at the 13th.
	   But both players capped their rounds in the strokeplay format
with birdies at the 18th as good approaches left them within 10
feet.
	   ``My putting was very good today and I hit every green but
one,'' Imano said through an interpreter. ``It's my first time in a
team match and my leader (Kusakabe) helped me read the line.''
	   Scores were low despite several players tipping trouble from the
winds swirling around the ocean front course. Tournament officials
appeared to heed the warnings on pin placements, giving the players
plenty of birdie chances. Imano said the greens were ``perfect''
coompared to a day earlier.
	   The 479-meter (517-yard) par-5 2nd gave up five eagles and 23
birdies from the opening 40 of 64 players.
	   England's Nick Faldo, playing here in a bid to kick-start his
form after a difficult season, also made a great start and was
5-under through the opening nine. He dropped a shot at 10 but got
it back at 11.
	   Italy's Costantino Rocca was another making an early run at a
low score, going to 8-under through 13 before dropping a shot at
14.
	   Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty was 7-under through 11, and was 9-under
with teammate Tony Johnstone.
	   The United States pairing of John Daly and Scott Verplank made
an encouraging start with the experienced Daly taking the lead.
	   Daly, who won all his matches in this year's Dunhill Cup after a
difficult PGA Tour season, was 3-under through six, including an
eagle at the par-5 6th. Verplank picked up one birdie to put the
U.S. team at 4-under.

Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan: Turkey's No. 1 enemy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Turkey-Kurds &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ With charisma, guns and bombs, Abdullah
Ocalan created one of the world's most ruthless and best-organized
guerrilla movements from a handful of Kurdish insurgents in the
mountains of Turkey's impoverished southeast.
	   His challenge now, after 37,000 deaths in the fight for Kurdish
autonomy in Turkey: convincing his followers and the world that he
will advance the Kurdish cause through peaceful means.
	   ``We have abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace
accord,'' Ocalan declared in an interview Wednesday in La
Repubblica newspaper in Italy, where he is seeking political
asylum.
	   A college dropout and one of seven children from a poor farming
family, Ocalan, 49, founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in
1978. It sought greater cultural rights for Turkey's Kurd minority,
including the use of Kurdish language in education and
broadcasting.
	   The movement turned to guerrilla warfare in 1984. Ocalan drew
supporters driven by Kurdish nationalism, poverty and anger over
the feudal system still prevalent in rural areas of the southeast.
	   Ocalan recruited thousands of young Kurdish men and women and
trained them with an iron fist.
	   The guerrillas lived on rice and water in snow-covered
mountains. They fought and died for him.
	   Since his arrest Nov. 12 at Rome's airport on a Turkish warrant,
thousands of devoted followers have taken to the streets of Rome
and capitals across Europe to oppose his extradition to Turkey.
They have marched by the thousands, launched hunger strikes by the
hundreds, set themselves on fire and blown themselves up in
suicide-bombings.
	   But to Turks, Ocalan is a ``bloody murderer,'' as Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Wednesday.
	   Turkey is trying him in absentia on capital crimes, a fact that
is expected to block his return by Italy. Italian law forbids
extraditing suspects to a country where they face the death
penalty.
	   PKK has recently lost ground in the fight against Turkish
troops, who over the years, have gotten better at combating
guerrilla warfare.
	   Ocalan himself was never in the Turkish battlefield. He hid out
most of the 14 years in Syria, until he was expelled this year
under Turkish pressure.
	   Ocalan schooled his fighters in Marxism and trained them in
camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon and in
northern Iraq. He said the Kurds had been ``humiliated for
centuries,'' and needed to regain their ``self-esteem.''
	   He ordered his rebels to kill Turkish teachers so that Kurds in
the southeast would not have to learn Turkish. But Ocalan himself
reportedly knows little Kurdish and speaks Turkish.
	   He separated from his wife, Kesire, who joined an opposition
group in the 1990s. Ocalan is said to have no children.
	   Turkish reports have portrayed him as a loutish, mentally
unstable man who uses his power to seduce female followers. A
Turkish TV broadcast showed the mustachioed Ocalan telling a group
of women guerrilla fighters, ``Being with me is an honor.''

Researchers say Peron knew Nazis were entering Argentina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ There is proof that Argentine
president Juan Peron encouraged fleeing Nazi war criminals to seek
asylum in his country after World War II, researchers said
Wednesday.
	   Ignacio Klich, the head of a government-sponsored group
examining Nazi activity in Argentina, said its members had
unearthed papers which reveal the president discussed the issue of
Nazi immigration in meetings held at his presidential palace.
	   Klich said the papers of Pierre Daye, a Belgian who once served
as an informal Peron advisor, reveal a series of meetings at the
presidential palace where ways were discussed of creating a network
for receiving large numbers of European immigrants, many of them
war criminals.
	   The papers however do not provide a list of names of who
actually entered the country, he said, but they do support a notion
believed for years by many historians to be true.
	   ``The documents indicate Peron and the participants at this
meeting were aware of the background of these characters,'' Klich
said in an interview.
	   Today's presentation capped off a three-day meeting of
historical researchers and experts digging into past Nazi
involvement in Argentina founded in 1997. The group's final report
detailing its findings is expected to be presented next year.
	   Much of the research has come from delving through archives in
Argentina, Europe, and the United States.
	   Dr. Sidney M. Clearfield of B'Nai B'rith International, a
leading Jewish organization, said he was encouraged by the
committee's findings and hoped continued research would help
Argentina better understand what happened here during the 1930's
and 40's.
	   Researchers ealier this year revealed that some Nazis who faced
charges for war crimes in Europe found refuge in Argentina using
passports issued from the Red Cross in their real names.
	   Those findings contradicted previous reportsthat most Nazis
arrived under false names with passports issued by Juan Peron's
government after World War II.
	   Argentina's image as a haven for Nazi war criminals who fled
postwar Europe is one President Carlos Menem has tried to dispel.
Hoping to help researchers better research what transpired during
the post-war period here, he signed a decree in 1992 opening the
government archives.
	   Earlier this week, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido DiTella
announced plans for a Holocaust museum in the capital, adding that
the recent extraditions of Dinko and Nada Sakic were indications
his country was serious about discarding its image as a hideout for
war criminals.

Dollar higher against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Thursday after fresh economic data released overnight
showed a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit. Tokyo stocks
advanced slightly.
	   The dollar bought 122.08 yen in early trading, up 0.86 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York
level of 121.65 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 41.64
points, or 0.29 percent, to 14,640.87 points in the 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed up 186.23 points, or 1.29
percent.
	   Traders said the dollar was buoyed by the U.S. Commerce
Department's announcement Wednesday that the trade deficit for
September was dlrs 14 billion, down 11.7 percent from a revised
record of dlrs 15.9 billion in August.
	   That led many economists to upgrade their estimates for third
quarter economic growth in the U.S.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, trading was thin as many investors
stayed on the sidelines to monitor the government's efforts to form
a coalition, traders said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 3.98 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,117.40. The TOPIX
closed up 5.77 points, or 0.52 percent, the day before.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
reportedly plans to form a new political alliance with the
opposition Liberal Party. Obuchi was scheduled to meet with Liberal
Party leader Ichiro Ozawa later Thursday.
	   The LDP has a majority in Japan's powerful lower house of
Parliament, but needs some support from opposition members in the
upper house to ensure swift passage of legislation.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.835 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.830
percent, driving its price down to 108.54 yen from 108.59 yen.

Down, but not out: Britain's hereditary peers face final battle
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ They've seen countless monarchs come and go,
survived England's 17th-century civil war and deftly sidestepped
abolition during 150 years of popular democracy.
	   Now, Britain's hereditary peers are likely facing their final
battle after a millennium of political influence.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair wants to strip the 759 nobles of their
voting rights in the House of Lords, Britain's upper chamber, as
part of a parliamentary reform program.
	   But some peers, described by one newspaper as ``an elderly but
tenacious and highly experienced guerrilla force,'' vow to fight
back by clogging up the government's legislative program.
	   ``I would regard that as my final duty and would be proud to go
out as a 'football hooligan,''' says Earl Onslow, 60, referring to
England's notoriously unruly soccer fans.
	   The House of Lords, which revises and examines government
legislation, was established in the 11th century. It is composed of
hereditary lords, who inherited their titles, and life peers, who
are awarded titles and may be the only members left after reform.
	   The peers debate in an ornate, gilded chamber and have a
reputation for courtesy, unlike the House of Commons, where
directly elected Members of Parliament argue more raucously.
	   The rebellious peers say the Labor Party's plans to abolish
their voting rights without proposing an alternative threatens
Britain's constitutional balance between the government's executive
and legislative branches.
	   ``Doing away with us without qualification won't do,'' said Lord
Mottistone, 78. ``In the last resort, we may fight all sorts of
rearguard actions _ slow things down, ruin government legislation _
because we will fight this hard.''
	   Reformers counter that it's indefensible that hereditary lords,
who overwhelmingly support the opposition Conservative Party, can
vote in Parliament on the basis of their ancestry.
	   ``I think the hereditary principle has led to a very narrow
social group in the Lords _ almost exclusively male and
overwhelmingly Tory,'' said Lord Ponsonby, one of only 16
Labor-supporting hereditary peers.
	   Britain's nobles have been a power for a thousand years,
although their influence has been draining to the House of Commons
for the past four centuries.
	   A total of 1,272 peers _ and a smattering of peeresses _ are
eligible to sit in the House of Lords. Of those, nearly 500 are
life peers.
	   Only about 200 hereditary peers regularly attend, carrying out
the bulk of the chamber's work with about the same number of life
peers.
	   A few hereditary peers trace their lineage to commanders of
William the Conqueror's invading 1066 Norman army or illegitimate
royals born to monarch's mistresses. But most of the titles are
less than 150 years old, won by political and military worthies
from England's landed gentry or wealthy industrial families who
helped govern Britain and ruled its far-flung Victorian empire.
	   Labor's refusal to say how the revised chamber will fit with
Britain's new constitution, in which Scotland and Wales will have
their own national assemblies, have led to accusations that Blair
is planning a new era of patronage politics.
	   ``We don't want an assembly which is the prime minister's
mirror,'' said Earl Russell, a spokesman for Britain's Liberal
Democrat party.
	   Some life peers also think the reform plans are being pushed
through too fast.
	   ``We may have to change,'' said Lord Chalfont, an independent.
``But we don't have to change a thousand years of history in the
course of a single parliamentary session.''
	   Labor supporters call that foot-dragging, and dismiss the peers'
claims of impartiality.
	   Lord Basham, a council leader from southern England who was
given a life peerage by Blair, said the government would publish
its reform proposals next year.
	   In the interim, the hereditary peers have started a quiet
campaign by taking their case to the court of public opinion.
	   Although polls show the majority of Britons support ejecting the
nobles from the chamber, others point to high levels of support for
them on specific issues.
	   The Lords voted against lowering the age of gay consent, for
example, and opposed unpopular measures such as the government's
ban on selling beef on the bone after a theoretical link with ``mad
cow'' disease was announced.
	   Labor's worry is that if the hereditary lords can raise enough
public support and identify themselves with popular causes, Blair
may be forced to shelve reform plans.
	   ``I think the arguments being put forward are delaying tactics.
I think the hereditaries realize the game's up, but they want to be
recognized when they walk out of the door,'' said Lord Ponsonby.
	   ``In personal terms, I would be sorry to go,'' he said. ``I hope
I have made a contribution. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't vote
against my own abolition.''

Remains of 25 children found, satan worship investigated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Authorities were searching for clues in
the murders of 25 children whose remains were found this week at
the bottom of a steep ravine and scattered throughout an overgrown
city lot.
	   Officials said Wednesday they were probing the possibility that
satanic cults were involved in at least some of the deaths in
Pereira, a western state capital about 110 miles (175 kilometers)
from Bogota.
	   ``It's a city where satanism is widely practiced, and there's
alot of talk that children are used in rituals,'' said mayor's aide
Luis Fernando Henao. Liquor bottles were found beside some victims,
two of whom were tied to trees and apparently tortured, Henao said.
	   Prosecutors said they were considering all possibilities,
including that the children may have been killed as part of a
``social cleansing'' campaign of suspected juvenile delinquents by
vigilantes.
	   The children's bodies _ almost all of them reduced to skeletons
_ were found in two separate searches in the same part of the city.
	   Twelve of the victims were found Tuesday in a riverbed below a
city highway. Searchers rappelled down a ravine to reach the site
after workers fixing electrical lines spotted what they believed
were animal bones, said state prosecutor Elena Osorio.
	   A search team discovered the other remains last week, hidden
beneath the underbrush in an abandoned lot, after a child came
across a skull. ``As they tore away the vegetation, they
encountered the bodies,'' Osorio said.
	   Many of the skeletons were incomplete and investigators
estimated the number of dead by counting skulls. Forensic experts
believe the oldest of the victims was 16 and at least half were 10
or under.
	   ``It's very distressing and disturbing...it's truly a mystery,''
Mayor Luis Alberto Duque told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
Duque said, however, that accounts linking the deaths to cults had
``in a high percentage been ruled out.''

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A trailer truck carrying a ton of
cocaine was seized after leading police on an 18-mile (30
kilometer) high-speed highway chase through an area that had been
demilitarized to facilitate talks with leftist guerrillas,
Colombian police reported.
	   The truck was captured Tuesday on the road between Florencia,
235 miles (380 kilometers) southwest of Bogota, and Neiva, a city
93 miles (150 kilometers) north, police said. The chase broke out
when the truck sped past a police roadblock.
	   The bulk of the cocaine was fully-processed, in hundreds of
packets hidden in a false roof built into the truck. Police said
they also found 73 pounds (33 kilograms) of unrefined cocaine in a
second vehicle.
	   The cocaine was seized occurred near a 16,200 square-mile
(42,000-sq. kilometer) southern region where army and police have
withdrawn to facilitate peace talks with leftist guerrillas
expected to begin soon.
	   Critics of the pullout have said it could lead to an increase in
drug shipments from the area _ a major cocaine-processing region.
The guerrillas have been accused of financing their operations with
cocaine profits.
	   In a separate capture near the same demilitarized zone, the army
said Wednesday it seized a truck carrying more than 3,000 gallons
(11,500 liters) of so-called ``precursor'' chemicals used to
process cocaine from the raw materials.
	   The chemicals were hidden in a shipment of horse feed, the army
said.
	   The military and the police did not connect either incident to
the guerrillas.

Fehr takes first-round lead in qualifying tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ Rick Fehr, a two-time PGA Tour
winner who lost his tour exemption this year, shot a 10-under 62
Wednesday in the first round of the tour's qualifying tournament
for 1999.
	   Fehr, whose last win was the 1994 Walt Disney/Oldsmobile
Classic, had five birdies on each nine at the La Quinta Resort
Dunes Course, one of two courses used in the six-day, 108-hole
event.
	   Fehr, a 14-year tour veteran, has earned more than dlrs 3
million on tour. But he finished just 138th on the tour's money
list this year with dlrs 196,745 in earnings to lose his exemption.
	   Brian Gay, playing the Weiskopf Course at PGA West just a few
miles from the Dunes Course, had a 64 for second place as 103 of
the 169 players broke par.
	   Next at 65 were Dino Lucchesi, Scott Dunlap, Ted Purdy and
Jonathan Kaye.
	   In all, 17 past tour winners are in the field this week,
including six-time winner Bob Gilder and five-time winner Ken
Green. Gilder had a 69 in the first round while Green had a 72.
	   The top 35 players and ties in the tournament receive PGA Tour
exemptions for 1999. The next 50 players earn full exemptions to
the developmental Nike Tour, with the rest of the player in the
finals earning partial exempt status for the Nike Tour next year.

All goes normal as U.N. inspectors resume monitoring of Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq appeared to be cooperating with United
Nations weapons inspectors carrying out routine inspections on
their first day back at work. Surprise inspections _ which have
scuttled cooperation in the past _ still lie ahead.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq provided the escorts necessary for the U.N.
Special Commission investigating Iraq's hidden arms under Iraq-U.N.
agreements; in the past it has denied escorts as a means to block
inspections.
	   Six white vehicles pulled out of UNSCOM headquarters on
Baghdad's eastern edge on Wednesday. Accompanying them were a
half-dozen cars full of Iraqi escorts _ a sign that Iraq was
cooperating.
	   The inspectors' spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not say where
the inspectors were going or what tasks they would perform.
	   ``The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center has resumed
full-range activities'' she said.
	   The surprise checks that in the past created clashes with Iraq
will come later, Ms. Cross has said. These are visits to sites
where it is suspected that Iraq has hidden material related to
chemical and biological weapons programs or long-range missiles.
	   The inspectors were back on the job only after the United States
and Britain threatened air strikes against Iraq unless it resumed
full cooperation with the monitors.
	   Iraq backed down Saturday as air and missile attacks were about
to be unleashed.
	   Asked about the first day of work by UNSCOM inspectors, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York said: ``They did a normal day's
work and came back _ no problems.''
	   The inspectors were expected to limit their first visits to
sites where they have installed cameras and sensors for long-term
monitoring.
	   Iraq suspended U.N. weapons monitoring activities on Oct. 31,
and UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
investigates Iraq's nuclear programs, pulled out their inspectors
last week.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted. Iraq says that it has
already complied with the U.N. demands.
	   One reason Iraq accepted the inspectors back was to get a
promised U.N. Security Council review of how well it has lived up
to resolutions on its most dangerous weapons.
	   Iraq wants the review to lead to a quick lifting of U.N.
sanctions, but the United States and Britain have resisted any such
move.

Eltingh-Haarhuis advance in straight sets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis,
playing in their final doubles tournament as a team, beat Ellis
Ferriera and Rich Leach 6-4, 6-4 Wednesday in the opening round of
the ATP World Doubles Championship.
	   The Dutchmen, ranked No. 1 in the world, improved their 1998
record to 42-4, the best winning percentage on the ATP Tour this
season. Together they have won 38 titles, including this year at
Wimbledon.
	   The pair has appeared in six previous World Doubles
Championships and has never lost an opening round match.
	   Eltingh, 28, announced his retirement from tennis following the
conclusion of this event.
	   ``We want to go out on top,'' Haarhuis said following the match.
``That means winning here in Hartford and finishing the year as the
best team in the world.''
	   Eltingh became a new father this year and admits his heart is
close to home.
	   ``I've been playing tennis seriously since I was 12,'' he said.
``It's been a great career, but I just know that I won't have to
pack my bags anymore.''
	   Also Wednesday, Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor defeated Sandon
Stolle and Cyril Suk, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.

Chief U.N. inspector asks Iraq for documents on weapons program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq, BC-Iraq-UNSCOM &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler has made his first formal request for documents on Iraq's
banned weapons programs since Baghdad pledged to resume cooperation
with his investigators.
	   Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, sent a letter
Wednesday to Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz asking for
documents that Iraq previously refused to hand over. The request
comes just a day after inspectors returned to Baghdad.
	   ``I wrote to him today saying start again. Give us a whole new
answer on biology. Break the habit of a lifetime and tell me the
truth,'' Butler said in a speech Wednesday night to the World
Affairs Council of Philadelphia.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency has accounted for most of
Iraq's nuclear program. And Butler said inspectors have accounted
for much of its chemical warfare and missile programs. But he said
Iraq has revealed almost nothing about its biological weapons
program _ which he called ``a black hole.''
	   The documents sought by Butler include an Iraqi air force
account of chemical munitions used in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war,
said commission spokesman Ewen Buchanan.
	   The commission, known as UNSCOM, charged with finding and
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton singled out the air force document
when he announced Sunday that the United States would give Baghdad
a last chance to comply with U.N. resolutions demanding its
disarmament.
	   Iraq halted the weapons inspections on Oct. 31. But early
Saturday, as the United States prepared to launch airstrikes, the
Baghdad government announced it would allow unconditional
inspections to resume.
	   Weapons inspectors discovered the Air Force document in July but
were not allowed to remove it. Commission officials did not release
any other details on the letter Wednesday or announce any other
documents they were seeking.
	   Gen. Amer al-Saadi, scientific adviser to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, said in a CNN interview Tuesday that Baghdad would be
willing to discuss the air force document, but did not say Iraq
would hand it over.
	   The account of munitions used in the Iran-Iraq war could help
inspectors fill in the gaps in Iraq's accouting of other chemical
munitions.
	   The United States and Britain, which have threatened military
action if Iraq does not cooperate unconditionally with the weapons
inspectors, will undoubtedly be waiting to see whether Baghdad
hands over the documents.
	   In June, Butler released a lengthy list of information that
UNSCOM is seeking from Iraq before it will verify that its weapons
of mass destruction have been destroyed. The U.N. Security Council
will not lift tough economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait without verification of its disarmament.

Israeli Cabinet meeting is last hurdle before troop withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials said they have completed
all of their obligations to date under the Mideast peace accord and
expect a green light from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
Cabinet for an Israeli troop withdrawal by the weekend.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet was to convene at 9 a.m. (0700gmt) Thursday
to review Palestinian compliance with the agreement and decide
whether to carry out the withdrawal from 2 percent of the northern
West Bank.
	   The hard-line Cabinet narrowly approved the agreement one week
ago and is bitterly divided over ceding land to the Palestinians.
At least 18 Jewish settlements will become isolated and surrounded
by Palestinian-controlled territory after the pullback.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel expects
confirmation of:
	   _A Palestinian decree against incitement;
	   _A decree regarding illegal weapons and a plan to be submitted
to the Americans detailing how arms will be collected and stored;
	   _A list of 10 Palestinian fugitives who should be in jail by
Thursday.
	   The cancellation of sections of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction has already been completed by the PLO's
executive committee and verified by Israel, Bar-Illan said.
	   Palestinian TV and radio broadcast a list of laws Wednesday
banning the possession, export, import, transfer, production or
sale of weapons without a license.
	   Violators face prison terms and fines of up to dlrs 4,000. The
decree will be published in Palestinian newspapers Thursday.
	   The rules were issued by Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jibali,
wanted by Israel on suspicion of ordering drive-by shootings on
Israelis. Jibali said people currently carrying unregistered arms
could apply for a license and confiscations would begin Dec. 6.
	   ``This law is to structure the Palestinian society and to
fulfill our commitment in the peace agreement,'' Jibali told The
Associated Press.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas said
Wednesday that the Palestinians had completed everything everything
required thus far in the staged agreement.
	   After meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, he
said he had been assured the withdrawal would be carried out.
	   ``(Israel) informed us that on Friday, the Israelis will begin
the first redeployment from the West Bank and they will release 250
Palestinian prisoners. We have not received anything from them
indicating that they will not,'' carry out the withdrawal.
	   Israel TV predicted the pullback would take place before dawn
Friday.
	   Abbas said thatsecurity officials from both sides were to go
over maps and preparations for the redeployment on Thursday, as
well as complete work for the opening of the Palestinian airport.
	   According to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement signed
by the two sides in Washington last month, Israel is to withdraw
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages in
exchange for Palestinian security and anti-terror measures.
	   Abbas and Sharon resumed talks for a final peace treaty
Wednesday, suspended since May 1996. The negotiations will open
formally with a ceremony next week and will tackle the most
explosive issues of the Israeli-Arab conflict including permanent
borders, refugees, water, Jewish settlements and the status of
Jerusalem, claimed by both sides.

Caroline Kennedy interested in helping United Nations

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Caroline Kennedy met U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday during a visit to explore
the possibility of helping the United Nations.
	   Gillian Sorensen, assistant secretary-general for external
affairs, said the daughter of the late U.S. President John F.
Kennedy wasn't looking for a job.
	   But she is interested in helping or supporting the United
Nations in some way, Sorensen said.
	   ``She has a number of interests that connect to us,'' Sorensen
said. ``We talked some about our human rights effort, about our
refugee work, about our child health efforts through UNICEF, and
about the anti-land mine effort.''
	   Kennedy, a lawyer who has written books on privacy and the first
amendment to the U.S. Constitution, spoke to a few key people in
those areas but had not made any decision on what she might do,
Sorensen said.
	   ``We welcome her interest,'' she said.

Seven injured in clash between rival South Korean monks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seven Buddhist monks were injured
Thursday during a fight pitting rival religious factions against
one another for control of a major temple in central Seoul.
	   The melee began when about 20 monks with shaved heads, armed
with helmets and shields and aided by 100 hired bodyguards, stormed
the five-story, pagoda-shaped headquarters of the Chogye Temple.
	   Fifty rival monks holed up inside the building fought back by
hurling fire extinguishers and furniture and spraying cold water
from hoses to repel the invaders in a half-hour battle.
	   The temple grounds were strewn with smashed window panes and
burnt furniture and garbage. Police said the injured were
hospitalized with minor head and other injuries.
	   The leadership dispute in Chogye, South Korea's largest Buddhist
order, erupted last week when the head monk, Song Wol-ju, announced
his bid for a third four-year term.
	   His opponents, including the order's spiritual leader, Wol Ha,
83, urged him to step down, accusing him of incompetence and
corruption. When he refused, they raided the temple, the
denomination's headquarters, and took control.
	   Thursday's raiders were supporters of Song, who has been trying
in vain to regain control of the temple.
	   Song accused his opponents of trying to block his efforts to
reform the 1,000-year-old order.
	   The election, scheduled for last Thursday, has been postponed.
	   Chogye, which emphasizes zen meditation, claims 8 million
worshipers. South Korea has a population of 44 million.

GUATEMALA: HILLARY -
U-S first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Guatemala on
Wednesday to assess damage from Hurricane Mitch. It seals the end of
a week of high-level international visits lending support to
storm-battered Central America. She met with Guatemalan President
Alvaro Arzu to discuss the impact of Hurricane Mitch on his country.
----
US: UK MISSILE - Britain has become the second nation with Tomahawk
cruise missile capacity, after successfully launching its first live
warhead test. The missile, equipped with a live conventional
warhead, was tested from the H-M-S Splendid in the Pacific Ocean.
Sixty-five of the computer guided missiles - used successfully in
the Gulf War and the Balkans - are being bought by Britain from the
United States military.
----
US: NKOREA - North Korea and the U-S are at odds again over the
suspicions that the secretive totalitarian nation may be proceeding
with a nuclear weapons programme.
The Clinton Administration suspects that an underground building
site is being used for weapons development,  and is insisting on
access to the site for inspectors. North Korea has so far refused
the request.
----
US: OCALAN - The U-S government has supported the arrest of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.  Ocalan was arrested last week by the
Italian government and now faces possible extradition to Turkey.
----
KURDS: WRAP - Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has said Italy
would become an accomplice to terrorism unless it extradited the
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Italy refuted the bitter attack, insisting it will stick to the
letter of the law, and will not be intimidated. Meanwhile, there has
been a spate of protests by Kurds across Europe to demand that Italy
grant political asylum to Ocalan. In Rome, a man set himself on fire
with gasoline outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed
to be held. Clashes between Turkish immigrants and supporters of
Ocalan led to the torching of two houses in Brussels.
----
MEXICO: VOLCANO -
Fears are growing in southern Mexico that the country's most
explosive volcano may be ready to blow. Officials have evacuated
about 175 people from two villages about five miles from the Colima
volcano's crater. The volcano -- which is about 280 miles west of
Mexico City -- erupted in 1991 and again in 1994.
----
BOSNIA: GRAVES - Bosnian commissions for missing persons have found
the remains of six Muslims and Croats, violently killed in May 1992
in the northern Serb-controlled town of Modrica. The exhumation
experts estimate some 60 bodies of non-Serb victims remain in the
Modrica grave. The expect to find more bodies in the next few days.
This was the first time Muslim and Croat commissions were working
together on the exhumation of mass graves.
----
FRANCE: SPY CASE -
A former British spy walked out of a Paris prison on Wednesday a
free man, after a French appeal court rejected a British request for
his extradition. David Shayler faced being charged under Britain's
Official Secrets Acts after he revealed details of intelligence
operations. Among Shayler's claims was an assertion that the British
Government planned to kill Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Japan's trade surplus rises for 19th straight month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout comments from analyst and government official,
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world
rose for a 19th straight month in October, surging 23.9 percent
compared to a year ago, the government said Thursday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a measure of goods which pass
customs, grew to a non-seasonally adjusted 1.37 trillion yen (dlrs
11.33 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus was slightly higher than the 1.32 trillion yen (dlrs
10.93 billion) average forecast of Tokyo-based economists surveyed
by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The growth in the trade surplus was expected to continue in the
coming months, said a Finance Ministry official who declined to be
named.
	   The steady climb in the surplus reflects consumers' reluctance
to spend amid Japan's worst recession in decades. That has cut
demand for imports and made Japanese manufacturers increasingly
reliant on sales overseas.
	   Despite the continued expansion in the trade surplus, the
ministry said exports fell 5.7 percent in October _ the first
year-on-year drop in five months.
	   Analysts said the decline in exports may signal that slower
global growth has started to have a negative impact on Japan.
	   ``This may be a sign that the slowdown in the world economy is
beginning to hold back Japan's exports,'' said Yoshito Sakakibara,
an economist in the Tokyo office of Goldman Sachs.
	   Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States rose 31.9 percent on the year to 719.74 billion yen (dlrs
5.95 billion). It was the 25th consecutive month of increases.
	   The surplus with the European Union soared 41.8 percent to
426.06 billion yen (dlrs 3.52 billion) for a 19th straight month of
gains.
	   Japan has been under heavy pressure from the U.S. and other
trading partners to rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak
economy and spurring demand for imports.
	   Before departing on a trip to Asia, President Bill Clinton said
in Washington on Wednesday that Japan must take decisive steps to
engineer a recovery.
	   Clinton was scheduled to arrive in Tokyo later Thursday and meet
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday.

Dollar higher against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock prices, dollar, bond rates, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Thursday after fresh economic data released overnight
showed a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit. Tokyo stocks
declined.
	   The dollar bought 121.94 yen in early trading, up 0.72 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late level of
121.65 yen overnight in New York.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 71.52 points,
or 0.49 percent, ending the morning session at 14,527.71 points. On
Wednesday, the average closed up 186.23 points, or 1.29 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar was buoyed by the U.S. Commerce
Department's announcement Wednesday that the trade deficit for
September was dlrs 14 billion, down 11.7 percent from a revised
record of dlrs 15.9 billion in August.
	   That led many economists to upgrade their estimates for third
quarter economic growth.
	   But with U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled to arrive in
Japan later in the day to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, market players were wary of heightened pressure from
Washington for Japan to get its economy in order.
	   Comments reflecting U.S. displeasure over Japan's bilateral
trade surplus would likely boost expectations of strong action by
Tokyo to help its economy, pushing up the yen, dealers said.
	   ``People are reluctant to buy the dollar further from here.
There is no doubt that Clinton will call for a recovery in Japan's
economy and warn against Japan's widening trade surplus,'' said
Toru Okuni, vice president and chief dealer in the Tokyo office of
Toronto Dominion Bank.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices dropped as traders took
profits.
	   ``Shares are down slightly because of Wednesday's rise,'' said
Masaaki Higashida, deputy general manager of the investment
information and services department at Nomura Securities Co.
``There isn't any direction to the market.''
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 2.06 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,111.36 at the
end of the morning session. The TOPIX closed up 5.77 points, or
0.52 percent, the day before.
	   Overall trading was thin as many investors stayed on the
sidelines to monitor the government's efforts to form a coalition.
	   Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party reportedly plans to
form a new political alliance with the opposition Liberal Party.
Obuchi was scheduled to meet with Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa
later Thursday.
	   The LDP has a majority in Japan's powerful lower house of
Parliament, but needs some support from opposition members in the
upper house to ensure swift passage of legislation.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.840 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.830
percent, driving its price down to 108.50 yen from 108.59 yen.

U.N. committee expresses concern at human rights in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. committee adopted a resolution
Wednesday expressing concern over Iran's continuing violation of
human rights, including the use of torture, stoning and amputation.
	   The U.N. General Assembly's human rights committee also noted
Iran's discrimination against religious minorities, in particular
``the unabated pattern of persecution'' against the Bahai
community, including executions.
	   The resolution called on the Iranian government to ensure that
capital punishment is only imposed for the most serious crimes, and
also called for religious tolerance.
	   The vote for the resolution was 63-35, with 60 abstentions. The
United States voted for it, and most Middle East countries
abstained or voted against. The resolution, which is not legally
binding, now goes to the full General Assembly for a vote.
	   Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami has talked of
strengthening freedom of expression and creating a ``civil
society.''
	   But Maurice Copithorne, the U.N. special representative on the
situation of human rights in Iran, told the committee earlier this
month there have been worrying signs that conditions were slipping
backward.
	   He said reformers, political dissidents and commentators were
detained under unacceptable circumstances, and in some cases the
individuals have disappeared.
	   The resolution also expressed concern at the arbitrary closure
of some publications and persecution of writers and journalists.

Police call off search for son of former Canadian prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NELSON, British Columbia (AP) _ With bad weather settling in,
police Wednesday called off the search for the body of former Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, Michel, who was swept into
a mountain lake by an avalanche last week.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the search was being
postponed indefinitely and might not resume until spring.
	   Michel's brother, Sacha Trudeau, said the family supported the
police decision and did not want to jeopardize more lives by
continuing the hunt at this time.
	   Michel, 23, is presumed to have drowned after he and a hiking
companion were swept into a lake in the Kootenay Mountains by an
avalanche last Friday.
	   His friend and two others in the group survived but were unable
to save Trudeau as he struggled under the weight of a backpack and
touring skis.
	   A memorial service for Michel was planned for family and friends
in Outremont, Quebec, on Friday.
	   Five police divers had started to search for Trudeau's body on
Tuesday, but concluded that a remote-controlled submersible was the
best way to continue scouring the lake.
	   However, temperatures dropped, and the lake became covered with
ice and snow.

Davenport rallies to get quarterfinal berth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Davenport-Testud match; ADDS Seles quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two days after clinching the year-end No. 1
ranking, Lindsay Davenport almost became a spectator at the
season-ending Chase Championships.
	   Davenport was two points away from defeat when she rallied to
beat Sandrine Testud of France 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 and complete the
opening round of the Chase Championships.
	   Earlier, fifth-seeded Monica Seles overcame an upset stomach and
a stubborn Anna Kournikova of Russia 6-4, 6-3, while No. 6 Mary
Pierce of France crushed South African Amanda Coetzer 6-1, 6-0.
	   Having escaped one French woman, Davenport next will play
another, eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat, in the quarterfinals of
this season-ending tournament.
	   Other quarterfinal pairings will pit Seles against Steffi Graf
in a battle of former No. 1s, Pierce against No. 2 Martina Hingis
of Switzerland, and Belgium's Dominique Van Roost against Irina
Spirlea of Romania in a meeting of unseeded players.
	   ``Winning when you're not playing great. Today was a great
example of that,'' Davenport said.
	   How true.
	   With her right leg heavily bandaged, Testud showed no signs of
the injury that forced her to retire from a first-round match a
week ago in Philadelphia. She seemed to be in the right place at
the right time to return Davenport's shots. And Testud replied with
winners.
	   She captured the first set and led 5-4, 15-30 in the second, two
points from a quarterfinal meeting with her French Fed Cup
teammate. She never made it.
	   Davenport survived. She took the next three points with two
winners and an unreturnable serve. That made it 5-5, and after the
two traded service breaks, they went to the tiebreak.
	   ``It wasn't looking too good in the first two sets,'' Davenport
admitted. ``My game was pretty bad.''
	   Testud had one last hurrah, building a 3-1 lead in the tiebreak.
	   Then Davenport found the game that has taken her to No. 1 in the
world.
	   ``The whole match just turned after the tiebreaker,'' she said.
	   Seles began her match as if she was double-parked on Eighth
Avenue outside Madison Square Garden. Kournikova's only point in
the first three games came when the left-hander from Sarasota,
Fla., double-faulted.
	   But after that, Seles, a former top-ranked player who is in the
midst of a comeback, was locked in a fault-filled contest that
neither player seemed able to win. It was an error appropriately _
a backhand service return that sailed long _ that ended the match
as Seles held serve. In between, there were 10 breaks of service in
the 19 games.
	   ``I was lucky to pull it out tonight,'' said Seles, who has been
ill since Sunday afternoon. ``I wasn't sure how I am going to play.
I just said, give it my best shot.''
	   Kournikova never was able to get her game together as she
continually double-faulted _ 17 in all, including five in one game.
	   Still, she hit enough winners to reveal the talent she does
have. Her groundstrokes were more crisp than those of Seles, and
they frequently left Seles just standing on one side of the court,
watching a winner sail past.
	   The 17-year-old Russian, making her Championships debut, also
exploited Seles' lack of mobility, winning several points with drop
shots.
	   But the veteran Seles, a three-time winner here in the Garden,
won the points that counted. Now she has a date with Graf, who
advanced into the quarterfinals on Tuesday by beating third-seeded
Jana Novotna 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1.
	   In her match, Pierce was overpowering in every aspect of the
game.
	   Coetzer, at 5-foot-2 one of the smallest players on the Corel
WTA Tour, relies on quickness, speed and grit to overcome her lack
of height. Against Pierce, none of those worked.
	   Pierce had the firepower from all sides, unloading huge
groundstrokes and hitting winners all over the court. She took
charge at the start and never gave Coetzer a chance. Pierce won the
opening four games while losing only nine points.
	   Coetzer then rallied from a 15-40 deficit to break Pierce, the
only game she won. In the entire match, Coetzer won only 26 points.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   The top eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's
blue carpet. The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.
	   The top-seeded team of Hingis and Jana Novotna were upset
Wednesday by Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia and Caroline Vis of the
Netherlands 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. Hingis and Novotna had won the doubles
in three of the four Grand Slam tournaments this year, the only
three in which they played together.

Brazil beat Russia 5-1 in friendly soccer match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORTALEZA, Brazil (AP) _ Rediscovering its form, Brazil put in
its best performance under new manager Wanderley Luxemburgo to
overpower Russia 5-1 in a friendly match here Wednesday.
	   In Ronaldo's continued absence through injury, Elber and
Amoroso, who scored twice, formed a formidable striking
partnership, assisted by Denilson and Rivaldo in midfield.
	   In truth, the victory came against a Russian side missing six
Spartak Moscow players not released by the club. The Russians also
had little time to adapt to the switch from freezing conditions to
a humid northern Brazilian night.
	   But this game saw some flair and fluency, missing since Brazil's
World Cup final defeat againt France in July, return.
	   There was one hitch. Just as both countries' national anthems
ended, the stadium was plunged into darkness for 25 minutes after
two buses crashed nearby and cut powerlines.
	   But within moments of the lights coming on and this friendly
match starting, Brazil turned it on too.
	   After three minutes, Brazil scored slickly. Amoroso streaked
down the right and crossed. Denilson dummied and Elber struck into
the net.
	   An aerial battle 15 minutes on between Amoroso and Yevgueny
Varlamov caused the ball to bounce of the defender's arm to make it
2-0. The Brazilian claimed the goal.
	   Just before half-time, Rivaldo added a third when he was brought
down by goalaie Novossadov and converted the penalty.
	   Goalie Novassadvo compounded Russia's misery by blundering a
straightforward free-kick by Assuncao after 60 minutes to leave the
score 4-0.
	   Striker Kournakov hit a consolation penalty six minutes later
after Serginho pulled at a Russian player to stop him advancing on
goal.
	   But Amoroso powered a 20 yard shot into the net on 70 minutes to
stop Russia making more than a marginal impression.
	   Line-ups:
	   Brazil: Rogerio (Emerson), Cafu (Assuncao), Cesar, Antonio
Carlos, Serginho, Vampeta, Flavio Conceicao, Rivaldo, Denilson
(Jackson), Amoroso, Elber.
	   Russia: Novossadov, Nekmor, Varlamov, Igonian, Mamedov, Smertin
(Kondrachov), Kormitzev, Solomatim (Kormakov), Semak, Esspiov
(Panov) and Kornaukov.

Smaller crowds gather in Thailand for last-gasp meteor show

	   DOI SUTHEP, Thailand (AP) _ Hundreds of die-hard star-gazers in
Thailand suffered another night of disappointment when cloud cover
and poor weather blocked their view of what had been billed as the
most spectacular celestial fireworks in 33 years.
	   Gathered atop this mountain at its historic Buddhist temple or
enjoying tailgate parties in pickups parked along the winding
approach, many of the Thai and foreign visitors scanned the skies
for the famed Leonids meteors for a third night in a row.
	   They expected Wednesday night and early Thursday morning to be
the last good chance to see the meteors before the end of the peak
viewing period predicted by astronomers.
	   But once again, Mother Nature interfered.
	   After a spectacular sunset, clouds shifted over Doi Suthep and
nearby Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest peak, and cast an opaque
pall over the northern Thai skies. Shortly after midnight (1700 GMT
Wednesday), however, streaking meteors became visible.
	   For about two hours, the meteors traced white streaks across the
inky skies. Spectators, many of them curled on straw mats under
warm blankets to keep off the chill, pointed skywards as new ones
appeared every 20 minutes or so.
	   The overall verdict appeared to be that the show was more
satisfying than on Tuesday night _ when as many as 10,000 people
flocked to the peaks and were dismayed by thick clouds _ but still
not as spectacular as they had hoped.
	   ``Hardly anything happened yesterday,'' said Rachata Pitak, 26.
``The authorities and the media had played up the event too much,
resulting in major disappointment for many people.''
	   Wichai Thepquanyern, 18, made a few wishes on falling stars,
asking for health and longevity.
	   ``I don't think the wish will necessary come true,'' Wichai
said. ``But it's better to be safe than sorry.''
	   Unlike Tuesday night, authorities in the nearby city of Chiang
Mai did not turn off city lights to make a better view for the
star-gazers and there was no major police presence to direct
traffic up the slopes.
	   The meteor craze appeared to have burned out in other Asian
cities, too, where big crowds had turned out Tuesday night but were
disappointed by bad weather.
	   The Leonids meteors, so named because they were thought to
originate in the constellation Leo, are actually the long,
streaking tail of the Tempel-Tuttle Comet. The meteoroids forming
it are particles, some no larger than a grain of sand, shed by the
comet.
	   They appear over Earth every year, usually in November, but only
come close enough to be seen by amateur star-gazers every 33 years.

India's state elections a test of governing right-wing party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos expected &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian politicians are shedding tears
over skyrocketing onion prices with state elections just a week
away, and the voting is widely seen as a referendum on the
popularity of the federal governing coalition that has been in
power less than a year.
	   Though the elections won't directly affect Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee, they could result in a political realignment in
the world's most populous democracy.
	   The run-up to Wednesday's elections for four state assemblies
have been dominated by one issue: high food prices. Devastating
floods that destroyed crops have pushed prices of onions _ a key
ingredient in savory Indian dishes _ and other staples to all-time
highs across India.
	   Few people believe politicians when they say they will bring
down food prices if voted to power. Produce from farms pass through
a complex network of brokers and consumers end up paying four to
five times what the farmer gets. Successive governments have tried
to reform the system in vain.
	   Newspapers are speculating that the Bharatiya Janata Party now
in power in the capital city of New Delhi and in Rajasthan state,
could lose to the Congress Party in local elections in those two
areas over food prices. The Congress, which is in power in the
populous central state of Madhya Pradesh, is riddled with reports
of corruption and is widely expected to lose to the BJP there. In
the tiny northeastern state of Manipur, regional groups are vying
over mostly local issues.
	   A defeat in prestigious New Delhi, which is governed as its own
state, could prompt the many regional parties in Vajpayee's
governing coalition to rethink their support for the BJP. Several
of Vajpayee's partners repeatedly threaten to pull out of the
government, bringing it down.
	   ``On the other hand, a defeat for the Congress could also
trigger debate within the party over Sonia Gandhi's leadership,''
said Shekhar Iyer, political columnist of the mass-circulation
Hindustan Times newspaper.
	   The Italian-born widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
took over the party for the February-March national elections.
Although she was unable to lead Congress to victory, she was able
to halt the growing popularity of the BJP.
	   Party workers critical of Mrs. Gandhi could step up a campaign
against her leadership if Congress fares badly this time, Iyer
said.
	   All the parties are fighting high voter apathy, as evidenced by
slow sales of party flags, stickers and posters.
	   ``People are fed up with frequent elections,'' said political
analyst R. Rajagopalan _ India held general elections twice in as
many years. ``Successive governments have failed to live up to
their promises.''
	   In addition to voter disinterest, the campaign has lacked much
of its traditional flare because India's independent Election
Commission has limited candidates to spending just 500,000 rupees
(dlrs 11,765) each candidate. In the past, richer candidates had
spent many times that on posters, trucks equipped with sound
systems blaring taped promises, and other tactics.

South Korean cruise ship docks in North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) _ A cruise ship docked in this North
Korean port Thursday carrying 780 South Korean tourists, the first
southern sightseers to set foot in the communist country since
1950.
	   The visitors filed off the ship into a low shed for processing
by customs and immigration officials, the only North Koreans they
are likely to see during their four-night, five-day stay.
	   Most of the tourists _ the first to go to the North since the
outbreak of the Korean War nearly five decades ago _ have relatives
in the secretive, impoverished Marxist state.
	   No family reunions, however, will be permitted during this or
subsequent weekly tours.
	   Changjon is the gateway to Diamond Mountain, a remote expanse of
high crags and deep, narrow valleys that is being developed by a
South Korean conglomerate in a joint venture with the North.
	   ``The tour has begun without any problems,'' said Bae Han-il, a
spokesman for the sponsoring Hyundai group in Seoul. ``It's a
little cold there, but otherwise it's perfect weather. No North
Korean civilians were allowed near the port.''
	   Hyundai plans to build a hotel, golf course, restaurants and
other facilities at Diamond Mountain over the next several years,
but for now there is almost nothing. The tourists will sleep on the
ship each night.
	   Accompanying the tour group were 200 South Korean reporters,
photographers and TV camera operators, not all of whom were
welcomed by North Korea.
	   Shortly before the ship departed South Korea's Donghae port
Wednesday evening in a burst of fireworks, North Korea announced it
would not grant entry to representatives of state-owned KBS-TV or
the conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper.
	   KBS angered North Korea by secretly obtaining video footage of
the mountain during a test run by the cruise ship last weekend. It
has long been angered by Chosun Ilbo's editorial policy, which it
sees as vehemently anti-North Korea.
	   Most of the tourists are natives of North Korea who were
separated from their families by the war, a fate shared by 10
million people on both sides of the closed border.
	   Many said they were fulfilling long-held dreams to simply stand
once again on their native soil.

Race-based election winner challenged because she is ``British''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The only candidate from right-wing
populist Pauline Hanson's One Nation party to win a seat in last
month's election is facing a court challenge that could prevent her
from entering parliament.
	   Heather Hill narrowly defeated the National Party's Bill O'Chee
for a Queensland Senate seat, but O'Chee is planning to challenge
Hill's victory in court.
	   O'Chee claims Hill, who became an Australian citizen in May, was
not eligible to enter parliament because she had not renounced her
British nationality.
	   If true, Hill would not be eligible under the Australian
constitution to take a seat in parliament. But Hill, who has been
in Australia for 26 years, said she was on safe legal grounds.
	   ``Basically what they say is that I have to take reasonable
steps to ensure that I have removed my British national linkages,''
she said. ``I believe I have done that.''
	   O'Chee said he is not convinced.
	   ``This is an example of One Nation lying to the electorate,''
O'Chee said in a radio interview.
	   Hanson, who was defeated in the October election, said Hill
should take her seat.
	   ``As far as I am concerned, the people of Queensland voted
Heather Hill to be their senate representative,'' Hanson said.
	   And she said the status of all Australian legislators should be
checked, if Hill is ruled ineligible to take her seat.
	   The court case is likely to take several months.

Uniquely Asian sports to shine at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BK101,102
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Crowds at the Asian Games will no doubt
flock to track and field events and boxing, but aficionados of
uniquely Asian sports will be equally passionate for lesser-known
but entertaining competitions like sepak takraw and kabaddi.
	   The quick and acrobatic play of sepak takraw, a sport almost
unknown outside Southeast Asia, is expected to draw a packed
stadium when host Thailand goes up against its rival, Malaysia.
	   Resembling a cross between volleyball and soccer played on a
badminton court, sepak takraw players must volley a rattan ball
over a net without using their hands.
	   Despite the physical limitation, the sport is filled with
graceful teamwork and players execute impressive spikes by reverse
kicking the ball over their shoulders.
	   Takraw has developed a reputation in Thailand as ``the pedicab
drivers' sport'' _ though such conveyances are few these days _
because the inexpensive rattan ball is the only equipment needed
for a friendly game of circle takraw.
	   Both Thailand and Malaysia claim to be the first country to
invent takraw. Although it is played by most of the 10 Southeast
Asian nations competing at the games next month, international
tournaments invariably boil down to a match between the Thais and
their southern neighbors.
	   ``Since 1965, when takraw was first played at the Southeast
Asian Games, the two teams have been arch rivals. No other team can
break this combination in the final round,'' said Sujin
Kaewswarang, a coach of Thailand's takraw team.
	   Malaysia has triumphed over Thailand and claimed gold twice
since sepak takraw was introduced into the Asian Games in 1990, but
the Thais hope to turn the tables on their home turf.
	   Sepak takraw could be on its way to worldwide competition with
the formation in recent years of both men's and women's teams in
the United States, but Sujin said efforts to spread the sport to
Japan and South Korea have not met much success.
	   As host of the Asian Games, which open Dec. 6, Thailand has
fielded one of the largest teams at 808 athletes, on par with
regional giant China, which is expected to send about 800.
	   Besides taking the opportunity to introduce circle takraw to the
games for the first time and boost its local favorite status _
there will be team and individual takraw for men and women _
Thailand is delving into less familiar sports like kabaddi.
	   A sort of team tag, kabaddi has a limited following outside
South Asia, but matches between India and rival Pakistan have been
known to draw emotional reactions akin to war among players and
spectators.
	   India took the gold medal at the last Asian Games in 1994 in
Hiroshima, besting Pakistan and Nepal.
	   One of the game's more colorful aspects is a rule that when a
player is in the opponents' zone, he has to hop continuously on one
leg while chanting ``kabaddi.''
	   Thailand formed its first kabaddi team six months ago out of
castoffs from other national teams and recruits from the Thai
navy's frogman unit, the president of Thailand's new kabaddi
association said.
	   The frogmen were selected because of their lung strength, which
president Verapoj Phummaphuti said would be advantageous for the
exhausting kabaddi chants.
	   The fledgling team had to make trips to Sri Lanka and India to
familiarize itself with the sport. But kabaddi is not completely
unknown in Thailand, where a version called ``ding chiap'' is
played in elementary school playgrounds.
	   ``People would laugh if I told them I was president of a ding
chiap team, but they don't understand how difficult this sport can
be,'' Verapoj said.
	   Asian martial arts judo, karate-do, taekwon-do and wushu _ a
type of kung fu with a stave _ will also be represented. Muay Thai,
the national form of kick-boxing, will be a demonstration sport.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Jan Bulis scored his first two goals of the
season and assisted on another, leading the Washington Capitals to
a 4-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday night.
	   Bulis had missed Washington's first 13 games with an ankle
injury, and this was only his third game and the first multi-goal
effort of his career. The three points also were a career high.
	   He assisted Richard Zednik on the Capitals' first goal and
scored the next two to complete Washington's three-goal second
period. Zednik, who had one goal and one assist, was returning
after missing the last 10 games with a bruised shoulder.
	   The victory ended Washington's seven-game home winless streak.
The Capitals, who now have won two straight for the first time this
season, went 0-5-2 after winning their home opener.

Suharto's ranch could be taken over for the state: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government is investigating
whether it can seize a cattle ranch owned by ex-President Suharto,
now the subject an official corruption inquiry, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Local villagers are claiming ownership of the 750-hectare
(1,850-acre) ranch in Bogor, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south
of Jakarta, saying they farmed the area for generations before
Suharto forced them out in the 1970s.
	   Several protests have been staged there. The ranch is considered
one of the finest in Indonesia.
	   Republika quoted Barman Zahir, a spokesman for the Attorney
General's office, as saying the title of the land was still held by
the state and could therefore be taken back by the state.
	   He said investigators were now looking at how Suharto took over
land.
	   Many Indonesians believe that during his 32-year autocratic
rule, Suharto and his children amassed riches through government
contracts and siphoned off wealth from projects and state-owned
corporations.
	   Suharto was forced to quit in May amid riots and protests. His
successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised investigations of
Suharto's business dealings.
	   Recently investigators have found that Suharto and his family
own huge tracts of land in several parts of Indonesia, particularly
on the island of Sumatra and Irian Jaya, the western half of New
Guinea.

 &UR; 20th Century Fox pulls out of Thailand for ``King and I'' remake

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Frustrated by official disapproval of
its script, 20th Century Fox announced Thursday it is dropping
plans to shoot a new version of ``Anna and the King'' on location
in Thailand.
	   Fox said in a statement that shooting for the remake of the
classic films ``Anna and the King of Siam'' and the ``The King and
I'' will be instead shifted to neighboring Malaysia.

BANGKOK: neighboring Malaysia.

	   The Thai Film Board has twice turned down scripts for the
proposed film, saying that they were disrespectful of the 19th
Century ruler King Mongkut and the monarchy of Siam, as Thailand
was then known.
	   The remake stars Oscar-winner Jodie Foster in the role of Anna
Leonowens, the Victorian governess Mongkut hired to teach his
children English, and Hong Kong action star Chow Yun Fat as the
king.
	   Fox's statement expressed regret over ``excessive bureaucracy
and political red-tape. This decision to move production was not
made with any disrespect or outrage.''
	   ``The simple truth is that time has run out,'' Fox said. ``In an
effort to avoid costly delays that could undermine the entire
project, the studio has exercised its ability to change
locations.''
	   Thais highly revere their monarchy and feel previous versions of
the story, based on Leonowens' disputed memoirs, portray Mongkut as
a brutal buffoon rather than the linguist and Buddhist scholar he
was.
	   Insulting the king is a crime _ though seldom punished _ that
carries a jail term of three to 15 years.
