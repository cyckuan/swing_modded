years since World War II."
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has called for a diplomatic and negotiated settlement of
the crisis as the military action has not achieved desired
results," said Godana.

ABUJA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Union of Journalists

attack of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, which
killed three Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here Tuesday, Secretary-General

people of China and calls on the United Nations Security Council
to condemn the NATO action in strong terms and hold NATO members
responsible for this tragedy."

The people throughout the world must put the responsibility for
"such brute use of force" on the door-steps of the United States
and its European Surrogates, Khalid stressed.

China and indeed its friends around the world must demand
proper explanation over the incident, he said, pointing out that
NATO had offered "very vague explanation" to the circumstances
leading to this dastardly act.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti FM Sees Better Kuwaiti-Yemeni Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti senior official said
Tuesday that that the upcoming visit by Yemeni Foreign Minister
Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal will help restore bilateral ties affected by
Sanaa's sympathy with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah expressed hope
that current diplomatic efforts will result in lifting the
bilateral relations to the previous level.
</P>
<P>
The ties "are set to be improved," stressed Sabah, who is also
First Deputy Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Yemen soured after Sanaa had
allegedly opposed the idea of forming an international coalition
to free Kuwait from Iraq's occupation after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The ice began to thaw after Kuwait expressed in May 1997 its
willingness "to improve ties with all Arab countries except Iraq."
</P>
<P>
A high-level Yemeni delegation led by Yemen's Foreign
Undersecretary Ahmad Al-Said arrived here last Saturday to
prepare for Ba-Jammal's visit, which is due to start next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah reaffirmed his welcome to Ba-Jammal's visit and wished him
a good stay.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Ba-Jammal is expected to meet with
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and convey him a message from
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on means of boosting bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with Sabah as well as Kuwaiti Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah on a number of
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal will also inaugurate the reopening of the Yemeni
Embassy in Kuwait, which will mark the normalization of relations
between the two countries.

<P>
BONN, May 11 (Xinhua)--Hundreds of Chinese students on Tuesday
held demonstrations in Bonn, Berlin and Munich, protesting the
rocket attack by U.S.-led NATO on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, some 200 students rallied on Monday afternoon before
the U.S. Embassy. They held Chinese national flags, the photos of
the three Chinese journalists who had been killed in the attack,
and slogans reading "U.S. Murderer", "NATO Goes Out", "No War",
and "We Need Peace".
</P>
<P>
A statue of an ancient Chinese man in white robe was held by
the students to express their condolences to the victims in the
strike and to denounce the NATO.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators sang Chinese national anthem, The
Internationale, and yelled, "punish the murderer!", " Chinese
people are not to be bullied!", and " Americans must apologize!".
</P>
<P>
More than 30 German policemen were deployed around the Embassy
to maintain order. The demonstrators, organized by Chinese student
associations, held the rally peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The students argued angrily with a U.S. diplomat who came out
to receive their protest letter, accusing the U.S. bombing was a
deliberate violation to Chinese sovereignty, the human rights and
the international laws.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that, we apologize for that, " said the diplomat.
But he still claimed the bombing "a mistake, a tragic mistake".
</P>
<P>
"...I thank you for your peaceful demonstration," he said,
promising he would transfer the protest letter to his government.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration lasted for more than two hours until evening.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, some 200 Chinese students rallied at one of the most
famous street of the city, Unter den Linden Street, singing
Chinese national anthem and calling out anti-NATO slogans.
</P>

And in the Bavarian capital of Munich, more than 150 Chinese
people held anti-NATO, anti-war demonstration, too.

solicit Angolan government's opinion on UN sanction on the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>

UN has imposed three sanctions on UNITA, banning among others,
the trade of oil, diamond and arms by UNITA, the trip abroad by
UNITA leaders and the activities of UNITA in foreign countries.

But for some time, Angolan government has repeatedly said that
Zambia, Rwanda, Togo and Burkina Faso are still offering arms and
logistics to UNITA and Angola's Ambassador to France disclosed

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Currency to Stabilize Soon: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The falling Ugandan shilling will
stabilize soon with advent of the bump coffee season, a Ugandan
minister said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development Gerald
Ssendaula blamed the quick depreciation of shilling to the decline
in exports of coffee, fish ban and decrease in tourist arrivals in
Uganda due to the insurgency in the country.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged non-traditional exports. The country cannot rely
solely on the traditional exports of coffee, fish, cotton, flowers
and fruits, Radio Uganda quoted Ssendaula as saying.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector, viewed as the engine of the economy, will
be strengthened to improve supervision of the commercial banks, he
added.
</P>
<P>
During the period between July 1998 to April 1999, the exchange
rate between Ugandan shilling and U.S. dollar fell by 18.9 percent
from a mid- rate of 1,232 shillings per dollar to 1,520 per
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank of the east African country has injected more
than 25 million dollars into the money market in April this year
to calm the market.
</P>
<P>
Economists here predicted that the coming coffee season would
somehow reduce the falling speed of nose-diving shilling, but it
is not enough to reverse the falling trend.

KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda-based Chinese companies

The United States, which has claimed to be the human rights
champion throughout the world, turns out to be the very country to
trample the basic human rights, the representatives of the

the NATO forces should take all the serious consequences of this
inhumane attack against Chinese diplomats," said Zhao Shijie,

as a "tragic mistake" as U.S. President Bill Clinton said.

Jinja, 80 kilometers east of capital Kampala, said that NATO's

UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday condemned the fighting in Guinea-Bissau and the
killing of innocent civilians in the West African country, a U.N.
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has continued to follow with grave
concern developments in Guinea-Bissau since fighting resumed there
on May 6," said the statement, issued here by the U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Against the background of reports that President Joao Bernardo
Vieira has been removed from office as a result of fighting, the
Secretary-General firmly condemns any measure that seeks to
transfer power by unconstitutional means tantamounts to a coup
d'etat," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General also condemns the killing of innocent
civilians during the recent fighting as well as attacks on
foreign nationals and diplomatic installations," the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General reaffirms his strong disappointment that
the pledge made by the parties to the conflict in Guinea-Bissau
never again to resort to arms to settle their differences was
broken by the latest fighting," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This regrettable turn of events in Guinea-Bissau has further
complicated an already difficult situation, as the country was
only recently and gradually moving, with the support of the
international community, towards a peaceful transition, within the
framework of the Abuja Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of these developments, the Secretary-General is
reviewing the options available to the United Nations with
regard to the peace process in Guinea-Bissau," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Guinea-Bissau military rebels and political party leaders
Tuesday named the head of parliament as interim president to lead
the country to fresh elections, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Malan Vacai Sanha will be formally ratified
by the National Assembly at a special session on Wednesday. The
decision follows the ousting of President Vieira, whose 19-year
rule ended on Friday last week with the surrender of his loyalist
forces.

</P>
<P>
The minister said this at the official opening of a four-day

While research on technologies for the utilization of vertsols
was a costly measure, he said, it was essential that it remained a

<P>
Vertsols cover more than 100 million hectares in Africa. The
largest vertsols are in Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Vertsols are potentially productive, but have not been
cultivated in some countries because of the cultivation problems,
especially in relation to managing drought or water logging.

The workshop aimed at identifying needs and opportunities for
further research to enhance adequate utilization of vertsols was

DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and Mozambican President Joachim Chissano, will pay a
brief visit to Tanzania on Wednesday for further consultations
with President Benjamin Mkapa on the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), a foreign ministry statement said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba will leave later in the afternoon after the
talks while the Mozambican leader will stay overnight and leave on
Thursday, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vice-President of Rwanda and Minister of
Defense, Major General Paul Kagame, is in Arusha in north Tanzania
for consultations with Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere.
But the statement did not give other details.
</P>
<P>
Last week, leaders of Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania met in the
Dodoma town in central Tanzania and issued a joint communique
calling for an immediate ceasefire in the war-torn DRC where
rebels have been fighting to topple the government of Laurent
Kabila since last August.
</P>
<P>
The war has dragged in Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia
fighting on the side of President Kabila and Uganda and Rwanda
allegedly backing rebels.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Chad announced last month that they will stop
fighting, while other key players in the war have yet agreed to a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which has remained neutral in the DRC conflict, has
been urged by other African countries to take a more active role
in brokering peace.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Condemn Nato's Attack on Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Association for
Friendship With Foreign Countries issued a statement Tuesday,
saying that the U.S.-led Nato attack on Chinese embassy to
Yugoslavia is "savage and extremely resentful".
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the attack, which killed three and
injured more than 20 others, shows once again that Nato is
following a contemptible strategy of expansion and domination in
Yugoslavia and Nato shows no respect to the independence,
democracy, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The association, together with the Sino-Mozambican Friendship
Committee, strongly condemned the savage action by Nato, and
extend condolences to the Chinese people and the relatives of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
It said that Nato's attack on Chinese embassy is a deliberate
provocation and it should bear all the personnel and material
losses of the attack.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Nato stop pulling other countries into the
conflict in Kosovo, the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese army intelligence has
smashed a sabotage group aimed at conducting massive attacks on
Syrians in Lebanon, the official National News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dani Habib and his brother Dani Dafid, who headed the group,
were arrested on May 6 after they threw hand grenades toward
Syrian workers in a parking lot in northern Beirut in
collaboration with four other Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
But, the attack didn't cause any casualties, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
During the interrogation, Habib had admitted that he and
another suspect also threw a hand grenade near a Syrian army
position in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They have been transferred to judicial department for further
questioning and investigation, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 Syrian troops are deployed in Lebanon as
peacekeepers to maintain stability after the country's 1975-1990
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an estimated one million Syrian workers are also
working in Lebanon, a country with only a population of 3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a brotherhood relationship treaty in
1991, stressing the highest level of cooperation in politics,
economy and military.
</P>
<P>
But some Lebanese are against Syrian military presense in the
country and have called on Syrian troops to withdraw from their
country along with Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Social Security, Protection Called for in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's social fabric must be
protected from consumerism, abuse of modern technologies, crime
and drug trafficking, the country's first lady Suzanne Mubarak
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Those ailments are part of the dark side of the economic
development, Mrs. Mubarak told the opening session of a one-day
meeting of social science and development. The meeting was aimed
at balancing Egypt's social development with economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been pushing to change its state-owned economy to an
open-market one since 1991 when the country launched its economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mubarak warned that Egypt will not maintain the economic
gains without social development, the country's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has "decided to focus its attention on social development
for its own merit, as well as to sustain and reinforce the
economic reform process," she said.
</P>
<P>
As the case in many developing countries, Egypt's economic
transition has left the country's social safety nets weakened.
</P>
<P>
The result is that groups like the handicapped or senior
citizens are left untended, other speakers at the gathering said.
</P>
<P>
This can be aggravated by such technologies as television or
satellite dishes which beam violence into Egyptian homes and
glorify easy sex or drug use, the speakers said.
</P>
<P>
The experts in social development discussed reconciling
international values with local traditions, and focusing on
development that would address people's needs instead of only
macroeconomic concerns.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on social development is to be held later
this year, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> 2 More Iraqis killed in U.S. Warplanes Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Two more Iraqis were killed and
seven others injured on Tuesday in U.S. and British warplanes
attacks on three guard points in the southern Iraqi province of
Basra, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 9:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) 16 formations
of enemy planes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated
southern Iraqi airspace over Thi-Qar, Basra, Muthana and Misan
provinces
</P>
<P>
These enemy warplanes bombed three guard points in Basra
province that are responsible for the security of transporting
provisions imported under the oil-for-food program, leaving two
people working at the guard points dead and seven others
injured, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He did not say whether the dead are civilians or not.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
and forced the enemy planes to flee at 11:05 (0705 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Nine formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from
Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva,
Dohuk and Erbil provinces at 10:00 (0600 GMT), said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the enemy planes bombed civilian facilities in
Neineva province, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units repelled
them at 13:25 (0925 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since last December's U.S. and British
bombardment of Iraq, their warplanes coming from Saudi, Kuwaiti
bases in the south and Turkish base in the north have made 6,105
sorties over Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets, leading to severe
civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, over a dozen civilians were killed and more
were injured in U.S. and British bombardment of civilian
facilities in the two no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.

compulsory education outline, which is meant to test students'
practical skills and originality. Physical education will make up
five percent of the test score for the high school entrance exam.

<HEADLINE> US-led NATO Bombing Against Yugoslavia Casts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States-led NATO
bombardment against Yugoslavia is among a series of development
which has cast a deep shadow over the work of the Conference on
Disarmament (CD), said Chinese Ambassador Li Changhe here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening meeting of the second part of the CD's
1999 session, Li said that NATO began its aerial bombardment of
the sovereign state of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)
three days before the end of the first part of the 1999 session.
</P>
<P>
NATO's indiscriminate bombing in the past 48 days have caused
large-scale civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of
refugees fleeing their homes, Li said, adding that this is the
biggest humanitarian disaster since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
In a latest development, Li said, NATO attacked the Chinese
embassy in the FRY last weekend by missiles, killing three people
and wounding more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia is an
extremely grave event," Li pointed out. "The US-led NATO must make
convincing clarifications and explanations for this and bear all
political, legal and financial responsibilities arising
therefrom."
</P>
<P>
Another shadow-casting development is that a certain country
announced its plan to speed up work on the "National Missile
Defense (NMD)" and "Theater Missile Defense (TMD)" and demanded to
revise the "Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM)", according to Li.
</P>
<P>
"This decision will have profound negative influence on the
global and regional strategic balance and stability, and trigger a
new round of arms race to the detriment of international
disarmament process," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li told the meeting that the Chinese government and its people
uphold justice, love peace and are ready to develop mutually
beneficial and friendly cooperative relationship with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, we will not tolerate any bullying and aggression,
neither do we fear any threat and pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
On March 26, the last day of the first part of this year's CD
session, Li recalled, Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivered an
important speech at the plenary.
</P>
<P>
As what President Jiang has pointed out, the Cold War mentality
still lingers on and that hegemonism and power politics manifest
themselves from time to time. The tendency towards closer military
alliance is on the rise. And new forms of "gunboat policy" are
rampant.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has thus called for the cultivation of a new security
concept that meets the need of the times and calls for vigorous
efforts to explore new ways to safeguard peace and security.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The goal of human resources
development (HRD) in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum is to promote the well-being of all the people in the region
through economic growth, a Hong Kong government official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph W P Wong, secretary for Education and Manpower, told the
opening ceremony of the 20th APEC Human Resources Development
Working Group Meeting here that the goal must be achieved by
planning, developing and implementing education and training
programs for managers, entrepreneurs and workers, in both the
public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wong noted that APEC Economic Leaders in Malaysia last year
stressed the importance of HRD in realizing the efforts for
sustained growth in the economies of the Asia Pacific region into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
"HRD must continue to be a high priority issue for us all.
Indeed, the Asian crisis has helped us focus on the importance of
HRD in this knowledge-based community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Working Group meeting is making preparations for the 3rd
APEC HRD Ministerial Meeting to be held in July this year. The
theme of the 3rd Ministerial Meeting is HRD Challenges and
Opportunities in the New Millennium: Address the Impacts of the
Regional Financial Crisis.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily: NATO, Serious Threat to World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a commentary entitled "Serious Threat to World Peace" to be
published Wednesday, the paper pointed out that the lunatic U.S.-
led NATO strikes against the Chinese Embassy have shocked the
whole world and ignited wide-spread condemnation and indignation
among the world people.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying, "The U.S.-led
NATO must bear full responsibility for the atrocity, or the
Chinese people will not leave the matter at that," the paper
pointed out that any prevarication such as "mistaken bombing" or "
accident" can never be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Development and peace have become the irresistible trend of the
world since the end of the cold war. As a cold-war-time military
organization, NATO, manipulated by the U.S., did not disband with
the end of the cold war, but kept growing larger to the contrary
of the expectation of the world people, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
According to its so-called "new strategic concept" made public
late April, NATO has developed from a defensive organization to an
offensive military and political one, which can extend its
military actions to areas beyond the north Atlantic and wage war
against any country without authorization from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this is a new strategic concept of hegemonism
inflated, and NATO's military attack against Yugoslavia bypassing
the United Nations is a practice of this concept, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper added the U.S.-led NATO military strike against
Yugoslavia is a downright gunboat policy. In history, the Western
powers ran wild by relying on advanced cannons and boats. Today,
the U.S.-led NATO uses high-tech weapons to wantonly bomb a small
nation and even wantonly raided the embassy of a permanent member
of the U.N. Security Council in flagrant defiance of the U.N.
Charter and basic principles governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
Such new gunboat policy is more fierce and more dangerous, and
poses greater threat to world peace, the paper warned, calling on
all the peace-loving people in the world and responsible
politicians of various countries to be highly vigilant against
this dangerous tendency of U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that major powers bear unshirkable
responsibilities for safeguarding world peace and security. In
their telephone conversation on May 10, President Jiang Zemin and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed that, as Security Council
permanent members and countries with vital influence in the world,
China and Russia bear strong responsibilities for maintaining
justice and defending peace. They noted that China and Russia have
cooperated well on the Kosovo and other important international
issues and will continue to keep in close contact to make their
efforts for the maintaining of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The paper finally urged all the peace-loving countries to work
together to immediately halt the extremely barbaric military
actions against Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO in defense of
world peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh' opposition alliance
staged an eight-hour hartal (strike) across the country on
Tuesday, which ended with sporadic incidents leaving about 30
people injured in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, observed the shutdown from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. to protest the
government's failure in resolving the current power and water
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The national BSS news agency quoted eyewitnesses as saying that
police used baton and tear gas to disperse the bomb-throwing
pro-hartal activists in several places including Bijoynagar,
central Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
In Bijoynagar area, activists clashed with police who
obstructed them from proceeding toward Topkhana road, by which the
government secretariat is located.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people were injured in Dhaka, including two opposition
members of parliament, a dozen photographers and five policemen.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested at least 25 people from different parts of the
city for alleged involvement in violent activities during the
hartal hours, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka Awami League and the ruling party's front organizations,
meanwhile, brought out anti-hartal processions in the capital,
with State Minister for Shipping Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury
leading the Awami League procession.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hartal, life was mostly normal throughout the
country, as the government, financial institutions and other
semi-government and private offices functioned as usual, according
to the BSS.
</P>
<P>
But shops and business establishments adjacent to the main
roads were largely closed during the hartal, the fifth nationwide
strike sponsored by the opposition alliance this year.

<P>
YANGON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar said Tuesday that NATO's air
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday violated the
United Nations Charter and the basic norms of international law,
and urged a peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar deeply deplores this grave incident which is
tantamount to violation of the U.N. Charter and the basic norms of
the international law, and undermines the fundamental principles
of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations governing
inter-state relations," said a Foreign Ministry press release
issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government and the people of Myanmar were greatly shocked
and distressed to learn the news of the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy by NATO forces, which had resulted in tragic deaths and
injuries of Chinese Embassy personnel, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the Myanmar government's conviction that a
peaceful resolution should be urgently found to end the crisis in
Yugoslavia which has seen the loss of lives of many innocent
civilians, including women and children.
</P>
<P>
It called upon all parties concerned to solve the present
crisis on the basis of respecting the principles of the United
Nations Charter and the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese journalists, including a female Xinhua
correspondent, were killed and more than 20 injured when three
NATO precision missiles hit the Chinese Embassy at midnight last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press release also said Myanmar leader Senior-General Than
Shwe has sent a message to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji expressing the deepest condolences over the
deaths of the Chinese journalists.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma Speaker Gennady
Seleznyov said here Tuesday that the NATO attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade was a brazen act of aggression and that NATO
had no reason, and could not find any reason, to do this.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the Chinese embassy, as well as other so-called
errors that caused the death of innocent civilians and the
destruction of civilian houses and other facilities, was a result
of NATO's disregard for international law, others' lives and the
common value of all human kind and the military alliance's attempt
to pursue power politics, Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
On ways to settle the Kosovo crisis, the speaker of the Russian
lower house of parliament said that the bombing should stop first
and NATO troops would be withdrawn from the borders with
Yugoslavia before talks on the status of Kosovo and the
repatriation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan crisis can only be resolved through political means,
Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it will bring endless future troubles to the whole
world," the speaker said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Itar-Tass Director Vitaly
Ignatenko said here Tuesday that the NATO attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade was a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter
and norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
Ignatenko told Xinhua that the attack was a barbaric act
intolerable to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The director pointed out that the air raids on Yugoslavia and
the missile attack on the Chinese embassy indicated that NATO was
creating a larger humanitarian catastrophe, pursuing hegemonism
and power politics in an attempt to rule the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that the peace-loving peoples of the world
cannot accept," Ignatenko said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's missile attack on the Chinese embassy, which killed
three reporters and wounded over 20 embassy staff members, was a
undisguised act of human rights violation that fully exposed the
hypocrisy of the U.S.-led NATO's safeguarding of human rights, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Proposals to Revitalize EU-ACP Ties: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said Tuesday
its new trade proposals to replace the Lome Convention will
revitalize relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
groups of nations.
</P>
<P>
Jose Leandro, EU economic advisor based in Zimbabwe, said this
in his address to 50 delegates on the last day of a two-day
regional workshop on Post Lome IV convention in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are proposing an innovative and flexible approach.
 The proposal is based on the assessment of past experience."
</P>
<P>
"We have decided it is time to revitalize specific relations
with ACP and give it a new spin in the trade area. We are not
trying to be pushy because the proposal is flexible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said EU had come up with the proposal because the impact of
Lome trade preferences which had been in place for the past 25 to
30 years had been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of Lome in 1975, he said, 92 percent of ACP
products entered the EU duty free.
</P>
<P>
The ACP-EU market, he said, had fallen from 6.7 percent in 1976
to 3.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said trade preferences had not led to a diversification of
ACP exports.
</P>
<P>
"Five products represent 50 percent of total exports. These
are petroleum, diamonds, cocoa, coffee and sugar cane," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Out of 71 ACP countries, only five, including Zimbabwe, enjoy
a growth rate for their exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the objectives of the new trade regime were to
stabilize trade and investment policies in the ACP countries and
enhance their predictability and credibility for business and
potential investors.
</P>
<P>
The regime would improve the ACP countries' capacity to handle
the trade related issues that were set to play an increasingly
crucial role in international trade and consolidate regional
integration processes as a step towards integration into the world
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The regime has two dimensions: the normal economic cooperation
 agreement and the new trade cooperation agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lome IV Convention due to expire next year is an agreement
between 71 ACP countries and the 15-member EU which covers trade,
financial and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a new trade agreement between the EU and the
ACP which started last September are expected to be finalized by
the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students in UK Send Protest Letter to Tony Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Students and scholars in
Britain Tuesday delivered a protest letter to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, expressing their "extreme indignation and
strongest condemnation" of NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The students and scholars said they were "deeply shocked" by
the bombardment of the Chinese Embassy on the 7th of May that
killed three Chinese journalists and wounded more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the attack is in violation of the Vienna Convention
and shows blatant disregard of international law, the students and
scholars demanded "an immediate investigation into this barbaric
act in order to reveal the truth."
</P>
<P>
"All those who sacrifice innocent people's lives for their own
political purposes are criminals. They should bear total
responsibility for the consequences of their actions and be
punished", the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) in
the UK said in the protest letter.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Kosovo crisis can be, and should only be,
resolved peacefully. We demand NATO immediately stop its air
strikes and any kind of military action in the Balkan region to
avoid further humanitarian disasters", said the letter of CSSA,
which represents about 8,000 Chinese students and scholars
studying and working in the UK.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian PM Calls for Greek Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski Tuesday invited Greek businessmen to invest in his
country, which is suffering economic losses due to the large
influx of refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Greek ministers and businessmen in
the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Georgievski said that
sincere cooperation was built at the level of economic cooperation
and Greek businessmen were the first to open the door to
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the fact that Greece was the
leading investor in Macedonia, which also was keen to see
investment from a diverse group of countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Skopje decided to create two industrial zones, one
of them would be located on its border with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disputes between the two countries concerning the
name of Macedonia, bilateral trade ties have been improved
remarkably in recent years, with Greece now becoming Skopje's
largest direct investor.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said
Tuesday in Thessaloniki that the Greek government examined
creation of two special funds worth three billion drachmas (about
10 million U.S. dollars) to be managed by the World Bank. The two
funds would support Greek businesses which would plan and
undertake projects in Balkan countries hit by the Yugoslav crisis.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Records More Arrivals of Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Zambia National Tourist Board's news flash
reaching here Tuesday, visitor arrivals increased from 340,896 in
1997 to 362,025 in 1998. Holiday visits alone recorded 93,383 in
1998 while in 1997 the figure stood at 89,926.
</P>
<P>
The top ten markets in 1998 in order of performance were: South
Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States,
Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Germany, France, Canada and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the increase in visitors, revenue earned last
year declined from 75 million U.S. dollars in 1997 compared to 74
million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The decline has been attributed to the reduction in the average
length of stay by tourists from nine days the previous year to
eight last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment pledges last year also grew by about 1.4
percent as compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The tourist board is optimistic that this year, the industry
will record a positive growth in both revenue and number of
tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The board has also finalized its five-year marketing strategy
to run from 1999 to 2004 intended to spearhead the industry.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Turns to Gas Substitution for Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- As a major effort to cut its oil
import bill, Pakistan is actively seeking more natural gas supply
from sources abroad.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study has been carried out on a 1,638-kilometer
gas pipeline project linking northern Iran and Pakistan, which is
capable of transporting natural gas of 1.6 billion cubic feet per
day (BCFD) to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project gained fresh momentum after the two
countries discussed related issues in details in Islamabad last
week when a high-level Iranian gas delegation visited here.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on another gas pipeline are also underway. A
tripartite meeting involving Pakistan, Turkmenistan and
Afghanistan ended on April 29 here, during which officials and
experts from the three sides studied plans to build a pipeline
linking Turkmenistan with Pakistan via Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The 1,280-kilometer pipeline has a proposed transportation
capacity of two BCFD of gas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pakistan is also negotiating with Qatar on gas
imports from the latter. According to Pakistani officials, Qatar
is keen to supply gas to Pakistan through a 1,600-kilometer
pipeline and the negotiations are progressing well.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said natural gas is probably to play a
spectacular role in Pakistan's energy sector in the backdrop of
the country's cash crunch and soaring oil prices in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
With an average balance of trade shortfall of around three
billion U.S. dollars a year and an escalating oil import bill,
encouragement of usage of natural gas over oil may offer the
country a way out to avoid the burgeoning debt trap and overcome a
possible energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
Energy experts suggest that the gradual substitution of natural
gas for fuel oil, specially imported oil, has become imperative in
view of the erratic frequent upward price revision of oil in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices have shot up by 50 percent since February this
year following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC)'s decision to cut their output by 2.1 million barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan on an average imports 350,000 barrels of crude oil and
petroleum products a day and its oil demand is steadily growing.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated, if no measures taken, the demand for imported
oil will jump to 500,000 barrels a day in the next three to four
years.
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, Pakistan has no way out but to effectively
switch over to maximum gas usage, experts said, adding this would
drastically cut its oil import cost apart from reducing dependence
on others.
</P>
<P>
They said gas costs 7.3 dollars per barrel of oil equivalent
(boe) less than fuel oil. Fuel oil import costs 12 dollars per
barrel while gas costs 4.7 dollars per boe.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is endowed with proven reserves of 515 million barrels
of oil, 20 to 22 trillion cubic feet of gas and three billion tons
of coal, and yet it is far away from matching its energy
requirement from indigenous resources.
</P>
<P>
Out of the proven gas reserves around 1.8 BCFD of gas is being
produced a day from 35 gas fields, concentrated largely in the two
southern provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, net average gas production from the
existing fields is projected to peak at 2.3 BCFD in the year 2002,
before declining to 2 BCFD by the year 2005, when a sizable gap in
demand-supply is anticipated to emerge in the range of 1.2 BCFD,
making massive imports of gas inevitable.
</P>
<P>
An independent study said natural gas consumption in Pakistan,
pushed by soaring demand from the power generation and other
sectors, is estimated to grow rapidly leading to around 10 BCFD by
the year 2010 from the current demand of 1.8 BCFD.
</P>
<P>
As to the three pipelines, Afghanistan holds the key to the
success of all these projects which will pass through the
war-ravaged country. The dominant Taliban militia, who control
more than 80 percent of the country, are keen to lay pipelines
through the area they control. But international investors are
hesitating and may choose to wait until peace is restored in the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
Financial difficulties in Pakistan are also standing in the way
of the implementation of the projects, each estimated to cost
between 2 and 4 billion dollars, thus entailing a huge investment,
both from the private sector and from these governments.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Devalues Currency to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Central Bank chief Tuesday
said the recent 10.3 percent devaluation of Naira reflected the
country's economic realities and has the potential to promote
competitiveness and external viability.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ogwuma, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, said here
at a press conference that "it is not in our economic interest
that naira (Nigeria's currency) should always remain strong even
when the economy is weak and fragile."
</P>
<P>
The three times devaluation during the past six weeks has
driven the country's currency from 86 naira to 94.88 naira to the
U.S. dollar on the autonomous foreign exchange market and 105
naira to the dollar on the parallel market.
</P>
<P>
Ogwuma said that the devaluation was intended to help contain
the burgeoning government deficit of 300 billion naira resulting
from two consecutive years of deficit budget as well as government
borrowing to finance its expenditure.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the devaluation and recent introduction of
special treasury bills were designed to mop up the excess
liquidity in the economy created by government borrowing to
finance its expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Nigerian out-going Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar announced the cancellation of contracts estimated at 60
billion naira awarded by the government.
</P>
<P>
Ogwuma also lamented the huge expenditure of the country's
foreign exchange on finished imported goods which had continued to
depress capacity utilization of its industries estimated at 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Task Force to Assess Damage to Environment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has established
a joint UNEP/ Habitat Task Force on the Environment and Human
Settlements in the Balkans to assess damage to environment and
infrastructure there caused by the on-going conflict.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director of the U. N. Environment
Program (UNEP) and Acting Executive Director of the U.N. Center
for Human Settlements (Habitat), announced this in Kenyan capital
Nairobi Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We urgently need clear, detailed and credible information on
the impacts on human settlements and infrastructure, and on the
possible environmental repercussions of the Balkans conflict, such
as water and air pollution or the release of hazardous waste,"
said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
"Such vital information will enable us to come up with a
prioritized action program for the whole region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Due to the circumstances of the war, it is extremely difficult
to verify information on environmental damage in the the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the wider Balkans region.
</P>
<P>
However, the broad-based joint UNEP/Habitat task force team is
determined to make great efforts to collect, collate, and review
available information on impacts on human settlements and actual
and potential environmental impacts in Yugoslavia and neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with technical bodies and relevant U.N.
agencies, it will also identify areas in need of assistance, help
formulate response measures and give recommendations on specific
actions to be taken in the short, medium and long term.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer has appointed UNEP's Senior Policy Advisor Bakary Kante
to chair the task force. Kante will also be a member of the
comprehensive U.N. inter-agency humanitarian team.
</P>
<P>
The task force was set up in response to UNEP and Habitat's
regular mandate and the team will work closely with relevant U.N.
agencies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and other
national focal points in the region, said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
In a spirit of cooperation, information and findings will be
shared with all partners of the UNEP and the Habitat in a
collaborative manner, he added.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Tumbles below 16 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices on the world
markets tumbled on Tuesday as speculators shed futures contracts
built up during the steep rally over recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
London futures for benchmark June Brent blend closed 48 cents
lower at 15.97 U.S. dollars a barrel as sickly refinery profit
margins weighed on the international crude market.
</P>
<P>
News that Royal Dutch Shell was planning to reduce European
refinery operations has raised the prospect of weaker demand for
crude supplies, frightening away some in the market who were
holding long positions on futures markets, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Monday showed speculators had built up on the New York futures
market four times as many long crude contracts, a bet that prices
will rise, as short positions.
</P>
<P>
"Prices had got overheated and this is the downward correction
that many had anticipated -- but the overall direction of the
market is still up," a London futures broker was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
Shell said it was planning to reduce operations across its
European refineries again, lowering crude throughput for the
second time in a month.
</P>
<P>
"Our cutbacks will reach 20 percent by next week, because
margins are still bad, and also forward margins are looking very
poor, so our expectations are of poor margins," a Shell official
said.
</P>
<P>
A typical complex refinery in Northwest Europe on Monday was
showing a profit of 69 cents on a barrel of Brent, before
operating costs, compared to nearly 2 dollars over the past year.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco said it too was worried about poor refinery profits
and warned that it expected margins to remain under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum product prices have failed in recent weeks to keep
pace with the rapid rise of crude which has carried Brent from
less than 10 dollars in February to over 17 dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
Oil markets are going through a period of slow seasonal
consumption between the northern hemisphere winter heating oil
season and peak summer driving demand for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said positive sentiment over strict OPEC compliance
with new supply curbs had been balanced by worries over the
remaining global stock overhang.
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency on Monday estimated that OPEC
had sliced April exports by 1.7 million bpd from the 75 million
bpd world market, recording 85 percent compliance with new supply
limits.
</P>
<P>
Oil analysts are warming to the idea that OPEC oil exporters
will maintain discipline in abiding by the self-imposed output
cuts they agreed in March.
</P>
<P>
Lehman Brothers on Tuesday raised its forecast for Brent this
year from an average 14 to 15.25 U.S. dollars and said it expected
prices to average 16.50 U.S. dollars in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 11 (Xinhua) -- As many as 25 kg of heroin were
captured late last week on the road linking the western towns of
Arad and Timisoara in Romania's biggest drug capture operation
this year.
</P>
<P>
The drugs worth over one million U.S. dollars were to be
transported to the Netherlands and were found in the tank of a car
registered in Hungary, reported on Tuesday the official Rompres
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Police of Timisoara took the head of the smugglers' network
Francisc Gheorghe Pusztai, into a 30-day preventive custody, along
with Balogh Iosif, a Romanian citizen resident in Hungary, and
Hungarian Balasz Sandor.
</P>
<P>
Investigation showed their activity was part of a much larger
drug-smuggling network, having international branches as well.
</P>
<P>
Romania has become, since early 90's, an important transfer
point of drugs from the Central Asia to the Western Europa, due to
its geographical position. Statistics show that the drug smuggle
cases cracked by the authorities in the recent 9 years are of 40
times more than in the previous 20 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-led NATO to Widen Airstrike Base to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that NATO would widen its military base by launching air
strikes from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue with prosecuting the air campaign
until the NATO conditions are met, and that alone will be the
cause of any suspension of the bombing," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Separately, U.S. officials said Turkey was expected to announce
as early as Tuesday that its bases would be made available for
NATO bomb strikes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 1-Billion-Dollar Loan to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Tuesday that its board of executive directors has approved a loan
of 1 billion U.S. dollars to South Korea to help the government
strengthen structural reform efforts for achieving long-term
financial stability and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the second tranche of the 2-billion-dollar Second
Structural Adjustment Loan (SALII) to Korea, which was first
approved last October and was part of an internationally
coordinated support package for the East Asian country. The first
of the two equal tranches was disbursed last October.
</P>
<P>
"The second tranche of the loan underscores our support for the
government of Korea's strong and comprehensive reform program,"
said Sri-Ram Aiyer, World Bank's country director for Korea.
</P>
<P>
Key areas of focus for the program supported by the loan are
financial sector reform, corporate sector reform, labor market
reform and strengthening of social safety nets.
</P>
<P>
"While the reform initiatives so far have been impressive,
Korea will need to continue to broaden and deepen its reform
program," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"With continued progress on reforms, Korea will be able to
consolidate the economic recovery and lay the foundation for a
return to sustained growth," it added.
</P>
<P>
The second tranche of SALII is a single currency loan in U.S.
dollar for 15 years including 5 years' grace period. The amount
has an interest rate of 6-month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 75 basis
points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rises 4 Percent in the First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity rose at an
annual rate of 4 percent in the first three months of this year,
the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The gain in productivity in the first three months of this year
followed a 4.3 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Even though the first-quarter increase was a bit of a slowdown
from the final quarter of last year, it indicated a spurt of
improved performance in productivity that was first noticed two
years ago is continuing.
</P>
<P>
The upturn in productivity has been led by big gains in the
manufacturing sector, which continued in the first quarter.
Productivity at U.S. factories was up 5.8 percent in the first
quarter, even better than a 5.3 percent fourth quarter gain.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is considered the key to rising standards of
living. Because wages are rising but overall product prices are
not, inflation does not become a problem and the increased wages
go even further, meaning their standards of living rise.
</P>
<P>
Last week in a major policy speech, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said the economy's "truly phenomenal" performance
in recent years was due in large part to strong gains in
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said large investments being made in computers and
other high-tech products of the information age had fundamentally
improved productivity and allowed the economy to grow as rapidly
as it has in recent years without fostering inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, Greenspan warned that the gains in productivity cannot
keep inflation at bay forever. He said that the nation's longest
peacetime expansion will be threatened at some point down the road
by the tight labor markets, comments that have increased worries
in financial markets that the Fed later this year will start
raising interest rates to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of this year, the 4 percent rate of
increase in productivity for nonfarm workers reflected a 5 percent
rise in output and a 0.9 percent increase in the number of hours
worked.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, a closely watched gauge of inflationary
pressures, rose at an annual rate of only 0.3 percent in the first
three months of the year, the second consecutive quarter of low
inflation pressures. In the final three months of last year, unit
labor costs had actually fallen at a 0.4 percent annual rate.

HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Tuesday condemned the "barbaric action" of the U.S-led NATO
missile attack of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the barbaric action," Mugabe told Xinhua at the
Harare International Airport after returning from his visits to
Singapore, China, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

"Our view is that the bombing is a sign of the NATO's
lawlessness. This is a law of jungle by the NATO," the president
pointed out.

The U.S.-led NATO forces attacked the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade last Friday with three missiles, killing three Chinese

MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday ordered an investigation into an alleged list of
government officials and private persons who are supposedly the
subjects of electronic surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'll have this investigated," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he raised doubts as to the physical capability of law
enforcement groups to wiretap large numbers of individuals.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to reports of an alleged list containing
the names of 300 government officials, military officers,
journalists and businessmen supposedly being shadowed by a
counter-intelligence group.
</P>
<P>
The supposed targets include both officials serving the Estrada
administration and individuals identified with the previous
administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada pointed out that he could not see any reason
why a group connected with his administration would put his own
cabinet members under surveillance.

HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Three press organizations in Hong
Kong Wednesday condemned the U.S.-led NATO's air attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the three news organizations handed over a
letter to the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
SAR), offering their deep condolences over the death of three
journalists and asking the office to convey their cordial sympathy
and solicitude to the families of the dead.

Deputy Commissioner Tang Guoqiang thanked the leading members
of the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong News
Executives' Association and the Hong Kong Federation of Journalist

<P>
Over the past few days, he said, Hong Kong newspapers had given
extensive coverage to demonstrations and protests staged on
China's mainland and Hong Kong and other parts of the world
against the U.S.-led NATO's barbarous act, and voiced firm support
for the Central Government's just stand.

COPENHAGEN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi shuttlers for the World

Dannish Immigration Office, the organizers said Wednesday.
</P>

According to John Hansen, Head of Events, the Iraqi delegation,
which was comprised of four players, applied for entry visa on May
5 and 6th. "All of them were refused entry visa and the
Immigration Office said this was the final decision," Hansen said.

In the year of 1991 when the seventh World Championships was
held in Denmark, several Palestianian shuttlers applied for asylum
after they entered the country. "But the Iraqi case does not have

"We have been trying to help the Iraqi delegation and trying to

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Brilliant flowers and sunlight
greeted the remains of Shao Yunhuan, a Xinhua journalist who was
killed in NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia when
they returned home.
</P>
<P>
Shao Yunqing, Shao's sister, burst into tears as she looked at
a portrait of her sister, while Cao Lei, Shao's 19-year-old son,
was tearful.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua News Agency held a large ceremony for Shao at its
headquarters in Beijing, where President Jiang Zemin and other
Party and state leaders came to mourn her loss.
</P>
<P>
When she heard of her death, Shao's colleague Liu Qing said
sorrowfully that it was hard to believe that such a person who
loved her work, family and life had passed away. When Shao had
left for Belgrade in March, she had said, "Don't forget me. I'll
work here after I come back."
</P>
<P>
"Shao liked small animals, and fed a little tortoise brought
from overseas before going abroad," recalled Liu Qing, "She often
explained to us how the tortoise would eat and sleep."
</P>
<P>
In front of the funerary box which was draped with the national
flag, there was a wreath from her husband and son, with a white
ribbon with the words "We will miss you for ever."
</P>
<P>
In the center of the wreath were 48 white callas, and pink and
yellow lillies, representing Shao's 48 years of life. A purple
forget-me-not symbolized her relatives' loss, and yellow and white
chrysanthemum indicated the mourning of the tens of millions of
Chinese, and green pines were for the everlasting soul of Shao.
</P>
<P>
Shao liked flowers, said one colleague, and she said she hopes
Shao will see the hundreds of flower displays that came in from
various parts of the country. The flower arrangements included
Shao's favorites: roses and carnations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Defends Arrest of U.S. Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Foreign Office
Wednesday issued a press release to protest against a U.S.
statement which demands Pakistan end what it called a "press
crackdown."
</P>
<P>
The press release said the government of Pakistan has taken
strong exception to the statement made by the U.S. State
Department, which alleges Pakistan's mistreatment of journalists,
including Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times (TFT).
</P>
<P>
Sethi was arrested in Lahore last Saturday for his
"anti-Pakistan conduct and ridiculing the very foundations and the
ideology of the country," according to a statement made by a
Pakistani government spokesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of making anti-Pakistan remarks in a lecture he
delivered in India earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Sethi's wife told a press conference Tuesday that he was
arrested because of an interview with a BBC team that is in
Pakistan preparing a documentary film on the issue of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement urged the Pakistani government to release
Sethi and others.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Foreign Office described the U.S. statement as
"unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"The statement is based on assumptions which are not supported
by facts. It also reflects total lack of objectivity and
understanding of the circumstances that led to the arrest of the
concerned individual," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The press release denied that Sethi had been physically
mistreated and said he will be afforded full opportunity to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the current Pakistani government "is fully
committed to the preservation of the freedom of the press and rule
of law."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Supports EU Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has decided
to align itself as far as possible with sanctions the European
Union (EU) intends to implement against Yugoslavia, government
spokesman Costas Serezis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Serezis said the decision was taken by President Glafcos
Clerides and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The EU sanctions include a ban on the entry into EU member
states of some 300 Yugoslav politicians, military officers,
journalists, bankers and members of President Slobodan
Milosevic's family.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include a ban on commercial and private flights
between Yugoslav and EU airports and the freezing of funds held by
Milosevic and senior Yugoslav government officials.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization began air strikes
against Yugoslav Serb targets on March 24 after the Serb-led
government refused to accept a peace agreement to grant great
autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in the
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' decision is the latest step to smooth the country's
entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Yugoslav offshore banks and other businesses
operate in Cyprus, and the new sanctions are likely to have a
serious effect on them.

UNITED NATIONS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A distinguished Portuguese
jurist has been elected the new president of the International
Narcotics Control Board (INCB), an independent quasi-judicial U.N.
body that monitors compliance with three main international drug
control treaties, U.N. officials said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The board, which began its two-week session on Monday, elected
Antonio Lourenzo Martins, currently a judge in the Supreme Court

<P>
During its current session in Vienna, the Board will examine
steps governments have taken to implement international drug
control treaties over the past six months, said the officials.
</P>

The 13-member INCB will also devote its session to study the
availability of a large variety of pharmaceuticals containing
internationally controlled substance, which are needed for medical

<HEADLINE> Primakov's Ouster Sparks Worry Over Political, Economic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
move to dismiss the government of Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday
sparked widespread concern over the country's political and
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's departure has been rumored for days as many
observers predict that Yeltsin would cast off the eight-month
cabinet in the face of impeachment proceedings against him in the
State Duma, or lower house of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
St. Petersburg Governor Vladimir Yakovlev said Primakov's
dismissal might seriously destabilize the society.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Platonov, deputy speaker of the Federation Council,
upper house of the parliament, and chairman of the Moscow Duma,
said he does not see "anything positive in the dismissal of
Yevgeny Primakov's cabinet."
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin has the constitutional right to do so, but the
step "may destabilize the economic situation in Russia," the Itar-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who lost his
premiership last March in a similar surprise government shakeup,
said, "frequent changes of the government cannot be positive."
</P>
<P>
"This creates certain difficulties for us," said Chernomyrdin,
now a presidential envoy on Yugoslavia, after his talks with U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential candidate
hopeful in the 2000 elections, voiced his regret over the
dismissal of Primakov, stressing that "preventing emergencies is
of crucial importance today."
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, said the
leftist opposition in the lower house would appeal directly to the
Federal Council to initiate an extraordinary session in the upper
house of parliament because "Boris Yeltsin has deliberately staged
a new government crisis."
</P>
<P>
In a farewell meeting with his cabinet members, federal
department chiefs and government, Primakov said his cabinet "has
no reason to blush."
</P>
<P>
"We have run business professionally, which is borne out by
objective indicators. There is no hyper-inflation in our forecast.
The rate of the ruble to the dollar today is not 50 to one as was
predicted on the macroeconomic level. The critical situation after
August 17 has been remedied.
</P>
<P>
"The government has, to the best of its ability, stabilized the
situation in the political, economic, and social fields. The
payment of wages and pensions has improved as has that of salaries
and other dues to armed forces. The number of strikes has sharply
decreased over eight months, which is an indication that the
social situation is shaping up," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov urged cabinet members to carry on with their duties
until new instructions and appointments are made. He asked them to
work as they have under him.
</P>
<P>
"The country must not be left without a government for a single
day," Primakov said. "All of us are aimed at work for the sake of
Russia and its people."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he would always remember "with great pleasure and
joy" the past eight months' work in the government.
</P>
<P>
Following a 20-minute meeting in the Kremlin early Wednesday,
Yeltsin sacked Primakov in what he described as a "difficult
decision."
</P>
<P>
"The government has accomplished a tactical task set for it in
full," Yeltsin said. "However, the economic situation is not
improving. Today, nine months later, the question about an
economic strategy still remains open."
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin was named acting premier and his candidacy has been
submitted to the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was born in Lushun, China, on March 2, 1952. He
graduated from the Russian Interior Ministry's Higher Polytechnic
College in 1973 and from the Humanitarian Military Academy in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He served in special Interior Ministry divisions and then
taught at the Interior Ministry's Higher Polytechnic College in
Leningrad (St Petersburg).
</P>
<P>
Stepashin has served as the interior minister since March 1998.

<HEADLINE> Senior HK Official on Railway Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nicholas Ng, secretary for
Transport, stressed here Wednesday that the aim of Hong Kong's
transport policy is to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and
environmentally friendly transport network.
</P>
<P>
"We do this by a 3-pronged approach," Ng said at a seminar on
the Hong Kong Railway Development organized by the One Country Two
Systems Research Institute Limited.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he said, Hong Kong will continue to expand the
transport infrastructure, but in a manner that will achieve
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, "we give priority to public transportation, in order
to make the most effective use of our limited space," and thirdly,
"we complement the expansion of transport infrastructure by
effective transport management," he said.
</P>
<P>
On railway development in Hong Kong, Ng said Hong Kong has a
railway network extending 143 kilometers, carrying 3.4 million
passengers a day, or about 36 percent of the total public
transport patronage.
</P>
<P>
The network will be significantly expanded by more than 40
percent to 200 kilometers when five new railways with a total
investment of 130 billion HK dollars (16.66 billion U.S. dollars)
are completed within the next five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to support the growth in population and the economy in
an environmentally acceptable manner and in view of the long lead
time required for railway construction, the government has
commissioned a consultancy study to look at the next phase of
railway development for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Second Railway Development Study, which started in March
1998, is identifying railway projects which Hong Kong needs for
the next two decades.

<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Catholic man was shot and wounded
in Northern Ireland in a sectarian attack by suspected Protestant
terrorists on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the latest in a series of violent incidents that
have cast a dark cloud over efforts to establish stability after
30 years of guerrilla war and sectarian strife.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old victim was shot twice in the leg and chest in a
building site in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, BBC quoted a police
spokeswoman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The man has been admitted to hospital," said the spokeswoman
for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). "It is understood at this
stage that his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening."
</P>
<P>
After shooting, the two gunmen ran down an alleyway and a car
thought to have been used by them was found burnt nearby.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer said at the scene that it had all the
hallmarks of a sectarian shooting. "I don't think there is any
doubt that it was a loyalist sectarian attack, I think that is
clear."

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Cambodia Condemn NATO Atrocity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in Cambodia
Wednesday strongly denounced the U.S.-led NATO's atrocity of
launching the missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, the
Association of Chinese in Cambodia, on behalf of all Chinese in
Cambodia, said the Chinese were greatly shocked at the attack last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three NATO missiles hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade from
different angles at midnight Friday, killing three journalists,
injuring more than 20 diplomats and leaving the embassy building
seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's more than 40 days' wanton bombing on Yugoslavia has
already caused hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians killed
or wounded as well as great losses to properties. What is more,
NATO now blatantly bombed the Chinese Embassy," it said.
</P>
<P>
The letter pointed out that "NATO's barbaric act has aroused
the strong protest from the peace-loving people all over the
world. We strongly condemn the murderers ... and urge NATO to stop
the bombing immediately," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The association also expressed its firm support for the Chinese
government's stand on the matter and extended their deep
condolences over the death of the Chinese journalists.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Several Sri Lankan non-governmental
organizations (NGO) have lent their support to the government and
the people of China by strongly denouncing the U.S.-led NATO's
missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In a communique published Wednesday, Sri Lanka-China Friendship
Association (SCFA) called for world opinion against this brutal
act of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The killing and seriously injuring of the Chinese embassy staff
by brutal forces led by the United States "represented a gross
violation of the Geneva Charter and International Law," said the
SCFA communique.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka China
Society (SLCS) expressed its deepest concern regarding the loss of
lives, property and the possible loss of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that no power can bully China nor will China
be untimely provoked," said the SLCS in the letter dated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tragic bombing constituted not only an attack against the
People's Republic of China but also a heavy blow to the world
peace process and the new world order, said the Association for
Sri Lanka-China Social and Cultural Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Sri Lanka
Association for International Understanding said the United
Nations should inquire and take action against the NATO commander
and officers who were responsible for the bombing.

Ministry and the Communist Youth League Central Committee of China
held a forum today in Beijing for the 80th anniversary of the May
4th Movement.
</P>
<P>
As an opening ceremony, people stood in silent tribute to those

and strongly condemned the barbarous act. They expressed their
support for the statement by the Chinese government and by
President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao.

the former vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee, who
witnessed the May 4th Movement 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun said that NATO atrocity kindled the indignation of
all Chinese and that the protest activities of the past few days
of Chinese youth are part of patriotic tradition of the May 4th
spirit and that she hopes that Chinese young people will cultivate
their ideology while actively pursuing their education to pursue
personal accomplishments as well as to serve the country, and to
foster lofty ideals and be prepared for hardship.
</P>
<P>
Lei pointed out that the Chinese cannot stand any trampling on
China's sovereignty and that they commemorate the May 4th Movement
in order to contribute to the revitalization of China and
socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, the first secretary of 14th Central Committee of

ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Pat Rafter maintained his
winning momentum as he eliminated Argentine qualifier Gaston
Gaudio in straight sets to enter the third round at the Italian
Open Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, seeded fourth, who had dropped only 10 games so far at
the clay-court tuneup for the French Open, made light work of
Gaudio 6-2, 6-3 under a fiery sun at the Foro Italico.
</P>
<P>
The two-time U.S. Open champion, who had lost in the first
round of his last two events, admitted earlier this week his form
"has not been too impressive".
</P>
<P>
American Michael Chang was not as resilient as Rafter as he
failed to rebound from his recent bad form, going down 5-7, 3-6 to
tenth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The American, who won the French Open in 1989, has made it past
the second round at just one event this year and his ranking has
slipped to No. 46.
</P>
<P>
In other actions, big-serving Britain Greg Rusedski, bowed out
meekly as he barely put up a fight in falling 6-3, 6-3 to
Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here Wednesday that the rebels fighting to topple Laurent
Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), are
part of the peace process and he will not ignore them in the
on-going consultations with regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before departure for Tanzania to discuss
the peace process with his Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin Mukapa
and the country's former President Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the
nine-month war in DRC, said that the rebels will be consulted as
well to make the peace initiative successful.
</P>
<P>
He said he will seek harmonize the urgent need to hold a
regional heads of state summit before going into another stage of
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
All the efforts being initiated by other African leaders will
not be done outside the SADC initiative to avoid complicating the
matter, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Chiluba go to Tanzanian in the past
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit to seek the peaceful solution
have been postponed several times from the originally planned date
of December 8 last year because of largely Kabila's refusal to
allow the rebels to be involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In March, Kabila changed his mind and agreed to allow them to
be involved.
</P>
<P>
The rebels attended a meeting of defense and security chiefs of
the concerned countries for the first time held here last month,
but walked out of the meeting, demanding a bilateral meeting with
the government delegation of DRC.

<HEADLINE> China Setting Up 3 More Assets Management Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will set up 3 more firms to
manage bad loans of state-owned commercial banks within three
months, according to Liu Mingkang, the deputy governor of the
People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at the '99 China Forum, which was
organized by the State Council Office for Restructuring the
Economic System (SCORES) and Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA)
and which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The specialized commercial firms are a step taken by the
Chinese government to prevent risks in the banking sector from the
increasing number of bad loans to state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The first firm, Cinda, was established on April 20 to handle
bad loans of the China Construction Bank and the three others are
expected to manage bad loans of the Bank of China, the
Agricultural Bank of China, and the China Industrial and
Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
Liu denied that China is going through a deflationary period
and cited as evidence the currency issue, which is still growing
and the GDP and fixed asset investments growth in the first
quarter. Nevertheless, he said, the government is watching the
situation closely and will take steps to prevent any possible
deflation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism about the settlement of potential Y2

<HEADLINE> Namibian Refugees in Botswana Granted Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has granted asylum to
2,232 Namibian refugees believed to be from a group seeking the
secession of the Caprivi Strip from Namibia, the Botswana
government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Botswana has taken the decision in accordance with its
obligation as signatory to international and regional covenants
governing refugees," South African Press Association quoted a
statement from President Festus Mogae's office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Botswana was committed to the principle of voluntary
repatriation as a durable solution to the problem and would
collaborate with Namibia to that end, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the number included 15 leaders of the group
whose status depended on their being settled outside Botswana. Two
of these leaders were accepted as refugees by Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The 15 leaders were given asylum in February. But mindful of
its relations with Namibia, Botswana made their status conditional
on their being settled outside the country.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees approached the
United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the Scandinavian
countries to take them.
</P>
<P>
Denmark earlier this month accepted former leader of Namibia's
main opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, Meshake Muyongo,
and a Caprivi traditional leader, Chief Boniface Mamili.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2,250 members of the group crossed into Botswana
since October last year, claiming they were fleeing to avoid
crackdown by the Namibian Defense Force and feared persecution by
the Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government had described the secessionists as
"terrorists", but during a state visit to Botswana in March,
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said they would be welcome to return
home.

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The three Chinese journalists
killed in the Chinese embassy attack were back home today and
there was a special ceremony but without funeral music.
</P>
<P>
A higher honor was, however, conferred on them when the
nation's flag was draped across the small caskets containing their
ashes.
</P>
<P>
The young son of a female journalist who was killed held her
casket while a man held the two caskets of his daughter and son-in-
law after they were brought back to Beijing's Capital
International Airport earlier today. Also on board the special
plane were six seriously injured people and some 20 other members
of the embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president Hu Jintao and other senior Chinese officials
were on hand to greet the Chinese martyrs and heroes, wearing
black armbands and white flowers on their jackets.
</P>
<P>
At 10:05 a.m., an honor guard preceded relatives and colleagues
of the deceased as they stepped slowly down from the plane,
holding portraits of the deceased and the funerary caskets.
</P>
<P>
Cao Lei, the 19-year-old son of Shao Yunhuan, the female Xinhua
journalist who was killed in the missile attack, had written a
letter to President Clinton, saying, "Do not let the tragedy of my
family be repeated."

<HEADLINE> Specialists Say Ecology Of Yangtze River Needs Better Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Some environmental specialists and
economists have said at a symposium on protecting the ecology of
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River that China
should increase protection of the Yangtze River's ecology and look
for economic and social benefits as well.
</P>
<P>
Land with a slope of more than 25 degrees needs to be planted
with trees and grass instead of being used as arable land, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that 20 percent of the cultivated land on the
upper reaches of the river has a slope of more than 25 degrees and
that cultivated areas and deforestation have caused serious water
and soil losses.
</P>
<P>
Erosed areas along the Yangtze now exceed 550,000 square
kilometers, and more than 2.2 billion tons of water and soil have
been lost. About 160 million people live along the middle and
upper reaches and the environmental deterioration caused by human
activities were a main cause of last year's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Crops and plants with a short growth period and high yield need
to be introduced to the areas to bring more economic and social
benefits, they say.

"We expect very soon, or at least before the end of this month
that ministers of foreign affairs and defense to meet to prepare a
ground for a summit of heads of state. And we think we can make
headway," Chiluba told reporters shortly after a consultation with
Mozambican and Tanzanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The consultation talks, lasting nearly four hours at the State

African Development Community (SADC).

<P>
The closed-door talks were joined by Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa, the host, Mozambican President Joachim Chissano,
who also came for a working visit, as well as Tanzanian former
President Julius Nyerere, a veteran African statesman.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique "appreciate
tremendously the efforts" made in the five-country summit in Libya
last month.
</P>
<P>
He described the Libya summit as a "very significant
contribution" to last October's Lusaka meeting at which 14 African
countries adopted in principle a draft ceasefire agreement for DRC
war.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the peace process," said Chiluba, spokesman
for Wednesday's talks. Standing by him were the presidents of
Tanzania and Mozambique who did not say anything.

NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of cholera in
Madagascar have killed more than 170 people and infected over
2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Concerned with the fast spreading disease, the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are increasing
its support to contain the epidemic, said a media release from
the International Federation's region delegation in Nairobi
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic on the Indian Ocean Island country is so far
confined to north-western Mahajanga Province and Antananaivo, the
island capital, the release said, adding that the federation
believed many cases might be unreported as Mahajanga is a large
province with many remote communities.
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere in the East African island is now safe from cholera,"
said David Dofara, an International Federation health delegate in
Madagascar, noting that "Unless a major regional program is
introduced, cholera will continue to make ground and many lives

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji, in a meeting
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder here today, explained
China's position on the Kosovo issue and the Nato attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has noticed Schroeder's shock and worry about
the missile attack.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, on behalf of the German government and people,
expressed his profound regret and made an unconditional apology to
the relatives of the dead and to all the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Nato countries shoulder responsibility for this, he said,
and that he is willing to do the same on behalf of Nato, which, he
said, needs to make a thorough investigation of the matter and to
make the results public.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder explained the statement of the foreign ministers of
the seven industrialized nations and Russia last week and
reiterated that the Kosovo matter has been further complicated by
the attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
A political solution must be worked out as soon as possible
because there's no other choice, he said, expressing the hope
China would play a role in solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government will maintain its policy towards
China and pursue the "One China" policy and develop bilateral
cooperation in various fields.

"We always hold that the Kosovo issue is an internal affair of
Yugoslavia," he said, and that, "conflicts between different
ethnic groups and different religions, which have long troubled
Yugoslavia, are so complicated that only peaceful means can be
used for a political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China has consistently advocated a peaceful
settlement of the issue and objected to NATO's use of force. It
has also warned that external military interference will not help
resolve the issue but will only make things more complicated, he
said, and called the use of force extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
NATO circumvented the United Nations and launched a military
attack of Yugoslavia without UN authorization, he said, an act
that seriously violated the UN Charter and international norms.
</P>
<P>
In 50 days, NATO's barbarous bombing of Yugoslavia has killed
or wounded a large number of civilians, and left many homeless, he
said, all this under the guise of protecting humanitarianism while
creating the largest humanitarian disaster in Post-War Europe. (

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Israeli Electoral System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to hold general
elections on May 17 to elect the country's 15th Knesset
(parliament) and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The framework of the Israeli electoral system is defined in
Article 4 of the Basic Law, which reads: "the Knesset shall be
elected by general, national, direct, equal, secret and
proportional elections in accordance with the Knesset Election
Law."
</P>
<P>
Every Israeli citizen aged 18 or older has the right to vote,
and every citizen aged 21 or older is eligible to be elected to
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The president, state comptroller, judges, senior public
officials and the chief of staff and other high-ranking military
officers can not stand for the Knesset unless they have resigned
their positions at least 100 days before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The entire country constitutes a single electoral constituency.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is elected directly by the voters, not through a
body of electors. All votes cast are equal in weight and
elections are held in secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
The 120 Knesset seats are assigned in proportion to each
party's percentage of the total national vote. A party must get at
least 1.5 percent of the total votes cast so that it can win a
Knesset seat.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset enacted in 1992 a legislation providing for the
direct election of prime minister. So the Israeli voters cast two
separate ballots simultaneously, one for the political party to
present him or her in the Knesset, and the other for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Committee, headed by a justice of the
Supreme Court and including representatives from the parties
holding seats in the Knesset, is responsible for conducting and
supervising the elections.
</P>
<P>
The election day is set for a national holiday to enable all to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Soliders on active duty vote in special polling stations in
their units. Special arrangements have also been made for prison
inmates and those confined to hospitals to vote.
</P>
<P>
Israeli law does not provide for absentee ballots and polling
takes place only on Israeli soil except for Israeli citizens
serving on Israeli ships and in Israeli embassies and consulates
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The election results should be published within 14 days after
the voting.
</P>
<P>
The number and order of members who can enter the new Knesset
of each party corresponds to its list of candidates as presented
for the election.
</P>
<P>
There are no by-elections in Israel, and should an sitting
Knesset member resigns or passes away, the next person on that
party's list automatically takes his or her place.

NATO not only escalated the bombing, but wantonly attacked the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, killing or wounding people and
destroying the building, seriously infringing on Chinese
sovereignty, he said and the "Chinese government and people are
utterly indignant about this barbarous conduct."
</P>
<P>
The explanation that it was a mistake, he said, is hardly
believed by the Chinese or the foreign public opinion, and the
Chinese government says that it needs to be thoroughly
investigated and those responsible punished.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Chinese government has always advocated a
political solution to the Kosovo issue and has supported the role
of the UN. in this and has noticed the statement of the foreign
ministers of the Group of 7 and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We insist on an immediate halt to the bombing be a condition
to a political settlement so that there will be conditions for a
political settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will
not agree to discuss any plans for a political settlement by the
UN Security Council if the bombing continues, he added, and UN.
Security Council resolutions on Kosovo will need to be agreed upon
by Yugoslavia or they will not be implemented.

<HEADLINE> UK: No Change in Russian Stance on Kosovo Following Primakov's Sacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday said it did not
expect Russia to change its stance on Kosovo following Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's sacking.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters that
he would not comment on what was an internal matter for Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We have been clear throughout that the Russians have been
acting in good faith and I have no doubt they will continue to do
so," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday fired Primakov and
named First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin as acting
premier.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also threatened that Russia would "withdraw from
cooperation in negotiations if its proposals and mediation efforts
for the Kosovo conflict are ignored," a Kremlin spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Tony Blair had insisted that there was no
weakening in NATO's demands over Kosovo as Russia's special envoy
said he had new proposals to offer.
</P>
<P>
"We've worked very closely with the Russians. But there can't
be any compromise about our basic aims," Blair told GMTV in London.
</P>
<P>
Restating the conditions which Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must meet before NATO stopped bombing were unchanged,
Blair said, "His troops go out, our troops go in and the refugees
return. That is what this whole thing is about."
</P>
<P>
Blair has come under increasing pressure from opposition
politicians at home since NATO's strikes of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade last week.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report said that Britain's Conservative opposition "
broke ranks with Blair's government on Tuesday, branding NATO's
air campaign in Yugoslavia a flop."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin went to
Guangming Daily this afternoon to mourn the loss of the two
journalists who were killed in the NATO attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing
accompanied Jiang in paying respects to the two journalists,
bowing three times before a portrait of the deceased and
expressing their condolences to the relatives.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, the chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference National Committee, laid a wreath for the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chen, the Editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily, said at a
memorial meeting here this afternoon that Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying,
the two journalists, were outstanding reporters and had sent many
timely, accurate, and lively reports in a heroic spirit, which
were praised by readers, since the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
He said that the barbaric missile attack on the Chinese embassy
that killed defenseless people like these journalists has
seriously infringed upon Chinese sovereignty and constitutes an
open provocation to the 1.2 billion Chinese and a gross violation
of international norms and the working rights of journalists.
</P>
<P>
This bloody fact shows that only development can help China, he
said, and only economic growth and scientific and technological
progress can improve China and China will not be bullied by others
when social stability and economic prosperity prevail.
</P>
<P>
"We will memorialize our comrades by more achievements in our
work," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Former Rebel Leader Becomes Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, a
former rebel leader in southeast Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT), took over as chairman of the CHT Regional Council
Wednesday, ending an eight-month long deadlock in implementing a
major provision of the CHT Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
"According to the notification of the Chittagong Hill Tracts
Affairs Ministry on September 6, 1998... I take over the charge as
the chairman of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council,"
Larma, also known as Shantu Larma, said in his letter submitted to
CHT Affairs Minister Kalparanjan Chakma.
</P>
<P>
The signed letter was handed over by Gautam Chakma and Rupayan
Dewan, two leaders of the Parbattaya Chattagram Jana Sanghati
Samity (PCJSS), the political wing of the former CHT armed rebels,
on behalf of Larma, who would enjoy the status of a state minister
as per the provisions of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed in December 1997 between the rebels and
the government, ending a more-than-two-decade-long insurgency in
the hills in southeast Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"I am very delighted, a much desired process has been
accomplished today... It has commenced a new era of development in
the hills," Kalparanjan Chakma told reporters after accepting the
letter.
</P>
<P>
The joining of Larma in the interim council came after more
than an hour of meeting between Larma and Chakma on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial installation of the council will be held on May
27 in Rangamati, one of the three hill districts, and will to be
attended by tribal representatives, local leaders and guests from
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The government announced the 22-member interim council last
year, but its chairman's take-over was delayed due to some
differences between the two sides, which Kalparanjan Chakma
described as "misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
The deadlock eased after Larma met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Gautam Chakma, a senior aide of Larma, said PCJSS decided to
accept the council after receiving assurances from Hasina that
their demands be looked into in line with the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The council, which must be headed by a tribal chairman, will
comprise 21 members -- 14 tribal members, including two women, and
seven non-tribal members, including one woman.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement, the interim regional council
formed by the government will function until an elected council
takes over to coordinate and oversee all development
administrative activities of the three hill district councils and
the CHT Development Board.

<HEADLINE> HK Legislature Passes Motion Condemning NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Legislative Council (LegCo) Wednesday
unanimously passed a motion on "Condemning NATO" over its missile
attack against the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The motion, moved by Leong Che-hung, states that the council "
strongly" condemns NATO for launching the missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
In response to the motion, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan
reiterated the HKSAR Government's support to the position taken by
the Central Government concerning the issue of NATO's bombing of
the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
On May 8, HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa issued a
statement extending his condolences to those who died in the NATO
attack and wished the injured an early recovery.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has
aroused strong reaction in Hong Kong, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that every Chinese strongly resents and is deeply
indignant over the bombing of our country's embassy," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, on behalf of all the people of Hong Kong, we would
like to extend our sincere condolences to the families of those
killed in the bombing incident, and to express our heartfelt wish
for the early recovery of the injured embassy staff who have also
returned to the Mainland," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over the motion, LegCo members voiced their
condemnation of the U.S.-led NATO and expressed their support to
the Central Government's four demands on NATO.
</P>
<P>
They said the U.S.-led NATO has been launching air strikes
against Yugoslavia under the disguise of "humanitarianism,"
killing large numbers of innocent civilians and damaging many
hospitals, factories and schools. This is an act of hegemonism
rather than "humanitarianism."
</P>
<P>
Members of the council refuted the explanations by NATO about
the cause of the incident, describing them as defiling the wisdom
of humanity.
</P>
<P>
They demanded NATO, headed by the United States, openly
apologize to the Chinese government and the Chinese people and
compensate for all losses.
</P>
<P>
Drawing lessons from the incident, LegCo members said that the
Chinese people should unite and build the country richer and
stronger to resist foreign aggression. The Chinese people should
continue to maintain the current stable situation in China, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The act of the U.S.-led NATO has posed threats to world peace,
LegCo members said. They demanded NATO immediately stop bombing
Yugoslavia, and urged the United Nations Security Council to
condemn NATO's act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
A total of 41 members took the floor and all members attending
the meeting voted in favor of the motion.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Parties Denounce NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Six left parties in Nepal
Wednesday handed over a letter to the U.S. Ambassador to Nepal,
strongly denouncing NATO's "barbaric aggression" against
Yugoslavia and its missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Since the NATO aggression is against all international rules,
regulations and norms and above all against the humanity, we, the
undersigned, strongly denounce it," the protest letter said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led imperialism has once again shown its barbarian
mentality. This time in Yugoslavia, the U.S. and her blood-thirsty
colleagues within the NATO have not only threatened the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent nation,
but also openly flouted all international conventions, rules and
regulations," the letter noted.
</P>
<P>
It said NATO of late has even struck the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade with its deadly missiles, killing three Chinese
journalists and injuring over 20 diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly denounce this barbaric acts of the U.S.
imperialism and her NATO colleagues and demand an immediate halt
to all kinds of aggression against Yugoslavia and compensation for
all losses caused by the continued NATO aggression.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, we also advise the NATO aggressors,
especially the U.S. imperialists, to learn lessons from the world
history and refrain from digging graves for themselves," the
letter pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strongest objections by the world community, the
letter said, "the aggression on Yugoslavia and many other Third
World countries is still going on unabated." "Dictating one's own
terms and conditions on others and resorting to force to get them
realized have never done any good."
</P>
<P>
"The world, time and again, has witnessed its examples,
especially in Vietnam in the mid-1970s. Over decades, imperialism
has inflicted grave losses to human civilization, most often
leading the world to unparalleled human tragedies and pathos," the
letter noted.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping this in mind, we advise the NATO imperialists to make
good use of their senses and learn respecting the rights of others
too. We warn that any consequences following the failure in paying
heed to this key aspect will solely rest with the imperialists
themselves," the letter warned.

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese insurance authorities today
announced a three-month suspension of business of Sedgwick
Insurance &AMP; Risk Management Consultants (China) Limited, a solely
British-funded firm, as part of a package of sanctions for
insurance regulation violations.
</P>
<P>
This makes Sedgwick the first example of insurance authorities'
attempts to rectify the insurance business this year. The China
Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said that the company was
found guilty of several offenses during a routine annual
inspection by the market watchdog.
</P>
<P>
These includes operating an unlicensed businesses, a serious
shortage of registered capital, and two unapproved changes of
business location. Three senior management personnel were also
found to be without qualifications.
</P>
<P>
CIRC said that the offenses were serious violations of China's
insurance laws and regulations and a threat to the order of the
insurance business and it ordered the company to suspend business
from May 10 to August 10, after which time there will be a second
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick was also asked to submit a letter of introspection and
a detailed plan for rectification to CIRC and CIRC said that it
will decide about further sanctions after an audit by an
independent auditor's office.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick was licensed by the Chinese People's Bank in 1993,
with 140,000 U.S. dollars worth of registered capital. It did 14
million yuan in business in 1998.

SUZHOU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou Industrial Park in the
Chinese city of Suzhou in Jiangsu Province opened a customshouse
today, exactly five years after China and Singapore started
construction work on the industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The State Council asked the Industrial Park to establish a

In 4 years the office has handled over 680,000 tons of goods,

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After an unexpected visit to Beijing, Russian peace envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin returned to Moscow Tuesday night and aligned
himself rhetorically with China's demand for an unconditional halt
in NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. flags at the six American missions in China were
lowered half-staff Wednesday as the ashes of three Chinese
journalists killed in the U.S.-led NATO's missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade were returned home.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the calls from China and Russia to halt the bombing
of Yugoslavia, American and other allied forces pounded targets
across the country Tuesday as NATO leaders pledged to continue the
air war until President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to meet all
their demands.
</P>
<P>
-- America's space rockets seem to be failing, blowing up or
losing payloads at an alarming rate that has experts questioning
the prowess of an increasingly competitive satellite launching
industry. In the last nine months, there have been six significant
failures of U.S. rockets trying to put civilian and military
payloads into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. federal prosecutors and regulators are investigating
the trading practices of as many as 64 brokers on the floor of the
New York Stock Exchange who may have illegally shared profits with
customers, says a person familiar with the probes.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Israeli Electoral System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to hold general
elections on May 17 to elect the country's 15th Knesset
(parliament) and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The framework of the Israeli electoral system is defined in
Article 4 of the Basic Law, which reads: "the Knesset shall be
elected by general, national, direct, equal, secret and
proportional elections in accordance with the Knesset Election
Law."
</P>
<P>
Every Israeli citizen aged 18 or older has the right to vote,
and every citizen aged 21 or older is eligible to be elected to
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The president, state comptroller, judges, senior public
officials and the chief of staff and other high-ranking military
officers can not stand for the Knesset unless they have resigned
their positions at least 100 days before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The entire country constitutes a single electoral constituency.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is elected directly by the voters, not through a
body of electors. All votes cast are equal in weight and
elections are held in secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
The 120 Knesset seats are assigned in proportion to each
party's percentage of the total national vote. A party must get at
least 1.5 percent of the total votes cast so that it can win a
Knesset seat.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset enacted in 1992 a legislation providing for the
direct election of prime minister. So the Israeli voters cast two
separate ballots simultaneously, one for the political party to
present him or her in the Knesset, and the other for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Committee, headed by a justice of the
Supreme Court and including representatives from the parties
holding seats in the Knesset, is responsible for conducting and
supervising the elections.
</P>
<P>
The election day is set for a national holiday to enable all to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Soliders on active duty vote in special polling stations in
their units. Special arrangements have also been made for prison
inmates and those confined to hospitals to vote.
</P>
<P>
Israeli law does not provide for absentee ballots and polling
takes place only on Israeli soil except for Israeli citizens
serving on Israeli ships and in Israeli embassies and consulates
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The election results should be published within 14 days after
the voting.
</P>
<P>
The number and order of members who can enter the new Knesset
of each party corresponds to its list of candidates as presented
for the election.
</P>
<P>
There are no by-elections in Israel, and should an sitting
Knesset member resigns or passes away, the next person on that
party's list automatically takes his or her place.

<HEADLINE> China Reforming State-Owned Sector Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will increase its reforms of
state-owned enterprises and open more industries to foreign
competition, according to Wan Jifei, the deputy director of the
State Council's Office for Restructuring the Economic System (
SCORES).
</P>
<P>
Wan said today at the '99 China Forum, which was organized by
SCORES and Hong Kong's Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA),
that China will continue to adjust state investment and continue
its strategic reorganization of state-owned enterprises, resulting
in a concentration of state capital in only a few sectors that are
essential to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The country will also continue turning state-owned enterprises
into shareholding companies, which means that a share holding
system will be set up in those that are qualified and that China
ill have vigorous policies to eliminate existing structural and
policy obstacles to the non-state-owned sector access to bank
loans and foreign trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has already promised to increase opening the market to
foreign telecommunications, banking, and retailing companies and
to law, accounting, and special service firm, he said, and for
some industries, Chinese capital will retain its status as holding
capital, while in some other fields, this status will not apply.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that China will continue to improve its
investment environment and to provide more comprehensive and
efficient services to foreign investors and said he believes that,
as the reform and opening up continue, China will provide more and
better opportunities to foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Student Quarrel at Zhejiang University Subsides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese student studying at
Zhejiang University was struck off the school rolls on Tuesday for
tearing up slogans put up by Chinese students and beating his
schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, Shibayama Takahare, deliberately knocked over the
slogans, put up by Chinese students in protest against NATO's
missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, time and again
while playing with other Japanese students around 7:00 pm on May
10.
</P>
<P>
When two Chinese students went up to reason with them,
Shibayama Takahare beat them with his fists and feet. His acts
aroused the great indignation of other Chinese students who
gathered around, demanding his apology.
</P>
<P>
But Shibayama Takahare refused to do so, which led a larger
crowd in front of the dormitory of foreign students. The two sides
were in a stalemate for more than 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Zhejiang University and the provincial government
went to the spot for persuasion. The students dispersed in the
morning of the following day.
</P>
<P>
In a written self-criticism broadcast yesterday afternoon,
Shibayama Takahare said, "It was my fault to commit a breach of
etiquette. I extend a profound apology for what I did to the
Chinese students."
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang University expelled him from school on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
The General Consulate of Japan in Shanghai sent consul Masaki
Funano to look into the matter. Masaki Funano said he will report
the investigation result to the consul general, adding he should
be expressing his sympathy for NATO's bombing of the Chinese
embassy rather than handling such a matter.
</P>
<P>
At present, 70 foreign students including 20 from Japan are
leading a normal scholarly life at the university.

<HEADLINE> NATO's "Faulty Information", Unconvincing: Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese satellite expert said
here today that the explanation of "faulty information" made for
the U.S.-led NATO missile attack on Chinese embassy in Belgrade
last Friday night can't be justified.
</P>
<P>
The United States leads the world in space technology. It ranks
first in the number and types of satellites for military use, said
the expert with the China Corporation of Aerospace Industry, who
declined to reveal his name.
</P>
<P>
The United States not only has communication and navigation
satellites, but also electronic reconnaissance satellites, photo-
flash reconnaissance satellites, marine monitoring satellites,
missile early warning satellites, and meteorological satellites.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the United States provided 12 satellite
systems with more than 30 military satellites during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Its military reconnaissance satellites, which have different
functions, can cover all parts of the globe. They conduct all-
weather reconnaissance on their strategic and tactical targets.
</P>
<P>
The resolving power of a visual imaging photo reconnaissance
satellite is 0.1-0.3 meters which can clearly see tanks, jeeps and
missile transport vehicles. Moreover, it can locate tents, the
number of people, and license plates of motor vehicles, he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO's "Faulty Information", Unconvincing: Expert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia is a major structure in
Belgrade. The embassy entrance has an obvious placard and the five-
star flag of the People's Republic of China flutters in the wind.
This has been under the watchful supervision of U.S.
reconnaissance satellites, the satellite expert said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, it would be futile for the United States and NATO
to quibble the attack on the Chinese embassy to be led by "faulty
information," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States claimed to avoid bombing civilian
installations in its missile attack in Yugoslavia and to try and
reduce the losses of war to the minimum extent. If this is true,
the expert said, NATO should clearly mark what it should not
attack. The embassies of China and other countries should of
course be protected.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the Chinese embassy suggests the so-called
avoidance of civilian installations alleged by NATO is absurd and
sheer deceptive talk, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia as a "willful act"
and "barbaric aggression." The Chinese expert demands that NATO
take up a thorough investigation of its attack of the Chinese
embassy and give a real explanation.

<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Gambia have condemned the
military coup in Guinea-Bassau which led to the overthrow of
President Joao Bernardo Vieira last Friday, The Punch newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Tuesday in capital Abuja, Nigerian Head
of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar and Gambian President Yahya
Jammeh lamented that the coupists disregarded the efforts of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to find a
peaceful solution of the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern at the proliferation of conflicts in the
African continent and called on the parties involved in the
conflicts to embrace dialog in the spirit of African brotherhood
in resolving their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders commended the efforts of ECOWAS so far in
Sierra Leone, particularly the countries which contributed troops
to the peace-keeping operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
They also called for increased logistics and national support
for the West African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar and Jammeh who was on a visit to Nigeria noted
that the Sierra Leonean conflict had been exaggerated by external
sources and called on the countries concerned to cease the supply
of arms and other terms of assistance to the rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
stepped up an information drive on the recurrence of dengue fever
as part of its efforts to prevent an epidemic of the dreaded
disease, the Philippines News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Romualdez, secretary of health, was quoted as saying
that in view of the unpredictable weather in the country, his
department had been constantly distributing information and
education materials on dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
"Our expectation that the dengue epidemic might occur earlier
because of the change in weather did not materialize and it might
be due to our continuous effort of constantly warning the public,"
Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said his department will keep a close watch on the
number of dengue cases until August.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health said the situation was normal at
present, with 414 cases of dengue fever reported since the start
of this year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The dengue epidemic started in the country around June and
peaked between September and November last year, it said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
expressed here today an unconditional apology for the missile
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, on behalf of Germany
and NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said the explanation given by NATO on the tragic incident
until now is far from enough, and the Chinese government has every
reason to demand a comprehensive, thorough and in-depth
investigation into the incident and affix the responsibility for
it.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan today.
</P>
<P>
Tang told Schroeder that the remains of the three Chinese
journalists and the wounded Chinese diplomats were just returned
to Beijing this morning. The wanton bombing against Yugoslavia
conducted by the U.S.-led NATO has caused a tremendous
humanitarian catastrophe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO campaign has gone so far recently as to
attack the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, infringing seriously
upon China's sovereignty and constituting an atrocity rarely seen
in international diplomatic history, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese people expressed their
utmost indignation and condemnation over the attack, and have
launched the strongest protests and made the most solemn demands.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the German government and people felt deep
regret over the missile attack against the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia, and hope to express their great sympathy and
condolences.

<HEADLINE> Shas Party Supports Netanyahu in Israeli Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Spiritual leaders of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, the third largest bloc in Israel's
outgoing parliament, announced Wednesday their support of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The Shas Council of Torah Sages, led by spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, adopted recommendations made by party leader Aryeh
Deri that Shas followers vote for Netanyahu in the May 17 polls,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
A religious party of Sephardic Jews, or Jews of Middle East and
North African origins, Shas occupy 10 seats in the outgoing
parliament, ranking third after Labor and Likud, giving it a power
to make or break a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, spiritual leaders of Shas are moderate on the
Middle East peace process, but the party tends to favor a
right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
Deri, who was sentenced to four years in jail last month for
bribe-taking and other misconducts, called on his followers last
week to support hard-line Netanyahu in the elections.
</P>
<P>
But some say that the close ties between Deri and Netanyahu
might erode the support among conservative non-religious voters
for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Shas has been actively engaged in a battle with the High Court
of Justice, accusing it of making rules in favor of civilian laws
against religious laws, such as allowing shops to open on Sabbath,
the Jewish day for rest.
</P>
<P>
In return, supporters of the High Court criticized the
ultra-Orthodox for attempting to intervene in national affairs.

Schroeder said that the Chinese government has every reason to
demand a comprehensive, thorough and in-depth investigation of the
tragedy and to fix the blame, and he had made the same comment to
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also discussed Germany's position and that of the
Group-Eight Nations on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Tang emphasized that China has always said that there should be
a peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue and opposes NATO's use of
force, which only makes the issue more difficult and results in
very dangerous consequences.
</P>
<P>
It is definitely an act in violation of the UN Charter to
circumvent the United Nations and use force against Yugoslavia,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister emphasized that there are two crucial
points in a political settlement of the issue. The first is that
the U.S.-led NATO must stop bombing Yugoslavia immediately. It is
not realistic to talk about a political solution while bombing
Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second is that any political solution of the matter must be
agreed upon by Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, or any agreement
will be in vain, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Institute Condemns NATO Atrocity (RPT) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The air attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO is "an open violation of
Chinese sovereignty and it should be condemned in the strongest
terms," the head of the Pakistan Institute of Regional Studies
said.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua Wednesday, Nishat Ahmad,
director of the institute, said the NATO act is "extremely brutal"
and held that NATO should assume all responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Nishat noted that the NATO claim of hitting the Chinese Embassy
by "mistake" is "totally unacceptable" as the embassy is located
in Belgrade's residential area.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S.-led NATO to carry out a thorough
investigation of this attack, announce to the world the result at
an earlier date and punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and more than 20 others wounded in the
embassy attack last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nishat believed that NATO will not achieve its goal by
attacking the Chinese Embassy, but on the contrary it will arouse
strong opposition and condemnation among the world people.
</P>
<P>
Nishat also said all the actions in resolving regional and
international disputes should be taken under the auspices of the
United Nations. NATO is not in a position to represent the United
Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Farooq Moin, a senior journalist from Pakistan Press
International (PPI), told Xinhua that the U.S.-led NATO's
"barbarian act" against Yugoslavia and its latest attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is against the U.N. Charter and
related international laws.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his "utmost indignation and strong condemnation"
of the U.S.-led NATO's "outrageous act."
</P>
<P>
The United States is always trying to impose its hegemonism
around the world, Moin said, adding that the latest "deplorable
and terrorist act" should serve as an "eye-opener" for the world
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the strong response by the international community has
fully proved that the U.S.-led NATO is unpopular. It is high time
that the world community took serious note of this barbarian act
to ensure that this kind of tragedy will not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Moin is also of the view that the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
was hit deliberately as it is located in the residential area with
the red national flag flying high in the sky.

LUANDA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola and the Republic of Congo
(Brazzaville) have signed an agreement in northern Angola's
Cabinda City to guarantee the safety on their border, the official
Angolan News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement said that the two countries will take joint

National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have
used the oil-rich Cabinda enclave, which has a long border with
Congo (B) to launch assaults against the main land of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The government of Congo (B) President Denis Nguesso-Sassou, on
the other hand, is also eager for the help from Angola to fight
against its anti- government revels which seem to be on the

<HEADLINE> Majority of Chinese Dislike U.S.'s International Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- An independent survey has shown
that over 80 percent of China's citizens do not like the United
States' international policies and say that they feel like they've
been cheated and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Horizontal Research Group Inc. did a phone poll of
816 people in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to get their
responses to the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
and found that some 54 percent of them had bad feelings about the
international policies of the U.S. and did not like them.
</P>
<P>
According to the research company, some 30 percent said that
they used to like the U.S., and now feel that they have been
cheated and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that those below the age of 22 or between
31 and 55, as well as students, enterprise managers, and ordinary
workers have sharply changed their attitude about the United
States.
</P>
<P>
On hearing that the Chinese Embassy had been attacked, 61
percent of the people surveyed felt infuriated and about 20
percent were astounded.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent didn't believe that it was a mistake, but was
a premeditated action and only one percent said the event had
nothing to do with the United States government.
</P>
<P>
More than a third said that the U.S.-led NATO should apologize
and pay for the attack while most said that they will follow the
Chinese government's request and work and study harder and
participate in demonstrations against NATO's atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Iran Underlines Regional Arrangement for Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani here on Wednesday underlined the formation of a
locally-developed security arrangement to guarantee security in
the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Such a security arrangement acceptable to all Gulf states will
create the political, cultural, economic, security and military
tools necessary to difuse disputes and check the spread of
possible crises in the region without the presence of alien
forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Shamkhani blame
the security pressure on the region in the region on the
"unnecessary presence of foreign military forces."
</P>
<P>
Tehran believes that the presence of foreign forces in the
region is the main threat to the regional security and stability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Constructive talks between Iranian and Saudi officials enabled
both countries to develop a correct understanding of the
conditions of each country, the Iranian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent visit of Saudi Defense Minister Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz to Iran, he said that the most important
issues discussed in the talks included ways of providing the
ground for cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Gulf states had been cool since
the Islamic revolution in 1979, but they were improved after the
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami came to power in 1997
with a detente policy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Paper Urges NATO to Stop Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian English newspaper
the African Wednesday ran a commentary, urging NATO to stop
strikes at targets in Yugoslavia to save "innocent civilians."
</P>
<P>
Titled "Military Force No Solution in Balkans", the commentary
also called on world leaders to concentrate more on seeking
political solutions, instead of military solutions, to political
problems.
</P>
<P>
The daily said NATO's "accidental" missle attacks on the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Friday should be enough proof
that any regional or local war could easily degenerate into a
nastier confrontation of international dimension.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO's key objective was to bring the Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to his knees and make him negotiate
the future of minority Albanians, it said,"the strikes have killed
many innocent civilians, ethnic Albanians and Serbs alike".
</P>
<P>
"The dead includes the victims of the so-called 'stray'
missiles and bombs. Buses, hospitals and residential quarters have
been hit, in what the military calls 'collateral damage'."
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the strikes have precipitated a deeper
humanitarian crisis in the Balkans than preventing it," said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Around 700,000 ethnic Albanians are now camped in the
neighboring Balkan states and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"NATO should stop the air strikes now for the sake of human
life," the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> G. Bissau Parliament Speaker Named Acting Head of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Speaker of the Guinea-Bissau
parliament, Malam Bacai Sanha, has been named acting head of state
of the west African country to replace ousted President Joao
Bernado Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Sanha's appointment was recommended by rebel leader General
Ansumane Mane after the rebels overthrew last Friday President
Vieira who has taken refuge at the Portuguese embassy in capital
Bissau, The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said former President Vieira signed a document late
on Sunday, formally surrendering to the rebels who seized full
control of the west African country last Friday.
</P>
<P>
But his refusal to sign a formal resignation has stalled moves
to appoint Sanha as interim president until the elections planned
for November 28.
</P>
<P>
The rebels and the main political parties sought to transfer
power in accordance with the constitution which requires Vieira's
formal resignation.
</P>
<P>
Vieira has remained holed up inside the Portuguese embassy in
Bissau where he fled Friday after the rebel army stormed his
palace and crushed the 600-member presidential guards.
</P>
<P>
He has sought and was granted political asylum by Portugal, but
rebel hard-liners and much of the population want him to stand
trial on charges of corruption stemming from his 19-year rule.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Tuesday condemned the coup that led to the removal of Vieira,
saying, he "firmly condemns any measure that seeks to transfer
power by unconstitutional means tantamount to a coup d'etat."

LUSAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has received a credit of 840
million U. S. dollars from the World Bank to finance the Basic
Education Sub-Sector Investment Program (BESSIP), Zambia Daily
Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi who signed for Zambia Tuesday
said the project was the largest the government had managed to
organize and would lead to reduction of poverty, disease and
ignorance.

Meanwhile, World Bank resident representative Laurence Clarke
said the agreement would give a new lease of life to the Zambian
child.

during which 340 million dollars would be spent while another 500
million dollars would be used in the second phase which goes up to
2005.

<P>
Apart from the World Bank, BESSIP is being financed by Norway,
the Netherlands, the United Nations Agency for International

<HEADLINE> PNG Military Denies Rumors of Intervention in Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Jerry Singirok, Papua New Guinea's
(PNG) military leader, Wednesday blamed disgruntled troops with
ethnic links to MPs for spreading rumors that the military would
intervene when the government faces a no-confidence motion in
July.
</P>
<P>
Singirok, PNG Defense Force (PNGDF) commander, strongly denied
that there would be any intervention by the military, the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs recently expressed concern that security forces
would act if they were displeased by the outcome of an expected
no-confidence motion against PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate.
</P>
<P>
"There are no such operations in place, there is no such elite
force being prepared to influence the process of democracy on the
floor of parliament," Brigadier-General Singirok told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very effective and a good rumor that has absolutely
no substance."
</P>
<P>
Singirok said he met with PNG Opposition leader Bernard
Narokobi earlier Wednesday to reassure him that the military was
committed to the democratic process and protecting the national
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"In the meeting I highlighted that there may be disgruntled
elements of the military who are known already by us and who are
linked with politicians to destabilize the country, destabilize
the government and discredit the defense force," Singirok said.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the disgruntled to come out openly and state
their agenda.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to play politics they must resign from the PNGDF
and go and play politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singirok was reappointed PNGDF commander in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of military intervention in PNG politics have been
widespread since Singirok's reappointment.

The NATO attack is not only an open encroachment on the Chinese
sovereignty and a grave provocation against the Chinese people but
also a wanton violation of the norms governing international
relations including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,
said a statement of the association of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The association expressed indignation and condemned the
criminal air raid. It also mourned the dead and sent deep
condolences to the bereaved families and regards to the injured
people.
</P>
<P>
A missile attack on a diplomatic mission representing a
sovereign state is unprecedented in the diplomatic history of the
world and the criminals should be punished, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO should bear full responsibility for
their unpardonable crime and stop such brutal air raids at once.
</P>
<P>
The association warned if the U.S.-led NATO continues criminal
aggressive acts in Yugoslavia in defiance of the protests and
condemnation worldwide, it will face final failure and destruction.

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese cultural impresario made
three deep bows acknowledging two Chinese Beijing Opera
performers as his masters yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
Fukami Toshu, chairman of the Tokyo-based World Arts and
Culture Promotion Association, came to China especially to learn
this unique style of opera from the two well-known Chinese, Wang
Jinlu, who has gained fame for his martial arts performance, and
Ye Peng, a professor with the China Opera Institute.
</P>
<P>
Fukami said he plans to develop a new performing style
combining Beijing Opera and a form of traditional Japanese opera.
</P>
<P>
He said that these two opera styles will blend well and
influence each other.

<P>
Many Chinese experts in the field consider this idea a creative
one for the development of the two operas.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to teach a Japanese pupil," said 80-year-old Wang, "
this is another channel for cultural exchange between Japan and
China."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Issue State Bonds to Obtain Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government decided to
issue state bonds to mobilize capital from the public to finance
key infrastructure projects and the Vietnamese Communist Party
called on the entire Vietnamese people to buy the bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government, according to a report of Vietnam
News Agency Wednesday, has issued a decree saying the state bonds
issued this year will fund irrigation and other rural
infrastructure projects, especially those in the hardest-hit
communes.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government expects to raise about 3,000-4,000
billion Vietnamese dong (roughly 216 million-289 million U.S.
dollars) from selling the bonds.
</P>
<P>
The five-year bonds will be issued in the Vietnamese dong in 11
denominations ranging from 20,000 dong (about 1.44 dollars) to 50
million dong (about 3,595 dollars). The first bonds will be
available on May 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Finance said the bonds, which can be
bought by Vietnamese citizens and organizations as well as
overseas Vietnamese and foreigners, will carry an annual interest
rate of 1.5 percent plus the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of Vietnam in a directive on Wednesday called on the entire
Vietnamese people to buy the bonds for national construction.
</P>
<P>
The directive said, "The issuance of national construction
bonds is a major policy of the party and the state to fully tap
internal resources by encouraging the entire people to contribute
to national construction and development."
</P>
<P>
It further said Vietnam needs large investment for the on-going
national industrialization and modernization process which calls
for a mobilization of all available domestic resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's State Environmental
Protection Administration has promulgated a regulation on
assessing the environmental impact of construction projects, in a
bid to raise the efficiency of approving these projects and
enhance supervision over their pollution-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Environmental impact reports, forms and registers now must be
drafted for construction projects according to the volume of
pollution they will cause, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
The development of river valleys, new urban areas, and the
renovation of old urban areas should have their impact on the
environment carefully and thoroughly assessed before they are
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Medium-scale projects that have no affect on environment-
vulnerable areas, or have certain affects on local ecologies
without changing their composition or function, should be analyzed
and assessed for possible threats they could pose to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Tertiary sector projects having little or no affect on the
environment should be registered before they are carried out,
according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the environmental impact assessment system in
the 1970s, which has played an important role in keeping new
sources of pollution from arising.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Cobra Gold'99, the annual joint
military exercise between Thailand and the United States, started
Wednesday in the northeastern Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima
with the participation of 20,000 Thai and U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In what U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Richard Hecklinger
described as "the largest joint exercise in Southeast Asia," which
lasts 12 days, more than 20,000 American and Thai soldiers,
sailors, airmen and marines will train and live together in
locations throughout Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Our security partnership, which remains strong and vibrant, is
one of the main pillars of the overall Thai-American
relationship," Hecklinger said in his speech at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The annual exercise was inaugurated when the image of the
United States is taking a beating in Asia after last week's air
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Apart from the attack, Thailand has its own reason to feel
bitter toward the United States after the latter's opposition to
Thailand's candidate for the top post of the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Makes Top S. African Awards to Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela has
madeSouth Africa's top awards to the two men responsible for
Libya's agreement to hand over for trial in the Hague the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie aircraft crash in 1988, the
Citizen papers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Saudi Arabia's
ambassador to the United States, received the Order of Good Hope,
which is South Africa's highest honor to citizens of foreign
countries who have "contributed to the well-being of the people of
South Africa".
</P>
<P>
The Order of the Southern Cross, awarded to South African
citizens who have "made an exceptional contribution to the
well-being of the nation", was awarded to Jakes Gerwel,
director-general in the office of President Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The awards were made by Mandela at a ceremony in Cape Town,
legislative capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 747-100, travelling from Malta to New York, blew up
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, killing
all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Investigations led to two Libyan suspects, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
and Abel Basset Ali Mohammed al-Megrahi, who have now been handed
over for trial in the Hague under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the awards to Prince Bandar and Gerwel were in
recognition of their prominent role in bringing to a resolution
the Lockerbie issue, by having the two accused surrender to the
authority of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Prince Bandar and Gerwel undertook numerous trips to Libya and
held countless discussions with the authorities of Libya, the
United Nations, Britain and the United States, Mandela said.

MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- More than l.4 million Filipinos have
undergone technical or vocational training over the past three
years, a government news release said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These Filipinos were trained in 58 training schools supervised
by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority
(Tesda) and 2,106 other private and public institutions, the news
release said.
</P>

since 1995 and assisted 160,000 others through career guidance
over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Of Tesda's 1999 budget, about 67 percent was allotted for the
Tesda-supervised schools nationwide while the rest was set aside
for the agency's regional and provincial offices and training
centers.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada earlier unveiled a package
of non-wage benefits for the country's workers along with a flurry
of initiatives designed to create and preserve jobs amid the Asian

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO air strikes against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia entered the 50th day Wednesday. A
dozen cities and towns came under NATO missile and bombing raids
overnight from Monday till Tuesday, killing at least 10 people in
various locations.
</P>
<P>
The most severely hit area was the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
Some 20 NATO missiles fired to the area landed around a densely
populated residential area of ethnic Albanians, killing three
people including a four-year-old girl. Polje, Decane and Gornje of
Kosovo were also severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, NATO bombed Pancevo, Sombor, Valjevo, Subotica,
Belgrade, Smelderevo, Sjenica, Obrenovac, Cacak, Kraljevo, Sabac
and Vranje.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes targeted in their overnight attack a double-
decker bridge near the town of Velika Plana.
</P>
<P>
The two-lane highway linking Belgrade and Nis, the third
largest city of Yugoslavia, was damaged on one side, whereas the
railway below was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It was the 27th bridge that has been damaged by NATO bombing
ever since the air strikes started on March 24. Two other bridges
were also damaged during the overnight attacks.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday-Tuesday air raids, NATO warplanes also
targeted power lines near Grocka but did not cause serious damage
or black-out.

<HEADLINE> China's Dairy Product Output Exceeds Spirit Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in history,
China's dairy product output exceeded that of spirit alcohol last
year, according to the '99 China Animal Husbandry and Fodder
Industrial Trade Fair, which closed here recently.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's milk output was put at 8.45 million tons,
one million tons more than that of spirits, traditionally popular
among Chinese, according to a senior official with the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The country's milk output has been increasing at an annual rate
of 7.8 percent since 1989.
</P>
<P>
But the annual per capita consumption of dairy products in
China is only six kilograms, one-fifteenth of the world average
level. In Tianjin, dairy product consumption by infants and the
elderly make up only 26 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
This year, Liaoning and Jiangsu provinces have launched a
campaign urging each primary and secondary school student to drink
250 milliliters of soybean milk or milk a day.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is designed to wipe out anemia and rickets among
students and improve their health.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has instituted a series of policies to
encourage foreign investment and cooperation in the dairy product
industry.
</P>
<P>
A survey of urban resident's consumption conducted by the
National Bureau of Statistics showed that 35 percent of the adults
in the capital city of Beijing have the habit of drinking liquor,
and the figure was 46 percent in Chengdu, capital of southwestern
Sichuan Province, and 24 percent in Shanghai. The percentage is
higher in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to reduce annual spirits output to 3.5
million tons in the next few years. Last year, the output of
spirit alcohol in China dropped by 1.2 percent, according to the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
Surveys have showed that more Chinese, who used to drink liquor
only, are changing their drinking habits with the improvement of
living standards.

KUWAIT CITY, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said Israel's unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon and
the reconstruction of the war-torn country will top his talks in
Kuwait later this month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Arabic daily Al-Anba published
Wednesday, Hoss said he will bring with him a lot of files
concerning the Israeli occupation of Lebanon's territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon did not lodge a complaint with the
U.N. Security Council on Israel's attempt to annex the Lebanese
town of Arnon, because his country aims to achieve a "full
implementation of related U.N. resolutions" which called for
unconditional Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The minister will also seek more Kuwaiti investments in
Lebanon's reconstruction drive and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"I will meet with Kuwaiti and Lebanese investors to elaborate
on our future steps and facilities, as well as the projects
included in our new five-year plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hoss is scheduled to start a two-day official visit to Kuwait
on May 22.

Hoss visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt, two Arab heavyweights last
February, and Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in March.

MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Wednesday sacked the entire Russian government, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Kremlin announced that Yeltsin
dismissed Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov for failing to
rescue the floundering economy and named Interior Minister and
deputy Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin as acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, observers say that the reason for the sacking of
Primakov appeared to be the start of parliamentary impeachment
hearings against Yeltsin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition parties and government politicians have
criticized the dismissal, warning that Yeltsin now faced a major
fight for his own political survival.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaker of the Russian parliament lower house, the
State Duma, Gennady Seleznyov blasted the dismissal of Primakov as
"the biggest mistake the President could have made."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Seleznyov said the prospects of
Yeltsin's impeachment remain the same as before the sacking of
Primakov.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Act Not Supported by American Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of 17 American students
studying in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province,
today faxed a letter to the Chinese media saying that they do not
support the U.S. government's military intervention in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the letter:
</P>
<P>
"As American citizens currently living and studying in China,
we are writing to express our horror at the NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, and to extend our deepest
condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed.
We would also like your readers to know that many Americans do not
support our government's military intervention in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
On the night of May 7, the U.S.-led NATO forces fired missiles
from different directions attacking the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia, killing three journalists, wounding 20 others and
severely damaging the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
On learning the news, many foreign students studying in Nanjing
said they could not understand and oppose the barbarous act of U.S.
-led NATO, which was a wanton trample on the Vienna Conventions on
Diplomatic Relations and the basic norms of international
relations, and expressed condolences and sympathy to relatives of
the killed journalists.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy Condemned in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO's air attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade came under continuous condemnation
in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Chinese Embassy here, Professor Ballabh
Mani Dahal from the Tribhuvan University said "I strongly condemn
the barbaric attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, by the NATO attackers."
</P>
<P>
He said this is not only against international law, values and
norms but also an act of power politics and hegemony.
</P>
<P>
"The demands put forward by the Chinese government are
appropriate and NATO should fulfill them. The protests of the
patriotic and brave Chinese people have expressed the feelings of
the entire Chinese people," he said. "The world is in favor of
justice and peace. National sovereignty should be safeguarded."
</P>
<P>
Chairman Purna Bahadur M.A. of the Nepal-China Friendship
Society said in a statement that the society very strongly
protests against the NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia which has created a very sorrowful situation in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The society expressed the hope that the NATO's air attack on
Yugoslavia stops as soon as possible and peace prevails under the
U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Chinese Embassy here, former Health
Minister Sushila Thapa said, "I condemn the attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia by NATO and express condolences to the
bereaved families. This naked attack has neglected the
international law, values and norms and I support the demands of
the Chinese government."
</P>
<P>
She said, "NATO should immediately stop the attack on
Yugoslavia and respect its sovereignty, and the problem should be
resolved through peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
In an editorial Tuesday, the government-owned Gorkhapatra daily
observed that though a war can help achieve immediate interests,
it is not helpful to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is felt that the attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, has deeply shocked the peace-loving people of the
world," the vernacular newspaper said.

PARIS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A public opinion poll conducted by Liberation showed that
the French people are more pessimistic about the perspective of
the outbreak of a new world war than 13 years ago. The poll showed
that 41.7 percent of the French population are afraid of the
possibility of a new world war, as is compared with 32.2 percent
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
-- The grand tribunal of Paris announced on Tuesday that Jean-
Marie Le Pen is the only one who can use the name and logo of the
extreme right party National Front, while depriving Le Pen's rival,
Bruno Megret, of the right to use the same name for his splint
party.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO refused on Tuesday to give the least credit to Belgrade
on its announcement of a partial withdrawal of Serb troops from
Kosovo. NATO demanded a ``total and verifiable withdrawal'' of the
troops, while trying to rally Russia and China to the efforts for
a political solution.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac said on Tuesday that he did
not have ``reliable information'' on the withdrawal of Serb troops
from Kosovo and that he did not see an improvement of the attitude
of the Yugoslav government. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said the European Union wishes to be in charge of the future
interim administration in Kosovo with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Dismisses Government, Duma Suspends Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday fired the cabinet of Yevgeny Primakov in what he
described as "a difficult decision."
</P>
<P>
Following a 20-minute meeting in the Kremlin, Yeltsin accepted
the resignation of Primakov, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I made a difficult decision -- I dismissed Yevgeny
Primakov from his position of the chairman of the government,"
Yeltsin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government has accomplished a tactical task set for it in
full," Yeltsin said. "However, the situation in the economy is not
improving. Today, nine months after, the question about an
economic strategy still remains open."
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin was named as acting premier. Stepashin's candidacy has
been submitted to the State Duma, lower house of parliament, for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed the hope that Stepashin "is capable of adding
necessary dynamics and energy to the work of the cabinet."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma suspended its session on news of Primakov's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
"We now need to receive all the necessary documents, the texts
of the presidential decrees in order to further consider this
question in greater detail."
</P>
<P>
The Primakov cabinet was asked to continue working until a new
one is formed.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential candidate for
the 2000 elections, voiced his regret over the dismissal of
Primakov, stressing that "preventing emergencies is of crucial
importance today."
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of ruble dropped to 24.7 against the U.S.
dollar from 24.3 at the interbank market in Moscow. Observers
expect further devaluation of the ruble in the wake of Primakov's
removal.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, said the
leftist opposition in the lower house would appeal directly to the
Federal Council to initiate an extraordinary session in the upper
house of parliament because "Boris Yeltsin has deliberately staged
a new government crisis."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma has invited Primakov to appear in the lower
house when deputies resume their session later Wednesday, Itar-
Tass reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
extended 500,000 U.S. dollars to electricity cooperatives to
provide electricity to remote barrios in six Mindanao provinces in
the southern Philippines, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Implemented through the government's program of Energization of
Rural Areas for Progress, this project will bring closer to
reality the objective of making Mindanao the country's food
basket, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the economic benefits of rural electrification, the
move will also improve the peace and order situation and enable
rural folk to enjoy the amenities of a progressive life, they
said.
</P>
<P>
For areas in Mindanao and other parts of the country not yet
reached by electricity, the government also has a program to build
solar-power systems in these far-flung barrios, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Interior and Local Government is installing
1,000 solar photovoltaic packaged systems worth 25 million dollars
all over the country under its three-year Municipal Solar
Infrastructure Project.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada last year ordered
government agencies to mount a massive rural infrastructure
buildup in pursuit of his vision to combat poverty and attain
national food security.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Destroys Massive Arms Cache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- South African police Tuesday
destroyed more than seven tons of arms and ammunition found in
northern KwaZulu-Natal, The Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The arms cache, believed to have been supplied by the biggest
apartheid- era assassin, Eugene de Kock, was the largest to be
uncovered in South African history.
</P>
<P>
The cache, found Monday by detectives of the directorate of
public prosecutions on information of KwaZulu-Natal provincial
legislator Phillip Powell, was destroyed in a controlled explosion
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the massive blast knocked them off their feet
even though they were one kilometer away.
</P>
<P>
The bunker, where the arms were stored, had been cemented over
but rainwater had seeped in, rusting some of the armaments.
</P>
<P>
Convicted killer de Kock has admitted delivering six truck
loads of weaponry to Powell just before the 1994 election, but,
according to police, the cache uncovered at Nqutu outside Ulundi
had filled only two trucks.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were believed to have been destined for Mlaba camp,
run by Powell for training of Inkatha Freedom Party
self-protection units.
</P>
<P>
National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulelani Ngcuka said
the matter was still under investigation and arrests would soon be
made.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation involved more than one individual and
was a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The investigation would now focus on who the weapons belonged
to, the other people involved, and where the rest of the weapons
were.
</P>
<P>
The weapons found were believed to be enough to wage a
full-scale war and could destroy a sizable part of Durban.

<HEADLINE> China to See Balanced Timber Supply and Demand (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kou Wenzheng, a National Bureau of Forestry official, also said
that China will mainly rely on itself to solve this problem, and
will not greatly increase its supply of imported timber.
</P>
<P>
"We will only import rare timber varieties and large-diameter
quality hardwood, and solve the problem through planting more
forests in our own country and popularizing wood substitutes,"
said Kou, director in charge of forestry resources management
under the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Market sources also predicted that with economic
development and rising of living standard in rural areas, the
demand for timber there is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
"For farmers, the first and the largest item of consumption is
building and repairing houses," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rebuilding of some five million houses damaged
by the floods last year, mostly in rural areas, will need a
greater timber supply.
</P>
<P>
The prices for plywood and large-diameter hardwood will rise
due to the nation's intensified efforts to crack down on smuggling,
and the booming market in home decorating materials and fittings,
according to the Market.

<HEADLINE> China to See Balanced Timber Supply and Demand (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will witness a balance
between timber supply and demand this year, though regional and
structural short supplies will still exist, according to sources
with the Beijing National Timber Trading Market.
</P>
<P>
China's planned timber output this year is 49.36 million cubic
meters, sources said, adding that with the national policy of
expanding domestic demand and infrastructure construction, the
demand for wood will reach around 60 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
"But the deficiency of ten billion cubic meters can be
supplemented with imported timber and inventory," said Zhang
Shiwei, vice-president of the Market.
</P>
<P>
China imported five million cubic meters of logs and prepared
wood in 1998, and this figure is expected to rise this year.
</P>
<P>
Following last summer's severe floods, China launched an
ambitious plan to protect 80 percent of its forests from logging,
and to ban logging at the mouths, middle and upper reaches of
major rivers, and regions with fragile eco-systems.
</P>
<P>
"Though the logging ban will generate a certain impact in some
areas, "said Zhang, "it will not severely affect the timber supply
in the country as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He noted the regions where the logging ban is being carried out,
and in their surroundings areas, as well as north and northwest
China which has depended on timber supplied from the northeast,
will all experience a timber shortage.

<HEADLINE> Scholar: NATO Bombing, Unprecedented Violation of International Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Chinese legal
specialist said today the recent U.S.-led NATO bombing on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia is a case of "grave and
unprecedented violation of international laws."
</P>
<P>
Also calling the barbarous act good material sent by the U.S.
government for teaching, Cao Jianming, president of East China
College of Political Science and Law, said, "The attack overtly
violated international laws, and the United States and the NATO it
leads should bear serious responsibilities for the attack."
</P>
<P>
Cao has visited countries including Belgium, France,
Switzerland, the United State, and Japan and lectured in those
countries. He was twice invited to Zhongnanhai, the seat of the
Central Chinese Government, to deliver lectures on legal
construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S.-led NATO wantonly trampled over the Vienna
Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and the basic norms in
international relations in attacking the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, which killed three journalists, wounded 20 others, and
seriously damaged the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO forces interfered in the internal affairs of
a sovereign state and trod on the U.N. Charter and circumvented
the U.N. Security Council to carry out airstrikes in Yugoslavia,
committing grave crimes involving encroachment on human rights and
violation of humanitarianism, leaving more than a thousand
innocent people dead, and making hundreds of thousands of people
homeless, said Cao.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to safeguard international pacts and to
punish those responsible for the crimes in accordance with
international laws," said Cao.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the United Nations will stand at the side of the
just Chinese people, support the righteous statement of the
Central Chinese Government, introduce further measures including
passing a resolution or publishing a statement to condemn the
barbarous act of U.S.-led NATO, and stop the airstrikes on
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Welcomes U.N. Envoy to Visit Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations ambassador Robert
Fowler will visit Zambia, South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe,
Botswana, Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on a fact
finding mission on the failure of U.N. sanctions to work against
the rebel movement in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Information Minister Newstead Zimba who welcomed the
move disclosed the impending visit in a statement released in
Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted Zimba, who also is
the Chief Government Spokesman, as saying the move would clear
Zambia of alleged gun- running to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Peace would only return to Angola once the sanctions were
successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fowler would investigate loopholes through which UNITA could
evading sanctions and recommend ways of sealing them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Saturday unanimously voted to
institute a probe on why the sanctions were failing.
</P>
<P>
"The peace protocol on Angola was signed in Lusaka in 1994 and
we want that Accord to work because it will entail peace not only
in Angola but also in the whole Southern African Development
Community (SADC) region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimba confirmed the talks between Zambia and Angola
over the allegations of gun-running started Monday in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
"The talks which are chaired by Swaziland are aimed at
resolving the differences which arose from Angolan accusations
that Zambia was supplying arms to the UNITA that Zambia has
constantly denied," Zimba said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 Changchun citizens in
northeast China's Jilin Province have participated in harnessing
the city's Yitong River beginning one Mother's Day, May 9.
</P>
<P>
This activity, organized by the Changchun Evening Newspaper and
the city's Environmental Protection Bureau, has received strong
support from the local residents, and many people spent their
weekend clearing rubbish and plastic bag litter along the river
banks.
</P>
<P>
The river is the mother river in the mind's of the local people.
"Whenever I speak of my mother, I feel proud. However, our mother
river makes me feel depressed and even ashamed," said one pupil,
but he added at once that they are quite willing to do something
to return beauty and cleanness to the river.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 families also took part in the city's tree-
planting activity last month. Wang Mujie, a retired official of
the Jilin Department of Water Resources, used her savings of 10,
000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars) to plant trees. "I have done this,
simply because I know how important the trees are to our
environment, and I have just done what I can," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"We come from different parts of the country, and Changchun is
our second hometown. Therefore, we also want to make our
contribution to its environmental protection. And wherever we go,
we will miss it, " said Wang Jing, a college student at Northeast
China Teachers University, who attended the activity with 14
classmates.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuanjun, the city's vice mayor, said during the tree
planting that it is the duty of every citizen to protect the
environment, and he is sure that conditions will improve a lot
when every one realizes this and decides to do something about it.

<HEADLINE> Pak Institute Condemns NATO Atrocity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The air attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO is "an open violation of
Chinese sovereignty and it should be condemned in the strongest
terms," the head of the Pakistan Institute of Regional Studies
said.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua Wednesday, Nishat Ahmad,
director of the institute, said the NATO act is "extremely brutal"
and held that NATO should assume all responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Nishat noted that the NATO claim of hitting the Chinese Embassy
by "mistake" is "totally unacceptable" as the embassy is located
in Belgrade's residential area.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S.-led NATO to carry out a thorough
investigation of this attack, announce to the world the result at
an earlier date and punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and more than 20 others wounded in the
embassy attack last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nishat believed that the NATO will not achieve its goal by
attacking the Chinese Embassy, but on the contrary it will arouse
strong opposition and condemnation among the world people.
</P>
<P>
Nishat also said all the actions in resolving regional and
international disputes should be taken under the auspices of the
United Nations. The NATO is not in a position to represent the
United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Farooq Moin, a senior journalist from Pakistan Press
International (PPI), told Xinhua that the U.S.-led NATO's
"barbarian act" against Yugoslavia and its latest attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is against the U.N. Charter and
related international laws.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his "utmost indignation and strong condemnation"
of the U.S.-led NATO's "outrageous act."
</P>
<P>
The United States is always trying to impose its hegemonism
around the world, Moin said, adding that the latest "deplorable
and terrorist act" should serve as an "eye-opener" for the world
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the strong response by the international community has
fully proved that the U.S.-led NATO is unpopular. It is high time
that the world community took serious note of this barbarian act
to ensure that this kind of tragedy will not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Moin is also of the view that the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
was hit deliberately as it is located in the residential area with
the red national flag flying high in the sky.

<HEADLINE> China Obtains Priority Rights for Ocean Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China has obtained the exclusive
right to prospect and priority rights to exploit mineral resources
in 75,000 square kilometers of international seabed near Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Association for Research and Development
of Oceanic Mineral Resources, the country has just concluded an
eight-year prospecting effort in 150,000 square kilometers of
international seabed, and has retained rights in half of the area
for further exploration and development, with the other half being
handed over to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China's half is estimated to contain 423 million tons of
mineral deposits.
</P>
<P>
The international seabed, which makes up 49 percent of the
earth's surface, is rich in natural resources, especially mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates
that every country may prospect and enjoy priority in opening up
natural resources in the international seabed if it obtains UN
approval and returns half of the prospected area to the UN.
</P>
<P>
China is the fifth-largest investor in undersea mining,
following France, Japan, Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
Since it received UN approval in 1991, China has made nine
scientific expeditions to this seabed near Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Support for Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is expected
to speed up the creation of a comprehensive support system for mid-
and small-sized enterprises in a bid to promote healthy growth of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) is generating a
set of policies to encourage and improve the development of these
enterprises, Shao Ning, director general of SETC's Enterprise
Reform Department, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the China Investment Forum 1999, Shao said that
facilitating the development of small enterprises is vital for
injecting new vigor into the national economy, increasing
employment opportunities, and improving the economic system of the
socialist market.
</P>
<P>
As the government continues to make efforts in this regard, "a
bigger stride will be taken in the building of a credit guarantee
system for mid- and small-sized enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other support systems are also under "earnest construction,"
in areas such as technological innovation, training, and
information and management consultant service, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government will strive to create an
economic environment that meets the demands of a market economy
and establish a market order of fair competition among enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shao also said that the reform of state-owned enterprises will
not only improve the development of China's economy and
enterprises, but also create more opportunities for international
cooperation, which is conducive to further opening the country to
the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Macao Women Eyeing for More Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A noted woman here hoped that the
future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will
create more opportunities for women to participate in political,
economic and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The wish came from Ieong San Man, chairwoman of the Council of
the Macao Women's Federation, during an exclusive interview with
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"Women are an important social force in Macao and we hope that
the future SAR government will pay due attention to women's
participation in political affairs and create more opportunities
for them," Ieong urged.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that more women will be employed as civil servants,
particularly medium- and high-level civil servants. She also said
that the future SAR government should attach keen importance to
issues pertaining to the rights and interests of women and create
better conditions for women in terms of schooling of their
children.
</P>
<P>
"We should encourage more women to go out of the kitchen and
engage in political, economic and social activities," said Ieong,
who is also member of the Selection Committee for the first
government of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
About 52 percent of Macao's 450,000 residents are women and
they have done a great deal of work in the process of Macao's
return to the motherland, which will fall on December 20 this year,
Ieong noted.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 women in the 60-member Preparatory Committee for
the Macao SAR and 39 women in the 199-member Selection Committee
for the first government of the Macao SAR, according to Ieong.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the Macao SAR will usher in a new era
when Macao people will be the masters of their own destiny, and
the Macao SAR will need more capable people to work for it," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, women should be given more opportunities to improve
themselves in order to meet the need of the social development,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
In the election of the first chief executive of the Macao SAR,
both candidates, Edmund Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au Chong Kit, have
gone to the Women's Federation to solicit their opinion, Ieong
said.
</P>
<P>
In face of a poorly-performing economy and a problem-laden
public order, the future chief executive of the Macao SAR will
have heavy tasks to tackle, she said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Expects Faster Economic Growth: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of China's
central bank said here today that the national economy has been
running well this year and will probably grow stronger than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese government will take further
measures to support the sound development of the economy, said Liu
Mingkang, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, at the
China Forum 1999 which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the first quarter this year, the overall
landscape of our economic and financial situation continues to be
relatively stable," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) grew 8.3 percent in the three
months, with trade surplus amounting to four billion U.S. dollars,
and foreign exchange reserves rising to 146.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"These strong figures heighten expectations that our growth
will surpass the target of seven percent this year," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has adopted a pro-active fiscal policy and
appropriate monetary policy to stimulate domestic demand, Liu said
these measures have contributed to the overall healthy performance
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"As events unfold this year, we will continue our supportive
efforts in many areas," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank will allow more flexible interest
rates with much wider spreads to support small and medium-sized
enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
Loan facilities will be expanded to quicken readjustment of the
economic structure and technological renovation, he said, adding
that financial facilities for mortgage loans for housing and cars
are now in place.
</P>
<P>
"We will also create and implement new policies to support
direct foreign investment," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the vice-governor said that China will
continue to adhere to the opening-up policy in the financial arena.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, 25 foreign banks had been allowed to begin
doing business in the yuan, 19 in Shanghai and six in Shenzhen.
The total assets of foreign banks in China have reached 35.6
billion U.S. dollars, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
"We will see stronger determination and a faster stride in
opening our financial market once we enter the World Trade
Organization," Liu said.

NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The China Development Bank of
the People's Republic of China Tuesday launched successfully a 500
million U.S. dollar bond in New York.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates investors' strong confidence in China," said
Chen Yuan, governor of the bank, after signing an agreement with
representatives from Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney who
are joint leading managers for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
Chen said it is a landmark transaction given that the China
Development Bank is the first non-sovereign Chinese entity to tap
the international capital markets since the Asian financial crisis
last year.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the transaction will be mainly used to fund
foreign currency-denominated loans extended by the Bank to finance
construction projects in China.
</P>
<P>
The issue was over subscribed by 2.5 times and was widely
distributed among investors in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Interior Decoration Booming in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's interior decoration
industry is expected to gain 80 billion yuan (964 million US
dollars) annually beginning next year, as an increasing number of
Chinese households are choosing better decorative building
materials to spruce up their homes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Construction show that the
total cost of housing decoration nationwide exceeded 75 billion
yuan in 1998, up 50 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But that only represents 70 percent of the nationwide demand
for home decoration, said a senior expert with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said the fast-growing national economy and the steady rise
in Chinese living standards have created a strong demand for
comfortable and tasteful residences.
</P>
<P>
And more wage-earners, including workers, teachers, scientific
and technological personnel and governmental office staff can now
afford well-decorated and well-equipped homes.
</P>
<P>
Along with food, clothing and entertainment, ordinary Chinese
residents are now spending more on home decoration. In addition to
big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin, Nanjing,
Shenzhen, Dalian and Chengdu, a great number of medium-size and
small cities are also witnessing a boom in home decoration.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that more than 60 percent of China's urban
households have decorated their homes at an average cost of more
than 20,000 yuan. The total cost of home decoration materials in
Beijing exceeded 2 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the state's housing development plan for the next
10 years, China will complete the construction of new residences
with a total annual floor space of 200 million square meters, and
provide 4.5 million urban households now facing housing
difficulties with comfortable homes.
</P>
<P>
The expert expects that by the year 2002, the country's total
housing floor space will exceed five billion square meters, and a
potential total of 83 million apartment units will be well-
decorated, at a total cost of some 30 billion yuan each year.

the country's coal sector.
</P>

coal industry, will take steps to produce according to market
demand, adjust their product mix, and lower production costs.
</P>
<P>
So far, effective results have been scored in the provinces and
autonomous regions of Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guizhou,
Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other coal-producing

NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The inter-bank borrowing rate in
Kenya has gone up by 2.05 percent to an average of 11.15 percent ,
said the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in its weekly report on
economic indicator.

assets which can be quickly converted into cash and include
deposits from non-financial firms like building societies, but

The Central Bank report said the interest rates on the short
term 91-day Treasury Bill increased to 9.67 percent in Monday
auction from 9.46 percent Friday, and commercial banks' average

percent in the previous week, while the average overdraft rate
stayed stable at 21.07 percent, the reported added.

KAMPALA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda-based Chinese companies
Tuesday strongly condemned the U.S.-led NATO missile attack of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has claimed to be the human rights
champion throughout the world, turns out to be the very country to
trample the basic human rights, the representatives of the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
They termed the attack as barbaric and brutal, saying that the
U.S.-led NATO should take full responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
"This is a harsh insult to the peace-loving Chinese people and
the NATO forces should take all the serious consequences of this
inhumane attack against Chinese diplomats," said Zhao Shijie,
Manager of Beijing Engineering Company Uganda Limited.
</P>
<P>
He said this showed that the U.S.-led NATO is pursuing hegemony
and gun- boat policy.
</P>
<P>
All the personnel with the China No.1 Automobile Manufacturer
Uganda Limited said that nobody with common sense could take this
as a "tragic mistake" as U.S. President Bill Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese medical team, working in a Ugandan hospital in
Jinja, 80 kilometers east of capital Kampala, said that NATO's
missile attack of Chinese embassy constitutes the gross violation
of international laws and the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
They vowed to work harder for their motherland and continue to
condemn the NATO's attack until the 19-member military bloc meets
all the demands set by the Chinese government.

HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Tuesday condemned the "barbaric action" of the U.S-led NATO
missile attack of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the barbaric action," Mugabe told Xinhua at the
Harare International Airport after returning from his visits to
Singapore, China, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that the bombing is a sign of the NATO's
lawlessness. This is a law of jungle by the NATO," the president
pointed out.

The U.S.-led NATO forces attacked the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade last Friday with three missiles, killing three Chinese
journalists and wounding more than 20 embassy staff members.

Mugabe also said that his visit to China is very successful,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Terms Development as China's Long-term Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Development is China's long-term task
and China hopes to establish and develop friendly cooperative
relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-Existence, said a top Chinese leader here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remarks when addressing a luncheon hosted in his honor by four
major economic organizations in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Li is paying a five-day official visit to South Korea, the
first leg of his four-nation tour in Asia and Africa, which also
covers the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
China has scored globally acknowledged achievements over the
past 20 years since it introduced the policy of reform and opening-
up, Li said, citing facts that the national comprehensive strength
of China has been raised with its trade and economic ties with the
rest of the world keeping expanding, the people's living standards
improving step by step and noted progress registered in all social
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He added that what is more important is that China has set up a
new course of development that conforms to China's own situation.
China now enjoys economic prosperity, political stability,
national unity and social progress and the nation is full of vigor
and vitality.
</P>
<P>
However, Li admitted that China is still economically
underdeveloped and quite a few problems are yet to be tackled.
This shows that China's grand development objectives cannot be
attained easily. Therefore, he stressed, development is and will
be a long-term task of China. Barring a large-scale foreign
invasion, China will stick to the objective of development.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, China needs a healthy international
environment -- an environment of lasting peace -- which is one of
the prerequisites for China to concentrate on economic
construction. However, China will not trade principles concerning
issues of national sovereignty and dignity, Li said, adding that
that is the Chinese people's tradition.
</P>
<P>
China's development will benefit the whole world, Li noted. The
so-called China threat is no more than an excuse created by
certain people in a vain attempt to check or restrain China's
development for fear that a stronger China may stand in their way
of threatening others, Li noted.

coming from different directions. The "wicked" attack resulted in

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey showed that all the
mobile phones produced in China have met state standards, but some
problems remain in the sales and circulation of mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
The State Quality and Technological Supervision Bureau
conducted a survey of Chinese and foreign manufacturers and
wholesalers of mobile phones in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Dongguan and Hangzhou at the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that in the production field, all the mobile
phones are qualified according to state standards. But in sales
and circulation, only 66.7 percent of the mobile phones surveyed
met state standards.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that foreign-funded companies still
dominate China's mobile phone market, as they are concerned with
the quality of their products and follow strict quality control
systems.
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey also indicated some problems, such as
fake certificates for entering telecommunication networks and low-
quality batteries, still remain in the mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 40 foreign-funded mobile phone
manufacturers and business agents in China, with over 70 models or
types of products. The number of mobile phone users in China now
has surpassed 24 million.

<P>
ABU DHABI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has decided to participate in any international peace-keeping
force that will be stationed in Kosovo, the local media said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE will participate in imposing peace if there is a need
to do so," Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chief of staff of
the UAE armed forces, was quoted by the official WAM news agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added the UAE is engaged in dialog with the United Nations
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision is not linked to any military cooperation
agreement signed by the UAE with Western powers.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf state has a joint defense agreement with Britain and
it holds joint military exercises with the United States, Britain
and France regularly to strengthen the combating capability of its
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has sent huge amounts of relief materials to Kukes,
Albania, for the Kosovo refugees since NATO launched air strikes
against Yugoslavia late March.
</P>
<P>
It also spent some 3 million U.S. dollars building a refugee
camp in the north of Albania and rehabilitating an airport in
Kukes aimed at increasing the flow of aid to the Muslim refugees
in the area.

TAIYUAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 hanging coffins have
been found along a one-kilometer-long cliff on Guancen Township in
Ningwu County in Shanxi Province in north China.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this is the first time such coffins have ever been
found north of the Yangtze River, and it is of significance for
the study of burial custom in north China.
</P>
<P>
Some of the hanging coffins were found in caves along the cliff,
while others were supported by boards attached to the cliff.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hanging coffins that have been discovered in China
were either of the Ming (1368-1644) or Qing (1644-1911) dynasties,
and it is estimated that people in those times used this method of
burial to save farmland. Yet the mystery of how such coffins were
brought up to the cliffs still remains.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Industry Reports Initial Success in Output Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry is
making progress in controlling steel production in the weak
saturated domestic steel market.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the output of 46 major iron
and steel companies dropped by a wide margin compared with the
same period last year, with total output standing at 24.62 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Since early last year, an oversupply of rolled steel has
triggered significant price drops, and many state-owned
enterprises are losing profits.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Metallurgical Industry (SAMI)
announced that steel output will be cut this year in order to
adjust the imbalance between supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the SAMI said that in the first two months of this
year, steel output decreased by 30,000 tons and iron output
overall dropped by 70,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Company stopped operating
outdated machines and reduced steel and iron output by 10 percent
in the first two months this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province in east China projected a reduction in steel
output down to 960,000 tons in the first half this year, which
will be 10 percent less steel produced than in the first half of
last year.

<P>
WELLINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's resident
population was estimated at 3,807,500 at March 31, according to
Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Dianne Macaskill, deputy government statistician of New
Zealand, said in a Wednesday media release that the figure
represented an increase of 19,300, or 0.5 percent, from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's average annual population growth rate for the
previous five years was 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
A big change in net migration figures is the main factor in the
 slower growth, according to Macaskill.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gorilla Park to Reopen in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Virunga National Park in
northern Rwanda will be reopened next month, thus leading to the
resumption of tourism after three years of closure because of
armed insurgency by Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
"The Virunga National Park was closed in june 1997 following
insurgency in the northwestern region," the director of the
National Tourism Office, Lt Col. Denis Nkizinkiko underlined.
</P>
<P>
He said, during the insurgency, about 40 workers from the
National Office For Tourism (ORTPN) were killed by the
infiltrators in Ruhengeri from neighboring Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Antoine Mudakikwa, coordinator of the Mountain
Gorillas Veterinary Project, the Virunga National Park hosts 320
Gorillas.
</P>
<P>
"About 2,653 tourists visited the Virunga National Park in
1996, bringing around 311,000 U.S. dollars throughout the year,"
Mudakikwa noted.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the closure of Virunga National Park had got
a negative impact on tourism in northwestern Rwanda and the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government missed the foreign currency that used to
come from tourism and the park.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a 45-day seminar opened in Ruhengeri
Prefecture in northern Rwanda in preparation for the reopening of
the park.
</P>
<P>
"The seminar which regrouped 70 guides is aimed at training the
staff in para-military, technical information in ecology and
behaviors of the animals," said Kenneth Cameron, who is working at
the Veterinary Center.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the activities in the Virunga park is a sign
of the total return to normalcy of this area which had become the
breeding ground of the armed Hutu insurgency.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Ashes of Killed Chinese Arrive in Beijing From Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ashes of the three Chinese
journalists' killed in U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia were brought back to Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Returning on the same special flight was a government special
mission to handle the case.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, vice president and Standing Committee member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, and other senior Chinese officials were among those
greeting the special mission at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Also back aboard the special plane were six seriously injured
people and some 20 other embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
The mission left Beijing for Belgrade on May 9 to handle the
case.
</P>
<P>
At 9:55 a.m. local time, the special plane arrived in the
Capital International Airport, and Cao Lei, 19-year-old son of
Shao Yunhuan, the killed female Xinhua journalist, stepped out of
the plane holding a cinerary casket draped with a five-star
national flag.
</P>
<P>
Also back was Cao Rongfei, Shao's husband and the first
secretary of the Chinese embassy, who was severely hurt in the
attack. His retinas came off and his left eye lost sight
completely.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Cao did not know that his wife had left him forever,
nor did he know that his son was aboard the same plane. People did
not tell him the truth for fear that excessive sadness will
aggravate his eye wound and lead to the loss of sight all his life.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, a young couple and both Journalists
from Guangming Daily, were also killed in the attack. Zhu's father
Zhu Fulai was holding two cinerary caskets, one for his daughter
and the other for his son-in-law, which constituted one of the
most tragic scenes in the world.
</P>
<P>
Without funeral music, but guided by the five-star national
flag and four guards of honor, relatives and colleagues of the
deceased held the cinerary caskets and pictures of the martyrs,
and passed through crowds of Chinese leaders and representatives
of all walks of life at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Hu extended welcome to the wounded on behalf of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council. "People of the motherland thank
and welcome all of you. And we have been concerned about you all
the time," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said he hoped that the wounded will recover
soon. He also warmly embraced with the wounded.
</P>
<P>
Six school children presented bouquets of flowers to the six
severely injured diplomats, Ren Baokai, Liu Xinquan, Liu Jinrong,
Zheng Haifeng, Yang Yongfeng and Cao Rongfei.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Rally Outside US Embassy in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 angry Chinese students
and scholars protested outside the U.S. embassy here on Wednesday
against NATO's air attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Justice", "Punishing criminals", "Stop bombing", the
protesters demanded from the U.S. government and its NATO allies
an open and official apology, an independent and thorough
investigation and severe punishment for those who are directly
responsible for the attack, killing three Chinese correspondents
and injuring more than 20 at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
In a peaceful rally, the protesters held high placards calling
for justice and denouncing the attack.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the U.S. embassy in Australia, the
protesters said "NATO's subsequent blame of intelligence failure
and outdated maps (for the bombing) is completely not acceptable."
</P>
<P>
"Three 'precision' missiles blasted the embassy from different
angles, which completely exposed the aggressors' evil intentions,"
according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
"The lip-service of 'sorry' for a 'mistake' expressed by U.S.
leaders and other NATO officials cannot whitewash their crime
against humanity and international law," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters dispersed about half an hour later before they
handed over the open letter to the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, about 100 Chinese demonstrators gathered outside
the U.S. Consulate in Perth, capital of the state of Western
Australia, to protest against the NATO air attack.

<HEADLINE> NATO-Killed Chinese Woman Journalist's Father Writes to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Fulai, father of Zhu Ying, one
of the Beijing-based Guangming Daily's two correspondents killed
in the NATO missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on
Friday, sent a letter on Tuesday to U.S. President Bill Clinton,
protesting against the atrocities perpetuated by the U.S.-led NATO
forces.
</P>
<P>
In the letter entitled "A Letter to Chelsea's Father, U.S.
President Bill Clinton," Zhu Fulai said, "I am a Chinese and
father of two daughters and a son-in-law. I am now writing to you
in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Earlier today, I went to
pay respect to my daughter Zhu Ying and my son-in-law Xu Xinghu,
whose lives were both taken by NATO forces under your leadership
in the attack on the Chinese Embassy. Looking at the horrible
sight of their remains, my grief was beyond words."
</P>
<P>
Zhu told Clinton in the letter that he had a happy family and
his daughters loved their parents very much. Zhu Ying, his eldest
daughter, got married only in the fall of 1997. "When our family
were having dinner together, the house was always permeated with
warmth and cheerfulness," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"I can visualize that when you are together with your wife and
daughter, Chelsea, you must be feeling as happy as I used to be.
But now, all I can do was stare at the remains of my daughter and
my son-in-law. They can no longer smile to me and greet me -- they
have left me for ever."
</P>
<P>
"My daughter was merely 27 years old. Had she, or her husband,
ever obstructed you in any way? (Were they killed) simply because
they were Chinese journalists staying at the Chinese Embassy?" Zhu
asked.
</P>
<P>
He said both his wife and himself had believed that the Chinese
Embassy was the safest place for their daughter and son-in-law to
stay in in war-torn Yugoslavia, "but who could have imagined that
you and your NATO would go so far as to attack the Chinese Embassy!
"
</P>
<P>
"Two young innocent people fell in a raid ordered by you,
deprived of their rights to live on," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that back at his home in Beijing, his wife
was tearful all day and his son-in-law's mother, living in a
village in southern Jiangsu Province, was struck unconscious by
the news of her son's tragic death.
</P>
<P>
"The happy life in these families has all been shattered!" the
letter read.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the tragic situation inflicted by you, don't
you, as a father, a human being and a person who has been
preaching human rights all times, feel obliged to say something?"
</P>
<P>
"It is my earnestly hope that you understand that we Chinese,
like you Americans, do not want to lose our happy life. They
deserve the same rights of existence as your people do," Zhu
Stressed.
</P>
<P>
He concluded the letter by wishing the Clintons a happy life!

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Bangladesh Sign 2 Cooperative Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Bangladesh signed two
agreements on Tuesday to boost cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam and Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad signed
here a cooperative agreement on water resource development and
flood control in an attempt to minimize the impact of natural
calamities, according to reports of the local press Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are prone to floods which continually undermine
the national development in the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers Tuesday also signed an agreement to
exempt holders of Vietnamese and Bangladesh diplomatic and
official passports from normal visa requirements when entering
each other's country.
</P>
<P>
The signing took place shortly after the arrival of Bangladesh
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad in Hanoi on Tuesday for a
three-day official visit at the invitation of Vietnamese Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Tuesday, the local press said, the two foreign
ministers agreed that bilateral ties had developed strongly after
the visit of the then Vietnamese prime minister Vo Van Kiet to
Bangladesh in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
They agreed, however, Vietnam and Bangladesh should work harder
to utilize their potential in trade and cooperation in farming,
water conservation, agricultural food processing, reduction of the
impact of natural calamities and reduction of poverty and hunger.
</P>
<P>
Cam and Azad agreed that efforts must be exerted to boost the
execution of already-signed agreements and to have more regular
exchange of visits by business leaders so as to expand bilateral
cooperation to a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Azad invited Cam to visit Bangladesh, and the invitation was
accepted by the latter. The visit will be arranged through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Foreign Minister Azad was received on separate
occasions by Vietnam's Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh and Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Program to Ensure Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Export Development
Board (EDB) launched a program to ensure the growth of its
exports to key markets, the official Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three key markets of the United States, European Union (EU) and
Japan account for 72.8 percent of the total exports, said Laxman
Hewawasam, director general of the EDB.
</P>
<P>
There are about 40 percent export going to the United States
alone which is Sri Lanka's largest export market.
</P>
<P>
However, Hewawasam did not give details of the program.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 Lankan entrepreneurs export over 3,000 products and
services.
</P>
<P>
Until 2005, Sri Lankan exporters are assured of a stable export
market in the United States and EU countries, the newspaper quoted
Hewawasam as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's total exports earned 4.7 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, an increase of two percent over the figure for the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
This performance is considered favorable in comparison with
other Asian countries, the director said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sri Lankan exporters had to face competition from East
Asian countries where there was a marginal price competition, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is focusing its export strategies on the South Asian
market which will be a single market area in a few years. It is
also expected to be a market for Sri Lankan exports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Gov't Forms Team to Ensure E. Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Tuesday formed a government team to monitor and ensure the
security of a direct vote to be held under the United Nations
auspices in East Timor on August 8.
</P>
<P>
The team comprises of Coordinating Minister for Political and
Security Affairs Gen. (ret) Feisal Tanjung, Minister/State
Secretary/Minister of Justice Muladi, Minister of Defense and
Security/Indonesian Military Chief Gen. Wiranto, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas, Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan
Hamid, National Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi and Head of National
Intelligence Coordinating Board Lt. Gen. (ret) Z.A. Maulani.
Feisal was named the team leader.
</P>
<P>
The team was established because the president did not want any
trouble to disrupt the direct vote, in which 800,000 residents in
East Timor will decide whether to be independent or remain a part
of Indonesia, Muladi said after a meeting with Habibie on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the result of the direct ballot will be, there should
not be a single fault in its implementation and it must be
absolutely secured. For the sake of Indonesia's reputation, we
should not tolerate any engineering," Muladi was quoted by
national newspapers Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Annex I of the agreement between Indonesia and
Portugal signed in New York last week, Indonesia will be
responsible for maintaining peace and security in East Timor to
ensure that the popular consultation is carried out in a fair and
peaceful way in an atmosphere free of intimidation and violence.
</P>
<P>
A number of international civilian police will be available to
advise Indonesian police during the popular consultation process.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia early this year announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

NANNING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A baby weighing just under one
kilogram born four months ago in the city of Liuzhou in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region now has survived thanks
to local doctors' timely medical treatment and care.
</P>
<P>
The female infant was born around 6:00 p.m. on the evening of
January 17 in the city's Women and Children's Health Care Center.
Doctors at the Center say they are now satisfied with the
condition of the little girl.
</P>
<P>
"But in the first week, her condition was rather dangerous
owing to her tiny weight and the mother's pregnancy of only 27
weeks," one doctor said, adding that during the first month after
birth the baby had a very weak cry and couldn't suck to take milk.
</P>
<P>
On the eighth day, the baby rallied after emergency treatment
after losing her heartbeat and breath for a while, according to
the doctor.
</P>
<P>
To tend to the baby, the medics were providing carbohydrates,
protein, and vitamins through a nose-feeding device.
</P>
<P>
The girl now has grown to 2.1 kilograms and is able to suck
milk from a bottle since leaving the hospital two weeks ago.

<P>
HOHHOT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- More and more animals can be seen
now in the Greater Hinggan Mountains area in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region since a hunting ban went into effect in
the area three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Local residents often see roe deer, red deer, wild boars, hazel
grouses, and hares seeking food around their houses.
</P>
<P>
Over-hunting in the area once caused the disappearance of roe
deer, hazel grouses, and red deer in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the hunting ban began, three ethnic groups in the region,
the Ewenki Nationality, the Oroqen Nationality, and the Daur
Nationality, have turned from hunting to farming.
</P>
<P>
"Bears were once hardly seen in this area. Now, they appear.
They have even bitten one of my cows to death, " said Ke Ligeng,
an afforestation worker who lives in the northern part of the
mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lin, in charge of security in the area, said that besides
the hunting ban, they have also imposed severe punishments on
those dealing in wild animals, and restaurants serving them up as
dishes.
</P>
<P>
He said that they took over 28 guns, more than 40 wild animals,
and punished over 20 illegal hunters in a case uncovered at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
There are over 340 species of wild animals in these forests,
more than 100 of which are under state protection.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government to Raise Funds For SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
serious in its plan to financially support the training of
athletes to compete in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei in August, said Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Agung
Laksono.
</P>
<P>
Agung insisted that, apart from the 5.5 billion rupiah (about
687,000 U.S. dollars) allocated by the National Planning Board (
Bappenas), the government would help the National Sports Council(
KONI) raise funds for the training program.
</P>
<P>
"I know that it is difficult now to find sponsors. I insist
that the government should contribute. I am optimistic that
Bappenas could add extra money from other ministerial spendings in
the State Budget", he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Agung said that President B.J. Habibie was likely to approve
KONI's suggestion to offer tax reductions to companies who
contributed to the SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the president has approved the suggestion. He
asked KONI for further details," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the tax reduction policy, companies which contribute to KONI
will be awarded cutbacks in their corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
"We will ask all companies for contributions, either foreign or
private local companies," he added.
</P>
<P>
KONI is facing difficulties in financing athletic training
programs and accommodation for athletes competing in the Games. It
asked Bappenas for 22.3 billion rupiah, but the board agreed to
give only 5.5 billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the 5.5 billion rupiah to be disbursed in
June, KONI borrowed 500 million rupiah from its treasury to
finance athletes' board and lodgings, pocket money, recreation and
laundry costs. The training program started last week.
</P>
<P>
However, it has only funded key athletes who will compete in
Brunei. The remaining athletes are being financed by their sports
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It will ask the board for another 7.2 billion rupiah for the
athletes' transportation fees and their accommodation in Brunei.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Alarm System Set up in South China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The city of Liuzhou in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region has set up an advanced flood forecasting
and alarm system as part of this year's flood-control effort.
</P>
<P>
Liuzhou, the largest industrial city in Guangxi, has been hit
by three severe floods over the past decade. The Liujiang River
which runs across the city imposes great threat during the summer.
</P>
<P>
The new system, still in trial operation, is able to update
information on rainfalls and water levels every 15 minutes instead
of the previous every hour from local flood-control stations, and
the advance warning time is shortened from four hours to 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, its accuracy rate on rainstorm and flooding
prediction improves from 70 to 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the system has the ability to predict rainstorms
and floods 48 hours in advance, 12 hours more than before.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 10 million yuan, the system consists of a
control center, a branch, four satellite relay stations, five
short-wave stations, and 64 distant survey stations for rainfall
and water levels.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raid on Chinese Embassy Condemned in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO's missile attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday was a deliberate one,
Second Vice-President of the Colombian House of Representatives
Sergio Cabrera Cardenas said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the Colombian legislator refuted
the U.S.-led NATO's claim that the attack was "a technical error."
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that NATO, which is equipped with the
most sophisticated military technology, could have "mistakenly"
located the embassy, he said.
</P>
<P>
But NATO does have committed a grave blunder by militarily
attacking a sovereign country such as Yugoslavia bypassing the
United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, director of the "World in Flight" television program,
Hector Mora Pedraza, said that the attack on the Chinese Embassy
showed NATO and the United States' contempt of human lives.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Chinese Embassy here on Monday, the
well-known program director expressed his most sincere condolences
with the Chinese victims in the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, three NATO missiles attacked the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, leaving three journalists killed and over 20
embassy staff members wounded.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Rice-Producer Grows More Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China,
the country's biggest rice-producer, has plans to plant 400,000
hectares of corn this year, and the area is expected to reach 530,
000 hectares by next year, with corn output amounting to 2.5
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
More farmers in the province have preferred growing corn to
rice, as better economic results can be achieved by growing corn.
For example, farmers can make 100 to 200 yuan more from a single
unit of corn than from a single unit of rice.
</P>
<P>
This is part of China's agricultural production structure
adjustment. In the past, rice-growing areas were mostly located in
south China and corn-growing areas were mainly located in the
north, with the Yangtze River, China's longest river, the dividing
line.
</P>
<P>
Thus, rice produced in the south and corn produced in the north
had to be shipped to meet demands, causing great losses and higher
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
This situation has changed in the past few years. Incomplete
statistics show that areas devoted to rice-growing in northeastern
China where corn and wheat are mainly planted have reached 1.2
million hectares, and the proportion of rice output in the
region's total grain output has risen by 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the rice supply has exceeded demand due to decreasing
demand by the northern provinces and increasing output in south
China, thanks to the widespread use of hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the climate and soil of south China is
suitable for growing corn, and that the rotation of corn and rice
is also good for improving soil quality, and have called for more
measures to help farmers promote corn production in Hunan Province.

difference from Arsenal with 42 goals against Arsenal's 41.

at home Sunday against Aston Villa, Manchester United was to play
relegation-threatened Blackburn on Wednesday and close the season
at home on Sunday against Derby.
</P>
<P>
However, the Premier League title will be not be settled until
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both Arsenal and Leeds had numerous chances to score before
Hasselbaink broke through in the 86th to hand Arsenal its first
league loss since December 13.
</P>
<P>
Leeds was denied its early 1-0 lead with a minute to play in
the first half when Ian Harte missed a penalty.

Latin America on Tuesday joined the wave of condemnation of the U.
S.-led NATO for its attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
Friday which left three journalists killed and more than 20 other
persons wounded.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter to the Xinhua Buenos Aires Bureau, the
Association of Latin American Reporters, the Association of Latin
American Correspondents and the Latin American Press Club
expressed their outrage at the NATO barbarity and lamented the

sovereign state as "insane" and "a crime against humanity."

In Panama, the Panamanian Reporters Union (PRU) strongly

intervention in Yugoslavia is driven by Washington's desire for
world hegemony.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's General Election to Be Held as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and 48
political parties had agreed to go ahead with the planned general
election on June 7 and implement it in a democratic way, according
to Antara News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The parties pledged to make all possible efforts to create
peace, order and security during the campaigning, on the polling
day as well as in the post-election period.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached and the pledge made at a meeting
between the parties' representatives, the General Election
Commission and a few cabinet ministers as well as the Indonesian
Armed Forces and State Police chiefs here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government and the parties also agreed that they would
accept whatever the outcome of the election would be.
</P>
<P>
Other points agreed upon were that all parties needed to
develop mutual respect and communications among their leaders at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
The political parties also agreed to avoid excessive mass
mobilization and speeches that would incite violence.
Representatives of religion-minded parties also stated that they
would refrain from citing religious verses in their campaign
speeches or slogans.
</P>
<P>
All of the 48 political parties agreed they would each appoint
personnel from their own ranks to help security forces in dealing
with mass behavior during the campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is bracing itself for an upsurge in violence ahead of
the ballot, the first to be held since the resignation of
president Soeharto a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Many observers say it is inevitable that violence will occur,
particularly after campaigning officially starts next week.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief of the Indonesian Police Lieut. Gen. Nana Permana
said recently that a 62,000-strong security force is being
prepared to safeguard Jakarta during the May 19 to June 5 campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Police Chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman said his
office will involve members of each party's task force in the
citywide security effort in an attempt to prevent clashes among
party supporters.

<HEADLINE> Slow Flowing River Results in Economic Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Areas around the lower reaches of
China's second longest river, the Yellow River, are plagued with
economic losses because of the decline of water flow.
</P>
<P>
Unusually dry conditions have caused losses of 26.8 billion
yuan to the industry and agriculture in the areas over the past 20
years, with four billion yuan attributable to just last year,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The lack of water also reduces the flow of silt and impedes
flood prevention efforts in the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, which carries more sand than any other river
in the world, normally should carry one billion tons of sand into
the Bohai Sea every year.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure has dropped to 0.6 billion tons, said Cheng
Yiji, director of the Yellow River Mouth Treatment Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the volume of water carried from the upper
reaches of the river - 15 to 20 percent over the past 20 years -is
the top reason for the dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
Currently only around 10 billion cubic meters of water run
through Henan and Shandong provinces every year, which covers the
lower reaches of the river, and in contrast, only two billion
cubic meters reached the Bohai Sea in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 overseas Chinese in Ukraine
rallied in front of the U.S. Embassy here Tuesday afternoon,
protesting the barbaric attack of the Chinese diplomatic mission
in Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Holding banners reading "Chinese people are not to be
humiliated" and "Down with modern Fascism," the demonstrators
delivered a protest letter to the U.S. Embassy, in which they
strongly condemned NATO's wanton trample on international law and
diplomatic pact in its missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
They said the attack, which killed three journalists and
wounded more than 20 people, was a serious provocation to the
Chinese people and fully exposed the U.S. wild ambition to be
overlord of the world. The protesters vowed that they would go all
out to defend the state sovereignty, national dignity and world
peace.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its NATO allies should take up all
responsibilities and consequences of the raid, the letter demanded.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An Italian volleyball player,
instead of a beach volleyball player, will be banned for doping if
his federation fails to prove his high level of epitestosterone in
the World Championships was natural, the World Volleyball
Federation (FIVB) said in Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, FIVB president Ruben Acosta said it would not forfeit
one of the Italy's victories that led to its third straight world
championships even if Simone Rosalba is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Acosta said FIVB's medical commission would meet in Lausanne on
May 25 with the Italian federation, FIPAV, to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
Both samples of Rosalba, a substitute in the World
Championships in Japan last November, tested high for
epitestosterone which is a chemical related to the performance-
enhancing male hormone testosterone after the team's quarterfinal
victory over the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
FIVB had confirmed at its annual meeting last week that in the
future a team would lose any match if one of its players was found
to be doping.

<HEADLINE> Graf Gets Win in 1,000th Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf had a lucky escape in
her 1,000th match as a tennis professional when she fought from 3-
1 down in the final set to a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win Tuesday
over Yugoslav qualifier Sandra Nacuk at the tournament where she
claimed her maiden career title, the 1.04-million-dollar German
Open.
</P>
<P>
Gaf, 29, had to fight for one hour 37 minutes and needed some
moral-boosting support as the game was interrupted by rain early
in the second set before prevailing on her first matchpoint.
</P>
<P>
The third seed Graf then received two big bunches of flowers
for her 1,000th match, one from tournament officials and another
from long-time rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain.
</P>
<P>
"Luckily I managed to win. I didn't even know I won my 1,000th
match," said Graf, who by getting the numbers wrong only
highlighted her confusion on the day.
</P>
<P>
Graf in fact claimed her 888th victory (to 112 defeats) in her
professional career spanning 17 years and highlighted by a record
377 weeks as world number 1, and 106 career titles - among them 21
Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
Her first career title came 1986 in Berlin, as tournament
director Ewald Wensky suggested Tuesday to rename the contre court
to "Steffi Graf Court" once she has ended her career.
</P>
<P>
Graf has won nine times in Berlin, but Tuesday's game almost
ended in one of her worst career defeats against the 102nd-ranked
Nacuk, similar to the 6-0, 6-1 clobbering she received at the same
event in 1997 against Amanda Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
Playing her first singles match on clay in almost two years,
Graf failed to hold serve through the first set and piled up
unforced errors. Nacuk impressed with baseline winners and claimed
the set after just 26 minutes in front of a stunned 5,000-crowd.
</P>
<P>
Graf improved slightly after the rain-delay at 2-1 in the
second set and levelled the sets at 1-1 courtesy of a sixth-game
break.
</P>
<P>
But she had to come from behind in the third again as Nacuk
raced off to a 3-1 lead with a break at love in the fourth game.
Graf rallied to lead 4-3, but needed to stave off two break points
before moving further ahead for 5-3. That did it and Graf wrapped
up matters two games later with a fine forehand passing shot.
</P>
<P>
The German Open boast almost the entire world elite led by
world number 1 Martina Hingis of Switzerland.

BEIJING -- China's leading newspaper, the People's Daily, has

security.

accident" can never be accepted. (People's Daily-Commentary)

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Israel' Court Decision on Palestinian Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
welcomed a decision by Israel's Supreme court that stops Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from closing Palestinian headquarters
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that a confrontation has been avoided and we
welcome that," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in a tough re-election fight, has tried to close the
offices to demonstrate his intention to maintain Israel's control
over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the State Department avoided any comment on
Netanyahu's move to close the offices. But after the Israeli court
blocked him, the State Department on Tuesday welcomed the ruling
and said it was important that both sides continue efforts to
resolve the dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The State Department also said peace talks between Israel and
the Arabs should be based on U.N. Security Council resolutions
adopted after the 1967 to 1973 Mideast wars.
</P>
<P>
This means the United States would assert Israel's right to
live within secure borders and for Israel to give up territory the
Arabs lost in the conflicts. But the resolutions did not call on
Israel to relinquish all the land captured in the war.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 1-Billion-Dollar Loan to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Tuesday that its board of executive directors has approved a loan
of 1 billion U.S. dollars to South Korea to help the government
strengthen structural reform efforts for achieving long-term
financial stability and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the second tranche of the 2-billion-dollar Second
Structural Adjustment Loan (SALII) to Korea, which was first
approved last October and was part of an internationally
coordinated support package for the East Asian country. The first
of the two equal tranches was disbursed last October.
</P>
<P>
"The second tranche of the loan underscores our support for the
government of Korea's strong and comprehensive reform program,"
said Sri-Ram Aiyer, World Bank's country director for Korea.
</P>
<P>
Key areas of focus for the program supported by the loan are
financial sector reform, corporate sector reform, labor market
reform and strengthening of social safety nets.
</P>
<P>
"While the reform initiatives so far have been impressive,
Korea will need to continue to broaden and deepen its reform
program," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"With continued progress on reforms, Korea will be able to
consolidate the economic recovery and lay the foundation for a
return to sustained growth," it added.
</P>
<P>
The second tranche of SALII is a single currency loan in U.S.
dollar for 15 years including 5 years' grace period. The amount
has an interest rate of 6-month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 75 basis
points.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Brings Ecological Disaster: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The NATO bombing of petrochemical
factories in Yugoslavia may result in ecological disaster,
according to a U.S. research institute.
</P>
<P>
The dangers arise from the direct releases of toxic materials
to air, soil and water as a result of the bombings, said the
Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IEER) in Maryland
in a press release reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The institute said dangers also come from the indirect effects
such as the increased risk of nuclear power plant accidents.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has undertaken actions that could put large numbers of
people at risk in Yugoslavia as well as in other countries," said
Dr. Arjun Makhijani, IEER President.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that NATO provide a full accounting of why
these plants were bombed, and what assessments have been
undertaken of their direct and indirect consequences for present
and future generations," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Among the industrial facilities that NATO has bombed is a
combined petrochemical, fertilizer and polyvinyl chloride
manufacturing complex in Pancevo, near Belgrade, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Among the chemicals reportedly released as a result were
phosgene, vinyl chloride monomer, ethylene dichloride and ammonia,
IEER said.
</P>
<P>
"These are highly toxic chemicals used as feedstocks and
intermediate materials in chemical manufacturing", it said.
</P>
<P>
IEER said petroleum and other toxic chemicals in the Danube
could affect the drinking water and food supply of people
downstream.
</P>
<P>
It also increases the risk of a severe nuclear power plant
accident at the Kozluduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria,
downstream from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Council Condemns NATO Attack of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Council for Afro-China Affairs
Tuesday condemned the U.S.-led missile attack of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here Tuesday, the council said that
NATO's move is "totally incompatible with the assumption of mutual
respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all
states granted by the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
The attack which killed three Chinese people in the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade last Friday was "primitive, barbaric," the
statement said, questioning the entire motives of the alliance
military involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The council views the attack on the Chinese embassy as a sign
of ill will and a resurgence of the cold mentality which still
exist in the dominant American ruling circles, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council resolved to urge the Nigerians to show solidarity
with Yugoslavia, whose facilities and people are the objects of
NATO's indiscriminate attack, and demonstrate solidarity with the
Chinese people whose embassy in Belgrade had come under the attack
of the West alliance forces in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the United Nations to exercise its foremost
responsibility to prevail on the U.S.-led NATO to halt its attack
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Afro-China Affairs is a platform for promoting
closer economic, social, cultural and intellectual relations
between the peoples of Africa and China.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Economic Development in Lithuania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Tuesday that it will provide a total of 220 million U.S. dollars
in loans to Lithuania under a three-year assistance program to
support the economic development in the former republic of Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The bank's board discussed Tuesday the Country Assistance
Strategy for Lithuania for mid-1999 to mid-2002, which covers the
following three main areas: human development, macro-financial
stability, and accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The Bank Group will support Lithuania through policy advice
and dialogue, economic and sector work, and selected lending
operations," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that Lithuania's development is currently characterized
by a stable political system, solid economic growth, low
inflation, and reasonable progress on structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
But the bank cautioned that while most longer-term economic
fundamentals remain sound, the crisis in Russia has fundamentally
altered the country's short-term path.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining sustainable growth and managing the resulting
increase in macroeconomic risks will require a near-term policy
response combining a fiscal adjustment with systematic structural
reforms to limit quasi-fiscal deficits in key sectors," the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
"These measures will also help Lithuania meet its overarching
medium-term goal of EU membership, as well as laying the
foundation for a more rapid convergence of living standards toward
EU levels and for sustained reductions in poverty," it added.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Canada Protest Against NATO's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- About 800 Chinese Canadians,
Overseas Chinese, and Chinese students in Ottawa, the Capital of
Canada, rallied and demonstrated Tuesday afternoon to protest the
barbaric bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by the
U.S.-led NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered in front of the American embassy in
Ottawa, carring banners with slogans such as "Strongly protest
against NATO's bombing of Chinese embassy," "Against hegemony,
Support world peace," "Canada for peace, not for war" and holding
high placards reading "NATO stop killing!" "Stop NATO's barbarian
act!" "Canada out of war!"
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by Federation of
Ottawa-Carleton Chinese Organizations, which consists of 23
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Mr. P.J. Chiu, the President of the Federation handed over a
protest letter to Ambassador of the United States in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
the letter said:" At midnight last Friday, the US-lead NATO
forces fired three missiles from different angles on the Embassy
of the Peoples Republic of China in Yugoslavia. This deliberate
attack killed three Chinese journalists and one embassy officer,
injured more than 20 embassy staff and devastated the building."
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of NATO's bombing of sovereign Yugoslavia,
the United States and NATO have been violating the Charter of
the United Nations. The United States and NATO have gone even further
to trample the international laws by wantonly attacking the
Chinese embassy last Friday," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
"We remind President Bill Clinton and the U.S. government with
an old Chinese saying: 'Whoever plays with fire will perish by
fire,'" the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterwards, the demonstrators held a protest rally at
parliamentary square.
</P>
<P>
The Federation President P.J. Chiu, also handed over a protest
letter to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chreten.
</P>
<P>
The letter said:" The Kosovo issue is an internal affair of
Yugoslavia and can only be resolved by the involved parties
themselves through peaceful negotiations and diplomatic channels,
under the guidelines of the United Nations. It's obvious that
NATO's bombing has escalated the confrontation in Yugoslavia,
killed numerous innocent civilians and drove more and more ethnic
Albanians out of their homes."
</P>
<P>
The federation said in its release that this act of protest is
also to urge the Canadian government to maintain Canada's image as
a peacekeeping force, not as an aggressor, and not follow the U.S.
foreign policy of intervening in the internal affairs of the
sovereign country.
