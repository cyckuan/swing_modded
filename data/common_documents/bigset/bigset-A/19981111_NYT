ARMY SECRETARY HAILS SPIELBERG FILM AS LESSON FOR YOUTH

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of Veterans Day, Secretary of the Army
Louis Caldera said that he hoped the film ``Saving Private Ryan''
would help young Americans who have never known war understand the
meaning of military service.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic and gripping World War II movie has rekindled
interest in the conflict even as the generation that fought it
fades from public life, Caldera said Tuesday at a meeting with
Daily News reporters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have started thinking, Hey, maybe that elderly
guy in front of me was in World War II,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Caldera, the issue touches on more than pride in his
organization. For years, America's civilian army has faced
declining interest among the young people it needs for recruits, he
said. Many have no memory of war, with the exception of the brief
Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say the words and you can see the comprehension in the
person's eyes, but they still won't understand the emotional
content of what you're saying,'' said Forrest Frields, a Thousand
Oaks planning commissioner and Vietnam veteran. ``To even have a
glimmer of what's being said, you have to experience it
firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said he did not know whether the film had yet spurred an
increase in recruitment. It has, however, drawn more visitors to
the French cemeteries shown in the movie's opening and closing
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera is spending most of the week in Los Angeles after a
one-day trip last weekend to Central American countries ravaged by
Hurricane Mitch. Nearly 1,000 U.S. Army soldiers are working to
help deliver food and rebuild bridges in the battered region, and
more are on the way, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Whittier resident and state assemblyman said the
devastation he witnessed dwarfs anything wrought by Southern
California's winter mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, people have to tell you that there used to be
a town there, because it's now just brown mud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 bridges in the region will have to be rebuilt.
Caldera noted that after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake,
reconstruction of a single span of the Golden State Freeway took
months, despite all the resources available.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries have hundreds of situations like that and a
fraction of the resources,'' he said.

HACKETT HEADACHE: BIG RIVALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been a fairly satisfying year for USC so far,
but coach Paul Hackett knows that the success of his inaugural
season will probably be determined by how the Trojans fare in their
final two games, against archrivals UCLA and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the true judge of the season. Let's face
it, if we lose our last two games, everyone will say, `How did they
do? Well, they went 7-5,''' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hackett was perplexed over USC's seven-year losing
streak to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's more important than beating UCLA. It's still
incomprehensible to me that we lost seven straight years,'' Hackett
said. ``Maybe I'll see clearer after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time USC defeated UCLA and Notre Dame in the same year
was in 1981, and those weren't back-to-back games. The last USC
team to sweep both schools on consecutive weekends did it in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we there yet? I don't know yet,'' Hackett said. ``Can we
beat them on back-to-back weekends? That's tall stuff. We have to
be ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Will R. Jay play? Wide receiver R. Jay Soward wore a boot on his
sprained right ankle Tuesday, as his status for the UCLA game
remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been hurt,'' Hackett said. ``I don't know how we
can predict anything. Obviously, we'll be super-super cautious this
week. Maybe in the middle of next week, we'll know more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like that never gets hurt. It hasn't happened before.
This is very hard. There's nothing you can do about this. We know
how great he's played against UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward declined comment Tuesday when asked by reporters about
his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Another commitment: USC has received an oral commitment from
Long Beach Poly wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who is rated as an
All-American by most recruiting services.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's teammate, All-American cornerback Darrell Rideaux,
currently favors USC over Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Bastianelli hurt: Wide receiver Mike Bastianelli suffered a
sprained medial collateral ligament in his knee against Stanford
and will be forced to wear a brace for the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   It is not expected to cause him to miss any games.

FORMER STUDENT CONVICTED OF KILLING SON OF TIME WARNER CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page.)   (sw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 19-year-old former student of Jonathan Levin was
convicted on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the May 1997
slaying of Levin, a Bronx public high school teacher, in his
Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But in a setback for prosecutors, the jury acquitted the
defendant, Corey Arthur, of first-degree murder, apparently
unconvinced that Arthur fired the shot that killed Levin, the son
of Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur faces 25 years to life in prison. If he had been
convicted of first-degree murder, he would have been sentenced to
life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors left the courthouse on Tuesday night without commenting
on their eleven hours of deliberations, but it appeared that they
rejected the testimony of the prosecution's lead witness, Carlethia
Weeks. Ms. Weeks, Arthur's former girlfriend, had testified that he
confessed the killing to her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weeks admitted under cross-examination that she had heard
voices in her head since she was a child and had seen a
psychiatrist about the problem. Prosecutors have not commented on
whether they knew of Ms. Weeks' psychiatric problems when they
placed her on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's mother, Carol Levin, expressed disappointment with the
verdict on Tuesday night in an emotional statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy about this,'' Ms. Levin said. ``There is no
happiness in this.'' She added, ``John wouldn't have been happy
with this verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury's ruling essentially meant that prosecutors proved only
that Arthur and his 26-year-old codefendant, Montoun Hart, tortured
his former teacher until he gave them the code to his bank card and
robbed him of $800, not that Arthur personally killed Levin. Hart
will be tried separately on second-degree murder charges in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur shook his head and muttered to himself when the guilty
verdicts were announced. His mother, Penny Bostick, sat motionless
and Arthur's current girlfriend began weeping.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Levin, who spoke for the first time publicly about the
murder, praised her son's life and criticized defense lawyers for
raising drugs in the trial. Defense lawyers suggested that drugs
may have been a reason Arthur was in Levin's apartment that night.
But an autopsy found no drugs in Levin's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt those who loved John very much to hear the defense
spin fictions about his life,'' she said. ``John lived a noble
life. He was a very honorable man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said that her son lived for his students and would not
have been able to achieve what he did in life if he had used drugs.
She said he gave selflessly to his students and that he responded
to Arthur's phone call the day of the killing because that was his
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would probably be very disappointed in Corey Arthur,'' Ms.
Levin said on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Levin led some public-school teachers to question
how accessible they should be to their students outside of school,
and turned Levin into a symbol of public service.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur was a student in Levin's English class at Taft High
School in the Bronx during the 1993-1994 school year, and the young
teacher apparently took the troubled youth under his wing. At the
time, at least, the two were close.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page, handwritten thank-you note that Arthur wrote to
Levin in 1993, he called the teacher his ``true and only friend in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have shown me that it is alright to step in and help
someone,'' he said in the letter. ``You have shown me not all
people want to use and exploit me.''
</P>
<P>
   The note concluded: ``Wherever I get in life, I owe it to you
and for that I am entirely grateful. I am also lucky and most happy
to call Jake or John Levin my friend. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin wrote in a paper for a graduate school class he was taking
at the time that Arthur showed promise and that reading the note
from Arthur nearly brought him to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers painted starkly different
portraits of what happened in their relationship. Defense lawyers
said the two remained close and argued in the closing statements on
Monday that Arthur would never have killed his former teacher. They
argued that cuts Arthur suffered on his hand at the time of the
murder occurred when he tried to stop one of his accomplices from
stabbing Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on God's earth that he would kill him,''
George Goltzer, one of Arthur's defense lawyers, said in his
closing statement. ``There is no way on God's earth he would harm
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said that Arthur and Levin had grown apart by
May 30, 1997. The former student took advantage of his previous
relationship with his former teacher to gain entrance to his
apartment. Twice during the trial, prosecutors played a tape from
Levin's telephone answering machine that recorded Arthur calling
him at 4:55 p.m. on the day of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Levin, this is Corey,'' the voice on the tape says. ``Pick
up if you're there. It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and Hart did go to visit Levin, and prosecutors said they
attacked him and tied him up with duct tape. The teacher was
tortured with a knife, including three cuts made across his throat,
until he gave up the code to his bank card. At 5:15 p.m, a man
identified by a witness as Hart withdrew $800 from Levin's bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors portrayed Arthur as the leader of the two. His
fingerprints were found on the roll of duct tape and his DNA was
found on the knife used to torture Levin. Blood from Levin was
found on Arthur's clothes. While the gun that killed Levin was
never recovered, prosecutors argued that Arthur was the only one
with a motive to kill his former teacher because he could later
identify Arthur to the police.

ANOTHER TOOL LEFT INSIDE BOEING PLANE DURING ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Another tool has been found in the rudder of a Boeing
airplane, this time on a new 777 operated by EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which can seat more than 300 passengers, had been
flying with a hammer in a ``critical'' part of the rudder since the
new 777 was delivered to EgyptAir last year, according to an
internal Boeing document obtained by the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-ounce hammer, left in the rudder during assembly of the
777 in Everett, Wash., in 1997, was found by EgyptAir mechanics
during an inspection late last month. By the time it was
discovered, it had already caused two small cracks inside the
rudder, apparently from bouncing around during flight.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Post-Intelligencer reported that a 5-pound
bucking bar, a tool use by riveters, was found inside the rudder of
a United Parcel Service 767. It punched small holes and dents
inside the rudder. As in the case of the EgyptAir 777, the bucking
bar was left in the rudder during assembly of the 767 in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   And in yet another recent incident involving what's known as
FOD, or foreign object debris, being left in new Boeing airplanes,
a 777 was grounded after the batteries of a flashlight left in a
wing during assembly corroded and shorted out a landing light.
Boeing would not identify the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The FOD problem is considered so serious that Boeing's Everett
factory is in the process of implementing a new policy that will
require workers to check out their tools at the start of each
shift, and check them back in.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing builds its widebody jets _ the 747, 777 and 767 _ in
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanic at the B.F. Goodrich airplane maintenance facility in
Everett, where the bucking bar was discovered in the 767's rudder,
said it is not uncommon there to find all kinds of tools that were
left in Boeing planes during production.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from flashlights to wrenches and pliers have been
found in the wings and flaps of new Boeing planes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the tools are found during what is known as a ``C
check,'' which is the first major overhaul a new airplane undergoes
after it is delivered to a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we get a new Boeing plane in for a C check, the
standing joke is, `I wonder what tools Boeing has left for us
today,''' said the mechanic, who worked on the UPS 767 when it was
recently overhauled. He asked that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing confirmed Tuesday that a flashlight was recently found in
the wing of a 777. The problem was uncovered by airline mechanics
only after the flashlight batteries corroded and shorted out a
landing light.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokeswoman declined to identify the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' Tim Copes, Boeing's quality assurance
manager for the 777 program, said Tuesday in an interview about the
EgyptAir incident. ``It's a breakdown of the system and something
we take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Copes said he may be asked by Boeing management to fly to Egypt
to personally offer the company's apology over the hammer incident.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents in which tools have been left in Boeing planes
during production come at time when the company is struggling to
produce a record number of airplanes. The quality of those planes
has raised concerns by longtime customers. UPS and United, for
example, recently complained to Boeing executives about customer
service problems, including quality control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both United and UPS opted to buy new planes from Boeing's rival
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir is the national carrier of Eqypt and a longtime Boeing
customer. The airline ordered its first airplane from Boeing, a
707, in 1966. The 777 in question was the second of three of the
widebody jets delivered to EqyptAir by Boeing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Airline representatives at Egypt-Air's office in New York were
not familiar with the hammer incident when contacted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident is detailed in an internal Boeing document
known as an ``ACT (airline concerns team) investigation activity
report.''
</P>
<P>
   The hammer was discovered when the rudder panels of the 777 were
removed by EqyptAir mechanics in October, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The rudder is a critical flight control surface in the the tail
of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of the hammer has caused two cracks at the rudder
hinge ... '' the report said. One crack measured 1.5 inches and the
other measured 1.75 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area is deemed to be a critical area in the 777 ...'' the
report stated, and added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be advised that EgyptAir is upset with finding this
hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Copes said the 16-ounce hammers are used throughout the Everett
factory and are painted bright orange so they can be easily spotted
and not left in an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the color of a hunter's jacket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hammer was apparently used by a worker during assembly to
help drive in the pins that hold the rudder to the 777's tail,
Copes said.
</P>
<P>
   The hammer was found in a rudder compartment that could be
accessed by hand but was too small for workers to stick their heads
in and check to see if any tools were left behind before the rudder
panels were closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Boeing's quality control program, after workers have
attached the rudder to the tail, another person is supposed to
inspect the rudder before it is closed to make sure no tools have
been left inside. This person then signs an ``OK to close''
inspection record.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the rudder compartment where the hammer was found
was too small for peek inside, a mirror should have been used to
aid in the check for such debris, Copes said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the EgyptAir incident is similar to the one involving
the UPS 767.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, he said, the tools left behind in the rudders
were used by workers to help tap in the pins that hold the rudder
to the tail.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 was delivered to UPS in September 1996 and the bucking
bar was not found until this past September.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic who worked on the 767 at the B.F. Goodrich facility
in Everett said the bucking bar, which has sharp edges, punched a
small hole in a plate that covers a much more critical compartment
directly below that has the rudder control motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have taken a while, but the bucking bar could have
eventually ended up in that more critical compartment,'' the
mechanic said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing gave UPS a new rudder because of the damage caused by the
bucking bar.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Mark Sanders, Boeing's top quality
assurance manager for Everett's 747, 767 and 777 production, said
the company has made significant progress in educating workers
about the dangers of foreign object debris in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing offers non-cash prizes to workers who find the most
foreign object debris.
</P>
<P>
   Copes said Boeing workers on the Everett flight line, where new
planes are tested before being turned over to the customer, must
now check their tools in and out. Eventually, that practice will be
adopted throughout the factory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to minimize (foreign objects) is to have a good
tool control program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has said that while it has
inspectors in Boeing assembly plants and reviews the company's
procedures, it's mainly up to Boeing to control foreign object
debris.

STORR ASSIGNED TO ICE DOGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Goalie Jamie Storr, who hasn't played since
suffering a strained groin in a tie with Colorado on Oct. 18, will
begin his comeback Thursday night, but not with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Storr has been assigned to the IHL's Ice Dogs
and is scheduled to play Thursday night when they play host to the
Utah Grizzlies at the Long Beach Arena and Saturday night at home
against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because it's something I asked for,'' said Storr,
who practiced with the Ice Dogs on Tuesday. ``I wanted to make sure
that when I do get back, I will be ready.... It's the perfect
situation for me, to get back to work right down the road. We're
lucky to have the minor-league team so close where it's easy to go
and play for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr played 11 games with the Ice Dogs a year ago after
suffering a groin injury in the exhibition season. Kings coach
Larry Robinson said he does not expect Storr to spend as much time
in Long Beach as he did a year ago but added that nothing is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stinks out the joint in both of those games, we may keep
him down there,'' Robinson said. ``He's got to perform. Our
goaltenders aren't hurting us here. It's not a divine right that he
comes right back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have gotten strong play from Manny Legace since the
injuries to Storr and No.1 goalie Stephane Fiset in the Colorado
game. Robinson said he wants Storr to play his way back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really only played one game,'' Robinson said. ``He missed
much of training camp with the contract (dispute). Right now, he
needs to face some pucks. I think he wanted to come on this trip.
But he had a full practice (Tuesday with the Ice Dogs), whereas he
wouldn't have had one with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Winger Steve McKenna's abdominal strain, suffered
six days ago, might sideline him for up to two months.... According
to a survey in The Hockey News, Robinson is tied for eighth on the
salary list of NHL coaches with Dallas' Ken Hitchcock, Mike Milbury
of the New York Islanders and Joel Quenneville of the St. Louis
Blues. All make $700,000. The highest-paid coach, at $1.1 million,
is Toronto's Pat Quinn. The lowest-paid coach is Calgary's Brian
Sutter at $278,885.... Kings prospect Matt Zultek, selected in the
first round of the 1997 draft, was named the Ontario Hockey
League's player of the week. Zultek, 19, recorded three goals and
nine points in three games for his junior team, the Ottawa 67's.

BRUINS' FARMER REAPS BIG NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Either opponents can't stop him with single
coverage or won't stop him with double coverage, but UCLA junior
receiver Danny Farmer isn't complaining. He simply catches pass
after pass _ most of them difficult and all of them important.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a clutch performer,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
``He catches the ball and he knows where the first-down marker is.
He makes huges catches. He breaks tackles. He's not very fast, but
he outruns everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer is third in the Pac-10 in receiving yards per game (96.5)
and second in yards-per-catch (20.3). He was at his best Saturday
at Oregon State _ feeling his way in the first half (one catch, 31
yards) as the Bruins distributed the ball democratically, then
dominating in the second with four receptions for 82 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   His best play, a diving sideline catch in the final minutes, set
up Chris Sailer's go-ahead field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, I go in and tell the coaches what's open,''
Farmer said. ``So does Cade (McNown). We make small adjustments and
try to spread the ball around. Obviously, if it's a close game, I
want the ball that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's offseason move from split end to flanker is responsible
for much of his prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Flanker usually is higher on McNown's read scale than split end,
which makes Farmer the primary receiver more often than he was last
year. In close games, the Bruins call plays designed for the
flanker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do more things with him at flanker,'' Toledo said. ``We
can move him around, and if they double-team him, (Brian)
Poli-Dixon can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff woes: In a reversion to their 1996 form, the Bruins
allowed 206 yards in kickoff returns to Oregon State. They
continually kicked to Tim Alexander despite his repeated success
and they failed to cover or tackle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't kick well, we didn't cover well and we didn't tackle
well,'' Toledo said. ``And we had a field goal blocked because of
low trajectory.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, no problems.
</P>
<P>
   No personnel changes are planned for the kickoff coverage unit.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: Washington's beleaguered secondary received a
boost this week when junior cornerback Jermaine Smith returned from
a five-game absence due to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have allowed 1,229 passing yards in their last three
games against USC, Oregon State and Oregon, and have the worst pass
defense in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings us stability,'' Washington coach Jim Lambright said.
``And that's something we're in dire need of at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to think about: It's possible McNown will be second in
Heisman Trophy voting but the second-team All-Pac-10 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   McNown trails Texas' Ricky Williams, according to a survey of
Heisman voters by the Scripps-Howard News Service. Meanwhile,
several Pac-10 coaches have said on the bi-weekly conference call
Oregon's Akili Smith is the league's best quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10: Senior safety Larry Atkins is one of 10 semifinalists
for the Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. The
others include USC's Daylon McCutcheon, Arizona's Chris McAlister
and Georgia's Champ Bailey.

BIG TOBACCO AND 8 STATES ARE NEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for eight states and representatives of the tobacco
industry have largely finished work on a deal to settle state
lawsuits against cigarette companies and could announce it as soon
as Friday, two lawyers involved in the talks said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the settlement could reach $200 billion, depending
on the number of states that participate, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of the eight states involved in the talks
_ California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington _ expect to brief 38 other
states on the plan in the hope of their joining the settlement. The
38 states will have about a week to decide whether to take part in
the deal or to continue pursuing independent legal action, the
lawyers said. The remaining four states, Florida, Minnesota,
Mississippi and Texas, have reached individual settlements that,
combined, exceed $40 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement is the result of more than five months of
talks, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, the lead
negotiator for the states, was traveling to New York and could not
be reached for comment. Other state attorneys general declined to
comment. Tobacco executives and industry lawyers also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR
Nabisco Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the
Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT
Industries, have agreed to pay as much as $200 billion over 25
years to settle lawsuits seeking to recover Medicaid costs for
treating smokers, the lawyers involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have also apparently agreed to remove cigarette
billboard advertisements, pay more than $1 billion for anti-tobacco
advertisements, halt distribution of merchandise with tobacco logos
and finance a national foundation that would try to reducing
smoking by teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement could lead to the largest civil settlement in U.S.
history and would free tobacco companies of their most serious
legal challenge.  &QL;

ODOM RESCUES RHODE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Lamar Odom went to the bench with 16:09 remaining
in Tuesday night's Rhode Island-Vanderbilt game after picking up
his fourth foul. Any question about how important the sophomore
sensation is to URI was answered in the next 3:49.
</P>
<P>
   URI suddenly went from a team worthy of its No. 23 ranking to a
sad shell of itself, a team devoid of rhythm and continuity,
scoring just once in five possessions. It was only a matter of time
before coach Jim Harrick would decide he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   Odom reentered and scored 11 of his team-high 20 points to help
URI pull away and register an 82-69 victory in the CoSIDA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started making eye contact with each other on the bench,''
said Odom. ``They went on a run, he looked over at me, and I knew
it was time to go back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who went to the bench with his team leading by 1,
reentered with the Rams trailing by 1. It was then that the
sophomore from Queens, N.Y., showed another aspect of his brilliant
all-around game _ the ability to play effectively while in foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are 2-0 for the first time in three seasons, while
Vanderbilt, which kept the game close by sinking 14 of 33 3-point
attempts, fell to 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening's first game, Texas Christian edged Providence,
79-77, on a bucket by Scott Gradney with 28.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   This has been quite a week for Odom. He played in his first two
collegiate games. He scored his first winning basket, in Monday's
victory over TCU. He suffered his first injury, when he left
Tuesday's game in the first half after he drove into a crowded
paint area, took a hard fall, and came up with a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   And he had his first long stint on the bench because of foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have ever played that long with four fouls
without fouling out,'' said Odom. ``Coach had his confidence in me
to go back in there and play well with four fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   What Odom has not experienced yet is his first collegiate
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to action with the Rams trailing, 51-50. URI then
outscored Vanderbilt, 7-1, to take a 57-52 lead, with Odom sinking
a 3-pointer. Vandy got within 61-58, but URI never relinquished
control. A pull-up by Antonio Reynolds-Dean with 3:59 left gave the
Rams a 73-63 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Lamar controls the game, kind of like a more
athletic version of Magic Johnson,'' said Vanderbilt coach Jan van
Breda Kolff. ``He's a big guard who can see over the top of people
just like Magic did. His vision of the court is great and he has a
smaller defender on him, so he's able to find people.''
</P>
<P>
   Providence, meanwhile, is only two games into its season but it
developing a dangerous habit of blowing double-digit leads.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Friars squandered a 15-point first-half
advantage and lost to Vanderbilt by 6. On Tuesday, they jumped out
to a 12-point first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was nip and tuck, and with the game tied at 77,
Gradney took a feed on the right wing and scored on a baseline bank
shot. PC blew a chance to tie or win when forward Jamel Thomas
misfired just before time expired.
</P>
<P>
   URI and PC face each other Saturday at the Civic Center.

PENGUINS DEFEAT ISLANDERS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ After loafing through the first two periods on
Tuesday night, the New York Islanders turned up the pressure on the
Pittsburgh Penguins, outshooting their hosts by 14-4 through the
final 20 minutes. The scoring chances were plentiful, but the
Islanders lacked polish around the net.
</P>
<P>
   For too much of their dreary 3-2 loss to the Penguins, the
Islanders were sleepwalking, having played for a second straight
night. The fervor they displayed in Monday's 3-1 victory at Toronto
was missing early, and there was little doubt that weary legs had
something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were probably five or six minutes we could have played
better,'' said Bryan Smolinski, who scored his fifth goal. ``That
cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Down by 3-1, the Islanders (7-8) awakened when Trevor Linden
scored from the middle of the right circle at 1 minute 54 seconds
of the third period. After Linden cut the Penguins' lead to 3-2,
the Islanders had several chances to tie the score, but were
thwarted by Pittsburgh's backup goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin, who
made 29 saves. Claude Lapointe hit the goal post with about six
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Salo, the Islanders' goalie, played well for the second
night in row, but he was let down by his defense. Salo made 17
saves, five against Jaromir Jagr, the league's top scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Islanders refused to cite exhaustion as an excuse,
but the veteran defenseman Rich Pilon had seen this sort of effort
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have our legs tonight,'' he said. ``We were just too
tired. I hate to use that as an excuse, but that's how a lot of us
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders fell behind by 1-0 less than two minutes into the
game on a perfectly placed wrist shot by Aleksei Morozov.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of his parents, who traveled from his hometown
of Toledo, Ohio, Smolinski scored at 6:27 to tie the score at 1-1.
The Islanders were on the power play when Smolinski, standing in
front of the Penguins' net, knocked down a shot from Robert Reichel
and tapped in the puck.
</P>
<P>
   The loafing Islanders were sloppy in the second period as the
Penguins (6-3-4) extended their lead to 3-1. Both of their goals
came on busted plays by the Islanders' defense. The Penguins, who
had six attackers on the ice because of a delayed penalty, took a
2-1 lead 54 seconds into the period on a one-timer by Robert Lang,
who was left alone in front of the Islanders' goal.
</P>
<P>
   A second miscue by an Islanders defender helped the Penguins to
their third goal, at 11:29. Defenseman Barry Richter slid into Salo
as the goalie was making a save on Martin Straka, knocking the puck
in with his skate. Had Richter not lost his balance, Salo would
probably have held onto the puck.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of game for the Islanders, who should get a
full night's rest now that they are stuck in Pittsburgh. The team's
chartered flight was canceled because of high winds. &QL;

CONDUCTOR TESTIFIED AGAINST SUSAN MCDOUGAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Tired after traveling halfway around the
world to testify against Susan McDougal in her embezzlement trial,
conductor Zubin Mehta angrily protested a question about how he and
his wife spent their money.
</P>
<P>
   When McDougal's defense attorney confronted him with receipts
that contradicted the conductor's testimony, Mehta responded:
``That doesn't mean she can steal from us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting upset now,'' Mehta blurted out at one point,
cutting off Superior Court Judge Leslie Light.
</P>
<P>
   Light ordered Mehta to take a few breaths and compose himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, the final witness of the trial, did little more in his
short stint on the stand Tuesday than confirm his wife's previous
testimony: When it comes to finances, she calls all the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The check comes home. Then she puts it in the bank (and) we
both spend it,'' Mehta said.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal is charged with stealing $150,000 from the Mehtas while
she was working as a bookkeeper for them from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal, who testified last week, and was in the courtroom
Tuesday, claims she had permission to spend the money and paid a
lot of it back. The Mehtas claim she took out a credit card in
their name and forged signatures without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The charges have nothing to do with the Whitewater land-deal
investigation that made McDougal's name known in households across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Zubin Mehta, who was directing the New York Philharmonic when
McDougal worked for him, drew a crowd of reporters and others to
the small Santa Monica courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   He spent little more than an hour on the witness stand _ a mere
cameo in a trial that has lasted for more than a month. McDougal
testified for more than six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sleepy,'' Mehta admitted when he took the witness stand
after a 13-hour flight from Germany. He is headed back to Munich
today for a concert.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his time on the witness stand, the 62-year-old
conductor seemed to get a little testy, with the one notable
outburst during McDougal attorney Mark Garegos' cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Garegos confronted Mehta with receipts contradicting the
conductor's previous testimony that he didn't pay for his plumber's
plane ticket to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, Mehta said he was gone most of the time
McDougal was working for him and heard positive reports from his
wife, who kept track of their finances at his Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no complaints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the allegedly unauthorized credit card charges were
discovered, Mehta said he calmly told his wife to get their lawyer
and confront McDougal, but only after taking her to a movie.
</P>
<P>
   While Mehta's temper flared on the stand, most of the time he
and Judge Light acted as if they were trying to perfect a comedy
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``All rise,'' Mehta joked at one point during his testimony,
ordering the packed courtroom to stand when Light entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate your gesture,'' Light said, but pointed out that
the tradition went out with long white wigs.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are scheduled to start Thursday afternoon.

HOLLYWOOD PARK MIXES PAST, FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood Park begins its short autumn season today with a nod
to the past and a headlong charge into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-day feature races are minor turf stakes named for
four-footed heroes of the Inglewood track's recent history, the
$70,000 Steinlen Handicap and the $54,000 Itsallgreektome Stakes.
Steinlen, in 1989, and Itsallgreektome, in 1990, won national turf
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Each race includes a contender representing trainer Neil
Drysdale and jockey Kent Desormeaux, the most successful team at
the Oak Tree meet that ended Monday at Santa Anita. Drysdale and
Desormeaux have 5-year-old Tamhid in the Steinlen and 3-year-old
Bodyguard in the Itsallgreektome.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-race card starts at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable changes at the 60-year-old track are
$600,000 in improvements of facilities for simulcast bettors, who
have become the backbone of the racing industry and are about to
become more important. Included are the addition of 500 television
sets in areas of the grandstand and clubhouse, bringing the total
to more than 4,000, and the addition of 700 new work spaces for
handicappers, nearly doubling that total.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are being made in anticipation of a Jan. 1 change in
state law that will allow California tracks to take bets on full
racing cards from out of state. Until then, tracks here are
restricted to selected races from other states and full cards from
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, California tracks are expected to take
races from Gulfstream Park near Miami and one other U.S. track.
</P>
<P>
   This Hollywood Park meet, which will run through Dec. 21, will
squeeze its biggest races into two weekends. The $700,000 Matriarch
for fillies and mares on turf and the $500,000 Hollywood Derby for
3-year-olds on turf are on Sunday, Nov. 29; the $500,000 Hollywood
Turf Cup for 3-year-olds and up on turf and the $200,000 Hollywood
Futurity for 2-year-olds are on Saturday, Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, the likely female turf champion who won the Yellow Ribbon
Stakes for Drysdale and Desormeaux at Santa Anita on Sunday, is
expected to face a challenge from New York-based Auntie Mame in the
Matriarch.

EARLY LESSONS FOR GEORGETOWN AND ILLINOIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They played basketball on Tuesday night at Madison
Square Garden. How's that for a novelty?
</P>
<P>
   For anyone in attendance who was feeling deprived in light of
the National Basketball Association's labor dispute, the Coaches
vs. Cancer Ikon Classic provided a brief lift. For Illinois and
Wake Forest, who played in the first game, the tournament provided
early indicators of what type of season they might have.
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons are young, but they are experienced, returning
four sophomore starters. The Illini are young and inexperienced,
with no starters returning. The more seasoned Demon Deacons, led by
24 points from the sophomore guard Robert O'Kelley, won in
overtime, 75-73.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Temple, ranked No. 7 by The Associated
Press, defeated Georgetown, 65-49. Temple will meet Wake Forest in
the final on Wednesday night at 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Illini (0-1), the defending Big Ten champions, have enough
variables to keep a coach up at night, even in November. Despite
the loss, Coach Lon Kruger was relieved to see that his team was
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of learning opportunities in that ball game,''
he said. ``They would slide and then fight back. We're going to
have to learn a lot. We have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Illini led by 73-72 with 25 seconds left in overtime after
Cory Bradford (20 points) drove past O'Kelley for a layup. O'Kelley
then exploded by Illinois' Sergio McClain at the other end and drew
the foul. He made both free throws to push Wake Forest ahead by
74-73 with 19 seconds remaining. Bradford tried to dribble past
O'Kelley on Illinois's next possession but was called for charging.
</P>
<P>
   O'Kelley made one free throw at the other end to increase Wake's
lead to 2. Bradford had one more opportunity, but threw up an air
ball as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   In regulation, Wake's Craig Dawson scored all 8 of his points _
two 3-pointers and a pair of free throws _ in a one-minute span to
give the Demon Deacons a 64-61 lead with 1 minute 12 seconds left.
Rich Beyers sailed in a 3-pointer for Illinois to tie the game.
After a missed jump shot by O'Kelley, Beyers let fly the potential
game-winner with a few seconds remaining, but it was blocked by
Wake's Darius Songaila. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `'I don't really like my team, I love them,'' Wake Coach Dave
Odom said. ``That's kind of uncomfortable for me because I usually
kind of grow into loving my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were sloppy. Illinois committed 26 turnovers, and
Wake had 21. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wake, the ACC's worst-shooting team last season at 40 percent,
shot 40 percent (26 of 65) on Tuesday night.

BCS can't deliver true champion
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The championship part of college football's Bowl Championship
Series has become a sham, as suspected all along, so it might be
time to come up with a more appropriate abbreviation than the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   May we suggest eliminating the ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, what is another championship system without a true
champion but just another pile in the pasture? What is it, but just
another example of why as long as there is not a national playoff,
there will be no true national champion. Period.
</P>
<P>
   We have been down this road before. We have seen such
nonsensical alternatives _ from under-the-table bowl agreements, to
the bowl coalition, to the bowl alliance, to the
super-duper-we-really-mean-it-this-time bowl alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But by any name, it is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   It hurts and diminishes the peripheral bowls that administrators
say they are trying to save. It cheats the fans to whom
administrators say they are faithful and whose fannies fill
stadiums and dollars build science labs.
</P>
<P>
   It penalizes some teams and conferences while rewarding others.
It is riddled with gaping holes and personal biases, no matter how
many computers, formulas and adjusted deviations are used.
</P>
<P>
   It is just another pile in the pasture. And the game's athletic
directors and university presidents have us stepping in it again.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look closely at the BCS as it stands. What has it offered
us with just three full weekends of football remaining?
</P>
<P>
   A true No. 1? No. Not now and probably not after the bowls.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fiesta Bowl were to hold its national-championship game
today, the teams involved would be UCLA and Tennessee, based on the
current rankings. Kansas State, probably the most consistent team
in the land, would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   And suppose Kansas State and Tennessee lose. Based on the
direction the rankings are headed, the winner of the
Florida-Florida State game Nov. 21 would earn the BCS bid to the
Fiesta instead of an undefeated Arkansas or Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us might be huge Florida and Florida State fans, but
such a development would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Arkansas and Wisconsin deserve the chance to fail
on the field. In a playoff. If a 10-1 Florida _ after not playing
in its conference championship game because it lost to Tennessee _
believes it should have a shot, it should earn it on the field. In
a playoff. If a team goes undefeated, it should not be shut out
simply because of a conference affiliation, as Tulane might be.
</P>
<P>
   What about an unbiased ranking? Has this BCS come through? No.
Not now and probably not going into the bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The latest BCS rankings have UCLA No. 2 despite the hand of God
apparently helping the Bruins to close wins over Stanford and
Oregon State, which are a combined 1-12 in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins justifiably lost ground in the opinion polls, but
remarkably remained strong enough in the three computer polls to
stay in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The use of computer polls by the Seattle Times, the New York
Times and Jeff Sagarin was supposed to eliminate biases and create
a rock-solid formula for determining the best teams. The computer
polls also were supposed to eliminate the temptation for coaches to
run up victory margins in hopes of earning points.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   One computer poll (Seattle Times) does not consider victory
margin, another (New York Times) gives added weight to victory
margin, and the third (Sagarin) collapses the margin after 28
points. This was clearing things up?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, fans only thought Kansas State's 49-6 win over
Baylor last week was indeed 49-6. In Seattle, it was just a win _
7-6 or 49-6, it didn't matter to the computer. In New York, it was
a 60-6 win, and according to Sagarin it was 34-6. You figure it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, today UCLA is No. 1 in Seattle; Sagarin has Kansas State
No. 1 and somehow the New York Times spit out Florida State, of all
teams, as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Kansas State, despite being ranked higher than UCLA
in four of the five polls, is behind UCLA in the BCS ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the human factor, nothing illustrated the flaws more than
an Associated Press voter saying recently that he believed
Tennessee was the best team in the country, but he would vote
Tennessee No. 3, Florida State No. 2 and Kansas State No. 1, just
so UCLA could lose some points in the BCS formula.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this: Pollsters no longer are voting on what they
see on the field, but on what they want to see in the BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly drastic jumps in the opinion polls might occur after
this weekend if Arkansas upsets Tennessee in Knoxville. Pollsters
might suddenly vault Arkansas, currently No. 10 and No. 9 in the
opinion polls, above UCLA or Kansas State, just so they can
manipulate the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's all just another sham. The more we want things decided on
the field, the more we find ourselves knee-deep in the pasture.

McNair relentless in pursuit of team
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The sun is going down, and the shadows are lengthening. It's
getting late in the game and the clock seems to be running faster
and faster.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bob McNair's huddle, and there is no lack of confidence
from the man running it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crunch time,'' he said. ``We have the ball in the red
zone, and now the job is to punch it into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sis-boom-bah!
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have official title of an NFL team for the city of
Houston, but McNair has the lingo.
</P>
<P>
   If we were looking for a reincarnation of Knute Rockne to carry
us back into the ranks of the NFL, McNair is our man, complete with
all the fiery words. Listen to him talk for just a few minutes, and
you'll believe he's willing to get down in the trenches and play
without a facemask if that's what it will take to bring pro
football back to town.
</P>
<P>
   He is like a linebacker in search of a set of exposed ribs in
which to jam his helmet, a running back with all the right moves
who is just itching to get his hands on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Twiddle his thumbs? No way
</P>
<P>
   It has been two weeks since McNair, the well-respected
businessman, led a group that included Mayor Lee Brown, County
Judge Robert Eckels and Jack Rains, head of the sports authority,
to Kansas City, where they laid out a drop-dead proposal for a
state-of-the-art football stadium in our town.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston group fulfilled all of the prerequisites of the NFL,
cleared all of the hurdles, and easily outdistanced any Hollywood
glitz promises and dreams that were made by two groups from Los
Angeles. The NFL owners said, in essence, we'll get back to you on
that, maybe at our next scheduled meeting Feb. 16. Which left two
choices:
</P>
<P>
   Sit back and spend the next 3{ months trying to set a world
record for twiddling thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Or put your head down, start your legs churning like you're
hitting a blocking sled, and try to grind out that one more yard
that might make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   McNair chose the latter. Soon after returning from Kansas City,
he reached an agreement to sell his highly successful gas business,
Cogen Technologies. Tuesday afternoon he met with a group of 82
local businessmen who are prospective limited partners in a Houston
football team. And as soon as commissioner Paul Tagliabue names the
expansion committee that will focus on determining the 32nd
franchise for the NFL _ which should happen soon after Thanksgiving
_ McNair will begin making rounds to do more campaigning and
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on himself
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who made the decision to sell off his business, in
part because it was a good deal, but also to serve notice he plans
for the NFL to become his prime focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do feel confident,'' McNair said. ``It's simple,
really. We met the NFL requirements, and Los Angeles can't. Not
without a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he didn't come back from KC with a team, raising suspicions
about whether Houston is being used as a pawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it so much as them keeping the door open for LA,''
McNair said. ``They just like competition. It keeps the price up.
If they had agreed that Houston is ready to go and said yes back
then, there wouldn't be nearly the hype to keep the price high.
What you've got, I believe, is a managed auction. They are trying
to keep us all in the game to bid against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But a price in excess of the $530 million paid for the Cleveland
expansion team is too high, according to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL did all the work, sold PSLs, got the stadium deal
worked out in Cleveland,'' he said. ``So I see that price as for
both a team and a stadium. I don't think it should be that much for
just a franchise in Houston, since we have done all the work to
deliver a world-class stadium. Of course, that's all negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the NBA and in the aftermath of the baseball
season, these are the games we play. The money games. Moises Alou
squeezes an extra $3 million out of the Astros. Randy Johnson holds
himself out to the highest bidder. The NFL raises the cash bar
higher, and McNair vows to show us his vertical leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intent on getting a team for Houston,'' he said. ``I
consider Tagliabue to be a personal friend. He advised me what was
needed, and we've delivered. Now I've got to meet with the members
of the expansion committee when it is in place. I've got to keep
pushing at them, make them understand.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be a tense time, a nervous time, if you really
believe you've done all you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a working time,'' McNair said. ``I don't get nervous. I
get my juices flowing.''

Caminiti turns down Tigers' offer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Return to Astros likely if deal sweetened
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   How badly does Ken Caminiti want to play for the Astros?
</P>
<P>
   All you need to know is what happened late Tuesday night. Faced
with a deadline to make a decision, Caminiti walked away from the
Detroit Tigers' generous three-year, $21.5 million offer in hopes
of striking a deal with the Astros, who have weighed in with an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball sources said the Astros' proposal could net Caminiti
about $10.5 million over the next three years, assuming he reached
certain incentives. The first two years of the Astros' offer are
believed to be guaranteed, with the club holding an option for the
third year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the Tigers' offer, but if the Astros would
be willing to improve it _ and there are indications it won't take
much more _ the two sides likely would reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who lives in Richmond, will resume negotiations with
the Astros today, and there is a distinct possibility the sides
could reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Astros) know what it's going to take, and I know what
it's going to take,'' said Caminiti, who declined to discuss
details of the Astros' offer or what it might take to sign him.
``Their offer was not bad, but it was not great, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving a whole bunch of money out there (in Detroit). I
want to play (in Houston), but I'm not going to be penalized for
playing here. They need to try and treat me fairly. I guess I've
been on both sides of it; they were overfair in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker, who is attending the
general manager's meetings in Naples, Fla., was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers submitted identical offers last week to Caminiti and
Dean Palmer, with the condition the deal would be pulled off the
table after one of the free-agent third basemen decided to accept
it. That presumably is the reason they asked Caminiti to make a
decision Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed an answer from Caminiti because we're giving Palmer
our best offer, and you can't have two offers hanging out there,''
Tigers assistant general manager Steve Lubratich said. ``We needed
an answer; Palmer has teams on his heels, and we couldn't wait for
Caminiti to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti said: ``I just had no more time left. I had to make a
decision. If (the Tigers' offer) is still there (today), maybe
we'll see. Right now, I just need to slow the process a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers will wonder how Caminiti could have turned down
such a lucrative deal from the Tigers to focus on the Astros'
offer, which is worth significantly less. It wasn't easy, but the
35-year-old third baseman wants to finish his career in Houston,
which would allow him to spend more time with his wife, Nancy, and
their three daughters _ Kendall, 7, Lindsey, 5, and Nicole (10
months).
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has been good to me,'' Caminiti said. ``I'm fortunate
not to have to play for money. I've never been the kind of player
who plays for money. I play for happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   And happiness would be finishing his major-league career with
the same team for which it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Caminiti is that home is very important to
him,'' Tigers general manager Randy Smith said. ``It says a lot
about him that money isn't his No. 1 issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was the Astros' third-round pick in the 1984 draft and
made his major-league debut with the club three years later. He
played in Houston through the 1994 season before being traded to
San Diego in a blockbuster deal.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti blossomed into a star player with the Padres, winning
three Gold Glove awards and claiming the National League's Most
Valuable Player Award in 1996 when he hit .326 with 40 homers and
130 RBIs. The RBI total tied Mickey Mantle's 1956 output, the most
ever by a switch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, Dodgers and White Sox also have expressed interest in
Caminiti, but returning to the Padres doesn't seem an option.
</P>
<P>
   On the Randy Johnson front, the same day he toured the Arizona
Diamondbacks' complex, he accepted a long-distance call from New
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss reached out and touched Johnson, although those were
the only numbers exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``George spoke with Randy today and everything went great. Randy
was very impressed,'' Johnson's agent, Alan Nero, said. ``Now it's
just a matter of us going through this process.''
</P>
<P>
   But to that end, the initial contract offer Nero was expecting
from the Yanks did not come when he spoke with GM Brian Cashman. At
least one GM monitoring the bidding surrounding the 6-10 lefty
dominator said he ``would be absolutely astounded if (Johnson)
wound up with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got off the phone with (Cashman) and I'm still waiting
for an offer,'' Nero said. ``But our discussion went very well and
was very positive. They said they're going to make an offer; it's
just going to take a little time. I'm still hoping it's some time
(Tuesday night or today).''
</P>
<P>
   As for Arizona, general manager Joe Garagiola Jr., also at the
annual GM's meetings, said of Johnson: ``From our sense, Randy is
still kind of sorting things out and maybe wants to visit a couple
more places. Then I think the discussion will start to focus on the
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is also among the clubs interested in Johnson, who lives
in suburban Phoenix.

RANGERS CRUSH LIGHTNING, 10-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TOM HARDESTY   
 c.1998 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ A week ago, six goals in one game seemed
impossible for the New York Rangers. On Tuesday night, they hit
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who entered the game as the lowest-scoring team in
the National Hockey League (24), scored at will and blasted the
Tampa Bay Lightning, 10-2, before 11,604 at the Ice Palace.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive game, the Rangers' offense was on
fire. Kevin Stevens had three goals and two assists, while and Ulf
Samuelsson, who has been bothered by a swollen knee, scored two
goals. Brian Leetch and Todd Harvey registered three assists each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's been playing very well,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler
said. ``Five points? That's a pretty good night.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stevens, it was his first hat trick since Jan. 11, 1994, and
the first time he had 5 points in a game since Oct. 17, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who last scored 10 goals on Dec. 13, 1992, in a
10-5 victory over Montreal, won their first game on the road this
season and snapped a seven-game slump here (0-6-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``All phases of our game were on tonight,'' Muckler said. ``We
had better puck movement in the neutral zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who has had two 6-point games in his career, said:
``It's nice to get one like this. It seems like all our games this
year have been nip and tuck. It was a great team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, who had two assists in the final period,
complimented his teammates. ``It's great to see those guys pile up
numbers,'' he said of Stevens, Harvey and Leetch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets their butt kicked every once in a while,''
Lightning Coach Jacques Demers said. ``They played very well. We
just got beat in every department.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't take long to assume control of the game.
Michael Knuble skated past the Lightning blue line and passed to a
wide-open Samuelsson, who teed it up and drilled a shot past Tampa
Bay goalie Bill Ranford on the glove side for a 1-0 lead and his
first goal of the season. The goal by Samuelsson came just 2
minutes 5 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay evened the score at 11:18 when, on a power play,
Daymond Langkow jammed in a rebound of a Benoit Hogue shot past
goalie Dan Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers stunned the crowd with two goals in 16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The first came on the power play. Jan Mertzig took a shot from
the right face-off circle, but Stevens redirected it with his stick
past Ranford at the 13:35 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The second was set up when Tampa Bay turned the puck over deep
in its own territory. Stevens grabbed the puck and passed to Manny
Malhotra, who was right in front of the net for the goal to make it
3-1 Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got their fourth goal of the period when Mathieu
Schneider made a perfect pass to John MacLean, who despite being
nearly even with the Tampa Bay goal, got the puck past Ranford for
his fourth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored just 25 seconds into the second period. Marc
Savard passed from the left side to Stevens, who one-timed it past
Ranford for a 5-1 advantage. It was Savard's fifth assist in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Another defensive miscue by Tampa Bay boosted the New York lead
to 6-1. Deep in the Lightning zone, Steve Kelly couldn't clear the
puck and Harvey grabbed it and pulled the trigger. Ranford stopped
the shot but fell down, and Samuelsson lifted the rebound over
Ranford with 3:29 gone.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay finally broke the string of Ranger goals when Mikael
Andersson skated through center ice and passed to a streaking
Enrico Ciccone, who blasted a shot at Cloutier that trickled
between the goalie's legs and into the net. Ciccone's first goal of
the season came at the 6:17 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger goal No. 7 came on the power play. Harvey, from the left
side, made a pinpoint pass to Savard on the right. Savard went high
and over a sliding Ranford for his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got goals from Niklas Sundstrom, Stevens and Harvey
in the third period to close out the scoring.

FORT WORTH-DALLAS AREA IS BASEBALL RICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best high school baseball in the country is right here in
the Fort Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   But we didn't need two rookie-of-the-year awards to tell us
that.
</P>
<P>
   We knew it from the youth-league games that we saw every year at
places like Richfield Park. We saw it in the summer select leagues.
And we saw it every time a local high school player signed a
Division I scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Brown knows.
</P>
<P>
   The TCU baseball coach once had grant-in-aid commitments from _
are you sitting down for this? _ both Ben Grieve, who yesterday was
named the American League rookie of the year, and Kerry Wood, who
on Monday was named National League rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Brown said yesterday, sighing deeply, ``if we had
gotten both of those, we might have been in good shape for a run at
the College World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown used to coach high school ball in this area, so he knows.
As good as it was in the '80s, it has been even better in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   High school kids now play baseball year-round. After the prep
season concludes, they head off to the Pony Colt leagues or Connie
Mack ball. Come September, it's fall-ball time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, a lot of time when people would talk about the
difference between the baseball in California, Florida and Texas,''
TCU's Brown said, ``it was because the California players played 12
months of the year. But California isn't the only one who has fall
leagues anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids here are playing year-round, too. We picked up on it
sort of late here, but since then the amount of talent that comes
through this area has really blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood and Grieve are products of those summer-select and fall
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the summer team that Ben played on after his junior
year,'' said Tom Grieve, Ben's dad and the former Rangers general
manager. ``That team had Kip Harkrider, who went on and played at
Texas and made the Olympic team. It had Eddie Furniss, who went to
LSU and became college player of the year. It had Adam Leggett, who
is in the Angels organization and made All-SEC. It had Chad Allen,
who went to A&AMP;M and was on the Olympic team. And it had Matt Blank,
the Expos organization's minor-league pitcher of the year this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every kid on that Dallas Mustangs team that summer
ended up playing at a major Division I school or playing pro
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Coached by Sam Carpenter, that Mustangs team finished second to
a team from Cincinnati, Ohio, at the national Connie Mack League
tournament. But Carpenter has won it in other years.
</P>
<P>
   The two rookie-of-the-year awards this week represent an
affirmation, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about baseball in the Tarrant County and
Dallas-Fort Worth area,'' Ben Grieve said yesterday, ``to have two
guys come through and be successful like this. I think there's a
lot of talent in the area and it's great to get some recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben himself was a part of a talented group at Martin High School
coached by Terry King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played on a state championship team in Massachusetts when I
was growing up,'' Tom Grieve said, ``and I think only two kids on
our high school team could have even made the team that Ben played
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have people in California and Florida argue. But
there's not a place in the country where the caliber of baseball is
any better than the Metroplex.''
</P>
<P>
   For the eldest Grieve, the announcement yesterday was mixed with
as much relief as celebration. He knew that Ben was facing enough
pressure this past season, just proving that he was ready to stick
in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the comment yesterday that on the first day of spring
training, the first question asked to him was whether he thought he
was going to be the American League rookie of the year this year,''
Tom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it was all over and done, he did live up to the
expectations. And I was real proud and happy that he was able to
perform under those circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who know Ben, even the day of his biggest major-league
honor was typically Ben Grieve. The family was up at 6:30 a.m.,
having breakfast, and had been pre-alerted by Oakland officials to
expect a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   If the call from the Baseball Writers Association of America
representative arrived, Ben was scheduled to dash out the door to
catch the next flight to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   If it didn't, Ben was going back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   There is something refreshing, it says here, about a rising star
athlete who still sleeps in the same bed where he grew up. In the
off-season, the American League rookie of the year doesn't move to
a condo in Southern California. He comes home to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it,'' Tom Grieve said. ``I'm sure he'll get married
someday, and when he does he'll leave. But for the time being, we
think it's great that he likes coming back here and living with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even complain about the mess.''

&HT;    FORMER STUDENT CONVICTED IN SLAYING OF SON OF TIMES WARNER
CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 19-year-old former student of Jonathan Levin was
convicted on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the May 1997
slaying of Levin, a Bronx public high school teacher, in his
Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But in a setback for prosecutors, the jury acquitted the
defendant, Corey Arthur, of first-degree murder, apparently
unconvinced that Arthur fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur faces 25 years to life in prison. If he had been
convicted of first-degree murder, he would have been sentenced to
life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the son of Gerald Levin, the chairman of Time Warner,
chose to be an English teacher at William Howard Taft High in the
Bronx instead of living a life of privilege. He was praised by his
students for giving to them selflessly and having an unusual
ability to raise their self-esteem. Some of his students displayed
a sign at Levin's funeral declaring, ``We are his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin's mother, Carol Levin, expressed disappointment with the
verdict on Tuesday night in an emotional statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy about this,'' Ms. Levin said. ``There is no
happiness in this.'' She added, ``John wouldn't have been happy
with this verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors left the courthouse on Tuesday night without commenting
on their 11 hours of deliberations over two days, but it appeared
that they rejected the testimony of the prosecution's lead witness,
Carlethia Weeks. Ms. Weeks, Arthur's former girlfriend, had
testified that he confessed the killing to her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weeks admitted under cross-examination that she had heard
voices in her head since she was a child and had seen a
psychiatrist about the problem. Prosecutors have not commented on
whether they knew of Ms. Weeks' psychiatric problems when they
placed her on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's ruling essentially meant that prosecutors proved only
that Arthur and his 26-year-old codefendant, Montoun Hart,
committed a crime that resulted in Mr. Levin's death _ torturing
him until he gave them the code to his bank card and robbing him of
$800. But they did not prove that Arthur personally killed Levin.
Arthur was also convicted of two counts of armed robbery. Hart will
be tried separately on second-degree murder charges in January.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty verdicts prompted cheers from friends of the victim
and sobs from a friend of the accused. Arthur shook his head and
muttered to himself when the verdicts were announced. His mother,
Penny Bostick, sat motionless and Arthur's current girlfriend burst
out weeping.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Levin, who spoke for the first time publicly after
attending every day of the trial, praised her son's life and said
his students still call her about him. She criticized defense
lawyers for raising the issue of drug use at the trial. They
suggested that drugs may have been a reason Arthur was in Levin's
apartment that night. But an autopsy found no drugs in Levin's
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt those who loved John very much to hear the defense
spin fictions about his life,'' she said. ``John lived a noble
life. He was a very honorable man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said that her son lived for his students and would not
have been able to achieve what he did in life if he had used drugs.
She said he gave selflessly to his students and that he responded
to Arthur's phone call the day of the killing because that was his
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would probably be very disappointed in Corey Arthur,'' Ms.
Levin said. ``The only reason he picked up that phone was because
he couldn't do otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers called the verdict a victory and said they had
to raise drug use as part of mounting a proper defense for Arthur.
Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of friends of Levin who
testified that he smoked marijuana occasionally but did not use
hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who had no comment on the verdicts on Tuesday
night, said during the trial that Arthur went to Levin's apartment
to rob him.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Levin led some public-school teachers to question
how accessible they should be to their students outside of school,
and turned Levin into a symbol of public service.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur was a student in Levin's English class at Taft High
School during the 1993-1994 school year, and the young teacher
apparently took the troubled youth under his wing. At the time, at
least, the two were close.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page, handwritten thank-you note that Arthur wrote to
Levin in 1993, he called the teacher his ``true and only friend in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have shown me that it is alright to step in and help
someone,'' he said in the letter. ``You have shown me not all
people want to use and exploit me.''
</P>
<P>
   The note concluded: ``Wherever I get in life, I owe it to you
and for that I am entirely grateful. I am also lucky and most happy
to call Jake or John Levin my friend. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin wrote in a paper for a graduate school class he was taking
at the time that Arthur showed promise and that reading the note
from Arthur nearly brought him to tears.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and defense lawyers painted starkly different
portraits of what happened next in their relationship. Defense
lawyers said the two remained close and argued in the closing
statements on Monday that Arthur would never have killed his former
teacher. They argued that cuts Arthur suffered on his hand at the
time of the murder occurred when he tried to stop an accomplice
from stabbing Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on God's earth that he would kill him,''
George Goltzer, one of Arthur's defense lawyers, said in his
closing statement. ``There is no way on God's earth he would harm
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said that Arthur and Levin had grown apart by
May 30, 1997. The former student took advantage of his previous
relationship with his former teacher to gain entrance to his
apartment. Twice during the trial, prosecutors played a tape from
Levin's telephone answering machine that recorded Arthur calling
him at 4:55 p.m. on the day of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Levin, this is Corey,'' the voice on the tape says. ``Pick
up if you're there. It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and Hart did go to visit Levin, and prosecutors said they
attacked him and tied him up with duct tape. The teacher was
tortured with a knife, including three cuts made across his throat,
until he gave up the code to his bank card. At 5:15 p.m, a man
identified by a witness as Hart withdrew $800 from Mr. Levin's bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors portrayed Arthur as the leader of the two. His
fingerprints were found on the roll of duct tape and his DNA was
found on the knife used to torture Levin. Blood from Levin was
found on Arthur's clothes. While the gun that killed Levin was
never recovered, prosecutors argued that Arthur was the only one
with a motive to kill his former teacher because he could later
identify Arthur to the police.

UCLA WINS EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If one sloppy, endless exhibition is any
indication of the season to come, the new-era UCLA Bruins will play
hard, they will pass and they will play fast.
</P>
<P>
   With point guard Earl Watson directing the attack, UCLA sprinted
to a 27-point first-half lead and outlasted the California West
All-Stars 95-89 Tuesday night before 6,094 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've played 10 straight nights, so we can't get too
excited,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``But I saw some real
positive things. We shared the ball and played aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson is UCLA's most-improved player and its floor leader, at
least until injured guard Baron Davis returns. Tuesday, he was
everywhere, throwing alley-oops and 50-foot bounce passes and
finishing with 15 points, 13 assists and 10 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded freshman forward JaRon Rush led UCLA with 17 points and
dived for more loose balls in one game than J.R. Henderson did in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric (knee tendinitis) and
sophomore guard/forward Rico Hines (sprained knee) did not play.
Both are expected to play in the season opener Nov. 19 against
Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Recruit Kareem Rush (JaRon's brother) gave UCLA an oral
commitment several weeks ago and might sign a letter of intent
during the early-signing period, which begins today. Or he might
wait until the spring.

KINGS FLOP AT FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ When Jozef Stumpel recorded an assist 17
seconds into his return from injury, it seemed there was no way the
Kings could lose Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto when Olli Jokinen scored his first NHL goal. And when Luc
Robitaille scored for the fourth straight game. And when Glen
Murray's goal provided a two-goal lead nearly halfway through the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? The Kings lost.
</P>
<P>
   And their 5-4 overtime loss to the Calgary Flames (6-6-2) before
a Saddledome crowd of 15,247 left coach Larry Robinson fuming. It
took all the sparkle off a victory by the Kings (5-7-3) in
Vancouver one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Bach, making his first NHL start and playing before friends
and family visiting from suburban Edmonton, allowed two late goals
in regulation, then had no chance when Andrew Cassels danced around
Steve Duchesne and scored the winner on a breakaway 1:12 into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get these points back, you know,'' said Robinson,
adding that he is considering lineup changes for Thursday night's
home game against the expansion Nashville Predators. ``At this
point, it would have been great for us to come in here and go back
home with two wins under our belt. The thing that worries me most
about this is it's a devastating blow to our confidence level. I
don't know who the hell we think we are, that we can sit on a
two-goal lead, or a three-goal lead _ any lead. It's just
frustrating as hell. You get tired of screaming and yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he sometimes feels as if he's talking to a brick wall,
Robinson replied, ``Sometimes there are brick walls, yes _ and
brick walls between their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   To think the night had begun with such promise for the Kings.
Stumpel, back after missing 10 games with a strained left hip
flexor, assisted on a goal by Vladimir Tsyplakov at 1:52 of the
first period. Jokinen made it 2-0 nine minutes later off a pass
from Craig Johnson. And Robitaille made it 3-0 early in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Kings let the Flames back in the game, allowing
goals to Theo Fluery and Valeri Bure before the end of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up, 3-0, we talk about keeping our shifts short in this
building because the air is thin, and Robitaille, Olli and Murray
got caught out twice, over a minute shift, two goals, they're back
in the game,'' Robinson said. ``Simple as that.... You (bleeping)
wonder why we scream and yell.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the lengthy shifts, Robitaille said, ``Sometimes that
happens. You want to come and change, but we got caught on a couple
of long shifts and got scored on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray made it 4-2 at 8:42 of the third and the Kings
seemed secure. But Cory Stillman beat Bach with a shot from the
right faceoff circle less than two minutes later, and with 2:28
left, Derek Morris scored after Jeff Shantz beat Ian Laperriere on
a faceoff to Bach's left.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Cassels was one on one with Duchesne and
stickhandled past him. When he backhanded the puck past Bach, a
prone Duchesne buried his face in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell down,'' Duchesne said. ``I worked hard. You make
mistakes. I feel really bad about losing the game like that, but it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach said, ``It all happened pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had decided Monday to play Bach against Calgary and
give a rest to Manny Legace, who had appeared in 10 consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bach's play, Robinson said, ``He struggled a little bit, but
that's not the reason that we lost. Three of the goals were
questionable goals. But, still, knowing that this is a young kid
that's coming in here, you as a player, you don't have to be a
college graduate to know that you have to play strong
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's solution to Tuesday's defensive woes might be lineup
changes. He said he will study videotape of the loss, then decide
whether to make one or more alterations. He added that healthy
scratches Dan Bylsma, Nathan LaFayette and Ray Ferraro might play
Thursday. He did not say who might be benched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's immune,'' Robinson said. ``It's a team. A team is not
made up of superstars. A team is made up of hockey players. You've
got to be able to get the message across somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   If benchings don't work, Robinson said he has one more idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pass out some resumes around here because obviously
there's a number of guys in there that think that their way is
better than my way, so if they want to coach themselves, then they
might as well fill out a resume,'' Robinson said. ``But they won't
last very long because their way has not been working.''

FROM DESERT STORM TO BIG SKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Quinton Reed was asked if he felt like a
veteran. He paused, pondering the question for a few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of playing linebacker at Mt. San Jacinto College
counted for something. Another nine games at Cal State Northridge
added to it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he had experience, but a veteran? No, not so early in his
Division I-AA career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that kind of a veteran,'' a voice shouted from the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Reed responded. ``You want to talk about the Army
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. The Army stuff. The Desert Shield and Desert Storm stuff.
The Gulf War. That kind of veteran. A battlefield veteran, not a
gridiron one.
</P>
<P>
   After all, today is Veteran's Day. But Reed, as attested to by
the aforementioned exchange, is anything but your prototypical
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   He's a football player, a college student. Reed, 33, a
linebacker-turned-defensive lineman, wears an Army beret once in a
while, but it's the only thing that bears any military resemblance.
It certainly doesn't suggest eight years spent in the Army, which
included service in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think of it that often,'' Reed said. ``But it's a
great thing, Veteran's Day and Washington, D.C., with the wall.
It's a great way to remember the veterans because there was once a
day when they were cast away.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was with the 1/39th FAR, an artillery division in the Army.
He went from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait and Iraq. Was on the battle
lines, always knowing death was possible.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, he insists. The experience wasn't terrifying, only
his duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't anything that bad,'' Reed said. ``There were
times when you were walking around and you thought about it, but it
wasn't that big of a deal. It's not what you would think.''
</P>
<P>
   While in the Army, Reed would play football. Flag football,
mostly. Sometimes touch, but never tackle. He's 6-foot-2, 270
pounds, so why would one play tackle with Reed? Not in the Army,
anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Junior college, though, was different. Reed wanted to play, but
didn't know where to go so he enrolled at Mt. San Jacinto.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Ron Ponciano scouted Reed. The coach's immediate
conviction was Reed would be playing high Division I-A football if
not for the age factor.
</P>
<P>
   Upon being named coach at CSUN, Ponciano contacted Reed and sold
the Matadors on him. Reed, not having many options, accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's exactly what we hoped he'd be when we decided to bring
him here,'' Ponciano said. ``He's mature. He's not a kid. It's
college, but everything's not an adventure to him. That's why you
can get on him and he'll look at you and say, `Check.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Check.' It means he's got it. A lot of kids give me excuses.
He gives you a check. That's why he gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's 10 tackles don't explain his value. Neither does his
willingness to move from linebacker to nose guard because the
Matadors were ravaged with injuries on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Reed at practice gives no indication of his age. He
hits the sleds as hard as the other Matadors, the ones who were
barely out of diapers when Reed went to Fort Bragg, N.C., for
bootcamp.
</P>
<P>
   Reed brings maturity to the rest of his teammates. During games,
it's the same thing. Reed offers no mannerisms to suggest he's
different, which he's not. Unless you look at his locker. His neat,
tidy locker that is so out of place in the Matadors locker room it
screams at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's locked up in his locker, nothing is hanging
out,'' CSUN linebacker Kenny Knoop said. ``It's cleaned up, folded
up. He laughs at everyone and sleeps when he can. He's used to it.
And he gets a lot of guys around him to clean it up, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Ponciano wasn't happy with the effort during conditioning
drills at the end of practice and threw the offensive and defensive
lines off the field. He also made the players run ten 100-yard
sprints before the players, tongues in tow, went to the locker
room.... Wide receiver Mike Ogas hyperextended his left elbow in
practice and cornerback Donnell Day injured his left hand and is
expected to have X-rays taken today. Both players said they would
be back at practice today.

HITCHCOCK LAYS DOWN LAW TO OUTSPOKEN HULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ken Hitchcock said Tuesday that Brett Hull's
comment about a lack of ice time in Saturday's game was ``just
talk.'' But the Stars coach said making public any displeasure is
something ``you just don't do'' in the Stars organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is a really good lesson for Brett Hull,''
Hitchcock said. ``He allowed himself to get going there, and you
can't do that. I don't know what he did before, but you don't do
that here. It doesn't matter if it's Hull, we just don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the general manager to the coach, we don't do it. We're a
family. If we have a family squabble, it's behind closed doors. We
don't air our laundry in public, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said that Hull's comment was blown out of proportion,
but that the incident allowed him and Hull to have a conversation
about what is expected from a Stars player in dealing with the news
media. The coach added that he ``would not let this fester'' before
the Stars play the Phoenix Coyotes at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday _ a
showdown between teams with the top winning percentages in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, one of the NHL's most outspoken players in 10 seasons with
the St. Louis Blues, declined to comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-minute news conference Monday, Hull answered several
questions, including one about him playing 11 minutes, 55 seconds
in a 4-3 victory against the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday _ about
five minutes less than his average ice time with the Stars and
eight minutes short of what he averaged with the St. Louis Blues
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possible way Brett Hull can do anything in 11
minutes. There's no flow, there's no feel,'' he said. ``You're used
to playing so much more that it's a completely different mind-set.
... I could have had four goals, but my timing was all \Rmessed\S
up and my legs were asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues raised in July when the Stars signed Hull to a
three-year, $17 million free-agent contract was whether the
free-wheeling Hull would fit into a Stars locker room filled with
``company men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two focuses,'' Hitchcock said. ``No. 1 is: How is he
fitting in? And quite frankly, and I need this written properly,
he's fitting in great. No. 2 is: We have a different set of rules
here, and the rules are we don't do that on our team, period. My
door is open, and march in if you've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the 11:55 in ice time for Hull was an anomaly
caused by a penalty-filled game. Hull averages almost 17 minutes a
game with the Stars, and Hitchcock said he expects Hull will get
his fair share of ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to play well, Brett should be in the top three
\Rforwards\S in minutes, as long as those are productive minutes,''
Hitchcock said. ``When he's playing well, and he's been pretty damn
good, he needs to be playing 17 to 20 minutes a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey said the Stars' system is built
on inner conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, there is a place where a player who feels he
didn't receive what he should have received can make comments and
get results,'' Gainey said. ``And there are places you can make
comments and not get the answers to your questions. And every
player has to be able to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that might seem overcontrolling, Stars defenseman Craig
Ludwig said players have always been able to talk with Stars
coaches when a problem arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their doors are always open,'' Ludwig said. ``We've built a
strong locker room, and that's a big part of it.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M'S DEFENSE RELYING ON FRESH, YOUNG LINEMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ In retrospect, Texas A&AMP;M defensive line
coach Bill Johnson can confess to fears he once covered with
bluster and bravado.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh season at the school, Johnson is the
longest-tenured assistant on the staff of football coach R.C.
Slocum. He has seen the team's ``Wrecking Crew'' defense evolve
from dominant to docile and back to dominant during his stay in
College Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had problems with our defense, it was when we were
short of experienced people in the line,'' Johnson said. ``And, to
be honest, I thought this would be the toughest year for us to get
through because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson based those concerns on a defensive line that headed
into an Aug. 31 season opener against then-No.2 Florida State with
four sophomores, three freshmen, one junior and no returning
starters among its list of potential participants.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M still uses all eight players in games, with each handling
between 15 and 40 snaps. But Johnson's unit no longer needs pregame
pep talks about reaching untapped potential. It no longer needs him
to tell the world how good they might be ... someday.
</P>
<P>
   Someday is today. As No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M prepares for Saturday's
game against No. 13 Missouri, Slocum points to the evolution of the
defensive line as a major reason why the Aggies rank third
nationally in total defense, allowing 246.7 yards and 11.7 points
per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time has that position been a weakness for us,'' said
Slocum, who has seen his linemen combine for 198 tackles (18 for
losses) and six sacks. ``Even against Florida State, with nothing
but new guys, they held their own. And they've gotten better every
week. In reality, we're further along than I expected to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival coaches have noticed the transformation. Missouri's Larry
Smith said A&AMP;M's progress up front has been ``striking.'' Texas
Tech coach Spike Dykes, who watched the Aggies make eight tackles
for losses in a 17-10 victory against the Red Raiders, praised the
Aggies' precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their technique up front is tremendous. They do a great job of
occupying blockers and holding their ground so their linebackers
can go make tackles,'' Dykes said. ``In a 3-4 defense, that's
exactly what you're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   That, plus a few big plays. Those have been coming in greater
numbers in recent weeks, with defensive end Rocky Bernard (47
tackles, six for losses) and nose guard Ron Edwards (39 tackles, 4
sacks) leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards ranks fourth among A&AMP;M players in tackles for losses
with eight. He had a season-high seven stops in last week's 29-0
rout of Oklahoma, when the Aggies allowed just five first downs and
124 yards. His sack of Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe on Oct.
10 resulted in a fumble that linebacker Warrick Holdman recovered
for a touchdown in a 28-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard's best game was against Kansas, when he had two tackles
for losses and a sack. Like Edwards, he also made a season-high
seven tackles against the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of the line's success, said defensive coordinator
Mike Hankwitz, rests with Johnson's rotation system. No one gets
more than 40 plays. Against Nebraska, three fresh faces took the
field with each new series.
</P>
<P>
   Hankwitz, who is working for his eighth Division I-A school
since 1970, said he has never been around a defensive line with
more quality depth. And his list of past employers includes
Michigan, Colorado, Arizona, Kansas and Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can sell them on the idea that they have to play hard on
every snap because we're not asking them to do it 70 plays in a
row,'' Hankwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's strength in numbers,'' Johnson said. ``If we had only
three who could play, we wouldn't be as good. As young as we are, I
don't think anybody is mature enough to handle an every down
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one is asked to do so. As a result, the Aggies have fresh
legs in the fourth quarter. The last team to score against A&AMP;M in
the final period was Baylor on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season first started, we hoped we could be part of
this team's success,'' Bernard said. ``Now that we've made some
contributions, it's exciting. I think the rotation system helps
with that. They keep us rolling to the point we really can't get
tired. And the stronger you feel, the better your chances to make
plays.''

COWBOYS-CARDINALS GAME OFFERS MATCHUP OF RARE SIGNIFICANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since they moved to Arizona in 1988, the Cardinals (5-4) have
had a winning record nine games into the season once. Thus,
November and December matchups featuring the Cowboys and Cardinals
have usually produced the pregame hoopla afforded a potato sack
race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you have to go back to Week 11 of the 1984 season _
when the Cardinals were in St. Louis _ to find a midseason
Cowboys-Cardinals game that merited big-game hype.
</P>
<P>
   That season, with each team sporting a 6-4 record, the Cowboys
and Cardinals were part of a four-way tie atop the NFC East when
the clubs met at Busch Stadium on Nov. 11, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The week before the game, the Fort Worth-Dallas news media
provided big feature coverage of how many Cowboys fans were
traveling to St. Louis, and how the Cowboys hoped to stop speedy
Cardinals receiver Roy Green. The media followed news of Tom Landry
naming Gary Hogeboom the starting quarterback over Danny White, and
of Tony Dorsett missing much of practice to be with his ill father,
who died a few days before the game.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a story on how the Cowboys would not have to wear
their ``unlucky'' blue road jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rafael Septien missed three field goals, the Cowboys
defeated the Cardinals, 24-17. Afterward, the Cowboys talked about
how their season was saved. And the Cardinals talked about how they
would bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk proved hollow. Each club finished 9-7 and missed
the playoffs, the Cowboys for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are again. First place in the NFC East is on the
line, with enough storylines to fill area news pages and newscasts
for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said, ``getting every bit as
many phone calls now \Rfrom national media\S about our team as I
was before we won our first Super Bowl in 1992, and that's fitting,
because then, and now, no one expected us to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with both clubs missing the playoffs last season, the hype
for this game won't match the hype of big games in the past. At
least that is the thinking of wide receiver Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss those games that took up the whole week of coverage,
like the Green Bay and San Francisco games,'' Irvin said.
``Everybody looked forward to those games. I look forward to one
day having those matchups again.''
Dorsett miffed
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett has said he is miffed that the club did not invite
him to Texas Stadium to watch Emmitt Smith break his career club
rushing record Sunday. Team owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that
if he had it to do again, he would have called Dorsett to join the
club on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Two things stopped Jones from making the call.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was not certain that Smith would get the 95 yards needed
to break the record. Smith had been limited to less than 91 yards
in each of the previous five games against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He also did not realize that Smith's accomplishment would
generate the publicity it did.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not invite Roger Staubach and Drew Pearson to the
sidelines when Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin broke their records,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't had a precedent for ceremonial-type approaches in
the past,'' Jones said. ``Had I known that Emmitt would have the
game he had, and that all of the positive things it would generate,
on hindsight, I would have invited Tony. And I didn't know that
Tony would not already be at the game because a lot of our former
players are already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not meant as a slight in our recognition of what Tony
Dorsett has meant to this franchise,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett was unavailable to comment.
Inside the locker room
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys play in Arizona, much of the sellout crowd is
usually pro-Dallas. But because the Cardinals are in playoff
contention, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey expects the crowd to be
cheering mostly for the home team. ``In years past, we probably
would not practice with \Rcanned\S crowd noise,'' Gailey said.
``But we will this week.'' ... Deion Sanders, Michael Irvin, Fox
commentator Pat Summerall, former Notre Dame football coach Lou
Holtz and former Texas Gov. Ann Richards are expected to be in
attendance at 6:30 p.m. tomorrow to roast Jerry Jones at the 11th
annual Celebrity Roast and Auction benefiting St. Philip's School
and Community Center. The event will be at Dallas International
Apparel Mart. For information, call (214) 421-5221.
YARD MARKERS: How far do the Cowboys have to go? First-and-10
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett and Emmitt Smith are not the only past and present
Cowboys who rank among the NFL's career league leaders. Troy
Aikman, Roger Staubach and Danny White rank among the top 20 in
passer ratings. Everson Walls and Mel Renfro rank among the top 20
interceptors. Dorsett, Smith and Herschel Walker rank among the top
20 in combined yards gained.
What's the call
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel tried a pass near the goal line last
week that resulted in a sack. Chan Gailey tried a pass near the
goal line that resulted in a touchdown. Fassel made a dumb call
because it didn't work. Gailey made a smart call because it did
work. See, the science of detailing what makes a good coach isn't
so hard, is it?
Play action
</P>
<P>
   Most practice-squad players make minimal money and spend the
week working on the scout team, emulating the opponent's best
players. Speedy Zebbie Lethridge has played Denver's Rod Smith,
Oakland's James Jett and Carolina's Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail. But
Lethridge would play Arizona's Scott Player if he had to: ``Hey, if
they want me to hold for field goals, I'd do it and be happy doing
it.''

PACKARD FOUNDATION GIVES $375 MILLION FOR POPULATION CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL MCCABE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the world's population expected to top 6
billion sometime next year, the Packard Foundation will announce
details this week of its plan to dispense $375 million over the
next five years for programs intended to slow population growth.
</P>
<P>
   The grants by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation of Los
Altos, Calif., are believed to be the largest donations ever made
by a private donor for population programs.
</P>
<P>
   The grants, totaling $75 million a year starting next year, will
go mostly to nonprofit organizations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Wilbur, the foundation's executive director, declined
Tuesday to discuss how the money will be allocated. He said details
will be provided during a news conference Wednesday at the
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be aimed mainly at developing countries, but we also
will continue funding programs in this country as well,'' Wilbur
said. ``If you were born in 1960, the world's population was about
3 billion. Every 12 to 15 years, the world gains another billion
people, and the fact that it will surpass 6 billion next year gives
you an idea of the enormity of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The population grants are a small piece of the $8.6 billion the
Packard Foundation is gradually giving away.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1964 by David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett Packard
Co., and his wife, Lucile, the private family organization divides
its grants among nonprofit organizations in eight categories,
including science, children, population, conservation, arts and
community. The grants for 1999 will total $400 million, double the
1997 level.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on population growth said the grants are particularly
timely in view of decreasing government spending to slow growth of
the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has cut its spending by 70 percent over
the past decade, said Peter Kostmayer, executive director of Zero
Population Growth in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's primarily politics, and the growing strength of the
religious right in Congress,'' said Kostmayer, whose organization
trains teachers around the world to teach children about the
population explosion's effect on the environment. ``Family-planning
programs reduce abortions because they don't get pregnant, but this
is lost on the religious right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 percent of the world's population earn under $1,100 a
year, Kostmayer said, and that population is expected to double
within the next 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University said Tuesday that he was
delighted to hear about the grants, although he still is awaiting
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the time when something like this is needed,''
said Ehrlich, Bing Professor of Population Studies as well as a
professor of biological sciences at Stanford. ``Since I got into
this game 40 years ago, we have learned more than enough how to do
humane and healthy things to get birthrates down around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich's 1968 book, ``The Population Bomb,'' has been called a
``wake-up call'' for an entire generation and played a significant
role in popularizing smaller families in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said the disaster and human suffering in Central America
brought on by Hurricane Mitch ``has a huge population component to
it _ people are forced to live in marginal areas far more
susceptible to natural disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   When David Packard died in 1996, most of his money went to the
foundation. Since then, grants have soared, and the foundation is
now the third largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, groups working to slow population growth received $14.8
million in Packard grants. By this September 15, the foundation had
given $35.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the funds have gone to a variety of organizations,
from a group that markets and distributes manual vacuum aspiration
equipment for abortions, to documentary filmmakers preparing a
feature on a health organization in Bangladesh, Wilbur said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Packard Foundation revealed a five-year, $175
million program focused on land conservation in California,
particularly in the Central Valley, the Central Coast and the
Sierra Nevada. To date, working with groups such as the Nature
Conservancy and Trust for Public Land, the program has helped
protect more than 135,000 acres.

FOR HONDURAS' HOMELESS, GOVERNMENT HAS NO READY SOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ To Gloria Reyes, the tiny shack on a
steep hillside overlooking downtown Tegucigalpa was home. To
government planners, eager to turn disaster into a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to redesign Honduras' capital, it was a
public menace.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Either way, the house where Gloria and Hector Reyes and 10
members of their extended family lived no longer exists. It was
smashed and buried by a mudslide during Hurricane Mitch a week and
a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The family members huddle today in a corner of a tent in an
emergency shelter. For the moment, they are surviving on rations
provided by the government and foreign aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   But where they and the nearly 2 million other Hondurans,
Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans made homeless by the
hurricane will go next is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch's devastation dramatized what nearly every visitor flying
into Central America notices: Huge numbers of the urban poor live
in shantytowns perched on steep hillsides and narrow riverbanks
where Mother Nature never intended humans to live.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, the situation is similar: The poor are squeezed
onto marginal areas that are subject to periodic flooding,
landslides, droughts and other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the people killed and displaced by the hurricane
lived in areas that would be considered uninhabitable in the United
States and other wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
   With the status quo finally demonstrated as untenable, the
question is: What next?
</P>
<P>
   ``After Hurricane Fifi (which killed 6,000 people in 1974), we
came up with an excellent plan for the nation's cities,'' said
Mario Martin, a top Tegucigalpa urban planning official who was
educated at Yale University and the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the plan _ which advocated creating green spaces
and settling the urban poor in safer areas on the outskirts of
urban areas _ was stymied by official corruption and the
unwillingness of powerful real estate interests to sacrifice for
the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after Hurricane Gilbert (in 1988) caused mudslides and
made many people homeless, we had another opportunity,'' Martin
added. ``Other floods and disasters have done the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've never been able to take the destiny of our nation in
our own hands. Poverty, apathy and vested interests keep taking it
away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the region's population explosion and the increasing
gap in incomes between rich and poor, workable solutions are few
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is a mountainous nation, and nearly all flatland that
would be suitable for new towns and neighborhoods is already used
for farming. If much of this land is converted to urban uses, the
nation's inability to feed itself will be exacerbated. Like many
other Latin American countries, Honduras imports much of its food.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and other Honduran government officials have proposed a
new master plan for the nation, with Tegucigalpa as the test case.
The neighborhoods where the city's 20,000 newly homeless lived
would be declared parkland, and new industrial suburbs would be
created outside the city to house them.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the plan include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Staggered work hours, with the start of the workday ranging
from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., to reduce rush-hour traffic jams across the
few bridges that remain after Mitch's catastrophic floods.
</P>
<P>
   -- The creation of downtown pedestrian malls _ ``just like San
Diego and other U.S. cities,'' said Martin _ to reduce traffic.
</P>
<P>
   -- Emergency repair of main city bridges while relocating other
destroyed bridges to better locations.
</P>
<P>
   -- A nationwide property-title census, to sort out the tangled
web of conflicting property claims that prevents huge numbers of
city residents from getting bank loans, obtaining city services and
leaving the black-market underground economy.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and his colleagues presented their proposal Tuesday to
Tegucigalpa's mayor and city council. A decision on whether to
adopt it as a blueprint for change is expected within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Where the money will come from, however, is unclear, because
Mitch has delivered a staggering blow to Honduras' economy.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez has no illusions about the
challenge ahead: ``We will have to make a number of difficult
social and political decisions in the coming months about how to
rebuild our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the type of decisions we can make, and whether they are
successful, will depend on the level of external support _ both in
aid and in forgiving our (foreign) debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez said that in addition to large amounts of disaster relief
aid, Honduras and its neighbors will need long-term program support
costing billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous years when natural disasters struck, the huge
price tag of a safer future may prove to be prohibitive in
comparison to maintaining the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa and most other Latin America cities, urban
shantytowns have been built through a complex, decades-long process
of demographic push and pull.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes' neighborhood, Colonia Soto, was founded about 20 years
ago by migrants from the countryside. They banded together,
squatted on unoccupied land and fought long political battles with
the city government.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s to the 1980s, when Honduras was viewed as a
bulwark against the spread of Marxism, U.S. and other foreign aid
agencies gave money to Colonia Soto and other poor neighborhoods to
build infrastructure and houses.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and his colleagues say the recent disaster proves that
the old model was a mere political stopgap.
</P>
<P>
   Such neighborhoods, although they possessed electricity and
water, were flimsily constructed _ and no match for Mitch. In
Tegucigalpa alone, 180 people were killed by the hurricane, 860
disappeared and 3,342 houses were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Similar devastation occurred across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While Honduran and foreign officials wrestle with the dilemma of
how to improve urban development without destroying crucial
farmland, everyday citizens can see no further than tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   In El Porvenir, a squatter neighborhood next to Colonia Soto
that was spared its neighbor's muddy fate, residents say that they
fear the grand dreams of city officials like Mario Martin more than
they do Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is unsafe and it fills me with fear, but it's all
we have,'' said Maria Ines Molina, leader of the neighborhood
patronato, or association. ``Where are we going to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Molina's home, perched on a 30-degree hillside, was shaken but
not stirred by the landslides during the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want us to move, that's fine,'' she said. ``But
they'll have to buy us a new place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid through the nose for our lot. We fought for it for
many years. And if anyone wants to take it away from us this time,
we'll fight again.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 11. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Today leads with the movement of U.S. naval forces toward
the Persian Gulf, apparently positioning for a strike against
Saddam Hussein, a story that is played on the Washington Post front
above the fold, but inside at the other majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times leads with a report that 36 state
attorneys general are very close to a $200 billion settlement of
the health cost claims they've raised against the major cigarette
manufacturers, a story that the Wall Street Journal flags in its
front-page news box. (The Journal says the deal could end up
involving 46 states.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times leads with an exclusive: During the recent
Wye negotiations, the director of the CIA vowed to quit if
convicted spy Jonathan Pollard was freed as part of any deal
reached between the Palestinian Authority and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   According to the USAT account, some of the Iraq scenario is
quite familiar: A dire threat to Saddam (this time issued by
Secretary of Defense Cohen), President Clinton conferring with
national security staff and several foreign leaders, and talk of
Tomahawk cruise missiles as the likely weapon. But, notes the
paper, there is a new wrinkle too: the State Department has ruled
out any last-ditch negotiations. The paper doesn't mention another
one: Unlike past stare-downs, this time neither France nor Russia
is openly resisting U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT lead explains that the proposed tobacco settlement
doesn't provide as much regulatory restraint nor as much money as
the failed federal tobacco bill would have, but also offers the
industry less protection from other lawsuits. In return for the
billions and a ban on cigarette billboards, transit ads and logoed
merchandise, the bill would end most suits seeking recovery of
Medicaid funds spent by the states on smokers. The settlement might
be announced as early as next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT lead says that before CIA Director George Tenet took his
stand regarding Pollard, President Clinton was seriously
considering releasing him. The paper adds that Tenet's vehemence
was a direct reflection of the intelligence community's depth of
anger towards Pollard despite his conviction for spying for a
friendly power. The paper notes that Pollard stole more top-secret
documents than almost any other spy in American history (it would
have been nice if the Times had said who had taken more), a take
measurable in cubic yards, plus it is still unknown if any of them
ended up in unfriendly hands.
</P>
<P>
   The WP lead is a peek at the special alternative medicine issue
of JAMA that's being published today, the first such issue by a
mainstream medical journal. According to the story, an estimated 83
million American adults used some sort of alternative medical
treatment last year, up 47 percent over 1990. This mainly reflects
the medical habits of baby boomers, most of whom said they pursued
the alternative therapies more to prevent future problems than to
treat current ones. The Post says Americans spent $27 billion on
alternative treatment last year, most of it not reimbursed by
insurance. USAT covers pretty much the same ground in its
front-page ``cover story,'' although adding that insurance coverage
of non-mainstream treatment is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page WSJ feature on the current upsurge in home buying
notes a troublesome undercurrent. Yes, the increase in
low-down-payment home loans has meant opening up home ownership to
more low-income families and to more Hispanics and blacks. However,
this new class of homeowner, being more financially strapped, might
have a much harder time retaining homes through any significant
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page NYT piece identifies the real lesson corporate
America is taking away from the Microsoft trial: Old e-mail can be
a minefield of legal liability. High-tech firms, long based on the
free-flow and candor that e-mail encourages, are having second
thoughts. For instance, with an eye towards the courts, employees
are now encouraged, says the paper, to say ``fair competition'' not
``slaughtering'' when talking of business strategy. And to dump old
e-mail whenever possible. The Times reports that Amazon.com
recently offered free lattes to employees who quickly expelled from
their e-mail all files not required for ongoing business or by law.
</P>
<P>
   The WP reports that the recent DNA test revelation that Thomas
Jefferson almost certainly fathered a child with one of his slaves
has energized an Illinois family's previous claim that it is
descended from a liaison between a son of George Washington and one
of his slaves. The family is now searching for known Washington
descendants for the same sort of genetic testing used in the
Jefferson matter. The story doesn't say whether the Illinois family
members view themselves as white or black. But if you think about
it, if this sort of testing became a trend it would be a good thing
no matter what the apparent race of the testers. If they are black,
discovering a relationship to a Founding Father would tend to
replace feelings of alienation often felt by minorities with
feelings of proud connection. If they are white, discovering a
blood relationship to a slave would tend to stimulate empathy for
blacks. Either way, society wins.

 &HT;    Where have you gone Refrigerator Perry?
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Me and a buddy were talking the other day, and
he bet me that in 10 years, there will be a whole bunch of
400-pounders in the NFL,'' Jay Humphrey said. ``I disagreed, but if
you look at (the University of Wisconsin's) Aaron Gibson and (the
University of Texas') Leonard Davis, it's going to be scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially scary if you're a 170-pound cornerback who is
politely asked to get in their way from time to time. That guy
should be a lot more concerned about this widening trend than the
310-pound Texas offensive tackle, who doesn't miss a trip to the
dining room any more than he does the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Humphrey didn't bet his dad's hunting preserve
outside Denison with his friend. The NFL currently boasts 362
linemen who weigh at least 300 pounds. Only 27 such behemoths
suited up in 1987. A report in The Quincy Patriot-Ledger attributed
the increase in widebodies to a loosening of pass-blocking rules
allowing linemen to extend their hands and a corresponding move to
more zone blocking, as opposed to outside plays, where more agile
linemen pull and lead student-body sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have been copying Washington's Hogs since Super Bowl XVII,
but last year's champs, the Denver Broncos, offered rebuttal with
the smallest line in the league.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't noticed _ and those solar eclipses are a good
sign _ the pattern of supersized football players has filtered down
to the college level. In the Big 12 alone, team rosters include 118
players who weigh at least 300 pounds, 15 of them true freshmen.
That doesn't include 51 aspiring hefties who are 290 or heavier,
just a double-cheeseburger away from that austere list. That trend
will never be more obvious than this week, when you watch Texas try
not to get squashed by Texas Tech's mammoth offensive line, which
just happens to be the heaviest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God for wide-angle lenses. These two teams have 27
300-pounders between them, including Texas' 350-pound Davis. But
don't start a food drive for Texas A&AMP;M. The Aggies think Slim Fast
is the star of a Cambodian Western flick. They weigh 299 pounds a
man in the line, and their backups weigh a svelte 298 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Hampton, the Longhorns' 6-foot, 300-pound defensive
tackle, could get a stiff neck from gawking up at a Red Raiders
group that averages 6 feet 4 inches and 323 pounds, 13 pounds more
than the Texas offensive line. Jonathan ``The House'' Gray has done
his part to keep that norm up, thanks to the Monday all-you-can-eat
buffets the Tech tackle frequents. He's a healthy 6-5, 357, give or
take second helpings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pounding on those little defensive tackles _ I say little,
some are about 300 pounds _ sets the stage,'' Gray says. ``It's
like pushing a car up a hill. They can do it one-quarter of the way
up the hill, but then it wears you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that Gray is not the biggest player in college
football. Hardly. That double-meat, double-cheese honor goes to
Wisconsin's Gibson, who at 6-7, 380, is big enough to consider
applying for statehood. Tom Humphrey _ Jay's father _ isn't all
that impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a whole lot of football player there,'' he said,
figuratively speaking. ``Real fast defensive ends are going to wear
him out.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows a little about football. The elder Humphrey played six
years of pro football as a left tackle and, including three seasons
in the Canadian Football League when he was ``a rangy 252 pounds,''
never weighed more than 265. In fact, that's all he was allowed to
weigh. He even had to work at staying under that weight or risk
being fined $25 per pound for exceeding that mandatory limit. Once,
he spent most of a day in a sauna, melting off nine excess pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Humphrey was a naturally strong athlete playing at
Comanche, Texas, where he was agile enough to play two years for
Abilene Christian on a basketball scholarship before switching to
football for his final two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have been in the Hall of Fame if I had lifted
weights,'' he said. ``Back then, you heard all (negative rumors)
about that muscle-bound stuff. You could have put the whole Denver
Broncos weight room in my bedroom. And (Lyle) Alzado was the only
one who ever used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Alzado had other assistance _ he admitted to steroid
use before his tragic, premature death. Humphrey said he believes
the amount of steroid usage is vastly overestimated, adding on a
personal note that ``Jay would rather step in front of a truck than
take drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Humphrey, like other Longhorns, dabbled with the creatine
protein supplement that can be bought over the counter, and Texas
strength coach Jeff Madden has no problem with encouraging its use
so long as dehydration is carefully avoided. Gray says creatine
just added water weight on him and his teammates and that
linebackers are more prone to use the substance.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater health risk is the amount of overload stress on a
player's joints in his knees and ankles. That risk graduates for
the oversized athlete after his career ends, but UT Coach Mack
Brown said the key is continued exercise to lose weight at that
point. He points to former Detroit Lion lineman and Longhorn great
Doug English. ``Doug's skinny now,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, football players work out year-round, while Tom Humphrey
used to prepare for each season about six weeks out. Jay can
bench-press 430 pounds, probably 130 more than his dad ever thought
about putting on a bar. ``They're like Olympic athletes now,'' he
said. Gray said three Red Raiders can bench 400 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   These big linemen practice specialized weightlifting techniques
year-round, observe high-protein and low-carbohydrate diets and
follow strict nutritional guidelines. When Mack Brown was a running
back at Florida State, he and his teammates were given salt tablets
before games to avoid cramping. Then, the coaches dispensed Hershey
candy bars at halftime for a quick energy boost.
</P>
<P>
   Under Madden's guidance, no aspect of the Longhorns' diet is
overlooked. For instance, caffeine is off-limits, so no coffee, no
soft drinks, no Hershey bars all season long. Juice and water are
the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with being big,'' Hampton
says. ``The student-athlete, period, is getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. Ryan Leaf, the San Diego Chargers' rookie
quarterback, weighed 261 at a workout last spring. Two Longhorn
freshmen, Mike Williams and Antwan Kirk-Hughes, average 330 pounds.
The sky apparently is the limit, assuming you'll still be able to
see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad weighed 265 in the NFL, and I'm around 310 now,'' Jay
says. ``You can probably add another 50 pounds for my kid.''

 &HT;    Steering voters not church's role
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Democratic candidates such as Georgia Gov.-elect Roy
Barnes showed up at black churches the Sunday before the election,
and Christian Coalition members distributed voter guides that
allocate points to mostly Republican candidates on a narrow set of
moral issues. The Christian Right is sometimes slammed for using
houses of worship for partisan campaigning, while little is said
about traditional Democratic treks to black churches, especially in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   African-American voter turnout in Georgia in this election was
nearly double the turnout four years ago, and it was key to
statewide Democratic victories. The successful get-out-the vote
effort in black communities can largely be attributed to the
church. But, is there a difference between the Christian
Coalition's political approach and that of black churches, newly
energized by the issues of this election?
</P>
<P>
   The answer isn't as simple as chastising either or both for
seeming partisanship. Religious leaders say churches have a
legitimate role in defining moral issues _ from views on abortion
to non-discrimination policies. But it's wrong for church leaders
to pick candidates for their congregations or for church folks to
work to suppress voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   For guidance on the distinctions in the conservative Christian
vs. black church approaches, I checked with three prominent
theologians: Steve Tipton, an Emory professor of Religion and
Culture ; Robert Franklin, president of the Interdenominational
Theologian Center, and Alton Pollard, director of Black Church
Studies at the Candler School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said he hoped the black church would take a more
``prophetic,'' less political role in the future and pointed to the
restraint exercised by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in resisting
partisan endorsements from the pulpit. ``King never made the
political moves of (the religious right's)Jerry Falwell,'' he
noted, ``but I admit I'm frankly disappointed in the some of the
political operations in black churches.'' Franklin said blacks
shouldn't be dependent on one political party or seek to
spiritualize elections. ``That's not noble, and I hope it's not a
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pollard was harsher in his assessment of Christian Coalition
differences in approach. A key distinction is that the black church
is still serving large numbers of folks ``struggling to survive, ``
he said. In the rural South, for example, blacks still have little
access to political power. Many feel they are ``on the precipice of
danger, `` (of more discrimination) when they see invidious
political ads tinged with racism.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lieutenant governor candidate Mitch Skandalakis'
notorious ads bashing Atlanta's ``black mayor,'' then associating
him with opponent Mark Taylor, supposedly had the blessing of
former Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed, a Skandalakis
campaign adviser In the final analysis, Pollard said, ``There's
only one real difference, but it's critical: Is a political
activity based on the demeaning of others? Because if it is, it's
anti-democratic in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipton, too, acknowledged the legitimate role of all churches in
identifying moral issues. But people of faith, he believes, must
search for facts and context rather then give out directives for
the voting booth _ they must look to teaching by example.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the black church can't and shouldn't be separated
from the black community, U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), best known
for his courage during the civil rights struggle, drew the clearest
distinction between the political activities of the Christian Right
and those of the black church: ``We don't tell folks to punish
people because of a particular piece of legislation,'' he said.

   Way to go, Joe
</P>
<P>
   Hurdling obstacles is Burns' specialty
</P>
<P>
   By Carroll Rogers
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year-old in Little League baseball, with his team
trailing by one run and nobody except maybe his father in the
stands expecting it, Joe Burns took off from third base and stole
home.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't supposed to make it, but he did. His team won, and
soon, after all the other Little-Leaguers were trying it.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing away from home nine years later proved much harder for
Burns, although it was that same instinctive aggressiveness, his
drive to excel and perhaps to shock _ his athletic ability
magnified by his will _ that has Burns sliding safely into his new
home as Georgia Tech tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the recruiting process, Burns was stamped as an
academic casualty. Poor grades and a low SAT score his junior year
made him a significant risk. When he committed to Tech a year ago,
before he had qualified, doubts didn't just circulate in Atlanta,
they were right there in his hometown of Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said `He ain't going nowhere,''' Burns said.
``I used that as a motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer school, a Princeton Review course, two more stabs at the
SAT, a heavy academic load his senior year, and Burns is right
where he said he'd be: taking on calculus and college tacklers. And
after a slow start this season, Burns has emerged as a breakaway
threat in the Yellow Jackets' backfield, a runner capable of making
the big play.
</P>
<P>
   Burns scored his first touchdown against New Mexico State in the
second game and added a team-high 43 yards against Florida State.
He earned his first start of the season against Maryland on
Halloween and responded in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed for a career-high 179 yards, including a 44-yard
touchdown run, to become the first Jackets back this season to gain
100 yards in a game. The performance earned him ACC rookie of the
week honors and helped strengthen a backfield weakened by the loss
of senior Charles Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he was going to be something special,'' coach
George O'Leary said. ``I'm amazed how much he's picked up our
offense as a true freshman. Our offense isn't the easiest to pick
things up with. He does a good job of that and protection and
things most young players have trouble with.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' success hasn't come without a price. Although he was a
high school standout at Thomas County Central, many of the same
folks who cheered him, and perhaps some who recruited him, didn't
expect Burns to make it in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central has a reputation of having great athletes who can play
in Division I, but grades hinder them from going,'' Joe Burns Sr.
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Georgia Tech, Burns also was getting recruited by
Florida State, Florida, Central Florida and South Carolina, but his
father was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them didn't really think he'd get his grades up,'' Joe
Burns Sr. said. ``I don't think they were really serious about
recruiting him, even Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   It was OK with Burns, who said early in his senior year that he
was going to stay in state and play for Georgia Tech. He'd realized
only a year earlier that he wanted to go to college at all.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been a running back since he was 5. In middle school,
the Burns family lived in Riverdale, just south of Atlanta, for a
few years, but Joe was sent back to Thomasville to live with his
grandparents and play sixth- and seventh-grade football.
</P>
<P>
   Yet never in all those years did Burns figure his football
career would go beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about going to college,'' Burns said. ``I
thought I'd graduate from high school and get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been telling him he needed to prepare himself,'' Joe
Burns Sr. said. ``It never dawned on him what I was saying. He was
satisfied playing in high school. He never thought (his ability)
could take him where he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's words didn't get to Burns in middle school, but
those of Thomas County Central coach Ed Pilcher did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became like a father to me,'' Burns said. ``He kept me on
top of things. He pulled me in his office. We had deep talks. He's
one of the things that got me here. He helped me get my priorities
in order. I hadn't matured a lot. I had to stop doing some things I
was doing. I had to stop going places with my friends and
concentrate on my books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me I have a chance to play college football. That
motivated me.''

</P>
<P>
   Zachery gives positive charge
</P>
<P>
   Future bright at Clemson
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Lee
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   The best part about being a member of the Clemson Tigers, says
Travis Zachery, is the 25-second pregame ritual of running down the
hill at Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of his two seasons in Death Valley has been the
downhill run of the Clemson football program; from the 7-5 team he
watched because of a broken ankle last season to the dreary 2-7
squad that he contributes to each week now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to having a season like this,'' said Zachery, a
redshirt freshman from Marietta. ``Little things keep us from
achieving our goals _ turnovers, missed assignments. I just try to
look at the positives.''
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many. Clemson is headed to its worst finish
in more than 20 years, and his coach, Tommy West, could be removed
at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been some positives for Zachery. Like darting to
the field of 80,000 orange crazies for the first time and rushing
15 times for 73 yards in a 33-0 season-opening win against Furman.
He also had a 93-yard performance against Maryland, but his total
in nine games this year is just 488 yards and three touchdowns on
119 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   As the Tigers prepare for 22nd-ranked Georgia Tech on Thursday
night, the 6-foot-1, 191-pound tailback wants a prime performance
against his hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be real pumped and ready to compete against my
fellow Georgians,'' said Zachery, who also returns punts and is
Clemson's all-purpose leader with 755 yards. ``I want to do better.
I want to do everything I can to make us win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think one person makes us win, but I take it a lot
upon myself to make big plays. That's the type of person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   At Marietta High, Zachery was a big-play machine who accumulated
7,528 all-purpose yards, including six kick returns for touchdowns.
Zachery rushed for 1,931 yards and 22 touchdowns his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I saw of him at Marietta, I knew he'd be the
featured back for us,'' West said. ``He's starting to give us that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Zachery, ready to burst loose, has to be patient for a year. On
his second day of practice in 1997, and only his third day at
Clemson, Zachery ran an out pattern and felt a pop in his foot.
Zachery didn't know the seriousness of the injury until he saw the
X-ray, which showed a broken metatarsal bone.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly was redshirted, and the player who once said that he
and weights were ``like oil and water,'' spent most of his time in
the weight room, adding 20 pounds. With the Tigers' career rushing
leader, Raymond Priester, drafted in the fifth round of the NFL
draft by St. Louis, the job of first-team tailback was handed to
Zachery.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his support has come from his mother, Katie, who attends
every Clemson home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep his spirits up,'' she said. ``He's not used to
playing on a losing team, but I don't think they'll be on the
losing end all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And for himself, Zachery sees an upward turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, I'm going to have a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Zachery of Marietta is ``pumped and ready'' for Yellow
Jackets.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: John Glenn's space flight has rekindled my interest in the
space program. Where can I get information on future flights, so I
can go to Florida to watch a launch?
</P>
<P>
   A: For recorded information, call 407-867-4636. Current plans
call for the launch of an unmanned communications satelite between
6:47 p.m. and 7:17 p.m. Nov. 19, followed on Dec. 10 by the
unmanned Mars climate orbiter. The space shuttle Endeavour is
scheduled for launch at 4:45 a.m. Dec. 3. It will be the last
shuttle flight for 1998 and the first flight for construction of
the international space station. It will be followed May 13 by
Atlantis; June 17, Discovery; Aug. 5, Endeavour; and Sept. 16,
Atlantis. All launch dates and times are subject to change, so call
in advance before heading to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to campaign money left over after an election,
or at the end of a politician's career, such as in the case of
resigning House Speaker Newt Gingrich?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only prohibition is that the money can't be converted to
private, personal use. ``They can't just keep the money and run,''
said Ian Stirton of the Federal Election Commission in Washington.
But other than that, politicians can do any number of things with
it, he added, such as contributing it without limit to a party
committee, setting up a political action committee, donating it to
charity, setting up chairs at a university, or even setting it
aside for future use if they choose to run again, such as for state
office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been any more news about the sailing yacht Fantome,
reported missing off Honduras during Hurricane Mitch? Was it ever
found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Officials of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises Ltd. of Miami have
concluded that all 31 members of the crew went down with the
282-foot, four-masted schooner. The Coast Guard gave up its
weeklong search for the vessel on Nov. 5. The $15 million,
steel-hull Fantome, threatened by Hurricane Mitch while on a
one-week cruise, had let off passengers and ``nonessential'' crew
in Belize City before setting back to sea to look for safe haven.
The monster storm apparently followed the Fantome and sunk it with
115-mph winds and towering waves. A helicopter from the British
frigate Sheffield reported spotting eight life vests and two life
rafts with SV/Fantome stenciled on them near eastern Guanaja off
Honduras. But no other trace was found. The water in the area is
1,100 to 1,400 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Bush brothers, George W. and Jeb, will be only the
second pair of brothers in U.S. history to be state governors at
the same time, who were the first?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nelson Rockefeller, governor of New York 1959-73; and
Winthrop Rockefeller, governor of Arkansas 1967-71.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Q&AMP;A leave William Henry Harrison out of the list of
presidents assassinated while in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harrison was the first president to die in office, but he
wasn't assassinated. He rode coatless and hatless on a white horse
to the Capitol on March 4, 1841, to deliver his inaugural address,
getting soaked in a driving rainstorm. The cold rain continued
throughout his one-hour, 45-minute address, and after the ceremony
he led the inaugural parade to the White House. That evening, he
attended three inaugural balls. He caught cold at the ceremonies,
and was prostrated by a chill on March 27. He died of pneumonia on
April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the experts have any tips for preparing a car before
taking it for an emissions test?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are some things a motorist can do: have the engine
tuned (which should include a new air filter); change the oil and
oil filter; make sure the gas cap isn't clogged; and drive the car
for at least 15 minutes before the inspection test. The primary
reason that even well-maintained vehicles require longer test
times, or fail emission tests, is because they're not completely
warmed up at the time of testing. If the little needle on the
temperature gauge is in the middle position, it should be warm
enough. Just before your turn to be tested, rev the engine up a
little, about 2,500 rpm, for a minute. It will help the system
clear out and wake up from the idle time. (Some BMWs, Volvos and
Peugeots should not be revved up, however, because that can cause
transmission damage).
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is wind chill determined? What would it be outside an
airplane going 500 mph if the temperature is 50 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wind chill factors are calculated using actual temperatures
in degrees (or negative degrees) Fahrenheit and wind velocity
measured in miles per hour. But there's no simple mathematical
formula. The National Weather Almanac's wind chill equivalent
temperature table shows 125 below zero as the most extreme, derived
from an actual temperature of 45 degrees below zero and a wind
velocity of 45 mph. As a practical matter, winds in excess of 40
mph produce little additional chilling effect. And it goes without
saying that wind chill is something that an airplane doesn't
experience, since it's a measurement of how the combined chilling
effect of low temperatures and wind feels to exposed flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understant that melatonin is used by some older people to
aid in sleeping. But I heard that during his space flight, John
Glenn wouldn't be taking it. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Previously published reports said only that Glenn ``failed to
meet the criteria'' established by Dr. Charles Czeisler, the
principal researcher on the sleep experiments being conducted on
the Discovery mission. Glenn was disqualified from the portion of
the experiment that would have required him to take small doses of
melatonin, a hormone produced in the brain that some researchers
believe enhances sleep and could serve as a countermeasure for
weariness among astronauts. The use of melatonin constituted about
one-third of the Discovery sleep experiment. Czeisler said federal
medical privacy requirements and his institution's own medical
ethics prevented him from disclosing the reasons for Glenn's
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife says she saw a UFO. She says it was gray, like
stainless steel, and at first was shaped like an isosceles
triangle. Then it moved very quickly to the north and changed shape
to a disc before vanishing. Is there some organization I can report
it to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Aviation Administration refers people who believe
they have spotted UFOs to the National UFO Reporting Center in
Seattle, 206-722-3000, said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
Recorded information at that number advises callers to leave
contact information and a brief description of the sighting so a
staff member can return the call. It also lists a Web site _
http://www.ufocenter.com _ for more information and on-line
reporting of sightings. Or you can write: National UFO Reporting
Center, P.O. Box 45623, University Station, Seattle, WA 98145. The
Mutual UFO Network is another possibility. You can call its
hotline, 1-800-836-2166, and you can get information at its Web
site _ http://www.mufon.org _ including a sighting questionnaire.
Or write: Mutual UFO Network Inc., 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX
78155-4099.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The latest space shuttle flight brought back memories of
Christa McAuliffe, who died in the Challenger explosion. What is
the status of her husband and children?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steve McAuliffe continues to adhere to the policy of not
speaking about his late wife that he set at the time of the
accident Jan. 28, 1986. McAuliffe has remarried, and in 1996 was
named a federal judge. He declines to talk to reporters about
Christa, and zealously guards the privacy of their children, Scott,
and Caroline. He even quashed a move to rename Concord High School
in Concord, N.H., after his wife, who taught there. Friends say he
keeps the Challenger explosion in quiet perspective. He just
doesn't talk in public about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The launch of the Discovery mission, with John Glenn aboard
and millions watching, was delayed by an airplane that flew too
close to the launch area. What was the upshot of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Oct. 30 launch actually was threatened by five private
planes, not just one. ``It was an all-time high,'' said Federal
Aviation Agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen, who added that at
every previous shuttle launch, there has been at least one
intruder. Published reports said all five offending aircraft had
been identified by the FAA. The FAA restricts air space at the
shuttle launch site at NASA's request to maintain the integrity of
the airspace and to ensure the safety of the shuttle and the pilots
who might fly too close, Bergen said. In the latest instance,
Discovery's launch was delayed for less than 10 minutes while
patrolling security planes chased the five offenders from the
restricted airspace.

<P>
   UNDATED: restricted airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I watched the recent TV miniseries about the singing group
Temptations, and it made me wonder: Who are the people billed as
the Temptations who perform around the country now? What
relationship do they have, if any, to the original group?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original Temptations, in the early '60s, were Eddie
Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eldridge Bryant and Otis
Williams. Over the years, the makeup of the act has been
ever-changing. Bryant left the group shortly after its first single
on the Motown label, ``Oh Mother of Mine,'' flopped. He was
replaced by David Ruffin, who himself was replaced by Dennis
Edwards when Ruffin decided to pursue a solo career in 1968. And so
on. Members who have died include Paul Williams (1973); Ruffin
(1991); Kendricks (1992); and Franklin (1995).
</P>
<P>
   As of this past summer, it was composed of Otis Williams (the
only original), Terry Weeks, Ron Tyson, Theo Peoples and Harry
McGilberry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hurricane Mitch left Central America devastated. How can we
send help to the people there?
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of relief operations are under way. These are among
them:
</P>
<P>
   CARE is concentrating its relief programs in the Atlantida and
Colon regions of Honduras, as well as the capital, Tegucigalpa.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember that back in the '80s, Roanoke, Va., had a female
symphony conductor who was up-and-coming and making a reputation
for herself. I forgot her name. Who was she, and what became of
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Victoria Bond, the first woman to earn a doctoral
degree in conducting from The Juilliard School in New York, and
music director and conductor of the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra from
1986 to 1995. She also served as artistic director of Opera Roanoke
from 1989 to 1995. In her multifaceted career, Bond, a Los Angeles
native, has composed symphonic and operatic works, chamber music,
ballet scores and pieces designed for young audiences. Her works
have been widely performed in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   She currently is music adviser to the Wuhan (China) Symphony,
but returns to the United States often. In September, Bond
conducted the Greenville, S.C., Symphony in the opening of the $36
million Bi-Lo Center; in October, she presided over the
season-opening performance of the Harrisburg, Pa., Opera. In
December, she'll return to China to conduct a Christmas program in
Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, which will include the premiere
of a commisioned work by her based on traditional Chinese songs. In
January, Bond will present her opera ``Travels'' in New York, and
in March she'll conduct Opera Carolina's production of ``Madame
Butterfly'' in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many U.S. presidents have been assassinated while in
office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Four: Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley and
John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long after liftoff does an astronaut start feeling the
weightlessness?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on the mission, because it's a combination of the
time it takes for both the solid rocket booster and the main engine
to fire, and that can vary. In the case of the current Discovery
mission, it was about 8 1/2 minutes, said John Petty of the Johnson
Space Center in Houston. The solid rocket booster burned for about
2 minutes; the main engine continued for another 6 1/2 minutes.
``When the main engine stops, that's basically when zero G, or
weightlessness, begins,'' Petty said. ``Just at the point the
external tank is jettisoned.'' The zero-gravity state lasts until
the astronauts turn the orbiter backward and ignite the orbital
maneuvering system engine to slow down and come out of orbit, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do astronauts sleep when they're in space? Are they in
a hammock or bed of some type?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the current space shuttle Discovery mission, John Glenn
and the other astronauts sleep in small, rectangular containers,
said John Petty at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. He likened
them to the compartments common at railroad stations and in
minimalist hotels in Japan, with little more than a small bed
enclosed in a space which has room enough only for one person. In
other missions, astronauts use sleeping bags that can be attached
to the walls, Petty said. The astronauts can't simply float around,
because they would bump into things and wake up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Bill Clinton was the first president
since Richard Nixon to watch a launch from Cape Canaveral. I seem
to remember pictures of Ronald Reagan at the Challenger launch when
it blew up. Is my memory faulty?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reagan was at the White House on Jan. 28, 1986, working on
the State of the Union address he was planning to deliver to the
nation that evening. When the Challenger exploded at 11:39 that
morning, just 74 seconds after liftoff, killing all seven crew
members, Reagan decided to postpone his State of the Union message.
He then made a nationally broadcast statement from the Oval Office,
saying, in part: ``Today is a day for mourning and remembering.
Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle
Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of
our country. This is truly a national loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas
attended the Discovery launch. Wasn't she the congresswoman who
once was in the news for asking if the cameras used in the Mars
probe could pick out the U.S. flag left there by American
astronauts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The planetary gaffe occurred in September 1997 when Lee,
a member of the House Aeronautics and Space Committee whose Houston
district neighbors the Johnson Space Center, was talking to an
official at the Mars Pathfinder Mission Control Center in Pasadena,
Calif. She asked if the Pathfinder mission succeeded in taking
pictures of the American flag planted by astronaut Neil Armstrong
in 1969, which of course was on the moon, not Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow committee member Rep. Vern Ehlers (R-Mich.) didn't
consider the question out of the ordinary. ``If you ask the
American people how long it takes Earth to orbit the sun, 50
percent can't tell you,'' he said. ``We just don't teach enough
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was stationed in the Rio Grand Valley in World War II,
we were told that the King Ranch in South Texas was one of the
biggest in the country. I've always wondered: Exactly how big is
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ranch certainly is kingdom-size: 825,000 acres (or more
than 1,300 square miles), making it larger than Rhode Island. It
was established in the mid-1850s by Richard King, a riverboat
captain. It's home to more than 60,000 head of cattle and more than
1,000 horses. In comparison, Ted Turner's Vermejo ranch in New
Mexico covers 578,000 acres. For another comparison, the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park covers 520,269 acres.

 &HT;    The '80s: Are you in tune with era?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a big country, dreams stay with you.
</P>
<P>
   So do song lyrics, especially when there is always something
there to remind you.
</P>
<P>
   And with the '80s, there is. From the soundtracks of ``The
Wedding Singer'' and ``Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'' to
radio revival shows and pop culture shrines on the Internet, the
Reagan years have got the beat. Loverboy and Rick Springfield are
on tour, and Culture Club and the Human League sold out their
Atlanta concert this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually we haven't. Quizzes on '80s lyrics and copies of
the essay ``I Am a Child of the Eighties'' have become staples of
Gen-X e-mail and newsgroups, so there's plenty of opportunity to
rewind.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry in the nostalgia fest is ``Who Can It Be Now?''
(Fireside, $9.95), a collection of trivia and 500 one-liner song
lyrics. Authors Peter T. Fornatale and Frank R. Scatoni, editors at
Simon &AMP; Schuster, put the book together after getting hooked on a
bar guessing game on '80s song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of listening to ABBA, so the '80s is the next
logical step,'' says Scatoni, 27, an MTV disciple whose first album
purchase was by the video-powered Men at Work.
</P>
<P>
   A little looking back goes a long way, though, even if mining
hundreds of songs for lyrics did rekindle Fornatale's respect for
Hall &AMP; Oates. After all, he and Scatoni had to listen to a lot of
Air Supply and Bonnie Tyler, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of fun reliving it,'' says Scatoni. ``But at the
end of writing the book, after listening to the songs over and over
again, we had had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lee writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Atlanta, Ga.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: restricted airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I watched the recent TV miniseries about the singing group
Temptations, and it made me wonder: Who are the people billed as
the Temptations who perform around the country now? What
relationship do they have, if any, to the original group?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original Temptations, in the early '60s, were Eddie
Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eldridge Bryant and Otis
Williams. Over the years, the makeup of the act has been
ever-changing. Bryant left the group shortly after its first single
on the Motown label, ``Oh Mother of Mine,'' flopped. He was
replaced by David Ruffin, who himself was replaced by Dennis
Edwards when Ruffin decided to pursue a solo career in 1968. And so
on. Members who have died include Paul Williams (1973); Ruffin
(1991); Kendricks (1992); and Franklin (1995).
</P>
<P>
   As of this past summer, it was composed of Otis Williams (the
only original), Terry Weeks, Ron Tyson, Theo Peoples and Harry
McGilberry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hurricane Mitch left Central America devastated. How can we
send help to the people there?
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of relief operations are under way. These are among
them:
</P>
<P>
   CARE is concentrating its relief programs in the Atlantida and
Colon regions of Honduras, as well as the capital, Tegucigalpa.
Information: 1-800-521-2273; and at http://www.care.org on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCares is organizing relief efforts in Honduras, Guatemala
and Nicaragua. Monetary contributions for the purchase of disaster
supplies can be sent to AmeriCares, 161 Cherry St., New Canaan, CT
06840. Information: 1-800-486-4357.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Committee for UNICEF requests funds for essential drugs
and medicines, clean water and blankets. Send donations to: U.S.
Committee for UNICEF, 333 E. 38th St., New York, NY 10016.
Information: 1-800-367-5437 or http://www.unicefusa.org on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders has programs in Nicaragua, Honduras and
Guatemala, and is monitoring the situation in Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Belize and Mexico. Donations to the Hurricane Mitch
Relief Effort can be made to: Doctors Without Borders, 6 E. 39th
St., 8th Floor, New York, NY 10016. Information: 1-888-392-0392.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross also is supporting Central American
relief efforts. Checks or money orders can be sent to: American Red
Cross International Response Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC
20013. For a credit card donation, call 1-800-435-7669 or
1-800-257-7575 (Spanish). Internet users can make an online credit
card donation at http://www.redcross.org and choosing International
Relief Fund as their option of giving.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember that back in the '80s, Roanoke, Va., had a female
symphony conductor who was up-and-coming and making a reputation
for herself. I forgot her name. Who was she, and what became of
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Victoria Bond, the first woman to earn a doctoral
degree in conducting from The Juilliard School in New York, and
music director and conductor of the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra from
1986 to 1995. She also served as artistic director of Opera Roanoke
from 1989 to 1995. In her multifaceted career, Bond, a Los Angeles
native, has composed symphonic and operatic works, chamber music,
ballet scores and pieces designed for young audiences. Her works
have been widely performed in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   She currently is music adviser to the Wuhan (China) Symphony,
but returns to the United States often. In September, Bond
conducted the Greenville, S.C., Symphony in the opening of the $36
million Bi-Lo Center; in October, she presided over the
season-opening performance of the Harrisburg, Pa., Opera. In
December, she'll return to China to conduct a Christmas program in
Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, which will include the premiere
of a commisioned work by her based on traditional Chinese songs. In
January, Bond will present her opera ``Travels'' in New York, and
in March she'll conduct Opera Carolina's production of ``Madame
Butterfly'' in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many U.S. presidents have been assassinated while in
office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Four: Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley and
John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long after liftoff does an astronaut start feeling the
weightlessness?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on the mission, because it's a combination of the
time it takes for both the solid rocket booster and the main engine
to fire, and that can vary. In the case of the current Discovery
mission, it was about 8 1/2 minutes, said John Petty of the Johnson
Space Center in Houston. The solid rocket booster burned for about
2 minutes; the main engine continued for another 6 1/2 minutes.
``When the main engine stops, that's basically when zero G, or
weightlessness, begins,'' Petty said. ``Just at the point the
external tank is jettisoned.'' The zero-gravity state lasts until
the astronauts turn the orbiter backward and ignite the orbital
maneuvering system engine to slow down and come out of orbit, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do astronauts sleep when they're in space? Are they in
a hammock or bed of some type?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the current space shuttle Discovery mission, John Glenn
and the other astronauts sleep in small, rectangular containers,
said John Petty at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. He likened
them to the compartments common at railroad stations and in
minimalist hotels in Japan, with little more than a small bed
enclosed in a space which has room enough only for one person. In
other missions, astronauts use sleeping bags that can be attached
to the walls, Petty said. The astronauts can't simply float around,
because they would bump into things and wake up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Bill Clinton was the first president
since Richard Nixon to watch a launch from Cape Canaveral. I seem
to remember pictures of Ronald Reagan at the Challenger launch when
it blew up. Is my memory faulty?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reagan was at the White House on Jan. 28, 1986, working on
the State of the Union address he was planning to deliver to the
nation that evening. When the Challenger exploded at 11:39 that
morning, just 74 seconds after liftoff, killing all seven crew
members, Reagan decided to postpone his State of the Union message.
He then made a nationally broadcast statement from the Oval Office,
saying, in part: ``Today is a day for mourning and remembering.
Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle
Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of
our country. This is truly a national loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas
attended the Discovery launch. Wasn't she the congresswoman who
once was in the news for asking if the cameras used in the Mars
probe could pick out the U.S. flag left there by American
astronauts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The planetary gaffe occurred in September 1997 when Lee,
a member of the House Aeronautics and Space Committee whose Houston
district neighbors the Johnson Space Center, was talking to an
official at the Mars Pathfinder Mission Control Center in Pasadena,
Calif. She asked if the Pathfinder mission succeeded in taking
pictures of the American flag planted by astronaut Neil Armstrong
in 1969, which of course was on the moon, not Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow committee member Rep. Vern Ehlers (R-Mich.) didn't
consider the question out of the ordinary. ``If you ask the
American people how long it takes Earth to orbit the sun, 50
percent can't tell you,'' he said. ``We just don't teach enough
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was stationed in the Rio Grand Valley in World War II,
we were told that the King Ranch in South Texas was one of the
biggest in the country. I've always wondered: Exactly how big is
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ranch certainly is kingdom-size: 825,000 acres (or more
than 1,300 square miles), making it larger than Rhode Island. It
was established in the mid-1850s by Richard King, a riverboat
captain. It's home to more than 60,000 head of cattle and more than
1,000 horses. In comparison, Ted Turner's Vermejo ranch in New
Mexico covers 578,000 acres. For another comparison, the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park covers 520,269 acres.

 &HT;    The culture of hunting: Texas deer season begins
 &HT;    (EDS: With photos.)
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPICEWOOD, Texas _ Griff Andrews is building the mother of all
campfires _ a hair-singeing, boot-melting eternal flame _ to ward
off the nasty wet chill that has settled on Red Bluff Ranch. It's
working, too, because anyone within 15 feet can feel the blast of
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Around the rest of the compound, the business of deer camp
begins. Jim Houser stands watch over a barbecue pit. Lynn Segall,
whose family owns the ranch, greets visitors. John Bloomquist, the
quiet one, disappears again after saying hello.
</P>
<P>
   The four hunters have been a single unit for 30 years or so, at
least since high school, and have been hunting from this spot for
the past 14 seasons. The group works as one in the fading light of
last Friday afternoon, getting everything ready for the next
morning, the opening day of deer season. They have spent weekends
leading up to this day, cutting brush, clearing camp and stacking
wood. The anticipation is thick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already drawn for stands,'' Andrews says. ``We've been
doing this for years. If you're No. 1 this year, you get to pick
first. Then your name moves down the list.'' Houser will get
hunting stand No. 1, the prize spot on the 500-plus acres.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a deer like old Big Boy will come along again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever killed him, but we saw him several times over
three years. Big Boy, he was something,'' Segall says. Everybody
stares reverently into the fire. The scene is repeated around
countless fires all over Texas on this night.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in this annual ritual spread across the state
this past weekend, from the midsize ranches like Red Bluff to
million-dollar deer-hunting temples along the Rio Grande border.
Deer hunting in Texas is big sport and big business. While some may
balk at the outcome, there is no arguing with the popularity of
this annual even-- that begins the first Saturday in Novem-- er and
continues into January.
</P>
<P>
   With this weekend's kickoff of the season, an estimated 600,000
hunters will kill somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 deer. Those
numbers do not dent Texas' healthy deer population, estimated at
about 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters will spend nearly $1 billion on shells and beer, gas
and food. The ranch owners spend millions more to feed, fence and
manage their herds.
</P>
<P>
   Deer camps and deer hunting are the new business of ranching in
Texas, actually replacing livestock on hundreds of ranches that
once were reserved for cattle or sheep and goats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are almost zero ranch sales for livestock anymore,''
said Darwin Avant, co-founder and operator of the private Los
Cazadores deer-hunting contest in Cotulla, former La Salle County
sheriff and now a ranch and lease broker in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ranches up to 5,000 to 7,000 and even up to 10,000
acres are strictly for deer hunting. A few very large places are
sold for livestock and hunting,'' Avant said. ``Deer hunting has
added $100 to $200 per acre to the price of land, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranches in South Texas have sold for prices once reserved for
prime waterfront property along Hill Country streams, and Avant
credits the emergence of the white-tailed deer.
</P>
<P>
   Times change; deer stay
</P>
<P>
   Old Big Boy aside, trophy bucks are hard to come by on Red Bluff
Ranch, where the emphasis is as much on fun and friendship as it is
on huge antler racks. Tradition and ritual are passed on to the
next generation. The hunter who fails to obey them hears about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned real quick what to do,'' Andrews says over barbecue
and beer at the pre-opening dinner. ``Like you never go (relieve
yourself) inside the fence.'' He points at the ragged barbed-wire
fence that circles the small camping area. ``I stumbled out here in
the middle of the night one time and thought nobody would know if I
just went to the fence. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Segall picks up the story: ``People were yelling at him from the
trailer, `Outside the fence.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson,'' Andrews says.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the camps are meant to be, places where lessons are
learned and traditions are shared among family and friends. That's
why B. Segall, Lynn's 79-year-old father and the camp patriarch,
started bringing the group when they were youngsters and why he
still comes _ just for the campfire life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved to Austin in the early 1950s,'' B. Segall says, as he
stands next to the campfire. ``I started Lynn hunting and then the
others came with us. I don't hunt anymore, but I still do my share
of work up here.''
</P>
<P>
   B. Segall started an engineering and consulting firm in Austin,
when the city was still just a town. He says he designed the
electrical and mechanical parts of the first air-conditioned
building in Mexico City and some of the first ones in Travis
County.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Spicewood was rural to the core, not a burgeoning
community between Austin and Marble Falls. ``I've seen this country
change,'' the elder Segall says. ``Some of the creeks have stopped
running as people have drilled wells and the cedar has spread. But
the deer have always been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual parade of hunters
</P>
<P>
   The deer have always been in the Hill Country, maybe nowhere
more than in Llano County, the designated Deer Hunting Capital of
Texas, which is to say the world. Even before deer hunting was big
business, the business of deer hunting was big in the tiny little
town on the banks of the Llano River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first weekend of deer season is a major weekend for
sure,'' said Mary Rhodes, executive director of the Llano Chamber
of Commerce. ``Forty-six percent of all the contacts at the chamber
are related to wildlife recreation. We have people from Florida,
California, North and South Carolina, Missouri, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Llano, famous barbecue is the foundation and deer hunting is
the superstructure of the area economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for deer season, we wouldn't be in business,''
said Bryan Miiller, owner of Miiller's Meats. ``We've been here for
13 years and deer hunters have kept us going. Half our annual
income comes during deer season.''
</P>
<P>
   Miiller said 10 percent of his business is done with hunters
from Florida, but he also has regular customers from Maryland, New
York, Pennsylvania, even England. ``One man has been coming here
for 37 years from Florida, and he brings 15, 20 people with him
every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same scene is played out throughout the Hill Country every
deer season, especially on the first weekend. By Wednesday of the
week leading up to opening day, streams of vehicles pulling
four-wheelers and deer stands are moving through every little town
west of Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters buy gas, food, deer corn, beer and soft drinks, as
well as book up the hotels and motels and fill up the restaurants.
Good times for the hunters, good times for the business people.
</P>
<P>
   Deer diary. . .
</P>
<P>
   Having wrapped themselves around a bunch of barbecued sausage,
backstrap and wild hog, and just a few beers, the crew at Red Bluff
Ranch is settling in around the fire to tell stories about hunts
gone by. Most of them are about shots that missed and jokes that
worked.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is less atavistic than anti-hunters would believe,
more Hemingwayesque and quiet _ people bonded by experience and
beliefs. Stories don't even have to be finished to be real. Just a
word or two, and everybody can live the event one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Houser pulls out the camp log book, a record going back to the
group's first year at Red Bluff Ranch, in 1984. Every deer killed
and its weight and age are recorded, along with personal notes
about good hunts and special bucks. Many of them have names.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Big Boy, of course,'' Houser says. ``Stumpy.'' He only
had three good legs. ``White Head.'' Obviously. ``Limpy and Limpy
II.'' Don't ask. ``The Bobbsey Twins, Old Gray, Gotcha.''
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on, like the fire, but the night is winding down.
Time to crawl into bed for the short night and long wait for
opening morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get to sleep before the snoring starts,''
Andrews says.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is a little bit worried about the weather, which is
wet, cold and tending toward fog and mist. Not the best weather for
deer hunting, ``-- ut better than last year, when it was 90
degrees,'' Segall declares.
</P>
<P>
   One last question before bed: Which hunter is the most likely to
fire a shot at first light? All hands point to Andrews. ``That
would be me,'' he says. ``I've been pretty consistent killing a
deer on opening day.''
</P>
<P>
   There's none of this waiting for a giant to come along for
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if I see something I want to shoot, I shoot it,'' he
says. ``I like to get something on the ground and then look for a
bigger one.''
</P>
<P>
   Big bucks mean big bucks
</P>
<P>
   Hunters all over Texas are looking for a bigger one, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1996 National Survey of Fishing and Hunting and Wildlife
Associated Recreation showed that in-state expenditures for hunting
were $1.4 billion,'' said Jerry Cooke, director of upland and big
game ecology for Texas Parks and Wildlife. Deer hunting represents
about 65 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
   That $1.4 billion was direct spending for trips, food and
equipment and does not include the cost of ranches, high fences,
protein feed and hunting vehicles. Some deer hunts now sell for
more than $10,000, and the price of leasing land is creeping toward
a state standard of $10 per acre annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``White-tailed deer are the No. 1 game animal,'' Cooke said.
``The change has come about not so much in growth in demand as in a
more reliable supply. People are managing their land and their deer
herds, and that means better hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that anybody in my family has ever paid to hunt,
but we're all still closely tied to the land,'' he said. ``When a
substantial portion of the population lived on the land, the
thought of paying to hunt was unheard of. Now, most people live in
cities, and paying to hunt is the only way they can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire at will
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no money that changes hands here,'' Lynn Segall says
as he waits for the hunters' return on the first morning of the
season. ``We all just know there's work that has to be done and we
come up on the weekends all year to do it. We start working on next
season as soon as this season closes.''
</P>
<P>
   He glances up over the mountain that marks the edge of Red Bluff
Creek, for which the ranch is named. The top is shrouded in mist
and rain, pretty poor conditions for hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard only one shot,'' Segall says. ``I think it was
Griff. He said he might kill a doe early.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Andrews' truck comes sliding up the wet caliche
road and circles camp to back in toward the hanging pole, where the
carcasses are displayed. Outside the fence. ``He's pulling around.
He's got one,'' Segall says.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, stripped down to an orange University of Texas jersey
and a pair of olive-drab pants, pops out of the cab with a smile on
his face, which is painted with stripes of blood. ``I did it
myself,'' he says. ``It's one of the traditions here.''
</P>
<P>
   The doe he has killed turns out to be 3 years old and weighs 90
pounds, a very good weight for a doe in the Hill Country. He hasn't
hung the carcass yet when Houser makes it back to camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a good one and I was going to shoot it, too, but my
scope fogged up,'' he says. ``I tried wiping it off, but he saw me
and spooked. He never came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole camp moves to gather around Andrews' doe. The talk --
s of other deer that were seen but not shot. Of deer that never
showed up. Of the afternoon hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, they have something new to talk about when
Bloomquist kills the largest buck in the 14-year history of the
camp. ``It was a big eight-pointer that weighed 140 pounds,''
Segall says. ``That's a big deer for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews keeps up a steady narrative, which everybody expects.
Bloomquist still hasn't said three words, but nobody expects him to
say anything. Houser keeps the log.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of this,'' Segall says. ``This opening weekend is
a ritual for us, and it would take a major emergency for any of us
to miss it. I've never had a better partnership than with these
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the men are starting to bring spouses and children with them
to share in the ritual _ the food, the talk and the hunting _ that
began when they were children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has gotten more complicated for all of us, but this is a
combination of values and tradition that are so easily lost
today,'' Segall says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad taught us to hunt and taught the value of ethics, and
we're feeling the same thing. We try to manage the game as much as
we can to to teach the kids the values of all this. It's almost
sacred to us.''

 &HT;    Mother of Susan Smith speaks out about her daughter's crime
 &HT;    (EDS: This story is the result of more than two years of efforts
by Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Chris Burritt to get
an interview with Linda Russell. Russell would not agree to a
photo, but Burritt took shots at John D. Long Lake and at the
memorial to the dead boys. File art of Russell should be
available.)
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION, S.C. _ Linda Russell cannot reach into her daughter's
mind to understand why she drove her little boys to the top of a
boat ramp, released the emergency brake and sent them to their
deaths strapped in the back seat of her car.
</P>
<P>
   So she drives the roads that Susan Smith drove that October
night in 1994 trying to fathom a depression so bottomless that it
could lead to murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put her in a dark car, on a dark road, for mile after mile
after mile,'' Russell said driving the desolate highway one recent
evening. ``The longer she drove, the more lonely she felt. She lost
touch with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell knew that her daughter was upset that day. She was
distraught over her broken marriage and her recently dashed romance
with her wealthy lover. Smith's life had always been a highway of
heartache, from her father's suicide to her twisted relationship
with her stepfather, Russell's then-husband, Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   But had Smith's life taken such a dire turn that she'd kill her
kids? Russell has pondered that question for four years, only now
grasping enough understanding to find a little peace.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since a jury convicted her daughter of
murder, Russell is talking publicly about the ghastly textile-town
tragedy that sent chills down America's spine. Divorced now and
selling the brick ranch house where Smith grew up, the 54-year-old
mother and grandmother who has been portrayed as cold, controlling
and hard-edged is showing her emotional scars, sharing her pain,
and trying to move on.
</P>
<P>
   She recently began attending meetings to organize the Union
County chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a
group that helps families deal with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the average person know about mental illness or
depression?'' Russell said. ``I think it is time we do have a
national debate or talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Russell said she's not yet willing to participate if it
means accepting invitations from Oprah Winfrey or some of the other
national television programs that have asked her to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``As if I were stupid enough to believe that they care about
Susan or me,'' Russell said. ``I think my family has been exploited
enough.'' In faded jeans and neatly pressed denim shirt, Russell
seems as tightly wound as a bobbin of yarn. Her silver-framed
glasses sit atop her neatly styled gray hair. She wears a gold
chain with a small cross and dove, hinting at the solace she said
she's found in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russell is bound up in grief and anger. She's angry at
Smith's ex-husband and at the prosecutor who sought the death
penalty against her daughter. She is suspicious of the media and
anyone else nosing around her family. Over the span of a balmy
October afternoon, Russell slowly, hesitantly unwrapped her
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Her 27-year-old daughter is mentally ill, Russell said, and
belongs in a hospital, not in Women's Correctional Institution in
Columbia where she is serving a life sentence. She is eligible for
parole on Nov. 3, 2024, 30 years after she was charged in the
deaths of Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Russell regularly visits her daughter, the former textile mill
secretary now identified as inmate No. 221487. She wears a tan
uniform. Her mother said that ``she looks like skin and bones. I
guess that goes with all the struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith does clerical work for teachers in the prison, where she
lives among the general population and receives counseling, coupled
with the anti-depressant Prozac. If Smith's depression had been
diagnosed and she had been taking Prozac, Russell said, her
daughter never would have killed her sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a bad person. She loved her children,'' Russell
said. ``Something as simple as a pill could have made so much of a
difference in so many lives.'' For the most part, life has returned
to normal in this Bible-belt town of 10,000 between Spartanburg and
Columbia. The boat ramp at John D. Long Lake is gone, ripped up
after a freak accident in 1996. Seven people drowned when their car
apparently slipped into gear and rolled into the water.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds visiting the stone monuments to Michael and Alex have
thinned out, leaving the state-owned lake mostly to fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth fall since the boys' murder. The crisp
coolness dabs the forest of piedmont South Carolina in the fiery
colors of sundown. But a sadness lingers. Michael would have turned
7 on Oct. 10. All that remains are pictures and clothes and toys.
The black-and-red plastic lawn mower he pushed around his
grandmother's back yard is tucked away, dusty, on the screened back
porch.
</P>
<P>
   The healing has been slow for Russell in a house surrounded by
memories of her grandsons and their mother. ``Almost instantly, one
half of my grandchildren were gone; one third of my children were
jerked away,'' said Russell, flicking her left hand as if shooing
away a fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking slowly on her back-porch swing, Russell smokes Salem
Lights and drinks coffee from a mug. It's the same place she sat,
stunned and silent, on the night of Nov. 3, 1994, after learning
that two of her grandchildren were dead and their mother had been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   From the porch, Russell can remember much of what she'll never
see again.
</P>
<P>
   Michael picked tomatoes and green peppers in a garden that's now
brown except for a splash of powdery blue flowers. His little legs
pumped the pedals of his tricycle, speeding around and around on
the cool blue concrete floor. He'd stop, turn the bike upside down
and cry out ``fix it'' as his tiny hands worked busily with
make-believe tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss them,'' said Russell, wiping her eyes. ``I rocked them
and fed them and bathed them and played with them hours on end.
When I ache to hold them, I can only ... I hurt that much worse
because no matter how bad I wanted to hold them, it couldn't be
anything compared to what Susan wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell can't bear the thought of Michael and Alex's last
moments. It is excruciatingly painful to picture them sinking,
strapped in car seats as the inky water of John D. Long Lake filled
the burgundy Mazda their mother had rolled down a boat ramp minutes
before. After Smith confessed, ending nine days of lying about her
sons' whereabouts, divers returned to the lake and found the
decomposing bodies 18 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Not once since then has Russell gone to the lake or visited the
nearby monuments. Nor has she pressed her daughter for details
about that moment atop the boat ramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what Susan told me?'' she said. ``That she thought
the Lord had lifted that car and put it somewhere. And (the
children) were somewhere and they were safe and if they could just
find where He had put it, she could have her children back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly three and a half years since Smith was found
guilty of murder, Russell said she has begun to understand the
silent devastation of mental illness. ``Obviously you have to say
that Susan was responsible for their deaths,'' Russell said. ``But
who was responsible for what happened along the way that got her in
that mental shape?''
</P>
<P>
   When Russell travels the route that Smith drove that night, she
believes that the lonely road echoed and emphasized her daughter's
dark isolation. As she often did, Russell had invited her daughter
to come to her house that night to feed and bathe the boys. Russell
had gone to another of her grandson's football games, and she came
home around 8 p.m. Smith had not shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the young mother drove aimlessly down S.C. 215, the
two-lane road between Union and Carlisle. She was deeply trouble
over her failed marriage to David Smith and the abrupt end of her
romance with Tom Findlay. He was the son of Susan Smith's wealthy
boss, J. Cary Findlay, who controlled one of Union's biggest
companies, decorative-tassel manufacturer Conso Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutor Tommy Pope tried to convince the jury that
Smith drowned her sons in hopes of winning back Tom Findlay, who
had told her in a letter that he wasn't interested in a ready-made
family. Russell said her daughter knew that Findlay was not
interested in marriage. Instead, Russell blames her daughter's
despair in part on her troubled marriage to David Smith. ``Susan
had filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery, and he was trying
to get her back,'' Russell said. ``He played mind games with her. I
do not think he realized how far he was pushing her.'' David Smith,
who worked recently for Winn-Dixie in Spartanburg, could not be
reached for comment. Neither could his father, C. David Smith in
Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1995 book, ``Beyond All Reason _My Life with Susan
Smith,'' David Smith admitted to cheating on his wife, while
accusing her of cheating on him. His portrayal of his mother-in-law
was unflattering, accusing Russell of interfering with the
marriage. After his wife had filed for divorce, Smith wrote, he was
so angry that he arranged for his girlfriend, Tiffany Moss, to
follow Susan Smith around in hopes of catching her with another
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be that somehow what Susan did was a product of all
that catting around and foolishness and lying?'' Smith wrote.
``People all over the world sneak around on each other, lie to each
other, and do each other dirt. But no one kills their children. No
one murders their babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell believes that nobody realized how desperately alone her
daughter felt. She tries to imagine how Smith felt driving that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu-draped trees loomed like ghosts in the darkness along S.C.
215. Smith turned left at the stop sign in Carlisle, dimly lighted
by the glow of the L'il Cricket convenience store, and she plunged
again into the darkness of the Sumter National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further she drove and the longer she drove, the more
isolated she felt,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith crossed the Broad River, drovea while and turned around.
She stopped on the bridge, got out of her car and contemplated
jumping into the black rocky river. Michael cried out in the back
seat, jarring his mother back from the brink, and she drove back to
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Even then she didn't go to her mother's house, less than five
miles away. She wound up on the other side of Union, parked atop
the steep boat ramp at John D. Long Lake. Russell believes she
intended to kill herself and her boys. But she got out and released
the emergency brake.
</P>
<P>
   The car hit the water, floated for an estimated six minutes, and
sank.
</P>
<P>
   For the next nine days, Smith lied, playing the part of the
stricken mother. She told police, her family and the nation that a
black gunman had stolen her car. She painted a pitiful portrait of
herself, stranded and screaming, ``I love y'all'' as her sons
disappeared down the dark road. Russell said she never suspected
that her daughter was lying, or that she might have killed her
boys. ``You know, I don't even like that word,'' Russell said.
After the truth came out, people recoiled at Smith's lying. Russell
said, ``If you go back and look at those interviews, everyone of
them says, ``I love you.' Everyone of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was Susan going to explain the unexplainable?'' Russell
said. ``If you could say there was a motive, in her awful state of
mind, it was her love of Michael and Alex.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you make anybody understand that you love somebody so
much that you just give them to Jesus?'' Russell said. ``That
nobody is ever going to hurt them anymore and that they are going
to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell believes that only those who have been in the depth of
depression could understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you rationally explain the irrational mind?'' she
said. ``Only somebody who has reached the point where they have
totally lost it, where they've had an emotional breakdown, can
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said she finds affirmation in the phone calls she
receives from strangers, some who call in the early hours of the
morning. They want to talk about how their mental illnesses almost
pushed them to suicide or some other horrible act. Her daughter
also hears from people who want to share their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identified with your situation so much because there were
many times when I knew that they only way to end my pain was to
kill myself,'' a 45-year-old woman from Pennsylvania wrote Smith in
August. Doctors ``had drummed into me how damaging it was to a
child if a parent killed theirself,'' the woman wrote. ``So in my
desperate and sick mind, I figured that I would have to kill my
daughter, too. It made sense at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith mailed the letter to her mother, and asked her to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Russell still begrudges the media for treating her family ``like
bugs under a microscope'' during the July 1995 trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was easier for the news media to make it into a
soap opera than delve into the complicated issues,'' Russell said.
In the trial, defense lawyers called Smith's relatives and friends
to testify that Smith had suffered from trauma after trauma,
including her father's suicide when she was 6. She attempted
suicide by aspirin when she was 13 and again at 18. She was
hospitalized after the second incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Susan's trial when the doctor said Susan was mentally
ill, that hurt. Well, I won't even say hurt,'' Russell said. ``It
was shock. All of the things that I had been through with
Susan...Here was a name for it. I had not even thought that Susan
might be mentally ill.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Smith seemed a normal teenager, who was voted
friendliest girl in Union High School's senior class in 1989. Her
mother always thought she'd work through her problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan was the only daughter I had,'' Russell said. ``And I
didn't have another daughter to compare. You live with things as
they come along. It's like dealing with one thing, and by the time
you think things are all right, here comes something else.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the trial's most sensational revelations, Russell's
second husband, Beverly, took the stand and apologized for having
sexual relations with his stepdaughter until three months before
she drowned her sons.
</P>
<P>
   Their relations had begun when Smith was 15. The family got
counseling, but the inappropriate relations resumed after Smith had
turned 16. A counselor told Linda Russell, ``Susan's in love with
Bev.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do when you have a 16 1/2 year old who thinks she
is in love with your husband?'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than divorce her husband, Russell said, she decided to
keep the family together as her way of protecting her daughter. She
feared that if her husband lived elsewhere, her daughter could
drive to see him and escalate the intimate nature of their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Russells called off an investigation by the sheriff's
office, which had been contacted by the local social services
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean if Susan had been 4 or 5, I probably would have killed
him,'' Russell said. ``I did what I felt like was the best thing to
do...by not allowing it to be beyond my control.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Russell said she separated from her husband in early 1995,
after she learned about the extent of his relations with her
daughter. Their divorce became final in September. They agreed to
sell the home where they raised Smith and her two brothers. Russell
hasn't been able to finish the task of sorting through Michael and
Alex's belongings. She has given away some of the clothing, but she
said, ``You could only stand to do so much.''
</P>
<P>
   She has put a few special things_some toys, a pair of shoes, a
baby book_in an antique cedar chest. She's also tucked in some of
her daughter's memorabilia, including her childhood ballet
slippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a chest full of remembrances of three lives,'' Russell
said softly as the porch swing creaked in a sad rhythm. ``That's
her chest.''

 &HT;    Byrd Goad powers to World Weightlifting bronze
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robin Byrd Goad, who won three medals Tuesday in the
World Weightlifting Championships, says it's pure coincidence that
her daughter has the same name as the city hosting the first
Olympics with that sport for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose her name the week before they announced we were going
to be in Sydney, Australia,'' said Byrd Goad, 28, who won three
bronze medals Tuesday in the 53 kg (116 pound) weight class at the
World Weightlifting Championships in Lahti, Finland. ``It wasn't
chosen for that, but maybe we instinctively knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is 2 1/2. Both of her parents, Byrd Goad and husband
Dean, have been training with the 2000 Games as their goal.
</P>
<P>
   In Finland, Byrd Goad lifted a total of 182.5 kg (401 1/2
pounds) for the overall bronze medal, including 82.5 kg (181 1/2
pounds) in snatch and 100 kg (220 pounds) in clean and jerk. She
finished behind China's Wang Xiufen and Bulgaria's Izabela Dragneva
in all three categories
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised because I didn't expect to be in medal
contention here,'' Byrd Goad said Tuesday. ``Women's weightlifting
. . . being an Olympic sport in 2000, is going to bring a lot more
attention and a lot more good athletes to the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 world champion, Byrd Goad has won 20 international
medals _ two golds, 12 silvers and six bronzes. For years, she
lobbied to get women's weightlifting into the Olympics and was
bitterly disappointed when the Atlanta Games didn't include it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Byrd Goad was four months pregnant and living near
Seattle, she received a pre-dawn call from her coach, John Coffee
with the good news about the Sydney Olympics. Even while taking
time off to have Sydney, Byrd Goad knew she wasn't finished with
weightlifting. And now, she says, ``I'd be crazy (to retire). It's
like being 16 and starting all over again. It's something I've
waited all these years for; training has a whole new meaning now.
Not to downplay anything I've accomplished before, but now
everything's new and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goads have turned their garage into a gym, and training is a
family affair; Dean Goad will lift in the American Open in
December.

 By CELIA DUGGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If Bombay is India's New York City, then New Delhi is its
Washington, a capital city with a staid provincial air that boasts
broad, stately boulevards, grand vistas of awe-inspiring monuments,
and an abundance of bureaucrats and politicians.
 &HT;    It is a place where the history of India _ from the time of the
Mughal emperors, through the British Raj, and into the
post-independence era _ is visible everywhere, like the layers of
an archaeological dig.
 &HT;    The best way to get a feel for the city, particularly the
buildings that were designed and laid out by the architect Edwin
Lutyens during the Raj, is to hire a taxi (you'll have to ask for
one with seat belts, since most have none).
 &HT;    Be sure to take the majestic drive up to India Gate, the giant
archway that is Delhi's Arc de Triomphe, a memorial to the 90,000
soldiers of the Indian Army who died in World War I. One of the
spokes of the wheel of streets that spin out from India Gate,
Rajpath, leads to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the official residence of the
President of India, once the British Viceroy's house.
 &HT;    Also worth a look is the sculpture by Devi Prasad Roy Chaudhary
that depicts the march led by Mohandas K. Gandhi in 1931 against
British salt taxes.
 &HT;    To step back in time, visit Shah jahanabad, the city established
by Emperor Shahjahan 350 years ago. Known today as Old Delhi, it is
still a thriving, vital place.
 &HT;    Walk through the vast interior of the Red Fort and its ill-kempt
gardens or rent a bicycle rickshaw to take you through the narrow,
clogged alleyways. The weather should be pleasant, with warm days
and cool evenings, although a cold snap is possible as the calendar
moves into December.
 &HT;    Anywhere you go, be prepared for the city's poor to jostle up
against you. In the middle of busy streets, urchins, mothers
holding naked babies and men with misshapen bodies knock on car
windows, begging for a few rupees. Once out of official New Delhi,
the jhuggis, or slums, sprawl outward from the highways.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    In November, the Crafts Museum, opposite the Purana Qila on
Mathura Road, (91-11) 337-1641, will have dozens of dhurrie
weavers, potters and other artisans working in a plaza where
visitors can talk to them and watch them.
 &HT;    The museum itself, a series of galleries in village huts, is a
wondrous collection of the folk and tribal arts and crafts of
India, which still provide a livelihood to more than 20 million
people. Admission is free.
 &HT;    The sound and light shows at the Red Fort, which run nightly for
50 cents a person, is schmaltzy but enjoyable entertainment. From
molded plastic chairs, the audience watches as the mosques and
minarets around the courtyard are illuminated by lurid lights.
 &HT;    A disembodied, mellifluous voice tells the story of the fort,
first in Hindi, then half an hour later, at 7:30, in English,
punctuated by the screams of women and the thunder of horses'
hooves. Tickets can be bought at the entry to the Fort and at the
Ashok, Janpath and Lodhi hotels.
 &HT;    On Nov. 15, Birju Maharaj will perform the classical Indian
dance of Kathak at Siri Fort Cultural Complex, Khel Gaon Marg. Time
and ticket prices have not yet been set. Call (91-11) 462-2033 for
information.
 &HT;    The story of Lord Shiva, one of the incarnations of the Hindu
god Vishnu, will be told in a regional dance of the state of
Orissa, Odissi, performed by Reela Hota. Call (91-11) 371-4307 to
get an invitation for free admission to the dance, Nov. 30 at 6:45
p.m. at the Sri Ram Center of Art and Culture, 4 Safdar Hashmi
Marg.
 &HT;    Sonal Mansingh will perform the classical Bharatnatyam dance at
the India International Center auditorium, 40 Lodi Estates, on Nov.
30 and Dec. 1 at 6:30 p.m. A call to (91-11) 461-9431 will produce
a free invitation.
 &HT;    For more listings of sights and cultural events, pick up the
weekly Delhi Diary at any newsstand.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Raj Ghat, the memorial to Mohandas K. Gandhi, father of the
nation, is moving, not because of the simple petal-strewn marble
platform but because of the pilgrims who touch it with reverence
and emotion.
 &HT;    With luggage balanced on their heads, they circle the memorial
in a kind of mourning dance that has never ended since his
assassination 50 years ago. It is set in a well-kept park east of
the Red Fort, between the Ring Road and the Yamuna River.
 &HT;    Chandni Chowk, a shopping area from the Mughal era and still a
thriving marketplace, has been spruced up. Here Delhiites buy
everything from electrical appliances to deep-fried sweets at
Jalebi Wala, an open-air shop where men squirt the pretzel shaped
treats called jalebis into vats of boiling oil.
 &HT;    Lodi Garden, next to the India International Center, is a lovely
spot for a picnic or a stroll. Its tranquil, beautifully landscaped
grounds are laid out around th e tombs of the Lodi and Sayyid
sultans who ruled north India in the 15th and 16th centuries.
 &HT;    The National Gallery of Modern Art, (91-11) 338-2835, near India
Gate on Rajpath, was once the Delhi residence of the Maharajah of
Jaipur. Its bright, spacious galleries now house Indian and
colonial art. Except for Mondays and holidays, the museum is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 12 cents.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Ambassador Hotel, Sujan Singh Park, (91-11) 463-2600, fax
463-8219, has pleasant, sunny rooms with window air-conditioning
units. Near Khan market, a shopping center with everything from
aspirin to books to handicrafts, the 88-room hotel has a cheerful
coffee shop where people crowd the hand-painted yellow and blue
tables. Double rooms cost $140 plus 20 percent tax.
 &HT;    Nirula's Hotel, L-Block, Connaught Circus, (91-11) 332-2419, fax
335-3957, is a popular place near one of New Delhi's main shopping
areas at Connaught Circle. The 28-room hotel has a lounge where
light streams through large windows and a bustling coffee shop, and
is next door to an ice cream parlor. The rooms are standard issue,
with central air-conditioning and showers. A double costs $68 plus
10 percent tax.
 &HT;    Budget: The Maharani Guest House, 3 Sunder Nagar, (91-11)
469-3129, is in one of the city's residential neighborhoods, close
to the main Sunder Nagar market. This modest hotel is neatly kept,
with its front lawn clipped like a spit and polish mustache. The 24
rooms are spacious and air-conditioned. Mattresses on the wooden
platform beds are on the thin side. A double room is $52, plus 10
percent tax.
 &HT;    Hotel Fifty Five, H-55 Connaught Circus, (91-11) 332-1244, fax
332-0769, is a spare, air-conditioned hotel with a small terrace
looking over the horn-tooting traffic that rushes past. Its 15
smallish rooms come with bathrooms and telephones, but no
television. A double room costs $35, plus 10 percent tax.
 &HT;    Luxury: Delhi has a number of plush hotels, but perhaps the most
elegant is the 290-room Oberoi New Delhi, (91-11) 436-3030, fax
436-0484, with a gorgeous swimming pool, sybaritic health club,
fancy Thai, Chinese and French restaurants, a 24-hour coffee shop
that serves delectable Indian lunch buffets and beautifully
decorated rooms. Doubles begin at $320 plus 20 percent tax.
 &HT;    The vaulted marble lobby of the 518-room Hyatt Regency Delhi,
Bhikaji Cama Place, Ring Road, (91-11) 618-1234, fax 618-6833, is
brightened with lavish displays of fresh flowers. The hotel has a
big pool and a children's pool, tennis courts, a fitness center and
the city's best Italian restaurant, La Piazza. It's fun to sip a
Kingfisher beer and eat chips and salsa, Indian style, at the Polo
Lounge, a wood-paneled bar. Doubles start at $275, plus 20 percent
tax.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Bukhara, at the Maurya Sheraton Hotel, Diplomatic Enclave,
(91-11) 611-2233, is one of the most festive places to eat in
Delhi. It is deservedly famous for its tandoori specialties from
the Northwest Frontier provinces of India.
 &HT;    The stone-clad walls are draped with carpets. Copper pots hang
from wooden rafters. And guests, eating at wooden trestle tables
with their fingers, consume platters of lamb, chicken and fish
pomfret that have been marinated and roasted in the tandoor oven.
Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $100.
 &HT;    Many Indian restaurants not based in the big hotels are very
inexpensive by American standards. Moti Mahal, the famous old
Indian restaurant on Netaji Subhash Marg, (91-11) 327-3011, serves
tasty tandoori chicken, spicy lamb stews and buttery dal.
 &HT;    Diners can eat outside and listen to live quawwali singing.
Dinner for two, with beer (no wine is served), costs about $20.
 &HT;    Getting to Karim, Gali Kababiyan, Matia Mahal, near the Jama
Masjid, (91-11) 326-9880, means wading through beggars, bicycle
rickshaws and shoppers into the narrow, jam-packed alleyways of the
old city. It is a raucous, smoky, exotic scene, a little like
something out of an Indiana Jones movie.
 &HT;    The restaurant is not air-conditioned and sells no alcohol, but
the kebabs, tandoori meats and curried dishes are delicious. Dinner
for two costs about $10.
 &HT;    The Sweets Corner, at 1 Sunder Nagar Market, (91-11) 461-9261,
is a South Indian vegetarian restaurant that sells no alcohol. At
the entrance is the Dosa Counter, where men at a griddle spread
batter for the South Indian style thin, crispy pancakes called
dosa, then fill them with delectable spicy stuffings. It would take
two people with very big appetites to spend more than $5 on dinner.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    Delhi has many wonderful places to treasure-hunt. The prettiest
is Santushti Shopping Complex in the Willingdon Air Force Camp, in
Chanakyapuri, where elegant shops in white bungalows are set on a
greensward along curving stone pathways.
 &HT;    The shops sell clothing, crafts, jewelry and household objects.
At Noorjehan a hand-painted scarf is $33. At Lotus Eaters, a silk
and Pashmina shawl is $106.
 &HT;    The Sunder Nagar market in Sunder Nagar is not much to look at,
but it has delightful shops that sell antique furniture, paintings,
jewelry, brass wares and other crafts. La Boutique, a dark, crowded
place, offers heavy tribal silver necklaces for $94 and silver
earrings set with semiprecious stones for $5 to $14.
 &HT;    Dilli Haat, Sri Aurobindo Marg, opposite the INA market, is a
large, pleasant crafts market spread over six acres. The 62 stalls
are arranged around a large, clean brick plaza. There is an
admission charge of 12 cents.
 &HT;    Here you can buy four sparkly arm bangles for $1.20 and a
hand-painted sari from Bihar for $35. At the back of the plaza are
stalls that sell snacks and meals from different regions of India
that can be eaten at stone picnic tables.
 &HT;    Khan Market, Subramaniam Bharati Marg, is a cluttered jumble of
stores that range from everyday vegetable sellers to boutiques.
Anokhi sells clothing made from pretty, subtly colored cottons that
are handblock printed. A girl's dress is $5.65, a woman's
sleeveless shift $12.
 &HT;    Mehra Brothers offers hand-painted, lacquered papier-mache
boxes, frames and other objects from Kashmir. Books in India are
generally a great value. Try Bahri Sons or Times Book Gallery,
which gives a 10 percent discount for cash. Hardbacks generally
cost $12 to $14 and paperbacks are $4.70 to $7.

 &HT;    
 By CELIA DUGGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If Bombay is India's New York City, then New Delhi is its
Washington, a capital city with a staid provincial air that boasts
broad, stately boulevards, grand vistas of awe-inspiring monuments,
and an abundance of bureaucrats and politicians.
 &HT;    It is a place where the history of India _ from the time of the
Mughal emperors, through the British Raj, and into the
post-independence era _ is visible everywhere, like the layers of
an archaeological dig.
 &HT;    The best way to get a feel for the city, particularly the
buildings that were designed and laid out by the architect Edwin
Lutyens during the Raj, is to hire a taxi (you'll have to ask for
one with seat belts, since most have none).
 &HT;    Be sure to take the majestic drive up to India Gate, the giant
archway that is Delhi's Arc de Triomphe, a memorial to the 90,000
soldiers of the Indian Army who died in World War I. One of the
spokes of the wheel of streets that spin out from India Gate,
Rajpath, leads to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the official residence of the
President of India, once the British Viceroy's house.
 &HT;    Also worth a look is the sculpture by Devi Prasad Roy Chaudhary
that depicts the march led by Mohandas K. Gandhi in 1931 against
British salt taxes.
 &HT;    To step back in time, visit Shah jahanabad, the city established
by Emperor Shahjahan 350 years ago. Known today as Old Delhi, it is
still a thriving, vital place.
 &HT;    Walk through the vast interior of the Red Fort and its ill-kempt
gardens or rent a bicycle rickshaw to take you through the narrow,
clogged alleyways. The weather should be pleasant, with warm days
and cool evenings, although a cold snap is possible as the calendar
moves into December.
 &HT;    Anywhere you go, be prepared for the city's poor to jostle up
against you. In the middle of busy streets, urchins, mothers
holding naked babies and men with misshapen bodies knock on car
windows, begging for a few rupees. Once out of official New Delhi,
the jhuggis, or slums, sprawl outward from the highways.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    In November, the Crafts Museum, opposite the Purana Qila on
Mathura Road, (91-11) 337-1641, will have dozens of dhurrie
weavers, potters and other artisans working in a plaza where
visitors can talk to them and watch them.
 &HT;    The museum itself, a series of galleries in village huts, is a
wondrous collection of the folk and tribal arts and crafts of
India, which still provide a livelihood to more than 20 million
people. Admission is free.
 &HT;    The sound and light shows at the Red Fort, which run nightly for
50 cents a person, is schmaltzy but enjoyable entertainment. From
molded plastic chairs, the audience watches as the mosques and
minarets around the courtyard are illuminated by lurid lights.
 &HT;    A disembodied, mellifluous voice tells the story of the fort,
first in Hindi, then half an hour later, at 7:30, in English,
punctuated by the screams of women and the thunder of horses'
hooves. Tickets can be bought at the entry to the Fort and at the
Ashok, Janpath and Lodhi hotels.
 &HT;    On Nov. 15, Birju Maharaj will perform the classical Indian
dance of Kathak at Siri Fort Cultural Complex, Khel Gaon Marg. Time
and ticket prices have not yet been set. Call (91-11) 462-2033 for
information.
 &HT;    The story of Lord Shiva, one of the incarnations of the Hindu
god Vishnu, will be told in a regional dance of the state of
Orissa, Odissi, performed by Reela Hota. Call (91-11) 371-4307 to
get an invitation for free admission to the dance, Nov. 30 at 6:45
p.m. at the Sri Ram Center of Art and Culture, 4 Safdar Hashmi
Marg.
 &HT;    Sonal Mansingh will perform the classical Bharatnatyam dance at
the India International Center auditorium, 40 Lodi Estates, on Nov.
30 and Dec. 1 at 6:30 p.m. A call to (91-11) 461-9431 will produce
a free invitation.
 &HT;    For more listings of sights and cultural events, pick up the
weekly Delhi Diary at any newsstand.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Raj Ghat, the memorial to Mohandas K. Gandhi, father of the
nation, is moving, not because of the simple petal-strewn marble
platform but because of the pilgrims who touch it with reverence
and emotion.
 &HT;    With luggage balanced on their heads, they circle the memorial
in a kind of mourning dance that has never ended since his
assassination 50 years ago. It is set in a well-kept park east of
the Red Fort, between the Ring Road and the Yamuna River.
 &HT;    Chandni Chowk, a shopping area from the Mughal era and still a
thriving marketplace, has been spruced up. Here Delhiites buy
everything from electrical appliances to deep-fried sweets at
Jalebi Wala, an open-air shop where men squirt the pretzel shaped
treats called jalebis into vats of boiling oil.
 &HT;    Lodi Garden, next to the India International Center, is a lovely
spot for a picnic or a stroll. Its tranquil, beautifully landscaped
grounds are laid out around th e tombs of the Lodi and Sayyid
sultans who ruled north India in the 15th and 16th centuries.
 &HT;    The National Gallery of Modern Art, (91-11) 338-2835, near India
Gate on Rajpath, was once the Delhi residence of the Maharajah of
Jaipur. Its bright, spacious galleries now house Indian and
colonial art. Except for Mondays and holidays, the museum is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 12 cents.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Ambassador Hotel, Sujan Singh Park, (91-11) 463-2600, fax
463-8219, has pleasant, sunny rooms with window air-conditioning
units. Near Khan market, a shopping center with everything from
aspirin to books to handicrafts, the 88-room hotel has a cheerful
coffee shop where people crowd the hand-painted yellow and blue
tables. Double rooms cost $140 plus 20 percent tax.
 &HT;    Nirula's Hotel, L-Block, Connaught Circus, (91-11) 332-2419, fax
335-3957, is a popular place near one of New Delhi's main shopping
areas at Connaught Circle. The 28-room hotel has a lounge where
light streams through large windows and a bustling coffee shop, and
is next door to an ice cream parlor. The rooms are standard issue,
with central air-conditioning and showers. A double costs $68 plus
10 percent tax.
 &HT;    Budget: The Maharani Guest House, 3 Sunder Nagar, (91-11)
469-3129, is in one of the city's residential neighborhoods, close
to the main Sunder Nagar market. This modest hotel is neatly kept,
with its front lawn clipped like a spit and polish mustache. The 24
rooms are spacious and air-conditioned. Mattresses on the wooden
platform beds are on the thin side. A double room is $52, plus 10
percent tax.
 &HT;    Hotel Fifty Five, H-55 Connaught Circus, (91-11) 332-1244, fax
332-0769, is a spare, air-conditioned hotel with a small terrace
looking over the horn-tooting traffic that rushes past. Its 15
smallish rooms come with bathrooms and telephones, but no
television. A double room costs $35, plus 10 percent tax.
 &HT;    Luxury: Delhi has a number of plush hotels, but perhaps the most
elegant is the 290-room Oberoi New Delhi, (91-11) 436-3030, fax
436-0484, with a gorgeous swimming pool, sybaritic health club,
fancy Thai, Chinese and French restaurants, a 24-hour coffee shop
that serves delectable Indian lunch buffets and beautifully
decorated rooms. Doubles begin at $320 plus 20 percent tax.
 &HT;    The vaulted marble lobby of the 518-room Hyatt Regency Delhi,
Bhikaji Cama Place, Ring Road, (91-11) 618-1234, fax 618-6833, is
brightened with lavish displays of fresh flowers. The hotel has a
big pool and a children's pool, tennis courts, a fitness center and
the city's best Italian restaurant, La Piazza. It's fun to sip a
Kingfisher beer and eat chips and salsa, Indian style, at the Polo
Lounge, a wood-paneled bar. Doubles start at $275, plus 20 percent
tax.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Bukhara, at the Maurya Sheraton Hotel, Diplomatic Enclave,
(91-11) 611-2233, is one of the most festive places to eat in
Delhi. It is deservedly famous for its tandoori specialties from
the Northwest Frontier provinces of India.
 &HT;    The stone-clad walls are draped with carpets. Copper pots hang
from wooden rafters. And guests, eating at wooden trestle tables
with their fingers, consume platters of lamb, chicken and fish
pomfret that have been marinated and roasted in the tandoor oven.
Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $100.
 &HT;    Many Indian restaurants not based in the big hotels are very
inexpensive by American standards. Moti Mahal, the famous old
Indian restaurant on Netaji Subhash Marg, (91-11) 327-3011, serves
tasty tandoori chicken, spicy lamb stews and buttery dal.
 &HT;    Diners can eat outside and listen to live quawwali singing.
Dinner for two, with beer (no wine is served), costs about $20.
 &HT;    Getting to Karim, Gali Kababiyan, Matia Mahal, near the Jama
Masjid, (91-11) 326-9880, means wading through beggars, bicycle
rickshaws and shoppers into the narrow, jam-packed alleyways of the
old city. It is a raucous, smoky, exotic scene, a little like
something out of an Indiana Jones movie.
 &HT;    The restaurant is not air-conditioned and sells no alcohol, but
the kebabs, tandoori meats and curried dishes are delicious. Dinner
for two costs about $10.
 &HT;    The Sweets Corner, at 1 Sunder Nagar Market, (91-11) 461-9261,
is a South Indian vegetarian restaurant that sells no alcohol. At
the entrance is the Dosa Counter, where men at a griddle spread
batter for the South Indian style thin, crispy pancakes called
dosa, then fill them with delectable spicy stuffings. It would take
two people with very big appetites to spend more than $5 on dinner.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    Delhi has many wonderful places to treasure-hunt. The prettiest
is Santushti Shopping Complex in the Willingdon Air Force Camp, in
Chanakyapuri, where elegant shops in white bungalows are set on a
greensward along curving stone pathways.
 &HT;    The shops sell clothing, crafts, jewelry and household objects.
At Noorjehan a hand-painted scarf is $33. At Lotus Eaters, a silk

 &HT;    The Sunder Nagar market in Sunder Nagar is not much to look at,
but it has delightful shops that sell antique furniture, paintings,
jewelry, brass wares and other crafts. La Boutique, a dark, crowded
place, offers heavy tribal silver necklaces for $94 and silver
earrings set with semiprecious stones for $5 to $14.
 &HT;    Dilli Haat, Sri Aurobindo Marg, opposite the INA market, is a
large, pleasant crafts market spread over six acres. The 62 stalls
are arranged around a large, clean brick plaza. There is an
admission charge of 12 cents.
 &HT;    Here you can buy four sparkly arm bangles for $1.20 and a

that can be eaten at stone picnic tables.

Anokhi sells clothing made from pretty, subtly colored cottons that

 &HT;    Mehra Brothers offers hand-painted, lacquered papier-mache
boxes, frames and other objects from Kashmir. Books in India are

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    New Year's Eve, 1998? Think of it as practice.
 &HT;    Most serious party lovers already have their eyes on the bash of
the century, Dec. 31, 1999. Many of them have already made their
plans, and plenty of hotels have been booked for ages.
 &HT;    But for travelers who haven't decided what to do, here's a
selection of travel-related parties that should make it easy to
welcome in the millennium with a bang. Prices are based on
double-occupancy unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;    The Big Apple looms large for party-goers on the ultimate New
Year's Eve, and the Rhiga Royal Hotel (151 West 54th St., New York,
N.Y. 10019; 800-937-5454) has a deal for couples from Dec. 31 to
Jan. 2, 1999.
 &HT;    Chauffeur-driven limousine transportation brings guests to one
of the hotel's Grand Royal Penthouse suites that overlook Central
Park and the Hudson River.
 &HT;    On New Year's Eve, each couple is brought by limousine to the
Rainbow Room to ring in the millennium with a dinner dance. New
Year's Day starts with breakfast en-suite and continues with a
Broadway show of the couple's choice.
 &HT;    The final day brings brunch and the bill _ just $10,000 per
couple.
 &HT;    Down in the Caribbean, the Bitter End Yacht Club (North Sound,
Virgin Gorda, BVI; 800-872-2392) has cozy hillside and beachfront
villas, a sailing school and a recipe for a party.
 &HT;    The BEYC 2000 Celebration is a 10-day package that includes a
millennium bash with 15 different bands from Virgin Gorda playing a
12-hour session on New Year's Eve. The partying will take place on
shore and on boats, with a fireworks display at midnight.
 &HT;    The package includes accommodations, transfers, all meals,
beverages, use of boats, all entertainment and theme dinners. The
cost is $10,800 per couple, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    Perhaps the tranquility of the English countryside beckons on
this special New Year's? The Lygon Arms (High Street, Broadway,
WR12 7DU, England; 800-63-SAVOY), located in the Cotswolds, has a
three-night package that will mark the millennium as well as its
own 500 year anniversary.
 &HT;    The millennium package at this Savoy Group hotel includes a
helicopter tour of the Cotswolds, a New Year's Eve ball and the
services of both a graphologist and a psychic on New Year's Day to
help everyone peer a little bit farther into the future.
 &HT;    Accommodations and most meals are included in the price, which
is $1,411 per person.
 &HT;    The Broadmoor (Box 1439, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80901;
800-634-7711) which dates from 1918, is one of the grandest hotels
in the West.
 &HT;    This Rocky Mountain treasure will have ``A Celebration of the
Centuries,'' an all-inclusive weekend party that offers activities
ranging from a dinner dance to a New Year's Eve show with
Bernadette Peters and the Temptations.
 &HT;    New Year's Day will feature Bloody Mary ``First Aid Stations.''
Such classic Colorado pleasures as horse-drawn sleigh-and-carriage
rides will be available during the quieter moments. The cost starts
at $2,500 per person.
 &HT;    Both Royal Caribbean International (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami,
Fla. 33132; 800-327-6700) and Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean
Way, Miami, Fla. 33132; 800-437-3111) have announced ambitious
millennium plans for cruisers.
 &HT;    For example, Royal Caribbean's ``Voyager of the Seas,''
``Enchantment of the Seas,'' ``Grandeur of the Seas,'' ``Sovereign
of the Seas'' and Celebrity's ``Century'' will convene at midnight
on New Year's Eve off Coco Cay in the Bahamas for a fireworks
display in the midst of individual millennium itineraries. Contact
a travel agent or cruise-only agent for prices.
 &HT;    The Ritz-Carlton (3414 Peachtree Road N.E., Suite 300, Atlanta
Ga. 30326; 800-241-3333) has the Ultimate Experience. Reserved for
just one couple at each of the Ritz-Carlton hotels, the package
includes three nights in the Ritz Carlton Suite, the premier suite
in each hotel, which includes a private dining room and butler.
 &HT;    Men receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Chronograph while ladies
receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Quadrato.
 &HT;    The two lucky guests also receive a magnum of Taittinger
champagne, two Baccarat flutes, limousine transfers and a Jaguar at
their disposal all weekend. All meals and parties are included.
 &HT;    For example, conductor Peter Duchin will be on hand at the
Ritz-Carlton, Boston, while Lou Rawls will hold court at The
Ritz-Carlton, Naples (Fla.).
 &HT;    The price for the Ultimate Experience is $100,000 per couple.
For those who aren't prepared to part with that kind of change,
there are packages with three-night minimum stays that start at
$450 per room, per night. Contact Ritz-Carlton for a Millennium
Experience brochure.
 &HT;    Finally, for those who absolutely must be together with their
closest friends in New York City on New Year's Eve, the Fitzpatrick
Manhattan Hotel (687 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022;
212-355-0100) is prepared.
 &HT;    This midtown New York hotel with an Irish flavor is offering one
enterprising celebrant and 181 of their closest friends the chance
to take over the entire 17-story hotel for three nights. That's 51
suites and 40 rooms, with a two- person limit per room.
 &HT;    All food, alcohol and entertainment are included, as are a New
York Harbor cruise with a Swing Band on board and a New Year's Eve
extravaganza with a Motown Band and a Medieval Banquet.
 &HT;    The cost? A cool $1 million. Well, it only happens once a
century.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    New Year's Eve, 1998? Think of it as practice.
 &HT;    Most serious party lovers already have their eyes on the bash of
the century, Dec. 31, 1999. Many of them have already made their
plans, and plenty of hotels have been booked for ages.
 &HT;    But for travelers who haven't decided what to do, here's a
selection of travel-related parties that should make it easy to
welcome in the millennium with a bang. Prices are based on
double-occupancy unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;    The Big Apple looms large for party-goers on the ultimate New
Year's Eve, and the Rhiga Royal Hotel (151 West 54th St., New York,
N.Y. 10019; 800-937-5454) has a deal for couples from Dec. 31 to
Jan. 2, 1999.
 &HT;    Chauffeur-driven limousine transportation brings guests to one
of the hotel's Grand Royal Penthouse suites that overlook Central
Park and the Hudson River.
 &HT;    On New Year's Eve, each couple is brought by limousine to the
Rainbow Room to ring in the millennium with a dinner dance. New
Year's Day starts with breakfast en-suite and continues with a
Broadway show of the couple's choice.
 &HT;    The final day brings brunch and the bill _ just $10,000 per
couple.
 &HT;    Down in the Caribbean, the Bitter End Yacht Club (North Sound,
Virgin Gorda, BVI; 800-872-2392) has cozy hillside and beachfront
villas, a sailing school and a recipe for a party.
 &HT;    The BEYC 2000 Celebration is a 10-day package that includes a
millennium bash with 15 different bands from Virgin Gorda playing a
12-hour session on New Year's Eve. The partying will take place on
shore and on boats, with a fireworks display at midnight.
 &HT;    The package includes accommodations, transfers, all meals,
beverages, use of boats, all entertainment and theme dinners. The
cost is $10,800 per couple, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    Perhaps the tranquility of the English countryside beckons on
this special New Year's? The Lygon Arms (High Street, Broadway,
WR12 7DU, England; 800-63-SAVOY), located in the Cotswolds, has a
three-night package that will mark the millennium as well as its
own 500 year anniversary.
 &HT;    The millennium package at this Savoy Group hotel includes a
helicopter tour of the Cotswolds, a New Year's Eve ball and the
services of both a graphologist and a psychic on New Year's Day to
help everyone peer a little bit farther into the future.
 &HT;    Accommodations and most meals are included in the price, which
is $1,411 per person.
 &HT;    The Broadmoor (Box 1439, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80901;
800-634-7711) which dates from 1918, is one of the grandest hotels
in the West.
 &HT;    This Rocky Mountain treasure will have ``A Celebration of the
Centuries,'' an all-inclusive weekend party that offers activities
ranging from a dinner dance to a New Year's Eve show with
Bernadette Peters and the Temptations.
 &HT;    New Year's Day will feature Bloody Mary ``First Aid Stations.''
Such classic Colorado pleasures as horse-drawn sleigh-and-carriage
rides will be available during the quieter moments. The cost starts
at $2,500 per person.
 &HT;    Both Royal Caribbean International (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami,
Fla. 33132; 800-327-6700) and Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean
Way, Miami, Fla. 33132; 800-437-3111) have announced ambitious
millennium plans for cruisers.
 &HT;    For example, Royal Caribbean's ``Voyager of the Seas,''
``Enchantment of the Seas,'' ``Grandeur of the Seas,'' ``Sovereign
of the Seas'' and Celebrity's ``Century'' will convene at midnight
on New Year's Eve off Coco Cay in the Bahamas for a fireworks
display in the midst of individual millennium itineraries. Contact
a travel agent or cruise-only agent for prices.
 &HT;    The Ritz-Carlton (3414 Peachtree Road N.E., Suite 300, Atlanta
Ga. 30326; 800-241-3333) has the Ultimate Experience. Reserved for
just one couple at each of the Ritz-Carlton hotels, the package
includes three nights in the Ritz Carlton Suite, the premier suite
in each hotel, which includes a private dining room and butler.
 &HT;    Men receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Chronograph while ladies
receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Quadrato.
 &HT;    The two lucky guests also receive a magnum of Taittinger
champagne, two Baccarat flutes, limousine transfers and a Jaguar at
their disposal all weekend. All meals and parties are included.
 &HT;    For example, conductor Peter Duchin will be on hand at the
Ritz-Carlton, Boston, while Lou Rawls will hold court at The
Ritz-Carlton, Naples (Fla.).
 &HT;    The price for the Ultimate Experience is $100,000 per couple.
For those who aren't prepared to part with that kind of change,
there are packages with three-night minimum stays that start at
$450 per room, per night. Contact Ritz-Carlton for a Millennium
Experience brochure.
 &HT;    Finally, for those who absolutely must be together with their
closest friends in New York City on New Year's Eve, the Fitzpatrick
Manhattan Hotel (687 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022;
212-355-0100) is prepared.
 &HT;    This midtown New York hotel with an Irish flavor is offering one
enterprising celebrant and 181 of their closest friends the chance
to take over the entire 17-story hotel for three nights. That's 51
suites and 40 rooms, with a two- person limit per room.
 &HT;    All food, alcohol and entertainment are included, as are a New
York Harbor cruise with a Swing Band on board and a New Year's Eve
extravaganza with a Motown Band and a Medieval Banquet.
 &HT;    The cost? A cool $1 million. Well, it only happens once a
century.

   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While the cost of flying continues to creep up, a few airlines
are trying to lure fliers ages 62 and older to their camps by
making changes to, and improving on, their discount programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fares are available to seniors in some selected markets at half
the cost of tickets bought with the popular senior-discount
coupons. For example, mature travelers could have flown round-trip
between New York and Chicago for as little as $138 under one new
club program, compared with $270 to $298 using senior-discount
coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Senior fliers will save some nice money with these recent
changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Continental becomes the third major airline to set up a
senior-fare discount club.
</P>
<P>
   _ America West has expanded its newly restored ``Senior Saver
Pak'' coupon program to include more destinations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTINENTAL'S CLUB &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the savings from other senior-discount clubs are based on
zone fares, Continental's new ``Freedom Flight Club'' offers fliers
ages 62 and older a savings of 15 percent to 20 percent off the
lowest published fares _ domestic or international.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Continental claims that unlike other airlines, its new
program has no capacity controls and requires no specified days or
times of travel. If any coach seat is available on the flight you
select, you get it.
</P>
<P>
   Club members get 20 percent discounts on weekdays, 15 percent on
weekends, on flights between Continental cities throughout the
United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Continental recently posted a limited-time,
promotional round-trip airfare between New York and Chicago of
$242. With 20 percent off, ``Freedom Flight Club'' members could
get those tickets at $196. In contrast, tickets purchased with
Continental's ``Freedom Trips'' senior-discount coupons would have
cost $270.
</P>
<P>
   A yearly Freedom Flight Club membership costs $75 for domestic
travel, an extra $50 for international travel. So far there is no
enrollment deadline. For more information, call (800) 248-8996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER SENIOR CLUBS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where you live and where you fly most frequently should play a
part in your decision to join a particular senior-discount club.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not live in any cities served by American Airlines,
there would be no savings for you in its ``AActive American Travel
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   That club, like Delta's SkyWise club program, is based on a
complicated series of zone fares that, at worst, offer the same
fares as those available to senior-discount coupon holders and, at
best, offer spectacular savings.
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip flights between New York and Los Angeles cost $298
for both AActive American members and holders of American's
``Senior TrAAveler'' coupons. But a New York-Chicago round trip,
which also costs coupon holders $298, costs AActive American
members only $138 _ more than half off an already discounted
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Both Delta and American clubs require 14-day advance purchase
and overnight stays on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many blackout dates when you may not use club
discounts, and the AActive American club has additional blackouts
for some international zones. Delta's club program is not available
on international flights.
</P>
<P>
   AActive American membership costs $40 a year, and a senior
companion can enroll for an extra $30. Delta's SkyWise club
memberships also cost senior travelers $40 a year, with additional
memberships for companions of any age costing an extra $25.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their clubs, all three airlines _ Continental,
American and Delta _ still tout senior-discount programs they
offered earlier: flat-rate coupons and 10 percent discounts for all
travelers ages 62 and older. Club discounts don't apply to any
other discount plan.
</P>
<P>
   For information on AActive American Travelers Club, call
(800)421-5600; for Delta SkyWise, call (800) 325-3750. (The SkyWise
enrollment period, which was originally scheduled to close Sept.
15, has been extended.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AW EXPANDS PROGRAM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America West Express passengers ages 62 and older and their
accompanying grandchildren may now use America West's newly
re-instated ``Senior Savers Pak'' discount coupons.
</P>
<P>
   The move opens the program to residents of 18 smaller cities in
the West. America West only recently restored the Senior Savers Pak
discount coupons after closing the program for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Coupons cost $548 for a book of four. America West Express
passengers pay an extra $5 per flight. Coupons can also be used by
grandchildren ages 2 to 11 who are flying with a coupon-holder age
62 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Buy coupons from your travel agent or America West, (800)
235-9292.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 49 AND HOLDING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 20, the Holiday Inn Hotel &AMP; Suites Main Gate East
in Orlando, Fla., is offering travelers ages 50 and older a ``49
and Holding'' package for $49/night. You get: free continental
breakfasts, free children's activities for the grandkids in the
Camp Holiday program, a coffee mug, and a collector's Mason jar
touting the hotel's 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   If you are traveling with grandkids between the ages of 3 and
12, they stay and eat free, and Holiday Inn will outfit you with a
free pager when you go off the premises. For more information, call
(800) 366-5437.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WARBIRDS ON DISPLAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Warbirds at Tom Reilly's Flying Tigers Warbird Restoration
Museum'' (what a name!) at 231 N. Hoagland Blvd., in Kissimmee,
Fla., features a cross-section of this century's aviation history:
B-25s, Corsairs and F104 Starfighters.
</P>
<P>
   Museum guests are encouraged to look, see and touch these
aircraft, and once a month a ride is given in the B-25 Mitchell
bomber to a lucky museum visitor. Special events are matched with
dates like Pearl Harbor and Veterans' days.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers pay $6 admission, $2 off the regular rate.
Warbird rides are extra and start at about $140. For more
information, call (407) 933-1942.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENGLAND'S WAR MUSEUM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading to England, go to Duxford to see the Imperial
War Museum. Admission for mature travelers is a little over 4
pounds compared to 7 pounds for other adults. The museum has
regular air shows, so call 01223-835000 to see what's scheduled.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ten thousand dead. Ten thousand dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch's toll in Central America is so mind-numbing you
shut it out as instinctively as you shield yourself from the midday
glare. How do you put your arms around a number like that? Do you
picture one out of 10 people walking around Dayton? The student
body of your college? The audience at your last Nutter concert?
</P>
<P>
   We find it easier to grasp a much smaller number:
</P>
<P>
   One.
</P>
<P>
   It was the story of Isabel Arriola de Guity that finally forced
me to look at the tragedy. The 36-year-old Honduran schoolteacher
survived for six days in the Caribbean Sea, clinging to floating
palm branches for the first four hours before fashioning a raft
from debris.
</P>
<P>
   Arriola's 4-year-old son was ripped from her arms as the water
carried her toward the sea. Before her eyes, the river swept away
her husband and two other children, ages 8 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   She had lost everything _ no, far worse, she had lost everyone.
Yet she clung to life, ferociously, her will to live as much a
miracle as her survival. On the sixth day, she pleaded with a duck
near her raft: ``Little duck, send a message that I'm alive. Take
me to my people. Take me to the shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Arriola's tragedy _ a family of five destroyed _ and
multiply it by 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   We can't imagine it. We don't want to imagine it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thousands in the Miami Valley are forcing themselves to
imagine it, to put themselves in the place of the millions more
displaced by the hurricane, the thousands still fighting for their
lives. At the Dayton area chapter of the American Red Cross, ``the
phone has been ringing off the hook since Monday,'' said chief
development officer Kent Anderson. Because of the massive damage,
the Dayton chapter has raised its goal from $25,000 to $75,000 _
part of the $6 million the American Red Cross hopes to raise as
part of an international relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   At West Carrollton High School this week, Kathryn Juenger's
Spanish students are competing to see which class can raise the
most money. The students came up with the idea after discussing the
disaster in class Friday. ``If you guys want to do it, do it,''
Juenger told them. ``I'm just the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day alone, they raised $417. At the end of each class
period this week, if they've finished their homework, they're
permitted to leave the classroom to solicit donations from
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   One student donated his lunch money for the week. Another turned
over his paycheck. Another is bringing her donation cup to her job
after school.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, these students woke up worrying about whether their
clothes looked right; now, they are seeing the contrast with
``these children who are waking up orphaned,'' Juenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Explained freshman Eric Jaynes, ``Some of the students are
starting to realize what it would feel like if we lived down there
and it happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand dead. Ten thousand dead.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to follow the lead of the students, send a check
payable to the American Red Cross, P.O. Box 517, Dayton 45401-0517.
Specify Central American relief on the check.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Isabel Arriola, and what she faces in the days and
years after her dramatic rescue. Her will to live triumphed against
tremendous odds; now she must wonder why. ``I have nothing,'' she
said. ``I lost it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers on the HMS Sheffield, the British warship that rescued
Arriola, described her as ``an incredibly resilient lady with a
strong desire to live.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd say that's an understatement.

 &HT;    Dayton footballers currently living in their own interesting
times
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The seasons used to be mostly like gym class. For
the University of Dayton football team, just to show up breathing
was enough.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, for example, after nine games, the Flyers were 9-0 with
the scoring at 305-40; in 1984, it was 9-0 and 294-75; 1991, it was
9-0 and 278-66; two years ago, it was 9-0 and 333-138.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Flyers are 5-4 and the point differential is
244-235.
</P>
<P>
   To the philospher who said, ``May you live in interesting
times,'' UD coach Mike Kelly says, ``It's killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has lost 18 pounds this season as week after week, games are
decided on the final snap.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of UD's nine games have been decided in the fourth
quarter; six of them still at risk to the last tick. Said Kelly,
``We're three plays from 8-1 or three plays from 1-8.''
</P>
<P>
   They lost a game on a fumble at the goal line; lost another when
a shoe came off, followed by a fumble inside the opponent's 10;
lost another on an interception on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you wake up screaming in the middle of the night?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' he said, ``because I never go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have pain in your stomach?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``My stomach is so calloused, I feel
no pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 43-42 victory over Towson was the capper, a
time-vault game. Up 27-0 at halftime, Kelly saw his team laughing
and joking on the way to the locker room. ``I threw a tantrum,'' he
said. ``I went nuts. I told them, 'You guys have no clue.' ``
</P>
<P>
   They didn't believe him. In the second half, the Flyers started
dropping the ball and falling down, and suddenly they were behind
42-34 with a minute-28 left.
</P>
<P>
   When UD scored a TD but didn't make the deuce with 0:28 left,
Kelly stood immobile on the sideline, contemplating, ``the darkest
day of my career,'' and trying to figure out what he was going to
say to his team afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't recovered an on-side kick in the 20 years I've been
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They got one Saturday. Magically, mystically, in a season where
so many things have gone wrong at games' ends, suddenly, a gift.
They moved to the Towson 24 and lined up for a 41-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago in practice, kicker Mike Pulsfort had been so
bad that after practice Kelly gathered the entire team at midfield
and told Pulsfort nobody was leaving until he kicked five in a row
from 35 yards. ``I would have kept them there till midnight,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Pulsfort missed the first one, he drilled five in a
row. ``I think that's the day he got his confidence back,'' the
coach said.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was Saturday, lining up a 41-yarder, and Kelly
caught Pulsfort's eye during the obligatory Towson ``ice him''
timeout. ``I shouted to him, 'Keep your head down and swing
through,' and tried to smile,'' Kelly said. ``He smiled back at me
and winked, and I thought, 'Oh, Lord, he's totally lost it.' ``
</P>
<P>
   He lost it through the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woulda gone 50,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you glad you've had the chance to experience this after
all those years of walkovers?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad? Heck, no,'' Kelly said. ``But the fans have to be
enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the excitement, the challenge, the coaching-on-the-brink?
Isn't that better than the 50-0?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer someplace in between,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And 10 years from now, or whenever you retire, which will you
remember best?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, no question,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Because for UD football, these are definitely interesting times.

 &HT;    Small businesses bank on the Internet
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Heroes and Legacies hopes that Internet commerce
is more than just blowing smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Like many small businesses, the Austin-based cigar seller has
launched a World Wide Web site in hopes of generating sales over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which markets several hundred cigars and tobacco
products from 11 countries, has been generating only about a
half-dozen orders a week from the Web site. But manager Juan
Barajas is enthused about its chances for much higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to make money, but we're not there yet,''
Barajas says.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and Legacies is interested in tapping the 67 million
potential customers using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Fornoff, vice president of corporate marketing
of IntelliQuest Inc., an Austin-based computer industry marketing
research company, the number of people on the Web is expected to
continue to grow, reaching 110 million users in another two years.
</P>
<P>
   Fornoff says while there are lots of folks on the Internet,
there are far fewer buying products online _ only 13 million, or 20
percent. Those buying are now spending an average of $100 a month,
but that will more than double in three years, predicts Fornoff,
the keynote speaker at the first Electronic Commerce Seminar.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big attractions of the Net is the quick exposure to
millions of potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   A small company with limited capital can reach out to a much
broader audience than it usually could afford.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site not only offers the opportunity to attract new
customers, but it also provides a way for established businesses to
protect their established customer base, Fornoff says. He says
small-business owners also must consider what will happen if their
customers become comfortable buying online and their company
doesn't have a site.
</P>
<P>
   Much like when an interstate goes into a small town and traffic
changes, he says, businesses must weigh what happens if their
customers start going to another company that's online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you open up a new 'store' and protect your business?'' he
says. ``Whether you open a store or not, a competitor will open one
on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Fornoff says small companies considering the expense of building
and maintaining a Web site need to give the same commitment to it
as they would if they were building another store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cost may be dramatically less than opening a
bricks and mortar store. But the same commitment has to be there or
greater,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Betsy Vaught, executive producer of interactive services with
SicolaMartin Inc., an Austin marketing and advertising company,
says a company must give their Web site visibility by putting it in
their other advertising and on all company materials _ on voice
mail, business cards, direct mail flyers and sales receipts.
</P>
<P>
   She says it is also important that the company update the Web
site and keep it stocked with useful information so Net surfers
will continue to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a business card or flyer from somebody that says
visit our Web site, and I go there and there is nothing of any
value, you have wasted my time,'' she says. Put some more
information about your company, industry news or tips that can be
helpful to a customer, Vaught suggests.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's being used for direct sales, make sure every Web
page has a chance to order.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of pitfalls to electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys is that whatever service or product a company is
offering must match the profile of the current Web customer _
someone with higher disposable income that owns a computer with Web
access, Vaught says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other medium in that regard. You need to target
the message and target the medium. If you're selling products that
have a lower-income appeal or need, it may not be a good match
because the world is not wired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites drawing the most traffic and sales are offering
products that are easily understood and don't require ``user
experience,'' such as books and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Vaught says that Heroes and Legacies offers products that match
the demographic mix of current buyers _ young, upper income and
mostly male.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and Legacies initially spent $10,000 to create the site
(http://heroesandlegacies.com/) and is now ready to invest another
$60,000 to improve its visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Barajas says his marketing plan includes buying more access
points on the major cigar Web sites that cater to cigar and tobacco
fans.
</P>
<P>
   A listing on one of the major cigar Web pages costs $1,200 a
year for a one-line home-page listing, plus $95 for each additional
category. He also plans to buy flashing banner ads to advertise
cigar specials.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and Legacies, which has a retail store at the Arboretum
shopping center in Northwest Austin, primarily sells cigars
wholesale to liquor stores, bars and restaurants in a dozen states.
But Barajas says the Net offers the company a chance to expand
direct sales to customers far beyond what its local retail store.
</P>
<P>
   In the store, he says the average customer will spend $10 to $20
a visit, while the average Net sale is typically twice that high
because online customers are more often buying in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put $60,000 into Austin alone (to advertise and generate
sales from the one local store) you get Austin customers alone,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put $60,000 into the Internet, you pretty much get the
world.''

 &HT;    This calculus series as good a way as any
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a small problem with the newly minted Bowl Championship
Series. Perhaps you've noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the plan is not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither would a playoff system, everybody's panacea,
be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Stock an imaginary post-season tournament at this moment, for
instance, with eight teams and there's a choice between leaving out
unbeaten Wisconsin or once-beaten Ohio State. The Buckeyes had been
No. 1 in the AP poll since August, remember, and likely would be
favored to handle the Badgers pretty easily if they played each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but wait, you say. All that stuff would work itself out by
the end of the season. Probably so, but why then is everybody so
eager to assume that the same thing won't happen with the BCS
formula? A month of games remain to be played, so much new
information that all this preliminary computer data may be headed
for the shredder.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, top seed in the BCS, may have to stop unbeaten
Arkansas twice, including the SEC title game. Kansas State has got
Nebraska and Missouri yet to tackle and probably a Big 12 title
game against Texas A&AMP;M, No. 6 on the reconfigured BCS board. And
then there's UCLA, which looks to be running about a quartile low
after consecutive cliffhangers.
</P>
<P>
   What's really rich about all this sniping over the BCS program
is that it proves what can happen when you try to give people what
they want.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of seeing teams with weak nonconference schedules
rewarded? There's a strength-of-schedule component in there now,
hopefully encouraging athletic directors to tear up a few of those
contracts with Northwest Rose Petal State.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wish there were a way to reconcile the differences between
the media poll and the coaches' rankings? That's covered in the
BCS, too, with a simple process of averaging each contender's
standing in the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   What about the classic argument that nothing should matter
except a team's final record, regardless of where or when a loss
should come? The BCS boys are all over that one, too, slapping on a
quick and dirty penalty point for each and every defeat with no
questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with teams running up the score in order to impress
pollsters? Sorry, that's the only thing the BCS doesn't endeavor to
fix, but from my viewpoint it's not a big deal. If a game is 60
minutes long, there's nothing wrong with letting them play it for
the full 60 minutes. There aren't any other major sports that
wrestle with this moral dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   To sum up all we've covered so far, the old system of polls and
backroom politics stunk, the elongated playoff system all you
dreamers crave will never be accepted by university presidents, and
the BCS is the best thing anyone's ever come up with to bring
precise shadings to the kaleidoscope of college football. All this
quibbling over the mysterious origin of a few lousy decimal points
seems kind of silly as long as the Big Ten is okay to operate with
11 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nobody understands the mathematical processes behind
the RPI rating system used in the selection and the seeding of the
NCAA basketball tournament but we have come to accept its findings
without rancor. The BCS will either reach that level of acceptance
over time or it will be improved upon little by little, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be necessary to point out, on top of all of this,
that the Rose Bowl never got on board until the BCS was built. Yet
another reason to embrace the computer, with all its adjusted
deviations, and lean not unto our own understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Any plan that's saved up even a sliver of national championship
implications for the FSU-Florida game can't be all bad.

 &HT;    Silicon Valley tech museum is living laboratory
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Tech Museum, the new $96 million
interactive monument to Silicon Valley, doesn't feel like a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a hands-on classroom that informs and
entertains and inspires,'' says Regis McKenna, a leading Silicon
Valley consultant and an early board member of the Tech Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of debate in the beginning about whether it
should even be called a museum. The Tech isn't about yesterday,
it's about tomorrow,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   The 132,000-square-foot museum in downtown San Jose is less a
record of what Silicon Valley has achieved _ including inventing
the many of the technologies that are part of everyday life
(microprocessor, semiconductor and the personal computer) and
putting them just about everywhere in the world _ than a living
laboratory where mind-bending exhibits illustrate how today's
technology works and where it's headed.
</P>
<P>
   You can don a bunnysuit and build a microchip in a
mini-cleanroom, take an ultrasound picture of your hand, and design
and ride in your own virtual roller-coaster simulator.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which opened Oct. 31, plays several roles in Silicon
Valley: It shows off the technology developed in the Valley, it
provides a sense of place amidst the sprawl of glass and concrete
office buildings and it shows that tech companies _ which
cooperated to create the museum _ really can work together.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to take the mystery out of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who thought 'Oh, that's over my head' to walk
away saying 'Now I get it,''' says Peter Giles, chief executive of
The Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, museum designers kept it as simple as possible.
Text descriptions are kept to fewer than 40 words so that visitors
spend little time reading.
</P>
<P>
   The feel of the place is young and hip _ walls are curved and
painted with blinding hot pinks, purples and yellows. Neon strips
zig-zag like lightning across high ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are kept to a minimum because of their intimidation
factor. In fact, exhibits explaining how computers work were
postponed because museum organizers couldn't figure out how to
explain binary mathematics in a way that was open and easy to
understand. (The plan is to add exhibits showing the inner workings
of computers in the next two years.)
</P>
<P>
   The galleries hands-on experiments are the heart and soul of the
Tech, which is divided into four galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Innovation gallery focuses on cutting-edge inventions and
innovators who helped the area earn its high-tech reputation
</P>
<P>
   Here you can create a laser-scanned 3-D image of your head, or
watch as grains of sand are transformed into silicon wafers. A
electron microscope lets you test a batch of real microchips.
</P>
<P>
   The Life Tech gallery looks at new ways to save lives and
enhance human performance. An ultrasound machine lets you see the
inside of your hand, and you can take a virtual tour of the human
body via an image database of a human body sliced in quarter-inch
sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Exploration gallery takes visitors to the surface of Mars,
the bottom of the ocean and back to the 1906 San Francisco
earthquake; and the Communication gallery explores how technology
helps humans create, harness and share information.
</P>
<P>
   Before building the 200 interactive exhibits, creators
interviewed area non-techies about what they already knew, what
they wanted to learn and how that could be achieved. Before
roll-out, people of all ages and backgrounds tested the interactive
controls, games and activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech also includes a 12,000-square-foot IMAX theater and a
learning center named after Robert N. Noyce, the late co-founder of
Intel Corp. and the first chief executive of Sematech Corp. in
Austin. The center will offer science and math activities for
teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take the very coolest stuff in high-tech and make
it accessible,'' says Wayne LaBar, who oversees exhibit creation.
</P>
<P>
   The concept works, visitors say.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, nine9-year-old Vincent Woo is hanging out at
an electronic cafe, where tables are embedded with laptop computers
that let you create a personal avatar, or cartoon identity. The
avatar travels through a 3-D graphical environment to chat with
characters created by other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the coolest place I've been,'' says Woo, whose named
his avatar Bubba. ``A lot of kids still don't have computers, so
this is a way for them to learn how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Helen Woo, a systems analyst at Chevron, says that
even though many families have PCs, the Tech goes far beyond what a
desktop computer can do. ``We have your basic PC in the den, but
what you can do on it is pretty limited,'' she says. ``Here kids
can be an astronauts on Mars or doctors doing genetic testing. It
opens up a lot of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a place The Tech, its organizers hope, will provide an
anchor to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's engineers work inside glass and steel buildings
full of floors of cubicles. There's little to tour, short of
sneaking into Netscape or Sun Microsystems. And even then,
computers and cubicles are about all you'd see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is intrigued by Silicon Valley, and they want to
explore it. But the problem is, there's nothere there,'' Leonard
Hoops of the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau says,
borrowing Virginia Woolf's remark about Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you go when you get here?'' asks the man who's in the
business of selling San Jose as a destination for business
travellers and tourists. ``You can't just show up to Intel or Apple
and knock on the door. There's really nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech is changing that. When it opened last weekmonth, the
eye-walloping electric mango and blue domed building became an
instant downtown landmark. Now the hope is that the Tech, as it's
called, will give some definition to the region that has spawned an
ongoing technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a fascination with technology and those who create it,
science centers and technology museums are flourishing. More than
400 science museums exist in 43 countries, according to the
Washington, D.C.-based Association of Science-Technology Centers.
Last year they attracted more than 40 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose has long regarded itself the capital of Silicon Valley,
which, loosely defined, is a collection of towns arrayed along the
west side of San Francisco Bay south of San Francisco. They include
San Jose, Cupertino, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
Sunnyvale and Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the area was best known for its orchards, and
San Jose boasted of being the prune capital of the world. Over the
past few decades, fruit trees have since given way to Apple, Intel,
Sun, AMD, Hewlett-Packard, Netscape and other high-tech companies,
and Silicon Valley has become known as the world's high-tech
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the museum had been bouncing around the Valley for
more than 20 years, with much of the time devoted to deciding on a
site (San Jose, of course) and raising money.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech is also an example of how high-tech companies that
compete fiercely for products, patents and personnel can come
together to create a cultural institution. All in all, the Tech
raised $30 million in private contributions and another $25 million
in in-kind gifts of equipment. It also received $40 million in city
redevelopment funds. Its board is made up of executives from
companies including Hewlett-Packard Co., the Kleiner Perkins
Caulfield &AMP; Beyers venture capital firm, Applied Materials and
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose boosters are hoping the Tech is the draw it needs to
attract out-of-towners. Other than business, there has never been
much reason for visitors to go downtown. Even business travelers
tend to skip out as soon as their work is done.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges in turning that around has been
that the city has lacked an easily marketable identity. The Tech,
designed by reknowned Mexico City architect Ricardo Legorreta, who
designed the eye-popping enchilada-red San Antonio library, could
be San Jose's solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tech is one more sign that San Jose has arrived,'' says
Kim Polese, chief executive of hot Silicon Valley startup Marimba,
who attended opening festivities. ``It's more proof that San Jose
is a serious city that knows how to have fun.''

   MCCOY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Ten thousand dead. Ten thousand
dead. Hurricane Mitch's toll in Central America is so mind-numbing
you shut it out as instinctively as you shield yourself from the
midday glare. How do you put your arms around a number like that?
Do you picture one out of 10 people walking around Dayton? The
student body of your college? The audience at your last Nutter
concert? We find it easier to grasp a much smaller number: One. It
was the story of Isabel Arriola de Guity that finally forced me to
look at the tragedy. (McCoy, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN _ The Christian Right is sometimes slammed for
using houses of worship for partisan campaigning, while little is
said about traditional Democratic treks to black churches,
especially in the South. Either way, it's not the church's role.
(Ezzard, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Cue violins. The Don paced the
floor, taking care not to pace too close to windows that would
expose his wideness to machine-gun fire. How had it come to this?
Minutes earlier he had been met by his chief deputy, whose face had
assumed the color and consistency of alfredo sauce. ``Don Gingrino,
the situation is critical.'' And so it was for Newto (The Hack)
Gingrino, embattled underworld prince. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald)

   WACO, Texas _ Cue violins.
</P>
<P>
   The Don paced the floor, taking care not to pace too close to
windows that would expose his wideness to machine-gun fire. How had
it come to this?
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier he had been met by his chief deputy, whose face
had assumed the color and consistency of alfredo sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Gingrino, the situation is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was for Newto (The Hack) Gingrino, embattled
underworld prince.
</P>
<P>
   The bad-news bearer was Dickie (The Book) Armey. He had been
sounding out the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion is that you step down as syndicate boss or that
you will be 'escorted' out.'' The Book gestured toward the window
that looked out onto an empire the Don had presumed to be his.
</P>
<P>
   How was this happening?
</P>
<P>
   It had only been a few days since the Gingrino family was poised
for its greatest coup: hearings for Willie (The Slick) Clinton,
head of the Clintonostra clan, on _ of all things _ a morals
charge.
</P>
<P>
   How sweet it was. The Don's mind flashed back to the heady days
of October . . .
</P>
<P>
   At Gingrino strategy sessions the laughter had rippled with the
vino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's to the Slick; what a chump,'' they had toasted. ``To be
caught with a broad. It's undignified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat our broads with respect,'' said a deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a respectable syndicate,'' Gingrino had said. ``We deal
in soft money, patronage, paybacks from our polluting friends. And
to our friends in the vice industries, we are ever true.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they convened over linguini and marinara, fine smokes
were passed out courtesy of those who bankrolled so much of what
kept the Gingrinos in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' inhaled the Don, ``there's nothing like a smoke-filled
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Running a syndicate came down to two simple rules: (1)
perpetuate your power; (2) have a good time doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the top had been heady for the Don. As a henchman
skilled at breaking opponents' kneecaps, he'd caught the attention
of the Reaganzano family.
</P>
<P>
   The Reaganzanos were one of the most powerful syndicates of the
century. In 1980 they had avenged the removal of Dick (The Trick)
Nixono, patriarch of the Nixono family. Reaganzano lieutenant
Gorgio Bush had four years at the helm. He is known to have raised
two ambitious sons.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other side, there had been the hated Kennedino clan,
headed by Teddy (The Tippler) Kennedino, and the short-lived reign
of Jimmy (The Prude) Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the '80s and into the '90s, the Reaganzanos ruled.
But in 1992 The Slick staged his takeover. He, too, knew how to
play the soft-money game. He, too, knew how to seize and hold power
and shower patrons with attention. Indeed, he was beating the
Gingrinos, the Reaganzanos, at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the scandal that, Gingrino assured, meant it was
all over for the The Slick: A woman. Imagine that? How unseemly.
How undignified. And she wasn't even a starlet. She was just a
nobody with a hall pass.
</P>
<P>
   For months the Gingrinos seized on the scandal. They demanded
``the truth.'' They issued long pronouncements about morality and
uprightness. Yet, came the ides of November and The Slick was
stronger than ever. Now, unbelieveably, it was the Don facing
removal.
</P>
<P>
   What had gone wrong? Had it been that the Don had otherwise
neglected his empire as he zeroed in on The Slick? Had the Don
forgotten his friends and patrons, his responsibilities to the
family?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, he was stepping down, retiring to his
Georgia vineyard while others offered themselves as upright, moral
and trustworthy to carry on the business of the syndicate. Cue
violins.

   Japan's Machiko Sekido, 46, a divorced mother and manager of a
Tokyo art gallery: ``In the bubble era,' people bought whomever was
the popular artist. They would pay a billion Yen and not think
about it. But compared to then, the number who buy is declining.
People don't need art.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Lee Du-Ho, 27, a caretaker in Seoul's Sosomun
Park, where 150-200 homeless have been living in tents: ``It's very
hard to see these people outside living so badly. I'm trying to
tighten my own belt because my salary has been cut, but this makes
me realize I have to save money so I won't ever live like this.''

   Malaysia's Liza Dhatta, 24, an office-worker in Kuala Lumpur who
has taken a 10-percent pay cut and been downgraded to a less
interesting job: ``This recession is interfering with people's
ability to get married. It costs too much money to have a family.''

   Indonesia's Ahmad, 15, a ninth-grade student in the Tangerang
region, who says he's afraid his parents may be forced to pull him
out of school to save $1 a month in school fees:
</P>
<P>
   ``My father lost his job driving a pedicycle taxi. My mother
tries to make up by selling traditional medicines, but it's hard.
The last time we had meat was nine months ago, at the time of a
Muslim festival.''
</P>
<P>
   China's Li Yong, 25, a recent college graduate looking for a job
in Beijing: ``Our economy is a little more chaotic than we are
accustomed to. The rate of unemployment has risen. For me, it means
that the authorities did not assign me to a work unit after my
graduation. Even so, I'm sure there will be a position, if I try
hard enough.''

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Shellshocked by an Asian financial
crisis that seems to have no end, Asians are in a sour mood as they
await this week's visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The near future for Asia looks as bad as this year. Maybe worse.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the potential locomotive of Asian economic recovery, is
stranded in its worst post-World War II recession and keeps
slashing imports from the rest of Asia. Now, even China's
long-vibrant economy seems on the verge of stagnating.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who will host Clinton
and 20 other Pacific Rim leaders at an economic summit here, has
vilified Western institutions in caustic language seldom heard from
a world leader since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the Asian crisis on ``Western capitalist greed'' and
financial bungling by the American-backed International Monetary
Fund, Mahathir accused the West of ``a desire to dominate the
Asians and stop them from developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other participants in the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) will be more polite-tongued than
the crusty Mahathir. But Clinton is likely to find other leaders
just as obstinate, especially on ticklish trade issues like Japan's
renewed efforts to shield markets against American exports.

   ``It is inexcusable for the second-largest economy in the world
and the largest economy in Asia not to fulfill its
responsibilities,'' complained U.S. Deputy Trade Representative
Richard W. Fisher this month, after Japan informed Washington it
couldn't keep its promises from an earlier APEC summit to cut
Japanese tariffs on forest products and fish.

<P>
   As Clinton will find in his week-long trip to Malaysia, Japan

   Tens of millions from Indonesia to South Korea are confronting
another year of unemployment and economic shrinkage -- still
without a safety net. A Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. study projects that
per-capita income will decline next year in India, Hong Kong, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Asia has been hit with a ``financial typhoon'' that left behind
a trail of devastation ``far greater than anyone imagined,'' said
Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong this month. Goh added that
while there are some signs the storm's force has lessened, he sees
a 20 percent chance that Asia will suffer a ``second typhoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can avoid a depression, but I think the credit
crunch will continue,'' ventured think-tank economist Susumu
Takahashi in Japan, where consumer spending has just fallen for the
11th month in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, where homeless executives can be found sleeping
in Seoul public parks, social worker Park Eun-Kyung of World Vision
Korea said she hopes the economy will hit bottom next year.
``People say this is the worst disaster since World War II,'' she
said.

   BEIJING _ The stalls at Beijing's ``Russian market'' are bulging
with bright down jackets, fur coats, ski pants, wool sweaters,
hats, muffs and gloves to warm up winter in the Russian icebox.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking are Russian buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are down more than 90 percent,'' said Zheng Jiaodi, a
Chinese entrepreneur catering to Russian clients who until this
summer used to take containers full of goods back to Russia for
retail sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started getting bad when the Russian money began to
depreciate,'' said Zheng, who is shocked at the sudden collapse of
one of Beijing's most bustling, lucrative specialty markets.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng, 33, has more at stake than just the women's coats and
jackets hung ceiling-to-floor in her cubicle of a shop. She rents
an entire building and sublets space to 17 other wholesalers also
dependent on the Russian trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this period, the income won't even cover the rent. There's
no way out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sales slump in the warren of stores and open-air stalls
densely packing this market is one symptom of how the Asian
economic contagion has spread. And it raises questions of whether
China still may catch the malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's wide-ranging economic problems produced a meltdown in
August -- the sudden devaluation of the ruble and a moratorium on
foreign credit repayments. In a world economic atmosphere already
burdened by the Asian crisis, the International Monetary Fund and
big industrial countries couldn't stop the Russian crash. Jittery
foreign investors stampeded not only to exit Russia, but to get out
of emerging markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's fall has landed one more punch to China's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in Russian purchases comes on top of declining demand
from the Asian countries in economic distress for more than a year.
At the same time, currency devaluations in Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea have made China's products less competitive in markets
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, these factors pulled down China's exports in
September by 6.7 percent compared to the previous year. In July and
August, before Russia's crisis boiled over, China's export drop had
been 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chinese exports grew 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hit by falling exports, China has seen its 10 percent-a-year
magic growth over the last two decades decelerate to a
comparatively sluggish 4-7 percent in 1998. To prevent sliding into
a Japanese-style recession, China has resorted to massive state
spending on infrastructure projects and has backed off attempts to
reform China's old, inefficient industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial unknown is whether China will be forced to devalue
its currency in an attempt to revive exports. China has vowed
dozens of times not to devalue. But if its exports to Russia and
Asia keep slumping, it might have to reconsider -- a move that
could ignite a fire sale of competitive devaluations throughout
Asia and delay the region's recovery for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Russian buyers doesn't cause trouble merely for
the sellers in this one corner of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Li Shu Yi peddled a variety of goods including traditional
Russian black fur hats at her open-air stall one recent afternoon.
Her Chinese-produced knock-offs were so good they even had a
Russian-language label saying ``made in Novosibirsk,'' a major city
in Siberia. But she wasn't selling much.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Russian customers) used to order goods worth a million
renminbi (nearly US$125,000) at a time, but no more,'' Li sighed.
``The manufacturers of the hats have many goods stored in their
factory that they can't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the hat factory outside Beijing, Chinese factories that
would be pumping out coats and sweaters for the Russian market have
a hard time keeping workers busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to bring big problems to China,'' she
said. ``Sure I worry. This should be the hot season, but it's very
bad.''

 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Kiara Payung is about 50
miles west-northwest of Jakarta.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIARA PAYUNG, Indonesia _ Hundreds of thousands of children in
once-prosperous villages like this are dropping out of school and
going hungry as Indonesia lurches into a Great Leap Backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to school any more,'' says Supendi, a skinny
13-year-old boy with festering sores on his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Until six months ago, he attended the local public school that
required a fee of 3,000 rupiahs (US$.40 cents) a month. ``My mother
doesn't have enough money to pay the fee,'' says Supendi, who like
many Indonesians uses a single name.
</P>
<P>
   So the boy lounges away the muggy midday heat by crouching on a
tin-roofed porch and listening to the barefoot men talk about ``the
old days'' just one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when ordinary people could afford to eat lamb or chicken
at least three times a week, recounts one of the story-tellers. His
name is Mista, and he is a 23-year-old laid-off factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   Mista lost his $25-a-week job in a chocolate factory six months
ago. He says he doesn't blame the factory for firing him, nor does
he expect to get hired back. ``The company had to buy materials
from abroad, and it got too expensive,'' Mista says.
</P>
<P>
   It's only been a year since this fast-growing, seemingly stable
nation of 212 million people was dragged down by the riptide of the
Asian economic crisis. In that time, the world's fourth-most
populous country has seen its economy shrink by about 55 percent,
inflation shoot up to 80 percent a year and its banking system go
into virtual paralysis where no loans are made or collected.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is the country worst hit by the Asian economic crisis.
Its suffering will cast a long shadow over the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum this week, as Indonesia and the region's
other leaders press for measures to make sure that their people
never endure a similar descent into hardship.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank specialist Richard Newfarmer estimates that school
enrollment throughout Indonesia has already dropped from 78 to 54
percent, as parents like Supendi's find even the nominal school
fees too high to bear.
</P>
<P>
   In two years the number of Indonesians living below the poverty
line has shot up from 20 million people to an estimated 100
million, dragging Indonesia down to a level of impoverishment not
known here since it was an underdeveloped backwater in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mista says he, his wife and two-year-old daughter haven't eaten
meat in three months. Today they eat rice from the market and
fruits that they can find growing wild, like jackfruit. ``That's
the cheapest, at least it's filling.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kiara Payung (population 10,400), children don't suffer the
distended bellies and spindly limbs that have marked the
near-starvation of refugee camps in Sudan or Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   But Tintin, the village pregnancy nurse, has just reported to
the district health office that in August she came across 12 cases
of malnutrition among children she treated who were under five
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleague Suharto(CQ), a district civil servant in charge of
welfare, estimates that unemployment in Kiara Payung has risen from
40 percent to at least 75 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The district health office says that another 35 malnutrition
cases were reported in four nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the deprivation of the Asian crisis looks less
acute in the capital Jakarta -- even in neighborhoods that were
torn apart by last May's anti-Chinese riots that burned scores of
Chinese-owned shopping plazas and killed nearly 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   F. M. Mendrofa, who has reopened his furniture store in the
burned-out Ciledug Plaza riot corridor, complains that banks won't
loan money, prices of materials have skyrocketed, and ``everything
is unstable.'' Somehow, says Mendrofa, he manages to sell about two
mattresses every day.
</P>
<P>
   For the poorest city-dwellers, the only way to avoid hunger has
been to resort to ``informal'' occupations that most Indonesians
consider degrading, like singing for a few rupiahs beside cars at
stoplights. Or hunting for metal and plastic bags at the Jakarta
municipal dump. Somehow, they are surviving.

 &HT;    JAPAN: RECOVERY SLOWED BY FEAR OF SHOPPING, DREAD OF FIRING
 &HT;    With ASIA-SUMMIT-$ADV15; Photos placed in the International
folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Nov. 15 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The personnel director of a major Japanese construction
company started his fourth whiskey-on-the-rocks, as he explained
his own gloomy role in the recession that stubbornly blocks Asia's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is to do the firing. If I don't do it, I will be
fired,'' said Tomihei Sudou, who was unwinding with three
colleagues at a shopping complex restaurant after a recent Saturday
of work.
</P>
<P>
   In 18 years he has fired ``not even 10 people'' at his
Tokyo-based firm, which has a payroll of 15,000 workers. In the
next three years, he must get rid of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some will quit or retire on schedule. But many, many more Sudou
will have to sweet-talk, cajole or coerce into leaving, defying the
once inviolable Japanese jobs-for-life tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is an essential reason for Japan's persisting recession --
fear over who next will be squeezed out of the nation's weakened
industries, fall victim to the highest surge of bankruptcies since
World War II, or see wages or annual bonuses trimmed further.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Japanese start spending again, returning confidence to
their own corporations and recreating vital markets for neighboring
countries, Asia will be unable to heave itself up and out of the
regional economic crisis now deep into its second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the health of Asia's economy -- and indeed the world --
depends on Japan,'' President Bill Clinton recently said, urging
the Japanese to move faster to rekindle the world's second largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 18 months of recession, Japan finally adopted
crucial bank reform legislation last month. Making $361 billion
available to debt-ridden banks, its goal is to get banks lending,
this time with some supervision. Only time will tell whether it is
enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to what the Japanese government was like before, we
actually did pretty well,'' legislative leader Okiharu Yasuoka said
in countering the critics. Yasuoka, who steered the bank bill
through parliament, said that further plans include massive tax
cuts, mortgage rate reductions and public spending that would
target nontraditional areas such as information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the government starting this, it should create a rhythm on
the consumer side and begin the spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding consumer rhythm beyond a sluggish waltz will not be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wonder whether the banks will do better with the new
government money, after losing hundreds of billions in unpaid
loans, and question whether public spending will be wasted away.
Confidence in government continues to slide, with 56 percent of
Japanese polled last month giving the ruling politicians a negative
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Few Japanese are going hungry or homeless, but many have seen
living standards drop more than in any economic downturn since
World War II. Others are too anxious to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Takashimaya Co. Ltd., retailer to royalty and regular Japanese
since opening in 1831, had to cut 2,800 personnel over the past
three years. It staffed a long-planned new department store by
moving 550 workers from other sites and using 500 temporary
workers, said spokesman Tetsuo Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   Retail woes began in earnest when the government raised Japan's
consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales declined dramatically. After that in Japan, we had more
and more bad news,'' Yamaguchi said. In the first half of October,
sales dipped 10 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, intense shoppers crowd store aisles throughout Tokyo.
But Yamaguchi said they buy small and less. The furniture
department at one of his stores, for example, was literally empty
of customers on a recent Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Tokyo restaurant, located near the new Takashimaya
store, construction executive Sudou and his three buddies
exemplified the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One friend wanted to buy a car, but felt he couldn't. Another
said Japanese have stopped taking out loans for big purchases or
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Their salaries haven't much changed, they said, but the bonuses
that differentiate employees have. Sudou said his was down about 25
percent, or about $9,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That cuts into discretionary spending that once buoyed Japan's
economy and the economies of regional neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some good things have come out of this,'' Sudou said. ``Now we
have discount stores.''

 &HT;    SOUTH KOREA: LOSING A MIDDLE CLASS TO THE IMF

<P>
   SEOUL _ Koreans groping through the deep waters of economic
collapse divide recent history into two eras -- before and after
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``When restructuring started after the IMF, I never thought I
would be on the lay-off list. I had been working for the company
for 10 years,'' said Cho In-Ho, 51, a gaunt and sorrowful man still
unnerved over losing his job as a senior manager at a book
publishing company last February.
</P>
<P>
   Quarrels at home led to divorce. Now Cho sleeps on a blanket on
the spotless yellow linoleum of a homeless shelter begun in May by
a Buddhist order and the city government.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is not a scene of starvation and rampant poverty. It
is the story of a proud and new middle class suddenly gutted.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time ``Asian tiger,'' this country has been deeply
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has tripled in a year and is expected to quadruple
to 2 million, a rate of 10 percent. Gross domestic product is
predicted to contract 6.5 percent this year, then another 2 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-third of Korea's conglomerates, known as chaebol,
are bankrupt or surviving on government emergency loans.
</P>
<P>
   Through unrelenting work, Koreans pulled up gross domestic
product per person from $1,200 to $14,200 in less than two decades.
The fruits of that labor are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Wounded spirits are not confined to 3,000 homeless in 80
emergency shelters, established to collect the fallout from
punishing financial and monetary controls the IMF imposed in its
$58 billion bailout package last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a banker is a middle class, stable job,'' said Shim
Il-Sun, the president of a federation of banking unions, who has
seen 35,000 bank workers lose jobs since the IMF stepped in. ``Now
there is fear, psychological frustration, loss of social status.
The middle class is going to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the city, store placards announce IMF going-out-of
business sales. Subway computer ads cite the IMF bogeyman, warning
readers to learn new job skills or risk sacking. Koreans routinely
refer to life as it was before, versus what it has become since the
diminishing, daily life changes the IMF wrought one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, an international lending agency in which the United
States plays a major backstage role, tries to save financially
stressed nations from defaulting on international obligations. To
get bailout loans, countries usually must swallow economic
austerity policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the IMF made the situation worse, with demands for
high interest rates and open markets,'' said Marion Kim, editor of
Civil Society, a publication of the Citizens' Coalition for
Economic Justice here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the other conditions that the IMF mandated we
approve. But people think we didn't have to go through all this
hardship,'' said Kim, whose grassroots activist group wanted the
IMF agreement renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist Shim questioned the IMF call for immediate and drastic
actions, which closed five big banks and contracted operations at
many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social unrest is a profound concern,'' said Yoo Jang-Hee,
economist and dean of graduate international studies at Ewha
Women's University in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   He and others believe the country's essentially democratic
processes have helped defuse social disruption, but wonder what
will happen as more Koreans exhaust their savings and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Some already are forced into desperate solutions such as Dong
Myung Children's Home, a cheerful, noisy mix of kids and toys and
hamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president Kim Kwang-Bin said his complex of apartments soon
will be 20 children beyond the capacity of 65, now that the city
asked orphanages to temporarily help overwhelmed families.
</P>
<P>
   He expects another 30 percent increase next year. City officials
envision children staying for six months to a year, but Kim looks
around him and fears these families cannot recover for two or three
years at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents love their children and want to care for them,''
Kim said, ``but they cannot.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the world dials 911 these days, it's
increasingly the president of the United States who answers the
call.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary year of global crisis management, President
Clinton has helped broker agreements aimed at ending bloodshed in
Northern Ireland, Kosovo and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He's struggled, with mixed results, to counter efforts to build
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Iran, worked to hold
together a scheme that keeps in check North Korea's atomic
ambitions, and urged India and Pakistan to step back from their own
unnerving game of nuclear saber-rattling.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month he dispatched emergency aid to the victims of
flooding in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday he arrives in the Malaysian capital of Kuala
Lumpur, where, meeting with his counterparts in the 21-nation Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, he'll try to help
guide the region out of its economic malaise before the financial
contagion afflicting East Asia and Russia cripples growth and
undermines wealth at home.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, whether it's a measure of the man and the limits of his
office, a testament to the times or simply the complexities of the
issues he's bound to address, not even the president of the United
States can claim to have brought peace to troubled lands, stability
to roiling markets or comfort to a world still menaced by powerful
weapons in dangerous hands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the White House has become the global crisis
center, the more intractable challenges of the late 20th Century
have become as much a reminder of the boundaries of American power
as of its possibilities. For Americans, and the growing number of
others who depend on them, the sobering truth is that not all of
these problems can be solved: some must simply be managed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the nature of things in the world today,'' Clinton
said in a press conference last month. ''Not everything we have to
do is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of what historians have labeled ''The American
Century,'' the White House has confronted its share, and often
more, of the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Cold War ended, though, the pace of the
global challenges set before American presidents has quickened,
even as the variety of those tasks has grown.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons have to do with technology, global integration and
the epic realignment of power and influence resulting from the
collapse of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   The first two trends have broadened the scope and lowered the
threshold of what constitutes a global crisis, even as the third
has made world problems breaking out virtually anywhere a uniquely
American concern.
</P>
<P>
   With other countries routinely looking to the last remaining
superpower before committing their own resources to address a
problem, the United States is often pivotal, if not, as U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright likes to say,
''indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the ability of the United States, or any one nation, to
fully resolve complex global crises is being diminished.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago, for example, that the United States and half
a dozen other industrialized democratic countries could control
most of what mattered in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer true.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in air travel, computers and telecommunications
have helped make possible the emergence of a truly global economy,
while the collapse of the Soviet empire, and the failings of world
communism more broadly, have led dozens of formerly
centrally-controlled states to harness their workers and enterprise
to the border-less marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   There are now perhaps 60 countries, that are important
participants in world investment and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That's presented enormous opportunities to the United States,
which will do some $2 trillion worth of two-way trade in goods and
services this year.
</P>
<P>
   Economic problems in far away lands, however, can have
unprecedented impact on jobs and wealth in this country, presenting
the White House with new headaches in uncertain times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more complicated in the sense that a lot more countries
are really important,'' said Fred Bergsten, director of the
Institute of International Economics, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, instead of convening a meeting of the Group of Seven
finance ministers to fine-tune world growth, ''You have to worry
about what happens to a Thailand or an Indonesia,'' Bergsten said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every participant in the global economy, moreover, plays by
the same rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant corruption rotted the foundations of Indonesia's growth,
while organized crime has undermined Russia. Cozy links between
money and politics meant easy credit for a generation of
well-connected Japanese companies until the bubble of instability
that system created popped a decade ago, plunging Japan into
recession. Malaysia is retreating from the global economy, imposing
currency and investment restrictions meant to limit its exposure to
the risks of unbridled markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of that makes it difficult for the United States to repair
the damage done to each country's economy, or mitigate the threats
posed to Americans, by policies and practices Washington opposes
but has a finite ability to change.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the rise of free-market economics has put the
management of much of the world economy, by design, outside of the
domain of public policymakers and increasingly in the hands of
investment bankers, currency traders and even shareholders of
global corporate empires.
</P>
<P>
   ''The non-state actors, the private interests, play a larger
role,'' said Paul Papayoanou, assistant professor of political
science at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not really controlling the economy, they're acting on
market forces,'' he said. ''But a lot of their actions affect the
international economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand-in-glove with those developments has been the emergence of
a truly global community linked by television, telephone and
computer communications.
</P>
<P>
   That's expanded the realm of crisis. In the global media
village, it's harder than ever to turn a blind eye to the suffering
of others, whether the cause of the trauma is genocide in Rwanda,
political violence in Yugoslavia or the death and devastation
caused by floods in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true for Americans, who, in winning the Cold
War, picked up global responsibilities not yet fully grasped.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the Soviet Union break up at the end of 1991, for
example, than its collapse triggered the eruption of ethnic and
civil conflicts, such as those that tore apart the former
Yugoslavia, once a Soviet satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the United States led a massive NATO
peacekeeping force into the former Yugoslav province of Bosnia to
stop Europe's worst bloodshed since World War II. The United States
has yet to knit back together the social and legal order, however,
that permitted Serbs and non-Serbs to coexist and cooperate as they
did under the old Soviet-backed system.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House officials admit that U.S. troops could
remain in Bosnia for years to prevent the outbreak of renewed
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, Soviet and American responsibilities were
understood as clearly as their respective areas of control; there
was seldom any question over whether it was Moscow's job or
Washington's to take care of a given crisis, or to simply let it
drift.
</P>
<P>
   ''That tended to calm things, to make them easier to understand
and manage,'' said Ed Haley, professor of international relations
at Claremont-McKenna College, in Claremont, Calif. ''What's changed
is now Russia isn't a player at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Russia may have lost its ability to help deal with global
problems, but it has retained some capacity for preventing
solutions, or at least muddying the chances for their success.
</P>
<P>
   For months, in 1995, the United States and its NATO allies put
off decisive, and ultimately necessary, military action against
Serb atrocities in Bosnia, out of deference to Russia's historical
ties to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian sentiment had had similar effects in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, where Serb troops have waged a year-long
campaign of terror against the ethnic Albanian majority; and in
Iraq, which has spent much of the year in violation of its 1991
pledge to grant United Nations inspectors access to alleged
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who pulled back from the brink of threatened strikes
against Iraq in the face of Russian objections last winter, is once
again weighing such attacks. And, once again, his strategic
calculus must include the sort of Russian opposition that can make
it hard for the United States to use the tools of its own choosing
to act on clear-cut policy aims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means the United States has to engage in threats and side
payments,'' said Papayoanou. ''There's sort of a bargaining process
that goes on with countries like Russia and China to get them to
follow a line of some other policy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   As crisis management increasingly involves other nations or
entire regions, or resources beyond the means of the United States
alone, it has become the president's job to try to muster global
support, through the use of multilateral institutions such as the
United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has the dominant voice in each of those
institutions, it must often compromise its aims or its methods to
build needed support among other member-nations.
</P>
<P>
   For a country that still defines success as total victory -- on
budget and on time -- the process of negotiating global consensus
can seem endlessly, painfully ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, rightly I think, constantly try to avoid unilateral
action, constantly try to build a group,'' said Haley. ''It's both
hard-headed and decent. It just gets horrifying sometimes before
the good can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly integrated world of growing complexity and
evolving risks, the White House finds itself managing crisis upon
crisis in hopes of reducing trauma and tragedy, even when it cannot
do away with them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all the world hopes for when it dials 911, but there
are times when that's as good as it gets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the world dials 911 these days, it's
increasingly the president of the United States who answers the
call.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary year of global crisis management, President
Clinton has helped broker agreements aimed at ending bloodshed in
Northern Ireland, Kosovo and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He's struggled, with mixed results, to counter efforts to build
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Iran, worked to hold
together a scheme that keeps in check North Korea's atomic
ambitions, and urged India and Pakistan to step back from their own
unnerving game of nuclear saber-rattling.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month he dispatched emergency aid to the victims of
flooding in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday he arrives in the Malaysian capital of Kuala
Lumpur, where, meeting with his counterparts in the 21-nation Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, he'll try to help
guide the region out of its economic malaise before the financial
contagion afflicting East Asia and Russia cripples growth and
undermines wealth at home.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, whether it's a measure of the man and the limits of his
office, a testament to the times or simply the complexities of the
issues he's bound to address, not even the president of the United
States can claim to have brought peace to troubled lands, stability
to roiling markets or comfort to a world still menaced by powerful
weapons in dangerous hands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the White House has become the global crisis
center, the more intractable challenges of the late 20th Century
have become as much a reminder of the boundaries of American power
as of its possibilities. For Americans, and the growing number of
others who depend on them, the sobering truth is that not all of
these problems can be solved: some must simply be managed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the nature of things in the world today,'' Clinton
said in a press conference last month. ''Not everything we have to
do is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of what historians have labeled ''The American
Century,'' the White House has confronted its share, and often
more, of the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Cold War ended, though, the pace of the
global challenges set before American presidents has quickened,
even as the variety of those tasks has grown.

   1. DUKE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 32-4 overall, 15-1 ACC (1st).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Mike Krzyzewski (505-212 overall, 432-153 in 18 years at
Duke).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Trajan Langdon 6-3, Sr. (14.7 ppg); F
Elton Brand, 6-8, Soph. (13.4 ppg); F Shane Battier, 6-8, Soph.
(7.6 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F Corey Maggette, 6-6, Bellwood, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Duke played four freshmen extensively, and they are
back, better than before. William Avery will take over the point
guard slot, while Brand, Battier and Chris Burgess form a strong
front line. Fifth-year senior Langdon is the team leader.
</P>
<P>
   2. MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 21-11 overall, 10-6 ACC (3rd).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Gary Williams (371-240 overall, 164-112 in 9 years at
Maryland).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): F Laron Profit, 6-5, Sr. (15.8 ppg); G
Terrell Stokes, 6-0, Sr., (5.4 ppg); C Obinna Ekezie, 6-10, Sr.,
(12.8 ppg)
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Juan Dixon, 6-3, Baltimore; G Danny Miller,
6-8, Mt. Holly, N.J.; G Steve Francis, 6-3, Takoma Park, Md.
(Allegany Junior College); F Lonny Baxter, 6-8, Silver Spring, Md.
(Hargrave Military Academy).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Terps look to be loaded and in a position to
challenge Duke for the ACC lead.
</P>
<P>
   3. NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 34-4 overall, 13-3 ACC (2nd).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Bill Guthridge (34-4 overall, 34-4 in one year at North
Carolina).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): G Ed Cota, 6-1, Jr. (8.1 ppg); F Ademola
Okulaja, 6-9, Sr., (8.0 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Ronald Curry, 6-3, Hampton, Va.; F/G Jason
Capel, 6-8, Chesapeake, Va. F/C Kris Lang, 6-10, Gastonia, N.C.; F
Orlando Melendez, 6-8, Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico (redshirt).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Tar Heels return only 27 percent of their scoring
and 17 percent of their rebounding from a year ago. Brandon
Haywood, a 7-0 center, could step forward, but look for freshmen
Curry and Capel to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   4. WAKE FOREST
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 16-14 overall, 7-9 ACC (T-4th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Dave Odom (220-135 overall, 182-93 in 9 years at Wake
Forest).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (4): G Robert O'Kelley, 6-1, Soph. (16.6
ppg); F Niki Arinze, 6-5, Soph. (7.0 ppg); F Rafael Vidaurreta,
6-9, Soph. (4.5 ppg); F Josh Shoemaker, 6-9, Soph. (3.0 ppg)
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Roderick Hicks, 6-1, Houston; G Jim
Fitzpatrick, 6-0, Fairfax, Va.; F/C Darius Songaila, 6-9,
Marijampole, Lithuania; G Ervin Murray, 6-5, Teachey, N.C.; F
Antwan Scott, 6-8, New Bern, N.C.; F Craig Dawson, 6-5, Kinston,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Wake started three or four freshmen for most of last
season, and five freshmen in two games, and still has the youngest
team in the league this year. O'Kelley led the Deacs in scoring
with a 16.6 average.
</P>
<P>
   5. CLEMSON
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 18-14 overall, 7-9 ACC (T-4th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Larry Shyatt (19-9 overall, first year at Clemson).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Terrell McIntyre, 5-9, Sr. (13.9 ppg);
C Tom Wideman, 6-10, Sr. (4.4 ppg) F Tony Christie, 6-6, Sr. (8.0
ppg)
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Will Solomon, 6-1, East Hartford, Conn.; G
Tywan Harris, 6-0, Greenville, S.C.; G Dustin Bracklick, 6-4,
Charleston, S.C.; F Chuckie Gilmore, 6-8, Fayetteville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Three starters and nine lettermen return. McIntyre was
the leading scorer last year and senior Harold Jamison grabbed 7.3
rebounds a game. Vincent Whitt, Johnny Miller, Mohamed Woni and
Adam Allespach all played plenty last season, to give Shyatt one of
the most experienced teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   6. N.C. STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 17-15 overall, 5-11 ACC (8th).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Justin Gainey, 6-0, Jr. (5.3 ppg); F
Kenny Inge, 6-8, Soph. (11.0 ppg); C Ron Kelley, 6-10, Soph. (8.3
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Brian Keeler, 6-2, Cary, N.C.; G Ron Anderson,
6-6, Fayetteville, N.C.; F Keith Bean, 6-8, Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The most notable returnee is 6-8 forward Damon
Thornton, who missed all but three games last year with a foot
injury. Archie Miller is one of the best shooters coming off the
bench in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   7. GEORGIA TECH
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 19-14 overall, 6-10 ACC (T-6th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Bobby Cremins (426-274 overall, 326-204 in 17 years at
Georgia Tech).

<P>
   Returning starters (1): C Alvin Jones, 7-0, Soph. (6.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Tony Akins, 6-0, Lilburn; G Darryl LaBarrie,
6-3, Stone Mountain (transfer from Florida A&AMP;M); F Jason Collier,
7-0, Springfield, Ohio (transfer from Indiana).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Sophomore guard Dion Glover, who averaged 18.4 points
per game last year, is out with a torn ACL. Starting point guard
Travis Spivey transferred to Iowa State and backup center Pablo
Machado transferred to Loyola Marymount. With Matt Harpring and
Michael Maddox graduated, Tech is not overwhelmed with
experience.Tech will return 15.8 points of offense per game.
</P>
<P>
   8. FLORIDA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 18-14 overall, 6-10 ACC (T-6th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Steve Robinson (64-32 overall, 18-14 in first year at
FSU).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (1): G. Terrell Baker, 6-5, Sr. (12.0 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F Antwaun Dixon, 6-5, Marietta; G Adrian
Crawford, 6-5, Soph., Akron, Ohio (transfer Tulsa); F Damous
Anderson, 6-6, Jr., Greenville, S.C. (transfer from Metro Atlanta
College); G Emanuel Mathis, 6-3, Atlanta; F/C Justin Mott, 6-10,
Jr., Chula Vista, Calif. (transfer from Barton C.C.).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Four of Robinson's players have played at other
Division I schools: Crawford (Tulsa), Oliver Simmons (Kentucky),
Anderson (South Carolina) and Mott (Washington State). The problem
for the Seminoles is that few on the roster have played together as
a team, although forward Ron Hale and center Karim Shabazz saw
plenty of playing time last season.
</P>
<P>
   9. VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 11-19 overall, 3-11 ACC (9th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Pete Gillen (274-128 overall, first year at Virginia).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Donald Hand, 5-11, Soph. (4.7 ppg);
G/F Willie Dersch, 6-5, Jr. (6.5 ppg); C/F Colin Ducharme, 6-9, Jr.
(7.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F/G Adam Hall, 6-5, Katy, Texas; F/G Chris
Williams, 6-5, Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Prospects for Gillen are not bright. The Cavs return
three starters, but they also happen to be the only three with any
experience. In fact, the Cavalier roster lists only eight players,
period.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Employees at Amazon.com, the popular on-line bookseller,
recently received a directive from senior management that struck
some as out of character in a company that had sprouted from the
Internet's free-for-all culture.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an event that the Seattle-based company designated
``Sweep and Keep,'' employees were instructed to purge, among other
things, e-mail messages that were no longer required for business
or not subject to legal records requirements. Free lattes would be
dispensed in the cafeteria to those who complied immediately, the
directive said.
</P>
<P>
   This Amazon ``document retention'' policy, which requires
employees to expunge electronic files regularly, was followed a few
weeks later with guidelines for ``document creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply put, there are some communications that should
not be expressed in written form,'' the Oct. 20 memo stated.
``Sorry, no lattes this time!''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind monopoly power in the marketplace; the real lesson
corporate America is taking away from the Microsoft antitrust trial
is that old e-mail can be a mine field of legal liability, not to
mention a source of public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-profile court battle between the Justice Department
and the Microsoft Corp., e-mail has emerged as the star witness _ a
fact that appears to be giving pause to corporate executives
accustomed to clicking ``send'' without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love e-mail,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief
executive. ``I think it is changing the world. The problem is
somebody can take it out of context and use it against you, and we
have to guard against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, like many companies, had embraced e-mail as the
preferred way to communicate about business matters. Instant,
convenient and at least putatively private, it allows the lowliest
employee to discourse with the most exalted. And it provokes
spontaneous, if not always eloquent, brainstorming among colleagues
who might otherwise keep their thoughts to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Amazon, which to many people symbolizes a progressive
Internet culture, is among the growing ranks of companies that are
imposing new restrictions on e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier policies prohibiting abusive or harassing
electronic messages, the new rules tend to curb types of expression
that have long been deemed acceptable business discourse. And when
such exchanges must take place in writing, the prevailing
philosophy would have them expunged as quickly and ruthlessly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   This backlash underscores a paradox of the information age:
while instantaneous electronic communication often helps increase
productivity and innovation, the privacy of workplace
correspondence and accountability for what is written are growing
concerns for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   Often, e-mail is more a conversation that happens to be written
down than an actual letter, and it is often more revealing than
either. It has thrived largely because of the assumption _ some
would call it the illusion _ that the rapid-fire confessional
exchanges that e-mail seems to encourage will never be divorced
from their context.
</P>
<P>
   But that is often not the case in legal disputes, where e-mail
is increasingly being treated as the ultimate window into the true
thoughts of executives and the inner workings of an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Microsoft trial's electronic highlights: the company
chairman, Bill Gates, in a sworn deposition, flatly contradicts his
e-mail statements, and an e-mail from James Barksdale, chief
executive of Netscape Communications Corp., to America Online's
chairman, Steve Case, in which he refers to Case as ``Franklin D.''
and himself as ``Joseph Stalin.'' The reference implies a
comparison between the two executives in their war against
Microsoft and the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union
fighting Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the Sun Microsystem lawsuit against Microsoft over
the Java programming language, a federal court in San Jose, Calif.,
has seen a great deal of embarrassing e-mail from both companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the very attributes that have made e-mail so
popular _ chief among them its tendency to induce off-the-cuff
candor _ are driving managers to conclude that its use must be
reined in, its tracks dusted over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, message-retention policies have been primarily
designed for disk space management,'' said Jim Browning, a senior
research analyst at the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. ``The new
question is how quickly should e-mail be deleted to prevent it from
becoming a danger to the organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Browning said that anxious calls from clients had been rising in
tandem with headlines about the Microsoft trial. Earlier this
month, a client called looking for what he characterized as an
``e-mail shredder.'' Another wanted a ``Mission Impossible'' e-mail
product that would self-destruct the message after it was read.
``That option doesn't exist today,'' Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   But such anxiety is not unreasonable. E-mail that someone thinks
has been erased often still exists somewhere, perhaps on the hard
drive of one or more recipients or of someone to whom it was
forwarded. People often do not realize they have set their software
to leave e-mail on the server, the computer that acts as an
electronic post office. And erased files can sometimes be
reconstructed with special software that reassembles discarded data
from the digital ghosts left behind on hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group recommends policies that help employees
understand what a company considers appropriate business language.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Joyce Graff, Gartner's research director for
the electronic workplace: ``You talk about `fair competition'; you
don't talk about `slaughtering' them. No warfare language. That way
you have fewer messages you have to worry about in the files.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 83 million Americans who now use e-mail in the workplace
know, it is easily and often forwarded, copied and stored in
perpetuity on everything from company backup tapes to personal Palm
Pilots. The fact that people are disinclined to erase old e-mail
has not been lost on lawyers, who routinely request e-mail as part
of the discovery process in civil and criminal cases.

   Robert Lipstein, a Washington-based antitrust lawyer, said a
company's e-mail was a treasure trove of evidence ``because that's
when you catch people in their unguarded moments.'' Lipstein, who
specializes in subpoenaing computer records from multinational
corporations, added, ``I've seen e-mail that makes me cringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several executives said they regretted the new
atmosphere of deliberation and delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slows down communication if everybody is stopping and
thinking about what they write,'' said Tom Jermoluk, chief
executive of At Home, a company that provides Internet access over
cable television lines. ``It's chilling. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jermoluk, whose company was dragged into the
Microsoft antitrust dispute because of an e-mail message a senior
manager had written titled ``Gates on the Warpath,'' said he had
instructed the company's lawyer to write a more restrictive policy
to regulate e-mail and record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting desires to engage in frank, private
communication and to escape public accountability for it are by no
means new. Corporations have for decades trashed acres of files _
albeit with the added incentive that paper takes up a lot of space.
</P>
<P>
   And well before the first subpoena for a document, Socrates
warned that writing ideas down was a bad idea because, among other
things, one could never know who might read them. Plato countered
that a culture that had to commit everything to memory was limited
in its intellectual possibilities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The quandary of archived records, said Neil Postman, a professor
of media studies at New York University, has been around ``ever
since phonetic writing became a critical part of Western culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important new technology is a Faustian bargain,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, employers are choosing censorship. More than 20
percent of the respondents in the American Management Association's
annual survey this year said that they monitored employee e-mail,
compared with 15 percent who said they did so in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Classes with titles like ``E-Mail 101'' are getting healthy
enrollments. Bloomberg, the financial news service, installed a
system last month that searches e-mail for offending words. If it
finds one, a warning pops up before the e-mail is sent: ``This is
inappropriate language to use in correspondence with any customer,
and a copy of this message will be immediately sent to your
superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers at Polk Co., a data resource firm in Southfield, Mich.,
recently discovered that 10 percent of employees had from 5,000 to
10,000 e-mail messages saved on hard drives. A delete-fest is being
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Microsoft trial has done is to say that if people are
using this as an electronic filing system, it could be a dangerous
medium,'' said David Zaccagnini, Polk's vice president for
information technology. ``That's what the Microsoft trial really
means to corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without formal policies, executives said they were
sanitizing their own e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I self-consciously tone my language down,'' said John Gage,
chief scientist at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Prusak, executive director of IBM's Institute for
Knowledge Management, is wary of inhibiting the use of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``With e-mail, you get an optimization of a firm's knowledge,''
Prusak said. ``You know Queen Elizabeth I said, `I don't wish to
build windows into men's souls.' That's in a sense what we're
beginning to do, and I find it very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Iran-Contra investigations in which Col.
Oliver North's e-mail detailed illegal aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels, courts ruled that most government e-mail must be saved as a
public record. That has changed attitudes toward e-mail among
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous increase in information requests
from Congress, which has a very legitimate oversight function,''
said Sally Katzen, who formerly headed the Clinton administration's
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. ``But the call for
e-mails _ which in many instances are very susceptible to being
incomplete, cryptic and misunderstood _ has led a lot of people to
shun the use of e-mail, and I think that's most unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some critics say that unless e-mail comes to be viewed
through a more appropriate legal lens, companies, governments and
individuals will lose the full benefits of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is perhaps the most contextually sensitive piece of
writing that we have, and culturally we're going through this stage
where we don't understand how to read it,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a
Harvard University law professor. ``The clumsiness that the legal
system has in dealing with this will lead to losing some of its
value unless we learn how to put it into context and properly weigh
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's own personal e-mail became a source of controversy last
year when he was named special master by the judge hearing the
Microsoft antitrust case. Microsoft contended that he was biased,
citing an e-mail message he had sent to a Netscape executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people now who will not send me things in e-mail,''
Lessig said.

FLOPPIES STILL RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Tuesday's elections proved, there's a lot to be said for
incumbency. It takes an extraordinary effort to dislodge the guy
who got there first, and most haven't got what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing in the tech trade, though around here we have a
suitably clunky term for it. We call it ``the first-mover
advantage.'' Win this bit of technological high ground and you'll
probably stay there for quite awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the lowly floppy disk drive, the one you use for
carrying word-processor files around in your purse or pocket. It's
about the most primitive piece of technology you'll find in the
average computer. Its sheer crudity so offended Apple Computer Inc.
boss Steve Jobs that he banned the floppy drive from the new iMac.
Instead, he declared, iMac users would buy advanced drives with
removable high-capacity cartridges _ drives like the Iomega Zip,
the Imation SuperDisk or the SyQuest Sparq.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not the Sparq. Syquest shut its doors last week,
citing massive losses. The company may be resurrected after a bout
of Chapter 11 therapy, but then again maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other floppy-drive wannabes aren't long for this
world. Iomega's Zip is far and away the most successful, with 14
million sold, yet the company has lost money the past two quarters.
Imation's SuperDisk has managed to move just four million drives,
even though SuperDisk is more versatile than Zip _ it accepts
standard floppies and 120-megabyte high-capacity disks. By year's
end, Sony Electronics, the firm that invented today's floppies,
will offer a 200-megabyte drive that also works with regular
floppies.
</P>
<P>
   I figure Iomega's bound to survive, given its existing customer
base. But either the Imation or Sony offerings probably won't be
around next year. The market's just not big enough. According to
Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., Iomega and its rivals
sold only 8 million drives between them in 1997, and will probably
sell only 14 million this year. For Iomega to get back in the
black, it'll have to get a large share of this small market,
leaving very little for the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   In a sane world, the market for Zip and its rivals would be much
larger. Computer retailers ought to be nudging every home computer
buyer to buy one of these drives as a quick and handy way to back
up important data. A high-capacity removable disk is the simplest
way to avoid disaster. By not pushing them, computer dealers keep
blowing an opportunity to provide better service to their customers
and make more money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lowly 1.4-megabyte floppy soldiers on, a standard
feature in nearly every desktop and laptop computer. The industry
will buy 100 million of them this year, and while Disk/Trend
president James Porter expects sales to level off, they'll remain
popular well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're everywhere. Steve Jobs may despise
floppies today, but he's the guy who introduced the current 3
1/2-inch standard disk to the world. The original Macintosh, back
in 1984, was the first machine to use them. Billions have been used
since.
</P>
<P>
   It costs a PC maker just $15 or so to install a floppy drive in
a machine, compared to about $40 for a Zip drive. And old floppy
disks cost about 50 cents apiece, compared to $10-$15 for a Zip
cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   And while the floppy can't handle hundreds of digital photos,
it'll easily hold hundreds of pages of text _ even more if you use
disk compression. Zip isn't only the name of a removable disk drive
_ it's also the name of the PC world's favorite disk compression
system. With the use of programs like Nico Mak Computing's WinZip
(http://www.winzip.com), floppies go a lot farther than you might
think.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent bout of housecleaning, I decided to back up a
16-megabyte file. WinZip made the file 75 percent smaller. Then it
let me do ``disk spanning,'' a handy feature that divides a single
large file into floppy-sized pieces, and then copies them onto the
disks. You just keep inserting floppies until the job is done. I
only needed four. There's no denying that floppy drives are
obsolete and destined to pass away. But Syquest's failure suggests
that a lot of newer and better technologies will beat floppies to
the graveyard.

By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  DEAR DR.
BOMBAY: Having become frustrated with America Online, would you
please recommend a more effective, yet user-friendly, server?
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ American Offline
</P>
<P>
   DEAR AMERICAN: Gee, I hate to be the one to break this to you,
but it doesn't get much easier or effective than AOL, even for the
cerebrally challenged. I know what you're looking for, though.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is a nice little place to get used to the online world. You
can learn how to e-mail and browse and mouse-click your way around.
You can even learn to chat with other users, who will most
certainly want to know A) what you're wearing right now and B) if
you will send them a naked picture of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is only one small part of the Internet, like a corral
out on the prairie. Horses can come and go through the gate,
providing the system wrangler can keep it open. Many of these
horses are happy just to stay in the corral, chatting amiably with
other horses, wondering what they're wearing and trying to get them
to send naked pictures of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What you're looking for is a true ISP _ an Internet service
provider. These are the people who let you dial into their big,
expensive computer that's connected to the entire Net. In the olden
days, two or three years ago, it pretty much took a four-eyed,
Xena-worshipping technoweenie to hook things up right the first
time. Well, we can look back on those primitive times and burst out
laughing now. If you can set up AOL, you can set up a Web browser
and a dialer. The ISP should give you software, instructions and a
help line number.
</P>
<P>
   Will you use the Internet when you're on the road? Try some
national or statewide company with a long list of local access
numbers unless you can handle the long-distance bill. If it's just
for home use, you'll probably find a cheaper deal with a local ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your ISP carefully, which is to say, do it when you're
sober. Don't sign a year-long contract right away, because the ISP
may stink or be otherwise unreliable. Find out how long the company
has been in business and how many users it has per available
connection. Nothing more frustrating than a busy signal. Talk to
tech support and pretend to be totally in the dark. Big stretch,
huh? If you're not comfortable with the help desk dweeb, take a
walk. Lastly, ask the biggest nerd at work what he uses. He may get
so excited that somebody actually talked to him he'll do that trick
where he shoots milk out of his nose. I never get tired of watching
that.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Here's something to try if you have
Windows 98 and are really bored. Click the Start button, open the
Programs menu and go to Accessories. Right-right click on an
application (like Notepad), then pick Properties from the menu that
appears. Now click the Change Icon button. Double-click on the icon
already in use and then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Start button again. Hover just between Shutdown and
the Start button and a scroll arrow appears. Now on the list:
``Eject PC,'' which is what many of you Win98 users would love to
do.
</P>
<P>
   This trick doesn't always work the first time, so please don't
whine about it. I'm very sensitive.
</P>

NEW MACOS 8.5 FRUSTRATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let the truth be known, I really do miss my Macintosh. I gave up
my Mac a little more than a year ago when I developed a bad case of
tendinitis; to save my hands, I started using Dragon Naturally
Speaking, a continuous speech recognition system. While speech
recognition software is available for the Mac, it doesn't have the
power of Naturally Speaking.
</P>
<P>
   So I was a bit curious when Apple Computer Inc. sent me a review
copy of its newest operating system, MacOS 8.5. Seizing the
opportunity, I decided to try it out with my friend Aaron, a
Mac-intosh enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron and I tested MacOS 8.5 on a PowerPC 9600 with 64 megabytes
of RAM and a 4-gigabyte hard drive. The system had an impressive
load of applications, including PhotoShop, Microsoft Office, and a
variety of Web publishing tools.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, MacOS 8.5 is Apple's first Internet release. Many
Internet features that have until now only been available from
third-party or shareware applications are now bundled into Apple's
operating system. For example, the Date/Time control panel now
allows you to automatically set the system date and time from a
Network Time Server. Meanwhile, the functionality of the infamous
Macintosh Internet Config utility has been subsumed into a new
Internet control panel
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Internet-savvy feature in MacOS 8.5 is Apple's new
Sherlock search system. Previously called Find Files, you can use
Sherlock to search for information three different ways. First, you
can search for all of the files that have a particular name. Next,
you can index your hard drive and search for any file that contains
a given keyword. Finally, you can turn Sherlock loose on the
Internet, and have it search via Web sites such as AltaVista,
Hotbot, Excite, and Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users are positively enamored with Sherlock's
features. Although companies like On Technology of Cambridge have
sold hard-drive indexing tools in the past, most Mac users have
never known that it exists. Now its built-in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these various improvements, however, there are still a
lot of things that are frustrating about MacOS. MacOS is
multitasking, which means that you can run more than one
application at a time, but the operating system still does not have
preemptive multitasking, which means that one process can interrupt
another.
</P>
<P>
   What this means in layman's terms is that every now and then the
Mac seems to lock up and become unresponsive. It hasn't crashed _
it's simply doing something that can't be interrupted. This is most
visible when applications are launching. Yes, MacOS 8.5 launches
applications faster than MacOS 7.5 and possibly faster than 8.0,
but while an application is launching your system is basically
unusable.
</P>
<P>
   That's annoying for people like me who are constantly switching
between applications. (I frequently browse the Web or read a few
e-mail messages while a complicated application is starting up on
my Windows machine.) Some programs, such as Apple's new Help
Browser, are particularly bad offenders in this department.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is calling MacOS 8.5 The Must-Have Upgrade. Unfortunately,
a lot of current Apple users are locked out of the 8.5 experience.
According to Apple, MacOS 8.5 requires a PowerPC computer with 16
megabytes of physical RAM and virtual memory set to at least 24
megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   But I was unable to install it on a Performa 5300 computer that
had 32 megabyes of RAM. Apple's upgrade software refused to update
the operating system on the hard drive, and when we tried to boot
from the CD-ROM and do a clean install, the installer crashed,
complaining that the system didn't have enough memory.
</P>
<P>
   You should also avoid install MacOS 8.5 on Macintosh clones that
were made by companies like Power Computing, SuperMac, Motorola,
and UMAX. Although these machines would run MacOS 8.0, Apple
terminated the clone maker's MacOS license when it decided to
jettison those annoying clone companies that were making computers
that were faster and cheaper than what Apple could produce.
</P>
<P>
   Big warnings on the SuperMac Web site advise customers that if
you try to install MacOS 8.5 on a non-Apple branded computer, you
are doing so at your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Macintosh Web sites such as Macintouch and TidBits have
also reported that some people have had their hard disks severely
damaged upon installation of MacOS 8.5. This seems to affect less
than 1 percent of all MacOS users _ mostly people with non-Apple
SCSI hard drives that are using third-party disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, MacOS 8.5 warns against installation if it detects that
you are using a non-Apple hard drive. This is just insanity on
Apple's part, a cynical attempt to extort more money from the
Mac-intosh-loving public. A hard disk is a hard disk, and Apple is
the only company I know that has gimmicked its operating system to
behave differently when run with hard drives that were purchased on
the open market (where customers can typically save hundreds of
dollars off the price charged by Mother Apple).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I see the advances in MacOS 8.5 as largely cosmetic,
not revolutionary. With a selling price of $99 and guaranteed mass
appeal, Apple is sure to make a lot of money on the product. But
rather than working on glitz, I would rather see the company spend
its R&AMP;D dollars on fixing the fundamental problems with the MacOS
plumbing.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    New Apple OS introduces Sherlock
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OS 8.5, the latest version of the Apple Computer
operating system, represents another incremental step forward for
the Mac. By and large, OS 8.5 is a collection of small but
important tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is a potentially important new technology
called Sherlock. It's a search engine that replaces the Mac's aging
Find application. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   While receiving good reviews overall, OS 8.5 has generated some
disturbing complaints. A few users have reported severe damage to
the data and programs on their hard drives. Others have complained
that, over time, the icons on their Macs have slowly disappeared
with OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these complaints have been linked to Mac clones or Macs
using drivers other than Apple's. Apple Computer has launched a
major investigation to identify and correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a new version of the operating system to
cause problems. Most are corrected within a few months. So it
wouldn't be unwise to wait a bit before buying OS 8.5, which
retails for $99.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've been playing with OS 8.5 for about three weeks
and have experienced no problems. It has worked fine on both a G3
PowerBook and G3 desktop.
</P>
<P>
   By far OS 8.5's biggest innovation is Sherlock. It lets you
search for files through hard drives, networks and the Internet.
With the old Find application, you could only search through file
names and characteristics. In addition, Sherlock lets you search
the content of a file.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I launched a search for the word Michelangelo,
which was buried within one of the hundreds of files on my hard
drive. Sherlock found this file in a split second.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock ranks its findings by relevance, a presentation that
mimics a style now common on the Net. Indeed, Sherlock looks and
acts more like a Web search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock also incorporates some long-awaited file management
improvements. Click on a listed file and you jump right to it. You
can also move files _ to another folder, the desktop or the trash _
by simply dragging them.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock is only one of many new features in OS 8.5. I will
examine others, including small but helpful ones, in the weeks
ahead.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Computer ghost defies readers' explanations
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All Hallow's Eve has come and gone, I'm gorged with
candy scarfed up before those annoying little trick-or-treaters
could get it, and the ghost still resides in my computer, turning
it on at midnight every night.
</P>
<P>
   Since I reported this phenomenon, I've received several kindly
suggestions from readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article suggests that you may have Norton Utilities
installed since you considered whether to call Norton or
Ghostbusters,'' one reader began. ``Norton may be the better
choice. These utilities have the ability to do things for you all
by themselves at a preset time _ which, of course, would include
turning on the computer if it is so capable. See whether that's
your problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not, because I'm waiting for the latest version of Norton
to install. Additionally, some guy named Peter Norton sent me a
message suggesting Ghostbusters would be the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is your computer is not shutting down but going into
a sleep, suspend or standby mode and wakes up at midnight because
of Microsoft task scheduler,'' wrote another reader. ``It comes
with Internet Explorer 4.0 and also with Windows 98. It does
periodic tasks such as defrag and scandisk when the computer is
idle for a period of time or on a regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   No luck. The computer's not sleeping, and I have neither
Explorer nor Windows 98 installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I too noticed my computer coming on at odd hours even though I
had put it in rest mode,'' reports a third reader. ``I began
noticing that the computer only came on after my using the
telephone (the modem is connected to the same line). Perhaps, your
son's use of your wife's computer triggered yours to come on after
he went online _ that is if both computers use the same telephone
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Two computers are indeed using the same line, but mine is turned
off, not suspended or rested, and I can see no connection between
online activity and the machine coming on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two possibilities to your problem. ... You may have
a problem with power management. Both the BIOS and Win 95 have
settings for this and sometimes they conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second takes an explanation. It might have something to do
with a new standard called Desktop Management Interface or DMI. DMI
is a tool for administrators of a network to get more productivity
out of a workstation. DMI allows a PC to be turned on a few minutes
before an employee arrives at work, thus saving valuable time lost
while booting the PC. DMI also monitors whether the cover has been
removed from the system and is used to track network activity.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't detect any conflicts in power management, and if I have
something called DMI on my computer I cannot find any trace of it.
If I did, I would swiftly expunge it. What kind of sweatshop wants
a computer to come on automatically a few minutes before John Q.
Public comes to work so he doesn't waste the company's valuable
time booting it up? Talk about Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   The best, however, came in last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with great surprise that I read your article on Sunday,
10/25/98, and learned that I am not the only person with a computer
that cuts on at midnight! If you should ever find the reason, I
would be most interested. Shutting off the power seems to be the
only solution. Thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   You see? They're all around us. But the truth is in there
somewhere.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Ham radio brings out the adolescent squeal in me
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in nearly two years, I hooked my
ham radio station up to an antenna and _ in just seconds _ I was 13
years old again.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a licensed ham radio operator _ KQ4YA _ but because I lived
in apartments for the last three years, putting up an antenna
capable of transmitting wasn't practical. I recently bought a home
and moved in last week. Long before the pictures were hung, I had a
temporary antenna in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio has been a hobby, off and on, since I was 13 years
old. And each time I throw the switch and listen to the voices from
far away fade in and out of the static, I remember how my hands
used to tremble as I tuned my original radio station _ an old
Hallicrafters SX-99 receiver and a Healthkit transmitter. Both
companies are gone now and my ham radio now is a transceiver,
combining the functions of a transmitter and receiver, all in a
black box that isn't much bigger than a breadbox (if you're old
enough to remember what that is).
</P>
<P>
   But the thrill of ham radio doesn't depend on the type of radio
you use. The airwaves are one of the few parts of my world that
don't seem changed in modern and confusing ways. It's still very
much _ as I tune the bands _ like walking through a tropical forest
filled with birds. There are birdlike squeaks and squawks as I tune
past stations. And there are voices from around the world, other
amateur radio operators having conversations using an old
technology that hasn't changed markedly since the days of Marconi.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a particularly shy man, but it took me nearly half an
hour before I tried actually answering another station. But there
was a radio operator in Kentucky and, as I listened, he talked
about his job as a newspaper publisher. So I hit the transmit
button and called him _ sending my voice out over the air using
about the same amount of power it would take to illuminate a single
light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   I know it probably sounds crazy if you _ like me _ casually send
e-mail to acquaintances all over the world using the Internet, but
when that ham just a few states away answered my call it seemed
like magic that all of that was possible. And I was a tongue-tied
13-year-old again, babbling about the new house and the fact that I
hadn't been on the air in years.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I write a column about ham radio I wonder if I'm
whistling in the wind. A lot of p UHDn't even know what we are,
confusing ham radio operators with CB radio enthusiasts of the
``uod buddy'' variety. After all, there are only 600,000 licensed
amateur radio operators in the entire nation, so it's not strange
there's so much confusion about what we do and what the hobby is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur radio surely isn't trendy. You're unlikely to impress
anyone at a party when you tell them about your new Yaseu FT-990
transceiver. Nor will crowds gather when you pull out a card
confirming a radio contact with a station in Bosnia. The way the
Internet bridges distances at the push of a button has taken away
some of the drama of talking to people in foreign lands. And the
ease of making a cellular phone call makes wireless communication
seem mundane.
</P>
<P>
   But we are not dealing with logic or even with something
practical now. Instead, I am talking about the magic of walking
into your spare bedroom and fishing out the voices of strangers
from the static. I am talking about the pure drama of hearing a
station in some distant country come back to you. And unlike on the
Net, you'll hear their voices and even _ in some cases _ literally
hear the background sound of the family dog barking in a parlor in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio isn't for everyone. But I am surprised, each time I
write about it, to find there is still a heart tug for many that
hasn't been lost in the static.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to learn more about the hobby, point that
newfangled Web browser of yours to the home page of the American
Radio Relay League at http://www.arrl.org. That's the best-known
organization for U.S. ham operators. You'll find complete
information about licensing and the hobby itself.

PROFILE: AT 29, AN ELDER STATESMAN OF INTERNET EROTICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (js) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the president of his industry's trade group, a well-known
Internet pioneer who has floated above the red ink that has drowned
so many other entrepreneurs, but Mark Tiarra still asks that a
reporter not mention the northern New Jersey town where he conducts
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stuffy place around here,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So let it simply be said that Tiarra works most days in a
nondescript building in Bergen County, not far from Ridgewood,
producing, marketing and carefully manipulating the most popular
commodity on the World Wide Web: adult entertainment. And as a
measure of how rapidly that industry has grown, Tiarra, who has
been in the business only about four years, has become one of its
elder statesmen, a highly sought-after guru who is now making
plenty of money as a consultant to aspiring Webmasters of
cyberporn. He is 29 years old and has the interview spiel down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with basing a business on human
sexuality,'' he said, relaxing in front of an enormous computer
monitor. ``Of course, we don't even do that many hard-core sites.
There's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn't appeal to my
tastes. Our sites try to cross the line between art and erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   He is mildly dismissive of the thousands of coarse, tumbledown
Web sites that fail to surround their flesh pictures with the
proper graphical environment, but for Tiarra, the president of the
United Adult Sites, there is a limit to condescension. The
nonprofit organization, formed in 1996, is the trade association of
adult Web sites. It has established a code of ethics for its 500
members and lobbied in Washington against restrictions like the
Child Online Protection Act, signed into law last month by
President Clinton and immediately challenged by Internet
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department doesn't even know how it's going to
enforce it,'' he said. ``If I were the Supreme Court, I'd be
insulted that they passed it.'' The law penalizes commercial Web
sites that fail to keep ``harmful material'' out of the hands of
minors.
</P>
<P>
   With his long, limp black hair and faint beard, Tiarra looks
more like the musician and record producer he says he would prefer
to be than the pornography industry authority he has become. But he
is immensely knowledgeable and utterly straightforward about the
details of his work, and though he has no business background,
others in the industry say his marketing abilities are remarkable.

   ``Mark is known as a genius at directing traffic,'' said Fay
Sharp, who runs the XWebexpo, a trade show held twice a year for
the adult Web industry. ``Someone sets up a site and they need to
have traffic into the site or they die. So they call Mark and they
buy traffic from him, and it's not yucky traffic _ it's people who
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, for the uninitiated, refers to the number of people who
look at a Web page, and ideally, give out their credit card numbers
for a peek at password-protected photos. (According to several
industry estimates, more than half the Internet's bandwidth, or
capacity, is taken up with traffic in adult material.) By setting
up carefully manipulative advertisements on his own popular sites,
Tiarra can send his traffic to other sites, charging them for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, he realized that thousands of people had read
about the gold rush of profit possibilities in cyberporn and were
trying to enter the industry with no knowledge or ability. So, just
as in the mainstream computer world, he began selling his knowledge
to new Webmasters, and is now offering complete packages to
entrepreneurs with cash. The basic package starts at $3,499, for
which a buyer gets two galleries of photos, several completely
designed Web pages and a month of consulting advice. The ``platinum
package'' goes for $34,999 and includes a huge gallery of photos,
live video feeds, credit card processing, advertising and three
months of consulting.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Tiarracorp, now has seven full-time employees and
60 or 70 contractors around the world who design the sites. This,
of course, is where the big money is. Thousands of inexperienced
adult Webmasters have gone under with the increasing competition,
but his company has made several million dollars for the last three
years, and his telephone continues to ring as newcomers seek out an
honest reputation in a rough trade filled with swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he had never seen the Internet, coming
late to the industry. He grew up in Bergen County, the son of a
data-processing executive. He was allowed to play with an Apple 2C
and a guitar in high school. He took music in college and later
worked in a printing business until a friend asked him to design a
Web site for a band. He studied the Internet and by 1994 realized
there was only one likely way to make money with it, appealing to a
very old-fashioned instinct. His Web sites range from the grandiose
(``All the Beauty That Is Woman'') to the crass (``The Girls of
Tiarracorp''), but every evening, they are seen by thousands of Web
surfers, many with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 2-year-old son, and I don't want him seeing these
sites until he knows the difference between love and sex,'' Tiarra
said. ``Nobody wants kids on their sites. They cost you bandwidth,
and they don't have a credit card to buy anything you have.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within three seconds of logging on to America Online from her
room on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, Debbie Shapiro, a junior
at Stuyvesant High School, got an instant message from her best
friend's brother's college roommate, who was on his dormitory room
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey there, Deb,'' the message flashed, as the twinkle sound
that accompanies every instant message alerted her to check her
screen.``Hey,'' she fired back, rolling her eyes. ``This guy is
always bugging me,'' she said to a companion. ``I don't know why. I
have nothing to say to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Debbie's computer screen was peppered with several
more instant messages _ one from a friend wanting to know if any
jocks had been at the party Debbie went to the night before, one
from a classmate inquiring about math homework and one from a
friend just wondering what was up.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half-hour, Debbie performed an epistolary juggling
act that had her holding four different online conversations
simultaneously. When Debbie's best friend called, Debbie picked up
the cordless phone next to her computer, cradled it between her ear
and shoulder to talk and continued typing.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the household with a computer and multiple phone
lines, the teen-ager who years ago would have secreted herself away
in the closet with her Princess phone now has vastly expanded
communications, thanks to America Online or other instant-message
services.
</P>
<P>
   AOL began offering instant messages as soon as it signed up its
first members, in 1985. But the service has now moved as far into
the mainstream as MTV because it has been letting people outside
AOL sign up for Instant Messenger since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, 100 million instant messages were being sent by
AOL members each day. Now that the service is open and free for
anyone, AOL says, the number of daily messages is 200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with scores of teen-agers showed that AOL's Instant
Messenger is indeed popular among that age group. And although
adults debate whether impressionable adolescents should have
unregulated Internet access, the main thing teen-agers seem to do
when they log on for instant messages is use their keyboards to
talk to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to move beyond anecdotal evidence of this
phenomenon to specific numbers. AOL does not track the way
teen-agers use the service.
</P>
<P>
   But many parents can testify that all of a house's telephone
lines can be monopolized for hours at a time by teen-agers chatting
on computers and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our peak hours are 8 to 11 p.m.,'' said an AOL spokeswoman,
Pam McGraw. ``But we do know that when kids get home from school,
they have a tendency to sign on and chat with their friends, just
like they normally would have talked on the phone in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL added its Buddy List to Instant Messenger in February 1996,
and that has contributed to the huge increase in instant messaging
among the under-18 set.
</P>
<P>
   Your Buddy List includes the online names of the people you want
to exchange instant messages with; you are notified each time a
person on your list goes on line, and those on your list are told
when you go on line. Before the advent of the Buddy List, you had
to type in someone's name to find out if that person was on line.
</P>
<P>
   Similar lists are now offered by other chat and instant-message
services, like those offered by Yahoo, Excite, ICQ, Internet Relay
Chat and Pow Wow. One reason for AOL's popularity among teen-agers
may be the fact that a majority of parents with Internet access
have AOL accounts.
</P>
<P>
   What urgent missives are imparted via instant messages that
can't wait until the next school day? ``We complain about school
mostly, and teachers and guys,'' said Sara Mulnix, a high-school
sophomore from Herndon, Va., whose Buddy List runs 83 names long.
She said she spendt two to three hours a week on line with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Scott, 16, from Reading, Mass., said: ``I I-M friends
about various social dilemmas, and all other kinds of craziness.
It's a quicker way to get answers than calling someone on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teen-agers use instant messages strictly to keep in touch
with friends from summer camps or catch up with friends from old
neighborhoods. ``I go on, read my mail, write back a couple of
sentences and get off,'' said Sara Shepard, a sophomore at Trinity
High School in New York City. ``I used to be much more into it, but
I don't have the time anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For other teen-agers, however, AOL's Instant Messenger system is
nearly as important as the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big social tool,'' said Jocelyn Nubel, 15, of
Northport, N.Y., adding that virtually everyone she knew at school
and in her town had access to AOL's Instant Messenger. ``To some
extent, it takes the place of the phone. We'll all be at a party
and when we leave, we say, `Bye, see you guys on AOL.' Then when I
get home, at like 1 o'clock, I'll go on line and get all these
instant messages. People asking me, `Did you have fun tonight?'
`Who did you go with?' and `Did you hear about so-and-so?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn said it was easier to approach boys on line than on the
phone. ``You don't have to deal with the awkwardness of phone
silence when you instant-message someone,'' she said. ``When you
call someone, it's more personal. If I I-M someone, it's not such a
big deal because that's what everybody does. You can get the
general stuff about each other out of the way so when you see him,
it's easier to start talking.''

NETSCAPE'S BROWSER PULLS AHEAD, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the phrase ``browser wars.'' When it comes to creating
software used to surf the World Wide Web, Netscape Communications
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are playing a game of leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   Each company's release of its respective browser is slightly
better than its competitor's _ that is, until the competitor comes
out with a new one. The last time I looked
(www.chron.com/content/chronicle/atchron/97/10/19/compute.html),
Microsoft was in the lead with Internet Explorer 4.01, the
top-notch browser that's also the interface for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Netscape's turn to hop ahead. The Mountain View,
Calif.-based company has released version 4.5 of its Communicator
Internet suite (home.netscape.com), and it's a winner. Microsoft
has been sent back to the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   I spent time with two different versions of Communicator 4.5 _
Windows 95/98/NT and one of the many variations of Unix. I did not
get a chance to review the Macintosh version.
</P>
<P>
   4,000 changes
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has made many changes _ more than 4,000, both internal
and external _ to the way the Communicator Suite works. The
Navigator browser, the Messenger e-mail/-Usenet reader and the
address book have been given overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Communicator's excellence is something called
Smart Browsing, and it's the way Web access should have been all
along. Instead of typing a full Web address into Navigator's
location field _ say, www.houstonchronicle.com _ all you need to
do, in most cases, is enter the name of the site _ in this case,
Houston Chronicle. Is that nifty, or what?
</P>
<P>
   This feature alone makes it worth adopting Communicator as your
primary Internet-access software. It's particularly good for novice
users who may be confused by some of the conventions used in
Universal Resource Locators, or URLs.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing works this way. When you enter the name of a site
instead of a URL, Navigator sends the entry to Netscape's Netcenter
Web site. The name is checked against a large database of known
sites, and you're directed to what Netcenter believes is the
correct one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every location in cyberspace is listed. When
Netcenter can't find a match, it runs the entry through its own
search engine. For example, if you enter my name, you won't go
directly to my Web site _ I guess I just don't have that much
juice! _ but you will get the results of a Netcenter search, and
the first choice is my home page.
</P>
<P>
   A companion feature to Smart Browsing is What's Related, a
button just to the right of the location field. If you visit the
Houston Chronicle's Web site and click on What's Related, you get a
list of other newspaper and news sites. Visit a site that
specializes in shareware downloads, and you'll get a list of other
like archives. If there are no matches, you get the option to
search Netcenter for similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to a very powerful combination, making
Netscape's browser a far more useful tool than Internet Explorer
for getting where you need to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two windows rolled into one
</P>
<P>
   Netscape also has made some changes in the way the Messenger
client works and looks. In Communicator 4.0, Messenger was actually
two separate pieces _ a window that showed you all your message
folders, as well as any discussion groups to which you had
subscribed, and another window with the messages themselves. This
seemed like a lot of wasted real estate, so Netscape consolidated
these two windows into one.
</P>
<P>
   In 4.5, you now have a three-paned window, similar to the design
used by Netscape's 3.0 mail client, or Microsoft's Outlook Express.
To the left are the mail folders and news groups. At the top are
the message headers and below are the message bodies. This makes it
very easy to sort mail _ just drag a header from the top pane and
drop it into a folder in the left one.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you'd rather work with a two-pane message window,
just click a button and the folder pane disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The address book is now much friendlier. It will auto-complete
e-mail addresses for you. Type the first few letters of a mail
recipient's name, and Messenger will finish it for you. If there is
more than one address under a person's name, you'll get a list that
lets you choose which to use.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Communicator 4.5 is perfect. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   It still suffers from a serious case of bloat. While it launches
a bit faster than version 4.0, Communicator still has a bigger
footprint than Internet Explorer 4.0, and thus takes longer to
load.
</P>
<P>
   And while it seems to crash less than 4.0, it still dies more
often than it should.
</P>
<P>
   However, Netscape now has added a neat feature that almost makes
a meltdown worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   When Communicator crashes, it generates a detailed log of what
happened. A dialog box pops up that lets you dispatch the log
directly to Netscape, complete with any additional notes you choose
to add. Presumably Netscape's software engineers will use these
details to make the product more stable.
</P>
<P>
   Communicator 4.5 is available in several configurations for
Windows 95/98/NT, Mac and Unix users _ sorry, no Windows 3.1
version is planned. You can get a base, complete and professional
installation. I recommend the complete installation for most users
_ the base version lacks some handy features, and the professional
version is designed for users on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hefty download, at about 14 megabytes for the Windows
version. But it's more than worth the effort.

TRAVEL WEBSITES LURE VISITORS, NOT SHOPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON   c.1998 The Arizona Republic   UNDATED -
They're the window shoppers of the online world, and they're giving
the Internet travel industry fits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you're one of them _ a traveler who checks out the online
travel agencies in search of a low fare or hotel bargain but never
clicks the ``Buy now'' button.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have too many lookers and not enough bookers,'' said
Terrell Jones, president of SABRE Interactive, creators of the
travel Web site Travelocity (www.travelocity.com).
</P>
<P>
   The big gap between browsers and buyers was driven home at a
travel industry conference in Phoenix this week.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released at the PhoCusWright Live 98 Conference found
that 80 percent of ``wired'' travelers have looked at online travel
sites but just 18 percent had booked travel online. A wired
traveler is defined as an adult American who has flown once in the
past year and visited a Web site (travel or otherwise) in the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says the travel industry has the biggest gap among online
retailers and ``that's the reason we're not profitable.''
Travelocity was one of the sponsors of the survey along with the
other major Internet travel players: MSN Expedia, Internet Travel
Network and Preview Travel. PhoCusWright, a Connecticut consulting
firm, also was a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the top reasons travelers gave for not buying online:
</P>
<P>
   - Unsafe to use credit card (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Have a travel agent (48 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Afraid of missing best price (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Use corporate travel agency (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Someone else should do the work (35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Won't save money (33 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most discouraging for online travel companies, three out
of four non-buyers say they don't have any intention of buying
travel online anytime soon. At those rates, the industry could have
a tough time racking up the $5 billion in sales projected by 2000.
The current total is about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these sobering statistics, players in the fledgling
industry spent much of the conference figuring out how to get
travelers to buy the airline ticket or vacation package from them.
It's not a matter of turning dreamers into customers. The study
found that 70 percent of the online lookers bought the trip they
were researching from a travel agent, airline or other source.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the suggestions for the fledgling industry included:
</P>
<P>
   - Ease customer fears about using the credit card on the
Internet. Jones suggested a public relations campaign, in
conjunction with credit card companies, that says using the
Internet is as safe as using the phone. Individual sites also
should continue to promote their security systems on their home
pages. Travelocity promotes its shop safe guarantee with an icon of
a lock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said it's mostly an emotional issue because there
haven't been any security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   One online travel executive says blaming the lack of bookings on
credit card fears is ``a lot of boloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is consumers don't see compelling benefits,'' said
Jay Walker, chairman of price &QL; 
line.com.
</P>
<P>
   When they see a benefit, they have no trouble providing a credit
card, he said, pointing to the $15 million in credit card offers
submitted to the site weekly.
</P>
<P>
   - Provide more incentives to book online. Many sites offer bonus
miles or other deals, but more perks are probably needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does boost traffic,'' said Simon Breakwell, group manager
of Expedia, which is part of the Microsoft family. Expedia.com has
been offering a $99 companion fare for a future flight to travelers
who buy tickets on Northwest or Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Whilden, president and chief executive officer of ITN, said
United Airlines' site (www.ual.com) has seen a big jump in business
from its offer of 20,000 frequent flier miles for travelers who
book 10 trips online between September and December.
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel plans to tailor its perks, with some designed to
lure frequent shoppers off the fence and others designed to reward
frequent buyers.
</P>
<P>
   On the airline side, Delta is reportedly considering making its
lowest fares available only through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   - Let customers put reservations on hold, preferably for more
than 24 hours. ``Instant purchase is scary,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   - Make the sites easier and speedier to use. Travelocity, for
example, will debut ``3 clicks to fly'' this month, down from the
12 clicks it takes to book a ticket now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, those in the young industry remain
upbeat. They point to many successes, not the least of which are
the last-minute airfares travel lovers flock to the Internet for
each week.

`PAIR GAIN' NO GAIN FOR MODEMS; UNISTALLER IS BEST WAY TO DELETE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have been unable to log on to my ISP with a v.90 modem at
speeds faster than 26.4K with either my laptop or desktop. But on a
recent trip to the Boston area, I was able to log on much faster
than I ever have here at home using my laptop. The other day a
telephone repairman was working on a switching unit down the
street. I stopped and asked about log-on speeds. He tells me that
in our area where we have fiber-optic cables, that the phone
company uses ``pair gain'' for economic reasons, and that may slow
my connection down. What is pair gain, and is there anything I can
do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I asked a phone company executive about pair gain, and here's
a simplified version of his fairly complex answer:
</P>
<P>
   Pair gain is basically a way of getting more home phone lines
out of a larger trunk line. It uses digital technology to split one
line into two. In theory, a trunk that could carry, say, 64 single
lines can now carry 128 using pair gain.
</P>
<P>
   Pair gain can take place at the neighborhood switch box, or on
the connection box on the side of your home. The latter happens
when you have more than one phone line coming into your house.
</P>
<P>
   When you make a connection using a modem between your house and
your Internet provider's offices, it goes through several break
points. Sometimes the signal being sent between these modems is
digital _ as when it enters a fiber-optic cable, or a digital
switch at a central office _ and sometimes it is analog. Every time
it must be converted, your connection speed will drop by about two
kilobits a second.
</P>
<P>
   A pair-gain connection on the side of your house digitally
splits one line into two. So as the signal enters your phone's
wiring, it's analog, then hits the pair-gain box outside and is
converted to digital _ that takes it down two kilobits. As it makes
its journey across town to your provider, it may be converted
several more times.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that line noise, the quality of the wiring in your home
and at your provider's offices, and you can see that your
connection speed could drop precipitously. But having pair gain in
your neighborhood is not the sole culprit _ it only drops the speed
by two kilobits.
</P>
<P>
   Upon request, if there is an adequate quantity of phone lines in
your neighborhood, Southwestern Bell will remove a pair-gain
connection from your house and replace it with two separate lines.
However, there are no guarantees. Unfortunately, in Texas, the
phone company is only required to guarantee connection speeds of
2,400 bits a second _ an antiquated standard in the Internet Age.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently installed a demo program on my Windows 98 system.
I tried the program, didn't care for it and now I want to get rid
of it. However, when I went to look in the Add/Remove Programs
list, I didn't see it. I don't own an uninstall program. How do I
remove this safely?
</P>
<P>
   A. There's no easy way to remove software without an Add/Remove
listing or an uninstaller, but there may be an uninstall module
available for that program. Check the program group for the demo to
make sure there's not an uninstall feature there. If not, use My
Computer to go into the folder where the program itself is stored
and look for an uninstall module. It may be called REMOVE or
UNWISE, or something that gives you a clue that it will erase the
program from your drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't find it, you could delete the folder and use the
Registry Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) to delete all references to it from

SYSTEM.INI and possibly AUTOEXEC.BAT files for entries related to
the program. However, this kind of surgery is not for the faint of
heart.

NETSCAPE PIONEER TO INVEST IN SMART VCR

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new technology intended to replace the
traditional home videocassette recorder is expected to get an
important vote of confidence on Monday with the announcement that a
co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp. has invested in one of
two companies developing digital television recording systems.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, who founded Netscape along with Jim Clark in
1995, will announce that he is investing in Replay Networks Inc., a
small Silicon Valley start-up company and will join its board.
</P>
<P>
   Replay Networks, based in Palo Alto, is one of two Silicon
Valley companies developing television systems that enable viewers
to watch, store and retrieve programs in novel ways, including
pausing while the programs are in progress and returning to the
point of the pause as much as 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the company will begin shipping the system, known
as ReplayTV, which will enable users to record a complete program
that is already in progress, to automatically record programs that
meet a predetermined criterion _ for example, movies featuring a
particular actor _ and to intelligently skip commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important as the bells and whistles, Replay
executives say, is that unlike most traditional VCRs, ReplayTV is
simple enough to program without resorting to a manual. The system
includes an interactive programming guide that the viewer can use
to instruct the system to record all programs related to a
particular sports team, for example, or to capture a particular
program whenever it is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that most people can relate to is never missing
their favorite show,'' said Anthony Wood, Replay's founder and
chief executive. ``People have busy lives, and it's not worth it to
program their VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Replay and Tivo Inc., based in Sunnyvale, are trying to
adapt a strategy of Internet Web portal companies like Yahoo and
Excite to television by offering viewers the ability to create
custom TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' technologies are essentially powerful computers
with large hard drives that can store seven to 40 hours of
digitized video. And both intend to license their technologies to
consumer electronics manufacturers that will produce the new VCRs
at prices below $500.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carmel Group, a consumer electronics market
research firm, the market for so-called personal TV systems will
reach $380 million and 760,000 subscribers next year.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are developing different business models, but
both are built around subscription services that require a new
generation of digital VCRs capable of delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies will transmit electronic program guides to their
subscribers via telephone connections. However Tivo plans to charge
viewers a $10 monthly fee, while Replay intends to support its
service by advertising alone.
</P>
<P>
   Replay executives also said that the two services were different
in their privacy policies. The Replay system will not collect
information on users' viewing habits; Tivo plans to monitor that
information and sell advertisers the ability to deliver their
commercials to the specific audiences they want.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer versions of both systems are expected to be available
sometime in mid-1999. However, Replay plans to begin shipping a
high-end $1,000 version of its product before the end of the year
in an effort to jump-start the market for the recorders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Replay's advertisements in home theater magazines
that attracted Andreessen's interest in the company. A high-end
video buff, Andreessen said he contacted Replay in an effort to
become a product tester of their system, which he described as
something ``I had to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Replay system made more sense to him than the
WebTV set-top box, a technology now owned by Microsoft Corp. that
connects users to the Internet through their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``ReplayTV will do for TV what the browser did for the
Internet,'' said Andreessen, who was a part of the team at the
University of Illinois that developed the technology on which
Netscape was founded. ``It's the browser for TV.''
</P>
<P>
   While WebTV tries to integrate the Internet with television,
Replay, he said, ``is an effort to enhance the TV experience first
and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit back 10 feet, and you're relaxed and you watch what
you want to watch,'' he said, noting that watching television is a
very different activity from surfing the World Wide Web on a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen declined to disclose the amount of his investment.
Several people with knowledge of the company's history said that
Replay had spent about $1 million _ an unusually low amount _ to
develop its technology since the company was founded in September
1997.

 UNDATED: start talking.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-agers who frequently send instant messages often find it
more helpful than the phone for negotiating problems with friends.
``I'm not good at confronting people,'' Sara Mulnix said. ``On the
phone, you have to worry about someone's sarcastic response to what
you're saying. When you type it out, you have unlimited space to
let it all go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Scott prefers sending instant messages to t &UR; SN &LR; ing on the
phone for similar reasons. ``People act very differently on line
than they do in real life,'' he said. ``Everyone seems a little
more thoughtful, maybe because the conversation is a little slower.
The best thing about talking on line is that you can look at what
you're saying before you send it and ask yourself, `Do I really
mean this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not all heartfelt earnestness on line, Jacob was quick
to point out. Last year, he said, he and his track teammates
engaged in ``electronic warfare'' when Reading High School lost the
finals for the first time in 27 years to nearby Woburn. ``We went
into AOL's Member Profiles, typed in ``Woburn'' and ``Track,'' and
sent harassing messages to a lot of Woburn kids. It got to be an
all-out war.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers also use chat rooms to talk to one another on line.
Hundreds of Web chat rooms oriented toward teen-agers require
little more than a screen name and a password to sign up. Susan
Herring, a linguistics professor at the University of Texas at
Arlington who recently completed a yearlong study, was surprised to
find that even though chat rooms afforded teen-agers a relatively
new medium for communication, sex roles remain extremely
traditional.
</P>
<P>
   The chats Dr. Herring surveyed inevitably moved in one of
several directions, she said. ``There was the chivalry scenario,
where a boy will rush to the protection of a girl, do battle
verbally with the other boys and then proceed to woo the girl,''
she said. ``Then there was the `belle of the ball' scenario, where
a lone girl in a chat room full of boys will play the part of queen
bee, demanding that all the boys court her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because they can't see each other in a chat room,
but you usually don't have to wait beyond four or five lines before
there's some expression of gender or sexual identity.''
</P>
<P>
   What is to be gained from all this chitchat? Dr. Herring (who
said she was not even allowed to call boys on the phone when she
was growing up), said computer chats, especially those in chat
rooms with many participants, were simply another tool for social
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest approximation would be to imagine a large social
event, such as a party, where multiple conversations are taking
place at the same time, equally audible to all participants,'' she
said. ``The Internet just creates a lot more opportunities for this
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many parents of teen-agers who spend a lot of time on AOL's
instant-message service, Susan Mulnix, Sara's mother, is a little
bewildered by her daughter's zealous keyboard conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to be on the soap opera level,'' she said. ``It's
very `he said this' and `she did that.' '' But she also said her
daughter is closer to her friends than Ms. Mulnix was with hers
growing up, partly because of the freedom that online conversation
allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're able to say things to each other that we never would
have in person,'' Ms. Mulnix said. ``Instant messages and chat
rooms are a little like riding in the car with your mother. You're
not looking at each other, so it's easier to say things you
wouldn't otherwise bring up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ms. Mulnix has concerns about how worthwhile
talking on line to friends for hours on end can possibly be. Since
the school year started, she has tried to keep Sara from going on
line until she has finished her homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's hard,'' Ms. Mulnix said, ``because unlike the
phone, I can't hear her talking.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ira Magaziner, the author of the Clinton
administration's ill-fated national health plan, who most recently
has led government efforts to foster the growth of the Internet and
electronic commerce, said Friday that he would leave the White
House before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as the administration prepares to turn
over governance of the Internet to a private, multinational
organization and heads into a period of presumably tough
negotiations with the European Union over data-privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner, a senior assistant to the president for policy
development, has led a push for industry self-regulation of how
personal data on consumers is collected and used, a stance that has
placed the United States at odds with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that he was satisfied he had completed the
main job by moving the broad issue of electronic commerce onto the
world's agenda. Although he has not set a departure date and was
not prepared to say what he would do next, Magaziner said he hoped
to wrap up his duties in the next month and move back to
Providence, R.I. His wife and children moved back there a year ago,
and he has been commuting since then.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner joined the administration five and a half years ago to
draft what turned out to be a doomed effort to create a national
health care system. Then he turned to the Internet, where he has
been aggressively trying to shape domestic and international policy
for electronic commerce and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping win passage of two federal laws imposing
a moratorium on new Internet taxes and protecting digital age
copyrights, he successfully pushed for international agreements to
keep the Internet duty-free and to set standards for international
payment systems.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Shaughnessy of the Internet Alliance, an association of
companies with Internet interests, said: ``I think it's pretty
clear to say that at a time when there was a lot of confusion about
where the industry was going both domestically and internationally,
Ira Magaziner was the guy who rolled up his sleeves and got into
the nitty-gritty of how technology works, what the effect would be
on our society, and then took those notions and began to be the
evangelist for the Internet industry in a global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, after studying the Internet for 15 months,
Magaziner released the administration's ``Framework for Electronic
Commerce,'' which called for a hands-off, market-driven approach to
Internet regulation. His philosophy then and now is that while the
Internet is growing rapidly, it could be slowed by government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has led efforts to hand administration of the
network over to private ownership and has traveled widely, pushing
other nations to endorse his tax-free, unregulated approach to the
medium.

<P>
   A friend of mine and I have been playing computer golf for so
long that we have putted on the greens of Leaderboard, an Access
Software title for the now-defunct Commodore 64 and long-retired
Apple computer.
</P>
<P>
   The greens of Leaderboard were flat (and only one color of
green). On the early versions of the mid-1980s, there were
sandtraps and water hazards, but no trees. Back then, a ``software
upgrade'' was the addition of trees along the fairway that looked
as if they'd been cut from a block of wood using crosscut saws.
Adding leaves to the trees and texture to the fairways came a
version or so later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great game, however. It was the first golf-sim title to
actually give the feeling of playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Links LS 1999 was released. It had its beginning
with Leaderboard, which has now grown into a game that became the
first and only golf game endorsed by Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition offers plenty of new features. St. Andrews is
included on the course list, along with Palmer's Bay Hill Club &AMP;
Lodge, Latrobe Country Club, and Entrada at Snow Canyon. Video
tours of the courses and nearby attractions are included on the
four-disk set. The virtual tour of Palmer's office, workshop and
trophy room at Latrobe also is included.
</P>
<P>
   Latrobe now can be played during the fall, when the leaves are
in full color. Even if you bogey every hole, the trip around the
course is enjoyable for the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than two dozen new features, including two new
swing options. In addition to the two clicks of the mouse used to
control the swing's power and straightness, a three-click option
has been added. Players can also make shots and putts by moving the
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Taking something from another golfing program, a ``tournament
environment'' adds spectators to the fairways and allows players to
select the size crowds they want, ranging from a few onlookers to a
throng rivaling Arnie's Army.
</P>
<P>
   Depth of the screens has been improved, giving more of a feel
for looking down a fairway. In addition, overhead objects have been
added, including blimps, airplanes, birds and hot-air balloons that
move across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A ``caddie book'' gives tips for shooting par on each hole. In
addition, players can now record their own comments (in .WAV files)
and add them to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Access is trying to expand golf play for the Internet, and this
addition of Links includes a real-time voice chat for Internet
play. In addition, the company has set up the LS Tour Web site
(www.LSTour.com) which has live leaderboards and free tournaments
for Internet golfers of varying skill levels.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of Links LS 1999 is it takes the
customer into consideration: There are two versions of the product.
One is for people who already have purchased Links LS 1998 and only
need to upgrade. The other is the full version of the program for
the first-time buyer. The full game sells in the $40-$50 range; the
upgrade version is available for about $25-$30.
</P>
<P>
   Cut-Up Time For Kids
</P>
<P>
   Here's a neat little idea for youngsters for a playtime
experience at the computer: Tonka's Workshop (Windows 95/98; about
$40). It's a collection of plastic workshop tools _ saw, plane,
hammer, screwdriver, drill and spray-paint can. They're housed on a
plastic case that straps to the computer's keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tool causes a key lined up beneath it to be pressed.
Kids use this no-tech interface to help Tonka Joe onscreen as he
guides them through building various projects in his workshop and
performing fix-it chores in the barn, storage shed, pickup truck,
tree house and cellar. It's designed for children ages 3 and older
and works with nearly any keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   While the projects sound complex, building them is not. A few
swipes of saw cuts a sled from a piece of board. Twist the
screwdriver a couple of times and the runners are bolted in place.
Press the spray can lever a few times and the project is complete.
</P>
<P>
   For its oversimplistic approach to the tool shed, Tonka Workshop
has drawn some reviews that imply Hasbro Interactive (the
publishers) should be taken out behind the wood shed. True, the
can't-make-a-mistake world of Tonka Joe's tool bench isn't going to
win any awards from the carpenters down at the union hall who never
had the luxury of an ``undo'' button.
</P>
<P>
   But it's for young kids, for goodness sake, who want to hammer,
pull and twist. The not-so-favorable reviews have come from the
general computing press. The reviews from organizations that cover
children's software specifically have been much more favorable.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the kids seem to enjoy the program, even if saws
never cut a crooked line or threads never strip. The old
carpenter's advice of ``measure twice, cut once,'' need not apply
in Tonka Joe's workshop.
</P>
<P>
   And to a youngster, that's just fine.

   Who Knows Jack?
</P>
<P>
   The message on the outside of the box containing HeadRush, a
trivia game for the younger generation, says the game is, in so
many words, ``not for geezers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the purchaser knows the names of the South Park
characters, along with other timely, seldom worthwhile,
information, he or she might want to consider another trivia game.
</P>
<P>
   This one (Windows/Macintosh; about $30) is from Berkeley
Software, which has a line of trivia software under the ``You Don't
Know Jack'' title. Company officials said the younger crowd was
shying away from the line, which covered ``crusty old '70s
trivia,'' in the words of one company executive.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``You Don't Know Jack'' concept was kept, but given
additional graphics and a ``coolness factor,'' a company
spokeswoman said. It also has more than 550 questions offered in a
variety of formats, and allows three players to compete with each
other or a computer opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Questions are introduced by cartoons. Sessions have a break for
the ``game show'' fictitious sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   And to appeal to the younger audience, the CD contains one audio
track from three bands recording on Mercury Records: Motorbaby, 2
Skinnee J's and Swirl 360.

JIM WRIGHT IS HAPPY `GENTEEL PERSON' IS TO BE NEW SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MAHLBURG 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Former House Speaker Jim Wright of Fort
Worth, who resigned from Congress amid an ethics investigation
pushed by Newt Gingrich, says he's ``happy for the country'' that
Louisianian Bob Livingston will succeed Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to have a more genteel person who is not
obsessed with trying to discredit and embarrass others,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday that he hopes a change in speakers will mean
more civility and tolerance and greater attention to the nation's
problems, rather than what he described as petty scandals and
constant attacks on members of the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who was visiting Cuba with U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres,
D-Calif., last week when Gingrich announced his decision to step
down, said he cannot recall his reaction to the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not weep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he sees a sense of justice in Gingrich's
departure, Wright replied: ``I'm not going to gloat over it. I'm
not someone who's interested in carrying on vendettas; I gain no
joy from anyone else's misfortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he remembers Livingston, who is expected to become
speaker when the House votes Nov. 18, as ``quiet and not flamboyant
and bombastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for the country that this fellow Bob Livingston is
not mean-spirited,'' he said. ``A number of my Democratic
colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have told me he's a man
with whom you can work and a reasonable person and not obsessed
with trying to discredit and embarrass someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright resigned as speaker in 1989 in what he called a protest
against ``mindless cannibalism'' that he said was paralyzing
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He decried personal and political attacks leveled against him
during a House investigation into allegations that he violated
congressional rules on outside income.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who led the assault on Wright, months later became one
of the top Republican leaders in the House and eventually won the
speaker's job.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he believed that his resignation as speaker would
jolt Congress into being more civilized. But he said that thought
may have been naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed that such a dramatic act would shock and shame the
Congress on both sides into restoring the civility which people
like Mr. Gingrich and others had sacrificed,'' Wright said.
``That's why I did it. That's what I expected it to achieve. But it
did not. Conditions only got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said political infighting and an emphasis on scandal,
such as President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, have
hurt Congress and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obsession for months has been over petty scandals rather
than trying to achieve objectives for the country,'' he said. ``I
think everyone has seen that in this last session of Congress.
Members have seemed more intent on discrediting someone in the
other party than \Ron\S achieving a worthwhile objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he hopes that changing speakers will turn that
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does, I will feel richly vindicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of thinking of our colleagues in the other party as
our enemies, we need to be thinking of common solutions to problems
such as education, guaranteeing everyone's right to health care and
preserving the Social Security fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he had heard rumors for months that support for
Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, was slipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the inner circle these days, but I'm not
surprised,'' he said. ``It became obvious to him that he didn't
have enough votes. It would have been somewhat humiliating, I'm
sure, to go to the well and not have the votes to stay on as
speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he always tried to follow in the mold of his mentor,
Sam Rayburn, a former House speaker and a fellow Texan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him telling us repeatedly when I was a young member
that the greatest asset of a lawmaker anywhere in the Western world
was the ability to disagree without being disagreeable,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed ethics complaints in the late 1980s that led to
the investigation that ended Wright's political career.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Gingrich became the first speaker in history to
be punished for ethics violations. Lawmakers voted to reprimand
Gingrich and assess a $300,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich acknowledged that he gave ``inaccurate, incomplete and
unreliable'' information to Congress and violated ethics rules by
failing to get legal advice before using tax-exempt charitable
donations for projects that could be considered political.

CABLE MOVIE EXPLORES AFFAIR BETWEEN GROWN MAN, TEEN-AGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sinking back onto the couch in his home, Steven
Kovacs had a confident smile on his face when asked if he courts
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco State University film professor may get his
wish after his film, ``Angel Blue,'' makes its national television
debut Sunday on Lifetime under the title ``My Neighbor's
Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sam Bottoms and Lisa Eichhorn and featuring an
appearance by Karen Black, the film is a ``Lolita''-like tale of a
married man in his 40s (Bottoms) who enters into a relationship
with the high school daughter (Yeniffer Behrens) of his good
friend. The $1.1 million film is not a satirical black comedy, as
is Vladimir Nabokov's book, nor is it a film that cautions against
such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The affair is depicted almost positively, as if condoning
liaisons where one of the partners is, legally, underage. Behrens,
who was 21 when the film was shot in 1996 but plays a teen-ager of
16 or 17, briefly appears nude in the theatrical version of the
film, which includes a literally steamy sex scene in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs even included a manifesto, ``The Intolerance of Love,''
in the press kit, in which he states, ``My aim was to present the
moral and emotional complexity of such a relationship. In this
movie the lovers are at fault, but so is society. ... But it is
also an indictment of the contradictions in our culture, at once
youth-crazed and intolerant of young love.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the sunlight, which poured through the picture windows
of his home overlooking the ocean, could make Kovacs blink when
that statement was read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uncomfortable topic,'' Kovacs admitted. ``It's not
just perverse old men who rob the cradle. These affairs happen all
of the time. Many women my age I spoke to were horrified of the
idea (as a film topic). But when I talked to them, all of them had
at least a mentor who was much older, and a number of them had
affairs with older men when they were in their late teens and early
20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I decided to stir things up a little bit and to create a
story which seems very middle class, very ordinary, yet it's
troublesome _ and especially troublesome to those who believe in
the sanctity of a home, because it really destroys a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it seems like I am advocating it, it is only because
general opinion is against it. And I think it is the duty of a
filmmaker, of the writer, to question any belief that a society
has.''
</P>
<P>
   A 52-year-old widower who is raising two daughters, Kovacs said
both his family and his students helped inspire the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because I have kids, because I teach students, so there's
always that tension there,'' Kovacs said. ``It's one of the oldest
things, relationships between professors and students. So it's all
around, so maybe I'm more aware of it than other people. I think
maybe I began to be aware of teen-agers when my older daughter
reached that age. Maybe that was the inkling for the idea. And
stories about families are important to me, because my family is
very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead character in ``Angel Blue'' is charged with statutory
rape and is fired from his job, throwing a cloud over his unashamed
love for the girl. When asked, Kovacs _ who calls American
attitudes a swinging pendulum between ``hedonistic'' and
``Puritanical'' _ said the age for statutory rape should be lowered
to about 16. Not only does it makes sense, he postulates, but it
brings America more in line with its youth fixations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the ads, and always youth is what's up on
billboards and what's on television,'' he said. ``So we have this
incredible pressure on people and people think of the attractive
sexual, healthy features as being young. Yet there seems to be a
hands-off attitude when it comes to a serious relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Warner, who is vice president for planning, scheduling and
acquisitions at Lifetime, a cable network dedicated to programming
for women, defended the presentation of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not have bought it and made judicious cuts if it was
not appropriate for Lifetime,'' Warner said by telephone from his
New York office. ``But putting movies on does not mean we take a
position of advocacy. We put movies on that cover all facets, that
really cover the gamut of women's emotions.''

IT'S A SMALL THE WORLD, DISASTER AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The three-room Honduran Consulate in San
Francisco is too small to hold all the love and grief.
</P>
<P>
   In the inner room, the Honduran consul, Ramon Andres-Torres, was
communicating with home by Internet, the only reliable way to get
through. It was his first day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Hurricane Mitch, he was late arriving. And because of
Hurricane Mitch, his job had changed. He told me his country needs
food, clothing and medicine of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle room, Allan Talbott answered unending phone calls,
in Spanish and English, from people who wanted to help survivors of
the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott told callers to drop off goods at San Francisco's
Mission Neighborhood Center, where 500-pound containers are filled
each day to send to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, trust me, I've been there,'' he told one caller.
``You're going to find a bunch of boys with big smiles on their
faces. I hope those smiles are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the outer room, there were lines of people dropping off
checks to the Honduran Relief Fund, and a few people getting
passports to return to Honduras to help their families.
</P>
<P>
   Consular attache Faril Cortez asked Luis Moya where his family
is. Moya named a village on a river near San Pedro Sula in the
north of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wiped out,'' Cortez said. ``There's nobody there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya threw his hands over his face. When he regained his
composure, he left with his friend Rocky Gonzales, and everyone
said, ``Buena suerte.'' Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Moya and I had just been talking about what we had in common. I
told him that I spent the summer after high school in Honduras
working for a mining company near Danli, in the mountains near
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   He showed me an old ID card identifying him as a mine mechanic
for a Honduran company. He said, ``Small world.''
</P>
<P>
   Small world. That's what it is. When I was an 18-year-old
working with Honduran miners, I discovered they knew all about
North Americans. After all, Americans owned most of the companies
Hondurans worked for. But the average American knew nothing about
Hondurans.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, in 1964, miners were paid a dollar a day for a
12-hour day of hand-drilling with hammers and bits, using their
teeth to crimp blasting caps onto fuses.
</P>
<P>
   On days off, my Yanqui friends and I would take horseback rides
in the mountains, where families gave us tortillas hot off griddles
and coffee brewed in cans. One tiny dirt-floored home, dozens of
miles from the nearest road, had a portrait of John F. Kennedy
looking down from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   For years thereafter I tried to find stories about Honduras in
the New York Times. The newspaper carried about one story out of
Honduras a year, except during the contra war.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that's changed, but for how long?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just talked about that,'' Cortez said. ``We're afraid
people will forget about us in a few days or weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortez was opening piles of envelopes containing checks made out
to the Honduran Relief Fund (c/o Honduran Consulate, 870 Market
St., San Francisco, CA 94102). He said the response to the disaster
in his country was astonishing, with one woman even writing a check
for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez was sending back receipts and thank-you notes in Spanish
and English. The last sentence is sweet and gracious in the
Honduran manner: ``We thank you and we hope God compensates you a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua has caused an unprecedented
outpouring of generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines that serve Central America, such as American and TACA,
have volunteered to fly donated food, clothing and medicine.
Doctors have headed to Central America, including my father's
doctor on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Churches have opened their doors for donations, and they've
poured in. The Rev. Wayne Campbell, pastor of St. Felicitas
Catholic Church in San Leandro, Calif., donated all of Sunday's
collection to Catholic Relief Services to help the people of
Central America. Parishioners gave $21,000, twice the usual Sunday
donation. One woman wrote a check for $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really heart-warming,'' said Campbell, who devoted
Sunday's homily to the devastation in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about my own struggle with last week's events,'' he
said. ``There was the election, and the vast amount of money spent
on it. There was the space flight, the meaning of which I don't
understand. Then there was this terrible thing in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have used my remote to skip over it, but it really
bothered me. I basically said how lucky we were not to be born
there.''
</P>
<P>
   These very poor, now ruined countries are not so far away. Like
the man said, small world.

IF YOU'RE GAME, YOU CAN LEARN WORKPLACE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Believe it or not, you can discuss workplace law
without either mentioning President Clinton or making it drier than
a Windex martini. You can even make a game out of it, which is what
a San Francisco company did.
</P>
<P>
   Employment Law Training Inc. has created Winning Through
Prevention, a Trivial Pursuit-type game designed to help companies
avoid being pursued in some not-so-trivial court cases. The game is
easy to tailor to a company's needs, inexpensive enough for a small
business and, best of all, it helps you understand workplace law by
using human examples, not words like ``thus'' and ``whereas.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose someone gets hurt by a violent co-worker. He might be
able to sue the co-worker and the company, of course, but who else?
The property owner? The security company? The attacker's previous
employer? Yes, yes and yes.
</P>
<P>
   The property owner and security company could be sued if they
didn't do enough to prevent a potentially dangerous situation. And
the previous employer could be sued if he knew about the violent
tendencies and still provided a positive reference.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical game, players are in small teams; ideally, each
team has members of both sexes and people with different lines of
authority. Their answers move them around the game board,
struggling to earn the title of Team Leader of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The game comes with 300 questions in 15 categories, such as
employee privacy, preventing sexual harassment and improving
performance evaluations. It normally takes a couple of hours, but
can be shortened or lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   The legal expertise comes from Littler Mendelson, a firm
specializing in employment law, which has become a booming
business. Nearly 1,500 workplace-related lawsuits or claims are
filed nationwide in a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   Because the questions are in categories, it's easy to tailor the
game to different workers. Certain categories are for everyone;
others are aimed at managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jodie applies for a job with Stop-and-Go Corp.,'' one question
says. ``As part of her pre-employment screening, may the company
require her to submit to a medical examination?
</P>
<P>
   ``A. Yes, if the examination is job-related and consistent with
business necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``B. Yes, but only if the examination is conducted during
business hours and is paid for by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. No, unless the examination is required for insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``D. Yes, but only if the examination is performed by a member
of the same sex as the employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``E. No, a pre-employment medical examination is not
permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams briefly discuss the potential answers, then decide.
Sometimes the debates get loud; after all, the title of Team Leader
of the Year is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In Jodie's case, E is the ``most correct'' answer, as the game
puts it (you can't escape lawyers completely). Because of the
Americans With Disabilities Act, pre-employment medical exams are
pretty much out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses can ask whether potential employees can perform essential
duties, and they can make job offers contingent on passing a
physical _ as long as they require the exam for all entering
applicants for a particular job, not just those who appear to be
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The game sells for $99, strategic marketing consultant Cathy
Blagden says. An optional $799 Training Edition lets up to 200
people play and has such extras as a facilitator's guide that
explains the answers more thoroughly, and discs and slides that
help the facilitator present the game to large groups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My only concern is that employers need to view the game in
context. It provides the legally correct steps to take, but
sometimes those could lead to problems.
</P>
<P>
   One question, for example, describes a company that prohibits
overtime without advance authorization. So what does it do when an
employee works overtime without authorization? The ``most correct''
answer is to pay the overtime and discipline the employee for
violating company policy. Paying the overtime is required by law,
and if you simply remind the employee that future overtime must be
approved in advance, you could set yourself up for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an employer is inconsistent if its enforcement of the
policy,'' the game warns, ``the employer may not be able to rely on
the policy to justify an employee's termination when it needs to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a boss, now you know the correct legal step. But
what if the discipline turns an enthusiastic employee into a
cynical one? What if the discipline makes it absolutely certain
that no one will ever work overtime again, even when the
circumstances call for it? Is the legal protection worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Winning Through Prevention offers all sorts of valuable lessons,
as long as you remember that common sense is still the best
teacher.

DEAVER'S `COFFIN DANCER' IS THE THRILLER OF THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you read only one thriller this year, make it Jeffery
Deaver's extraordinary ``The Coffin Dancer'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$25, 358 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Quadriplegic Lincoln Rhyme is the world's top analyst of
criminal evidence. Five years ago, two of Rhyme's assistants were
killed by a bomb planted at a crime scene by a professional hit man
known as ``The Coffin Dancer.'' The only victim who lived long
enough to give a description told of a tattoo on the killer's arm
depicting the Grim Reaper dancing with a woman in front of a
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the feds believe the Coffin Dancer is back. A congressional
aide tied to an arms deal is killed in Washington. A pilot who was
a key witness in a case against a powerful arms dealer is blown out
of the sky. Two other witnesses, the pilot's wife, Percey Clay, and
her co-pilot, Brit Hale, are put in protective custody. The New
York City police, the FBI, Rhyme and his beautiful red-headed
assistant Amelia Sachs must keep Clay and Hale alive for 45 hours
so the two can testify Monday morning against the arms dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Rhyme knows that the Coffin Dancer is the consummate planner and
will do anything to eliminate his targets _ once he cut off the
hands of a victim, skinned the hands and used the skins as gloves
at another murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Deaver has constructed a compelling page-turner that is almost
impossible to put down. The tension mounts as the clock ticks down
to Monday morning and the bodies pile up. Rhyme is brilliant in
figuring out what the Coffin Dancer will do next, but the Dancer
always seems to be just a step ahead of Rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   The plot twists are amazing, yet never out of place in this
thriller full of intriguing characters and crafty detective work.
``The Coffin Dancer'' is terrific.

</P>
<P>
   (``The Hammer of Eden.'' By Ken Follett. Crown Publishers.
$25.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Follett's latest thriller may be a little far-fetched, but it
sure is fun to read.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office has decided to build a dam, thus flooding
a valley in Northern California. Members of a small cult who live
in the valley and grow grapes decide to fight back. Led by Priest,
the Hammer of Eden calls a radio station and threatens to create a
man-made earthquake if the governor doesn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the governor's office nor the San Francisco FBI office
believes the threat, but it has to be investigated. A new
supervisor unfairly assigns FBI agent Judy Maddox to check it out.
Meanwhile, Priest and his lover go to Texas and steal a seismic
vibrator _ ``a machine designed to detect oil on a seismically
volatile fault.''
</P>
<P>
   After the cult sets off a small quake in an isolated valley,
Maddox contacts seismologist Michael Quercus, who has developed a
theory of how to locate stress points along fault lines where
earthquakes are likely to occur. Unknown to him, his estranged wife
has joined up with Priest and stolen Quercus' research to use in
selecting where to place the seismic vibrator to cause the most
damage.
</P>
<P>
   After a second quake causes massive destruction south of San
Francisco, Maddox and Quercus rush to find the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hammer of Eden'' spends too much time developing the history
of the cult, but when the action starts, the tale is driven by plot
and unique characters. Priest is one of the better villains of
recent years.

<P>
   (``The Hanging Garden.'' By Ian Rankin. St. Martin's Press.
$24.95. 333 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankin's latest Scottish police procedural featuring Detective
Inspector John Rebus is a rich probe of the dark underpinnings of
the criminal mind.
</P>
<P>
   Rebus has been assigned to investigate a suspected war criminal
responsible for wiping out a French village in World War II. But
when war breaks out between Tommy Telford's and Big Gar Cafferty's
gangs in Edinburgh, Rebus is drawn into the investigation. Telford
is into drug running, prostitution and just about anything that
brings him an illegal buck. He has close ties to Mr. Pink Eyes, a
brutal gangster who is smuggling refugees into Scotland to work as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Rebus tries to protect a young Bosnian prostitute, his
daughter is the victim of a hit-and-run-accident that Rebus is sure
Telford ordered. Now Rebus will do anything to bring Telford down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hanging Garden'' is a very dark and gritty read that never
disappoints. Rankin's character development is first rate and the
dialogue rings true. Somehow, Rankin adeptly juggles seemingly
disparate plot lines into realistic tale of war against organized
crime.

<P>
   (``As Time Goes By.'' By Michael Walsh. Warner Books. $25. 417

</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot of guts to write a sequel to ``Casablanca,'' and
author Michael Walsh almost pulls it off.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lisbon plane disappears in the distance, Rick and Louie
walk to the end of the airfield where Sam is waiting with Rick's
Buick convertible. Rick tells Sam to step on it, ``we've got to
make Port Lyautey by daybreak.'' The plan is to avoid the Gestapo
and catch a plane to Lisbon and hook up with Ilsa and Victor. Of
course on the drive to Port Lyautey, they are chased by the
Gestapo, but the Nazis are all killed in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   When Rick, Louis and Sam get to Lisbon, they discover Ilsa and
Victor have left for London. The three eventually make contact and
agree to join Victor's plan to kill Reinhard Heydrich in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks, we learn how Rick hooked up with a Jewish mobster
in New York, and why he had to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue really sounds like the movie dialogue, and you
picture the cast of ``Casablanca'' as the tale progresses. But ``As
Time Goes By'' really calls out for a less happy and less
predictable ending.

NATIONAL PARK WORK RANKS AS DANGEROUS IN OSHA SURVEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's more dangerous than being an agent for the
Drug Enforcement Administration, a federal prison guard, a Border
Patrol officer or a Postal Service employee.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it's scenic.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service employees are injured doing their jobs
more frequently than workers in just about every other federal
agency, according to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Among the least safe spots are Yosemite National Park and the
Golden Gate National Recreation Area, known for its stunning
coastal views.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service has invited OSHA to inspect 10 sites and
overhaul safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA inspectors will help the Park Service address an injury
rate that is more than twice the average for federal workers.
Yosemite's injury rate is more than six times the federal average.
The injuries cost the agency $19.5 million in worker's compensation
last year, and even more in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much snake bites, hypothermia, wildlife
attacks, avalanches or other common wilderness fears. Employees are
more often hurt performing physical work, such as lifting items, or
using equipment without taking adequate precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials admit they have not provided adequate
training to employees, many of whom are lured to the job by the
outdoor work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people get a little overly enthusiastic about their
work,'' said Elaine Sevy, a Park Service spokeswoman. ``They don't
have traditional office settings. We have a lot of people in
out-in-the-field type settings. They just need to think before they
act. If a visitor has a need, you have to just make sure you've
taken the proper precautions before you act.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite, the stunningly beautiful park in the Sierra Nevada
range of Eastern California, is on the Park Service's list of sites
with the highest number of worker injuries. In 1996, out of 509
full-time park employees, 86 had to take time off work because of
accidents or work-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have workers here who are doing a wide range of activities
that would be considered high-risk activities _ clearing roads,
trail-building, moving large boulders, removing hazardous trees,''
said Scott Gediman, park spokesman. ``It's very physical, arduous
work in a wilderness setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gediman said most injuries occur during routine situations:
rangers injuring their backs lifting too much weight, maintenance
workers suffering cuts while clearing brush, park police officers
getting hurt in auto accidents or administrative employees
developing carpal-tunnel syndrome from repetitive hand motions.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate National Recreation Area also has among the highest
employee injury rates. Of 194 full-time park workers in 1996, 20
missed work because of accidents or work-related sickness.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based park said park
officials were awaiting the OSHA inspection to help determine why
so many employees had job-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service Director Robert Stanton asked OSHA this summer to
intervene _ the first time a federal agency has ever done so,
according to OSHA officials. The regulatory body has power to
inspect federal work sites, but not to fine agencies, except for
the U.S. Postal Service, for violations.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA spokesman Michael Fluharty said inspectors would help
rewrite safety guidelines for the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's a unique set of conditions,'' Fluharty said.
``We're going to have to look at it and say we don't see these
types of things too often and come up with some innovative
approaches.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: What those old oaks whisper
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Dreamsville is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   From little acorns grow mighty oaks, and some mighty fine
memories, too. Here's a story from Tony Garrett of Mesquite, Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're afraid of bridges, you'll never make it to
Whispering Oaks in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way across Lake Tawakoni, the Two-Mile
Bridge, once considered the longest bridge in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's worth the effort. When you finally hit the east side
you'll see the small neighborhood of Whispering Oaks, where I lived
with my grandparents in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather, G.W. Roseman, drew the plans for the house he
had built there, and if there ever was a perfect lake house, rustic
but with modern conveniences, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside, the house was rough cedar and looked like a lake
house should look. Inside, the walls were knotty pine, the big
kitchen had an L-shaped bar built around it and the fireplace ran
the entire length of the living room, crowned with a gun rack from
which a variety of aging weapons dangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go back today to the little park at the far end of the
lake, memories are everywhere. This is the same park where my
grandfather and I sat in his big white Buick and talked for hours
while listening to the car radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my favorite country singer, Don Gibson, came on, he would
let me crank up the volume until the music rattled the car windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it when we would go for long drives together, never
really going anywhere, just riding around through the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother would take my sister and me swimming every day
during the summer. Afterwards, we would visit the nearby store for
a corny dog, or cross the bridge for barbecue sandwiches and ice
cold bottles of Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small, underpowered motorcycles were popular at that time, and
I acquired a Honda 90 as did some of my buddies. We'd blast around
Whispering Oaks, making too much noise and ripping through the
woods when the mood struck us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while to get up the nerve to ask Judy Morris to
go for a ride with me, and even longer to find the courage to try
to kiss her. But after burning a month's worth of gas, I felt I had
earned the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never attempt two things at once on a motorcycle. We were
riding along when suddenly I turned around and kissed her _ and in
the process, veered from the road and ran over a mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stormed off, heading home on foot and swearing she would
never ride with me again. Personally, I thought the whole
experience was the most romantic venture of my young life. Maybe
Judy did, too. Eventually, she rode with me again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Whispering Oaks is so important to me because I had so
many `firsts' there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy Morris was the first girl I ever kissed (and the last one
I ever kissed from a moving motorcycle.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove my first car there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built my first tree house in the big oak down by the lake.
When I couldn't sleep I'd sneak out of my bedroom, climb up into
the tree house and watch the moon rise over the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to swim in Lake Tawakoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore my first pair of bell bottoms to a party there in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to play the guitar there, all alone in my room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to catch a pass in Gary Jensen's yard while playing
touch football.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather taught me how to fish there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw war for the first time there, every night on the TV
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I saw death up close when my grandfather died in the house
he drew the plans for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I drove through Whispering Oaks, three things came
to mind:
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my grandfather as much now as the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't play Don Gibson on the radio much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wonder who Judy Morris is running into mailboxes with
these days.''

RUSSIA'S ARCTIC NORTH HOLDS EXTRA PERILS THIS WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ Lyubov Anastasyeva shivered and cast a
worried glance at the aging heating duct in Murmansk's Special Home
for Children. It was a tad chilly inside the orphanage she runs in
this port city 1,000 miles north of Moscow, but this was only
November.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, and three months of bitter cold and polar night, are a
few weeks away. But already Anastasyeva (pronounced
ah-naw-STAS-yeh-va) has run up debts to keep the orphanage, home to
66 infants and toddlers with birth defects or other medical
problems, heated and lit.
</P>
<P>
   And the power companies, with huge debts of their own, have
begun limiting service to deadbeats, even if they are helpless
children and their caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. With the city government that funds the
orphanage bankrupt in the wake of Russia's economic crisis,
Anastasyeva has no medicine and barely enough food to keep the
children fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be able to solve these problems, but the prices
have become too high for us,'' said Anastasyeva. ``It's humiliating
and there's a lot I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the harsh reality of winter in Russia's far north, a
remote, inhospitable place where some 12 million people live. They
are the legacy of Soviet leaders' efforts to tame the harsh tundra
and tap the region's abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet centralized economy could afford to keep towns and
cities alive in the vast Arctic. But the annual ``Northern
Deliveries'' of food, fuel, and supplies have become a luxury that
cash-strapped post-Communist Russia can ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after the August devaluation of the ruble sent the
economy into a tailspin, the burden has become too great. Shipments
of food and fuel have dropped to half their usual levels, according
to Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations. With winter near,
the waterways that supply the most remote regions are now frozen.
Costly air routes are now the only alternative. With no money to
pay for shipments, northern regions are doing without.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Yakutia region in northeastern Siberia and Chukotka
and Koryak on Russia's north Pacific coast, areas where
temperatures can plunge below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, have
imposed strict fuel rations. Residents of Sakhalin island on the
Pacific receive only a few hours of light and heat per day. On
Kamchatka peninsula, in the grasp of an early cold snap, the
average temperature inside apartments has dropped below 50 degrees
Fahrenheit. The region last week appealed to the United Nations for
``fuel aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's fleet of atomic ice-breakers used to play a critical
role in supplying many northern regions by carving paths for supply
ships from Murmansk along the country's Arctic coast. But six of
Russia's eight ice-breakers have been retired or laid up for
long-term repairs. The Murmansk Shipping Co., which operates the
two remaining ships, has no money to pay for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Russian lawmakers have called for the evacuation of over 1
million residents of the worst-hit areas. Some economists have said
for some time that the whole concept of the northern cities should
be acknowledged as a bad Soviet idea and permanently closed. But
this week, Tatyana Regent, head of Russia's Federal Migration
Service, acknowledged what anyone who has tried to move to central
Russia from the arctic has known for some time: The rest of the
crisis-hit country has no place to put them.
</P>
<P>
   Murmansk, home to 500,000 people, has fared better than most
northern cities, thanks to a rail connection with central Russia
and an ocean port that never freezes. But the city and the
surrounding Kola Penninsula is still in dire straits. In September,
Governor Yury Yevdokimov appealed to Norway, Finland, and Sweden
for food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Yevdokimov's deputy, Igor Chernyshenko, said some 50,000 to
60,000 residents earn less than half the subsistence minimum of $47
a month and require assistance. Appeals to Moscow are in vain, but
Moscow cannot even pay federal workers their salaries.

ORACLE CHIEF URGES BREAKUP OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Larry Ellison, the brash visionary of Oracle
Corp., said he believed the Justice Department should break up the
Microsoft Corp. for violating antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of did Microsoft break the law,'' Ellison
said Tuesday. ``The question is, `Why did a smart group of people
break the law over and over again?' I think the answer is the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft's monopoly in the software industry has
quashed the efforts of other high-tech companies, including Oracle,
to gain a greater share of the software market. He theorized that
the exploding use of the Internet prompted Redmond, Wash.-based
Microsoft to ``damage'' other companies that develop tools for the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chief Bill Gates ``says, `All we ask for is the
opportunity to innovate,''' Ellison said. ``But Microsoft is not an
innovator. It's one of the great copiers of the world. ... They
copied database stuff from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison made his remarks to reporters during the Oracle
OpenWorld, a four-day conference being held in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is on trial in Washington in an antitrust case brought
by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oracle OpenWorld, Ellison delivered a keynote address
that touted the virtues of Oracle 8i, the company's new Internet
software application. Ellison said creating databases on the
Internet is the future for all businesses, from the smallest to the
largest.
</P>
<P>
   He said traditional client-server software, or networks of many
PCs connected to one central computer, is becoming obsolete because
it doesn't consolidate information well enough and doesn't make the
information accessible to every worker in a company.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ellison said: ``Internet computing uses standard
browsers and everyone in a company can use the network. ... Imagine
you're a doctor. Do you want to buy a server and teach your
receptionist how to use it when you can go to the Web and use an
accounting program for free for six months?''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison also said Internet computing helps companies
dramatically reduce their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his criticism of Gates and Microsoft, Ellison said he
wouldn't mind having the company's market dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the day Oracle is so dominant we have a
monopoly and are regulated by the government,'' he said.

A QUIET CHINA ARMY SOOTHES HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Even before China regained sovereignty over this
former British colony 16 months ago, authorities began to remove
the face of Queen Elizabeth II from stamps, redesign the flag and
repaint royal-crested mailboxes. Yet today, one of the most obvious
signs of British rule remains. Emblazoned in huge letters on the
local headquarters of China's People's Liberation Army is a
strikingly inappropriate name: the Prince of Wales Building.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1997 handover, pundits predicted that China would rip
the letters from the harborside tower as soon as People's
Liberation Army troops arrived. The troops are here, but the name
remains on the barracks. China's decision to leave it there seems a
deliberate move to remain as discreet as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Here in Hong Kong, where one in six people
marched to protest the 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters
around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, distrust of the Chinese soldiers
ran deep. Half of Hong Kong's residents are refugees from China or
descendants of refugees, and many worried that the new government
might use troops to curtail their liberties.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, doomsayers' predictions have fallen flat. Far from
cracking down on demonstrators, the People's Liberation Army has
become all but invisible here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been told to lie low, stay in their barracks, not to
mingle with the public, and for this they were rewarded with medals
and citations when Jiang Zemin visited on the anniversary of the
handover,'' said Willy Lam, China editor of the daily South China
Morning Post. ``They were rewarded for doing nothing, for staying
out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the People's Liberation Army image problem, China has
kept its armed forces so low-profile that some Hong Kong residents
now want to see more of them.
</P>
<P>
   The growing, if guarded, trust in the soldiers here reflects the
growth of Hong Kong's confidence in China's promise to let the
capitalist enclave maintain civil liberties that are unavailable on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, military analysts warn that if massive social
unrest were to grip Hong Kong, something hard to imagine under
current conditions, the People's Liberation Army would undoubtedly
act in the event that Hong Kong's 27,500 police officers could not
handle the situation, or if they refused to move against the local
people.
</P>
<P>
   The primary role of the estimated 4,700 troops here and 5,300
across the Chinese border ``is to create a degree of good will or
trust to convince Hong Kong that they have nothing to fear from the
handover, that being part of China is not going to impinge on their
lives,'' said Ronald Montaperto, a Chinese security specialist at
National Defense University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that mission appears to have succeeded. A survey by
Chinese University of Hong Kong found that the percentage of people
satisfied with the People's Liberation Army has risen from 30
percent in July 1997 to more than 50 percent this past June.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Leo Tang, a 17-year-old student who visited
the naval barracks recently. ``We all know of Tiananmen Square, so
I wondered if they would act the same way here if there were
protests,'' Tang said. ``But it seems China has gone out of its way
to choose a special group of soldiers here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll by the University of Hong Kong, as approval
of the People's Liberation Army grew, satisfaction with the Hong
Kong police has dropped, from 79 percent a year ago to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the few occasions when demonstrators have denounced China or
rallied for banned causes such as independence for Taiwan, it has
been the police who have drowned out slogans with loud music or
hauled protesters to the station.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, soldiers have been restricted to barracks except
for rare field trips in civilian clothes. Ironically, their absence
from bars and restaurants that depended on the patronage of British
troops has aroused complaints from pub owners who a year ago
worried that Chinese troops might intimidate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even official business has been kept almost comically
low-profile. When the US Navy invited top Chinese officers onboard
the visiting USS Blue Ridge, the Chinese were concerned about
boarding the ship because they would have to walk through a busy
shopping mall. To avoid alarming civilians by marching through a
public area in uniform, the Chinese asked US officials to devise a
route to enter as unobtrusively as possible _ via a parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   According to law, the People's Liberation Army can assist
authorities in a crisis _ a natural disaster or unrest _ but only
if requested by Hong Kong's Chief Executive and approved by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine social unrest extreme enough to
destabilize Hong Kong. But Tai Ming Cheung, a People's Liberation
Army specialist, cautioned, ``If you asked me in 1988 if they'd
have any reason to intervene on the mainland, I would have said no.
But in 1989, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, controversies involving the army here have been
small-scale: a dispute over customs checks, a few traffic
accidents, and a misunderstanding over nighttime firing practice in
villages in rural Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Liberation Army remains secretive, however. It set
up a telephone line for the media that goes unanswered, and it
ignores interview requests. Democratic politicians say that the
army should be more open and have more contact with society because
soldiers who befriend locals would hesitate to act against them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet mixing with locals would be difficult on a soldier's salary
of $66 a month. That is hardly enough for dinner for two in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   So contact has been limited to posing with locals for pictures.
The most startling exception occurred during a bizarre Open House
at the barracks on National Day, Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of curious locals stood in line for hours to get
tickets, and the atmosphere resembled a family picnic more than a
military tour. Parents pressed babies up for photos with soldiers.
Officers sang, danced, showed how they make beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this ... they seemed so severe and fierce. Now I'm
changing my opinion. They're quite friendly, singing and dancing,''
said Kwok Yuk-may, a 43-year-old housewife who joined in karaoke
with soldiers. ``Why should we be afraid of them? We're all
Chinese.''

IF YOU'RE GAME, YOU CAN LEARN WORKPLACE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Believe it or not, you can discuss workplace law
without either mentioning President Clinton or making it drier than
a Windex martini. You can even make a game out of it, which is what
a San Francisco company did.
</P>
<P>
   Employment Law Training Inc. has created Winning Through
Prevention, a Trivial Pursuit-type game designed to help companies
avoid being pursued in some not-so-trivial court cases. The game is
easy to tailor to a company's needs, inexpensive enough for a small
business and, best of all, it helps you understand workplace law by
using human examples, not words like ``thus'' and ``whereas.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose someone gets hurt by a violent co-worker. He might be
able to sue the co-worker and the company, of course, but who else?
The property owner? The security company? The attacker's previous
employer? Yes, yes and yes.
</P>
<P>
   The property owner and security company could be sued if they
didn't do enough to prevent a potentially dangerous situation. And
the previous employer could be sued if he knew about the violent
tendencies and still provided a positive reference.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical game, players are in small teams; ideally, each
team has members of both sexes and people with different lines of
authority. Their answers move them around the game board,
struggling to earn the title of Team Leader of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The game comes with 300 questions in 15 categories, such as
employee privacy, preventing sexual harassment and improving
performance evaluations. It normally takes a couple of hours, but
can be shortened or lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   The legal expertise comes from Littler Mendelson, a firm
specializing in employment law, which has become a booming
business. Nearly 1,500 workplace-related lawsuits or claims are
filed nationwide in a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   Because the questions are in categories, it's easy to tailor the
game to different workers. Certain categories are for everyone;
others are aimed at managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jodie applies for a job with Stop-and-Go Corp.,'' one question
says. ``As part of her pre-employment screening, may the company
require her to submit to a medical examination?
</P>
<P>
   ``A. Yes, if the examination is job-related and consistent with
business necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``B. Yes, but only if the examination is conducted during
business hours and is paid for by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``C. No, unless the examination is required for insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``D. Yes, but only if the examination is performed by a member
of the same sex as the employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``E. No, a pre-employment medical examination is not
permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams briefly discuss the potential answers, then decide.
Sometimes the debates get loud; after all, the title of Team Leader
of the Year is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In Jodie's case, E is the ``most correct'' answer, as the game
puts it (you can't escape lawyers completely). Because of the
Americans With Disabilities Act, pre-employment medical exams are
pretty much out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses can ask whether potential employees can perform essential
duties, and they can make job offers contingent on passing a
physical _ as long as they require the exam for all entering
applicants for a particular job, not just those who appear to be
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The game sells for $99, strategic marketing consultant Cathy
Blagden says. An optional $799 Training Edition lets up to 200
people play and has such extras as a facilitator's guide that
explains the answers more thoroughly, and discs and slides that
help the facilitator present the game to large groups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My only concern is that employers need to view the game in
context. It provides the legally correct steps to take, but
sometimes those could lead to problems.
</P>
<P>
   One question, for example, describes a company that prohibits
overtime without advance authorization. So what does it do when an
employee works overtime without authorization? The ``most correct''
answer is to pay the overtime and discipline the employee for
violating company policy. Paying the overtime is required by law,
and if you simply remind the employee that future overtime must be
approved in advance, you could set yourself up for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an employer is inconsistent if its enforcement of the
policy,'' the game warns, ``the employer may not be able to rely on
the policy to justify an employee's termination when it needs to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a boss, now you know the correct legal step. But
what if the discipline turns an enthusiastic employee into a
cynical one? What if the discipline makes it absolutely certain
that no one will ever work overtime again, even when the
circumstances call for it? Is the legal protection worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Winning Through Prevention offers all sorts of valuable lessons,
as long as you remember that common sense is still the best
teacher.

LIVINGSTON SEEN AS `A MAN OF PROCESS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He opposes abortion, supports anti-union
legislation, and wrote the ``three strikes'' bill to jail repeated
felons. He is a military hawk who crusades for a Star Wars-style
missile-defense system. He wants lower taxes and a smaller
government.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who appears
to have sewn up the race to succeed House Speaker Newt Gingrich, is
not considered a leading conservative by many lobbying groups on
the political right.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is conservative but not dogmatic. Where Gingrich is
a self-described revolutionary, whose bows to the most conservative
members sometimes tied the House in knots, Livingston is seen as a
man who will not let his deeply held beliefs override the orderly
process of governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man of process and believes that the procedures of the
House are to be richly observed,'' said Representative Joseph
McDade, a Pennsylvania Republican who serves on the House
Appropriations Committee that Livingston chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is as conservative as Gingrich is,'' said Representative J.
Joseph Moakley, the South Boston Democrat. ``The difference is not
on substance. We're talking about style here.'' While Gingrich saw
many bills vetoed by the White House, ``Bob knows that to get a
bill through, he's got to make some concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, such socially conservative groups as the
Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council say they like
Livingston's ideals, but they wish he pushed the issues harder. A
leading group of fiscal conservatives, the National Taxpayers
Union, also urges Livingston to work harder for tax and spending
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would view a Speaker Livingston as a flag-carrier who would
need plenty of reinforcement from the rear,'' said Pete Sepp of the
taxpayers' group.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Robert Linlithgow Livingston, 55, would be second in
line to the presidency, after only the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He is a former New Orleans lawyer and former federal prosecutor.
For four years, he has played a central role in Congress as
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which controls more
than one-third of the $1.7 trillion federal budget. It is a role
that has forced him to navigate conflicting currents within the
House, from budget-cutting conservatives to influential Democrats.
Both are often needed to build a winning bloc of votes for
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say he handled the task with good cheer. When first
given the chairmanship in 1995 by Gingrich, who had passed over
three more-senior committee members, Livingston brought an
alligator-skinning knife to meetings to show his commitment to
budget cutting. He is known for leading meetings while standing up,
his lanky 6-foot-4-inch frame showing he is firmly in control of
the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost to say, `I'm here. I'm in charge. If you've got
a problem, bring it to me,' '' said Hunter Ridgway, chief of staff
to Representative John Olver, the Amherst Democrat on the
Appropriations Committee. ``He shows a good combination of
authority and diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Livingston has helped host ceremonies for the
Silvio Conte Joy of Politics Award, named after the former
Massachusetts congressmen and given to people who practice a
gracious style of politics.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 dinner, Livingston presented history buff and former
Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield with an ``original'' letter to Ulysses
S. Grant by Abraham Lincoln _ then made a show of ``accidentally''
spilling his drink on the document. Hatfield was horrified, until
it dawned on him that Livingston played a prank.
</P>
<P>
   In recent comments on the possible impeachment of President
Clinton, Livingston said that lawmakers need to weigh the public's
apparent opposition to impeachment in deciding how to proceed. He
appeared to be more conciliatory than Gingrich, who has insisted
that Congress not be swayed by public opinion in the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But on other matters, Livingston has sided with Gingrich. ``I
can't think of a single issue on which they disagreed,'' said Ralph
Helman, lead House lobbyist for the National Federation of
Independent Business, a small-business group.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston earned a perfect 100 percent on the last Christian
Coalition scorecard, meaning he sided with the group on all major
issues. He co-sponsored bills to ban ``partial birth'' abortions
and to make English the official language of the United States. He
signed onto a plan to abolish the tax code by the year 2000, which
might force Congress to replace it with something better.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also authored the ``three strikes'' bill that
requires life sentences for defendants in federal cases convicted
of a third violent felony. He backs the right of workers to opt out
of union membership at unionized workplaces, a measure strongly
opposed by organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful friend of the oil and shipbuilding industries in his
home state of Louisiana, Livingston also claims credit for steep
budget cuts over the past few years. He wants to eliminate
inheritance taxes and close the Commerce and Energy Departments,
positions that win him praise from fiscal conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the National Taxpayers Union faults Livingston, as well
as Gingrich, for failing to enact those longstanding proposals into
law. ``That's been the problem for three years now. We've got lots
of great legislation, but there's not enough follow-through,'' said
Sepp of the taxpayer group.

WASHINGTON'S DUNN SEEKS POST OF HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jennifer B. Dunn is making a run for history.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a unifier and facilitator, the representative from
Washington state wants to be the first female House majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's timing is excellent. Known as the party's point person on
women's issues, she has cultivated a moderate image without losing
her conservative credentials and is well positioned to take
advantage of the disarray in the Republican leadership following
Newt Gingrich's resignation as speaker last week.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her bid for majority leader, Dunn is challenging
two white males who are buttoned-up, bare-knuckled conservatives.
The congresswoman is regarded as neither visionary nor brilliant as
a strategist, but her colleagues say she is a ferocious
sweet-talker with impeccable political instincts, and a knack for
striking deals and smoothing feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Such qualities are in such short supply in the fractious world
of congressional politics that political observers said Dunn may be
the antidote to a party on the verge of ``cannibalizing itself,''
as Gingrich put it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is the latest member to challenge the majority leader, Dick
Armey of Texas, who has been criticized by some as having
lackluster leadership skills. Still, Armey has the support of many
of his colleagues and his office said he is close to getting the
votes he needs to maintain his leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a football Hall of
Famer, entered the race Friday afternoon, hours before Gingrich
announced his resignation and threw open the leadership races.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Foreman, chairman of Washington State Republican Party,
said of Dunn: ``She's just right for the job. She's a woman. She's
smart. And she's experienced in dealing with rancorous internal
party debates and still presenting a positive vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In her role as state party chairman for 11 years, Dunn
successfully fought off repeated attempts to unseat her as state
Republicans debated gay rights, abortion rights, and other
hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miraculously, she was able to keep both her job and both sides
talking, exactly the qualities she'll need as majority leader,''
Foreman added.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican, said Dunn's
political skills helped distinguish her with Republican leaders
during her first term. By her third term, she was vice chairman of
the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn rode the ``Year of the Woman'' wave into Congress in 1992.
However, the single mother of two boys _ one named Reagan, after
the former president _ lost support of liberal and moderate women's
groups with a series of unpopular votes, including one against the
Family and Medical Leave Act, which guaranteed time off from work
for new parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer Dunn is a very articulate, sensible member with a
real opportunity to be the next majority leader,'' said
Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, a moderate who has
not yet committed to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, however, has not fooled Republican moderates into
believing she will be their ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be clear: None of the moderates consider Dunn a
moderate,'' said a congressional staff member who asked not to be
named. ``The reason they'd be inclined to support her is because
she is a woman and she's vaguely pro-choice. And Largent is to the
right of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is considered to be generally in favor of abortion rights,
but she voted against funding for international family planning
efforts that included abortion, and for efforts to ban
``partial-birth'' abortions as well as RU-486, the so-called
abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   Groups, including Republicans for Choice, are thrilled at the
prospect of seeing Dunn rise in the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that the Republican Party has finally
evolved to a point that they have competent women who can run on
the basis of their competence and not their sex,'' noted Barbara
Ledeen, executive director of the Women's Independent Forum, a
conservative women's Washington think tank.

DEFORESTATION WORSENED MITCH'S TOLL, FORESTERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Just about everyone agrees that
Hurricane Mitch was the worst natural disaster in Central America
in decades. But now scientists are arguing that humans made the
devastation even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Clear-cutting logging, hillside farms and rampant housing
developments exacerbated mudslides and floods, the experts say. The
damage was most extreme in Honduras, where loggers and farmers have
stripped away about 225,000 acres of forests every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurricane was a natural disaster but it was worsened by
the action of man's deforestation,'' said Dr. Carlos Medina, a
physician and biologist who served as the country's first
environmental minister from 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists fear that the desperate need to provide jobs
and housing for hundreds of thousands of displaced people may
prompt Central Americans to and chop down more of their forests and
build on precarious hillsides and riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, which left bilions of dollars of destruction, at one
point was a ``Category 5'' hurricane, the fiercest known. Medina
and others agree that even if forests had been intact, Honduras and
neighboring countries would not have been protected from surging
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers for the Peace Corps, which has sent dozens of
conservation experts to Honduras in the last few years, reported
that clear-cut areas were devastated by mud and avalanches. Reports
from farmers to the California-based Sustainable Harvest Coffee Co.
indicate that Mitch barely had an impact on small, experimental
``shade-grown'' plantations that mix coffee with traditional trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, a lot of places where they had clear-cut,
the soil structure collapsed and the plants have literally slipped
down the slope,'' said Dave Griswold, founder of the importing
company.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter flight over central Honduras last week showed that
heavily forested areas were relatively unscathed. But regions where
trees had been plundered and (itals)colonias(unitals), or slums,
had sprouted on hills were denuded. Even the houses had tumbled
into rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those mudslides could have been avoided if people had
not built colonias there,'' said Patricia Panting, executive
director or Pro-Lena, a non-governmental group in Tegucigalpa that
tries to preserve forests. Bruce Cabarle, director of global forest
programs for the World Wildlife Fund, called the settlements
``disasters waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the plundering of Central America's
forests has been staggering in recent years. In mountaineous
Honduras, the thin topsoil quickly washes away in a regular rainy
season _ and Mitch dumped a year's worht of rain on Honduras in
less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization in 1990
found that 41 percent of Honduras was forested in 1990. Only five
years later, the FAO said that 35 percent of the country was
forested, and environmental groups say those figures are overly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   In a report prepared before Mitch and released last week, the
Central American Commission on Environment and Development
suggested deforestation was imperiling prosperity. The report had
been compiled before the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if you cut down forests on hillsides, you increase
the vulnerability to sliding _ that's been demonstrated all over
the world,'' said Edward A. Parson, an associate professor who
specializes in international environmental policy at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations Foundation, set up by Ted Turner, experts
said that Mitch was reminiscent of floods in China and Bangladesh
this year. Blaming clear-cutting, along with other factors, China
laid off tens of thousands of loggers. Bangladesh conceded that
ruinous environmental practices had worsened the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are some ecological underpinnings to many of
these natural disasters,'' said Ian Bowles, a vice president of
another group, Conservatation International.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Washington Tuesday, James Lee Witt, director of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the United States,
too, must curb construction projects in flood-prone areas. ``We
need to protect or flood plains, our wetlands that act in nature as
sponges ... and not fill them in for redevelopment or
development,'' Witt said. ``The truth is we can prevent people from
becoming disaster victims and protect our environment at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In many developing countries, including Honduras, those who
speak out against clear-cutting risk their lives. Just a few weeks
ago, in the small town of Catacomas, a self-taught
environmentalist, Carlos Luna, was gunned down in front of his
family, according to colleagues from Honduras and the United
States. Luna had decried logging in what is supposed to be a
pristine ecological ``buffer zone'' in the mountains outside of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies, some with ties to former Honduran army
officers, are behind the logging, environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
   At the US State Department, a new office coordinates efforts to
preserve the environment in developing countries. But a State
Department officials say they have not spoken with Central American
leaders about what appears to be mankind's complicity with
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate thing to raise at the moment,'' one US
official said. ``You want to focus on assisting the victims, not
blaming them for deforestation.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from detecting a new attitude in Central America,
development workers say that they hear of plans for more clear
cutting. Lumber sales will give villages quick infusions of cash
and newly-opened fields will offer fresh topsoil for planting corn
and beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that to recover from this catastrophe, they
will probably deforest Honduras even more,'' said Helen Mills, a
Peace Corps volunteer from Riverside, Calif.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The soft punch of a stapler and the buzz of climate
control were the only muted sounds emanating from the office of
Boston's Haitian Consulate, tucked away at the end of a hall in an
office building in Copley Square.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the recently appointed consul general, Andrine Constant,
was quietly trying to solve a problem: how to arrange to ship the
tons of clothes, food, and other donations that had flooded her
office and other agencies in response to devastation left by
Hurricane Georges &UR;  &LR; in September.
</P>
<P>
   As Constant's voice melded with the hum of multiple phone lines
and the polite greetings from the lobby, there was no trace of the
chaos that ushered in the last consul, or the clashes that defined
a place Haitians here once viewed as the spying outpost of a brutal
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, scores of angry Haitians led a demonstration to the
doorstep of the consulate, shaking high fists and crying for the
overthrow of longtime Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. Days
later, after Duvalier fled in exile, Haitians stormed the office,
destroying furniture, burning flags, and demanding to install local
activist Jean Geneus as consul and eject the man who had been
Duvalier's representative in Boston for years, Wesner Chamoine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a decade after the unrest, Constant said her
mission is to continue and expand on the changes begun by Geneus,
who saw the diplomatic post through the turmoil and created a
consulate for Haitians to use, not fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to build an office that is honest and really serves
people, not one that does business like Haiti, where you have to
bribe someone to get anything done,'' said Constant, 32, who served
as vice consul under Geneus for four years. ``I want to be a
catalyst for helping to get people to come together, and ... also
be looking to the larger diplomatic community and all friends of
Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   The first woman to run the New England-based consulate since it
was established in the early 1980s, Constant is a trained physician
and a single mother to 6-year-old daughter Anais; the two live in
suburban Malden. Constant spent her own childhood in the small
southern coastal town of Les Cayes, the oldest of three siblings
and the daughter of teachers who she said taught her the meaning of
discipline and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Since her appointment last month, an onslaught of demands has
kept Constant focused on the immediate, pressing needs of Haitians
at home and in Massachusetts, which has the third-largest
population of Haitians in the United States. Besides working on
hurricane relief, she helped coordinate protests after a stinging
joke about Haitians and AIDS in the Hollywood movie ``How Stella
Got Her Groove Back'' erupted into controversy and demonstrations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the consulate she imagines is one that ultimately promotes
Haitian art, encourages Haitian business owners to expand, and
looks at the complex, internal problems that have stifled Haiti's
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Haitians need to take responsibility for our future and
for what we do. We have to be able to build institutions and have
professionals who are willing to play by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant fled Haiti in 1994, as then-president Jean-Bertrand
Aristide remained in exile after he was overthrown in a 1991 coup.
After 28 years living in her homeland _ the last six of those years
studying in medical school and working as a women's activist _ she
abandoned her childhood dream to practice medicine in her own
country and joined relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never planned to come and live here,'' Constant said. ``When
the coup happened, I thought it was going to last maybe days. I was
always expecting things were going to get back to normal. But they
never did.''

 BOSTON: ... the mid-1980s.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A personable and witty guy who insists that all those famous
names he frequently drops (``there was that Wyoming barbeque with
Ron and Nancy'') are really just references to hard-earned
meetings, Kobrick spends less time watching stock prices than a
casual observer might expect. ``It's an input, not an end,'' he
says. ``Research and thinking are our calling cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he adds, ``it's a green day,'' meaning that more of
the 100 stocks he owns are going up than down. ``If it were a red
day, I'd have to find out if it was the market or me.''
</P>
<P>
   In their brief lifetime, Kobrick's funds have done well. The $41
million Kobrick Cendant Capital fund is up 20.5 percent for the
year through Nov. 4, compared with the average mid-capitalization
fund's 1.9 percent loss. Over the same period, the $38 million
Kobrick Cendant Emerging Growth gained 11.2 percent, head &UR;  &LR; and
shoulders above the average small-capitalization fund's 10.3
percent loss, according to Morningstar Inc., a fund tracking firm.
In a new era of spectacular failures by high-risk money ventures,
Kobrick's $100 million hedge fund _ a private fund for wealthy
investors _ returned 25 percent over the first 10 months of this
year. And the hedge fund, unlike his mutual funds, even owns
battered Cendant stock.
</P>
<P>
   A growth fund he launched in September is too young to have
meaningful returns.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick needs at least one year's strong performance to ratchet
up marketing of his funds and grow his business, which lends a
do-or-die quality to his stock-picking skills this year. At stake
is a market in which the nation's top 20 asset management firms,
which include giants like Fidelity Investments, control only half
of the $4.9 trillion mutual fund industry. Indeed, a recent Goldman
Sachs study found that smaller money managers are increasing their
market share. Other prominent Boston portfolio managers who
recently left big companies to set up their own operations include
Warren Isabelle, formerly of Pioneer Group Inc. and Keystone
Investments, and ex-Fidelity staffer Larry Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   But with freedom come greater risks. ``If you see big returns at
a fund in the first year, the fund probably didn't get there in a
conservative fashion,'' says Russell J. Kinnel, equity fund editor
at Morningstar. ``The smaller guys have the biggest incentives to
take risks to go for the bigger returns.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By noon, Kobrick, his partner, portfolio manager Michael Carmen,
and his stock analyst, Todd Brooks, are wolfing sandwiches hauled
in by a Robertson Stephens marketing executive. Kobrick, who wants
to know more about the investment bank's research and what his
visitor's &UR;  &LR; top five stocks are, pencils ``Direct Hit _ new co.'' in
the margins of his notebook. The talk ranges from whether retailer
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch Co., a stock Kobrick owns, can remain hot, to
technology companies the Robertson Stephens executive says fib
about growth rates. As Kobrick vows to poll his fashion-conscious
21-year-old daughter on Abercrombie, his visitor moves to find out
what stocks he likes and how the relationship with Cendant has
gone. ``It has not been what I expected,'' he says later of his
venture with the troubled company. ``They rained on my parade.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1:45, Kobrick has checked the markets (the Dow is up about 90
points and hovering around 8460), winced at a stack of unanswered
phone message slips, pow-wowed via phone with a New York hedge fund
executive whose name he doesn't want mentioned, caught a taped CNBC
interview with auto retailing mogul H. Wayne Huizenga (``I'm so
glad I own this stock,'' Kobrick says), tinkered with a draft of
his ``Seven Points of Investing'' brochure, which posits that
inside every American is a secret investor just crying to come out,
and scribbled in his notebook a hiking itinerary through Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   The blue notebook _ wirebound and filled with cramped writing
from the dozens of conversations he has each day _ has the
intensity of a manic poet's journal. It goes everywhere he goes.
``Got years of this stuff,'' Kobrick says. ``Scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At 2:10 p.m., a Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette economist arrives
to explain where it's all heading. Kobrick, tempted by the John
Glenn space launch, invites him into the trading room to watch. By
4:15, after the market has closed, Kobrick scans headlines on his
stocks, then circles the wagons with Carmen and Brooks. Carmen, who
has possibly the world's most ragged fingernails, is edgy, and
debates whether sunglasses maker Oakley Inc., a stock in Kobrick's
portfolio, can get away with peddling a $1,500 watch in a newly
cost-conscious climate.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Most money managers are vigilant with their stocks, but those
running new funds have extra cause to be on edge. ``There is a
danger in reading too much into a strong start,'' Kinnel says,
pointing out that smaller sums are generally easier to manage than
large ones. ``A lot start strong and fade fast.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick then decides to review his financial stocks. In October,
when shares in banks, brokerages, and insurers got spanked, Kobrick
went shopping, snapping up more Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., among others, and nearly tripling the sector
to 24 percent of his portfolio. He cut his retail stocks _ Home
Depot Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, and golf
apparel maker Cutter &AMP; Buck Inc. are his top picks _ in half, to 16
percent. Technology stocks, including Lycos and other Internet
outfits, are still a quarter of his holdings.
</P>
<P>
   That night, driving to home to Sudbury after a drink with
colleagues at the tony Meridien Hotel, Kobrick decides to sell 7
percent of his portfolio to raise cash to buy more semiconductor
and computer equipment stocks. Having toyed with the idea for
weeks, he decides the market has risen enough to take a tidy
profit. If financial stocks fall again, he'll buy more of those,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely sleep less these days,'' he says of the market's
volatility, which he only sees continuing. ``But we laugh a lot
here. Executives with no sense of humor are probably going to make
bad decisions because of stress, which makes me more cautious about
investing in their companies.''

CALIFORNIA VOTERS NIX THE `GORILLA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California's politicians wanted to throw
around the state's weight in national politics, moving its
presidential primary from June to March, right after New
Hampshire's. But the state's voters last week refused to exempt the
presidential contest from the state's open-primary law.
</P>
<P>
   Two cliches thus collide in a hideously mixed metaphor: The
``800-pound gorilla of American politics'' has stumbled unprepared
into a ``beauty contest.'' King Kong's lip gloss is askew. Mighty
Joe Young is having a bad eye-shadow day.
</P>
<P>
   Can California cosmeticize its way out of this mess? The
electorate voted no by a 54-46 percent margin, dooming California's
plan to become the champion chimpanzee of the quadrennial circus.
The election returns suggest that a 1999 ballot question may
encounter similar hostility, skepticism, and mischief.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed law, the Save the Presidential Primary Act of 1998,
appeared as Question 3 among 11 statewide referendums. Democratic
and Republican politicians endorsed it, as did most of the state's
news-papers, everyone but the voters. Californians chose to save
their ``open primary,'' which they approved by referendum in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This law allows voters to zig-zag though the ballot, helping
nominate a Democrat for governor, a Republican for lieutenant
governor, a Peace and Freedom Party nominee for attorney general, a
Natural Law Party choice for insurance commissioner, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of California fun, say the Democratic and Republican
national committees, but we want only our own partisans to choose
the delegates who nominate a presidential candidate. Any contest in
March 2000, they say, will be a nonbinding ``beauty contest'' for
would-be presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Californians, seeking openness in a closed process, have
encountered the Law of Unintended Consequences, a Godzilla who
snacks on civic virtue, having devoured successive ``reforms'' in
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But do they care? Nominating presidents is important to many,
but in the nation's largest state, it is a civic afterthought.
Finance reports detail how $188 million was spent on November's
ballot questions. Electric utility interests spent $41 million, the
forces for and against Indian casinos shelled out $91 million, and
those opposed to horsemeat spent $1.2 million. Question 3 was
totally unfunded.
</P>
<P>
   In September, when Governor Pete Wilson signed legislation for
an early presidential primary, Secretary of State Bill Jones basked
in its glory. ``My job is to boost turnout, and this will help do
it,'' the Fresno farmer-businessman said. Last week, Jones survived
a Democratic tidal wave, winning reelection against a 30-year-old
Democrat, Michela Alioto, by 50,000 votes among 8 million cast.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will attend a Washington meeting this month of other state
election officials, a committee chaired by William Galvin,
secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who's ``delighted
that the question lost. This recuts the cake and helps us find
another way to change a presidential primary process that has
served the country pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin has been pushing for a New England regional primary on
March 7 for which California's presence would mean ``a disaster''
that ``would create a de facto national primary.'' Galvin says,
``The big-bang theory of primaries is favored by people like Al
Gore and George W. Bush, but if you're Bob Kerrey or Bill Bradley
or John Ashcroft, how do you run with limited resources?''
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries of state hope to find some way to rotate
regional primaries so every time zone has a chance to shine after
New Hampshire. Before the voters spoke, Bill Jones said in
September: ``There's been a lot of talk about rotating regional
primaries, but now California's is a fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones now avoids the cliche du jour, but Galvin doesn't: ``The
800-pound gorilla has died. We now have an 800-pound carcass to
dispose of.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The soft punch of a stapler and the buzz of climate
control were the only muted sounds emanating from the office of
Boston's Haitian Consulate, tucked away at the end of a hall in an
office building in Copley Square.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the recently appointed consul general, Andrine Constant,
was quietly trying to solve a problem: how to arrange to ship the
tons of clothes, food, and other donations that had flooded her
office and other agencies in response to devastation left by
Hurricane Georges &UR;  &LR; in September.
</P>
<P>
   As Constant's voice melded with the hum of multiple phone lines
and the polite greetings from the lobby, there was no trace of the
chaos that ushered in the last consul, or the clashes that defined
a place Haitians here once viewed as the spying outpost of a brutal
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, scores of angry Haitians led a demonstration to the
doorstep of the consulate, shaking high fists and crying for the
overthrow of longtime Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. Days
later, after Duvalier fled in exile, Haitians stormed the office,
destroying furniture, burning flags, and demanding to install local
activist Jean Geneus as consul and eject the man who had been
Duvalier's representative in Boston for years, Wesner Chamoine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a decade after the unrest, Constant said her
mission is to continue and expand on the changes begun by Geneus,
who saw the diplomatic post through the turmoil and created a
consulate for Haitians to use, not fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to build an office that is honest and really serves
people, not one that does business like Haiti, where you have to
bribe someone to get anything done,'' said Constant, 32, who served
as vice consul under Geneus for four years. ``I want to be a
catalyst for helping to get people to come together, and ... also
be looking to the larger diplomatic community and all friends of
Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   The first woman to run the New England-based consulate since it
was established in the early 1980s, Constant is a trained physician
and a single mother to 6-year-old daughter Anais; the two live in
suburban Malden. Constant spent her own childhood in the small
southern coastal town of Les Cayes, the oldest of three siblings
and the daughter of teachers who she said taught her the meaning of
discipline and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Since her appointment last month, an onslaught of demands has
kept Constant focused on the immediate, pressing needs of Haitians
at home and in Massachusetts, which has the third-largest
population of Haitians in the United States. Besides working on
hurricane relief, she helped coordinate protests after a stinging
joke about Haitians and AIDS in the Hollywood movie ``How Stella
Got Her Groove Back'' erupted into controversy and demonstrations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the consulate she imagines is one that ultimately promotes
Haitian art, encourages Haitian business owners to expand, and
looks at the complex, internal problems that have stifled Haiti's
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Haitians need to take responsibility for our future and
for what we do. We have to be able to build institutions and have
professionals who are willing to play by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant fled Haiti in 1994, as then-president Jean-Bertrand
Aristide remained in exile after he was overthrown in a 1991 coup.
After 28 years living in her homeland _ the last six of those years
studying in medical school and working as a women's activist _ she
abandoned her childhood dream to practice medicine in her own
country and joined relatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never planned to come and live here,'' Constant said. ``When
the coup happened, I thought it was going to last maybe days. I was
always expecting things were going to get back to normal. But they
never did.''

STUDY SAYS CALIFORNIA LAW HAS HURT MINORITIES, WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's anti-affirmative action initiative
has created widespread confusion that has eroded advancements women
and minorities had made in education and employment, according to a
new study.
</P>
<P>
   The voter-approved Proposition 209 ``has seriously set back
efforts to integrate California's public institutions. That impact
is going to grow over time,'' said Theodore Wang, program director
of Chinese for Affirmative Action, which released the study
Tuesday. ``The immediate impact has been in education, which serves
as a pipeline to employment and other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The law barred preferences in hiring and contracting in state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect of the law is unknown because of Gov. Pete
Wilson's executive order in March barring state agencies from
collecting data on woman- and minority-owned companies that win
state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, co-sponsored by the Equal Rights Advocates interest
group, was conducted by submitting questionnaires to 68 local,
state and educational agencies across California, conducting
interviews and gathering statistics through public records.
</P>
<P>
   It found that Proposition 209, which voters approved in 1996,
caused widespread confusion among contractors and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of 209 refers to `preferences,' but it doesn't
say what preferences are,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some governments have continued their
affirmative-action programs while others have eliminated them.
Several are trying to find an acceptable middle ground, focusing on
outreach to women and minorities without using their race or gender
as a factor in hiring and admissions.
</P>
<P>
   The most extreme example in the survey was San Diego County,
which eliminated its Equal Opportunity Office, including all 15
staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``By eliminating that office, you eliminate even looking at
whether there's any discrimination, and if there is, any efforts to
try to reverse that,'' said Beth Parker, program director of Equal
Rights Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of confusion and resistance to diversity arose
with federal contracts, which are not affected by the state law.
Any project with federal funding still has affirmative-action
requirements, but contractors sometimes are unwilling to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The co-sponsors of the survey opposed Proposition 209. They
recommend increased funding for outreach and recruitment efforts to
lure minorities and women.

   In trying to make an animatronic plush animal the Cabbage Patch

toy retailers to stage glitzy promotional events in many major
cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the $22.6 billion toy industry, something like Furby has to
be more than just a good idea; it also needs a marketing plan _ and
a bit of luck. That's especially true for a toy that, unlike
Teletubbies or Blue's Clues, doesn't have its own TV show that
serves as an ongoing ad for its licensed toy lines.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Tiger has stage-managed some nice buzz around Furby, a
Gremlin sort of creature that emits weird noises. But
self-manufactured buzz is one thing. Delivering the blockbuster toy
of the season may be quite another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furby has had great PR,'' notes Jim Silver, publisher of the
Toy Book, a trade publication. Tiger ``built a lot of excitement
for it even before it hit the toy store shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its own TV show, what makes a toy a holiday hit these
days? ``The consumer press,'' says Silver.
</P>
<P>
   That elastic phrase covers TV talk-show hosts Rosie O'Donnell
and Bryant Gumbel. On-air plugs from these worthies helped make
Tickle-Me-Elmo a smash item two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   According to Silver, this year's toy king-maker could be Wired
magazine. In its September issue, Wired described Furby as ``Giga
Pets 2.0'' (a reference to Tiger's last hit). Furby, according to
Wired, is an interactive toy children can nurture, teach, and play
with, and is likely to have frantic parents scrambling to find it
before the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, only a few obscure trade publications made such
predictions, but now every talk-show and newspaper is on the
lookout, and once one pundit anoints something as a hot toy, a
pack-journalism frenzy of me-too stories quickly ensues. For
example, following a Furby appearance on the Today Show, the Boston
Herald among others gave it a big splash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the snowball begins,'' Silver says.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Tiger, a recently acquired subsidiary of Hasbro Inc.,
wasn't poised to add to the snowball's momentum. In mid-October, it
launched an ad campaign for Furby, and even earlier, it approached
key retailers to help incubate a hoped-for craze.
</P>
<P>
   With the same tone that brewers use in their public service
announcements about sensible drinking, Tiger insists it would never
try to create demand for a toy it couldn't meet.
</P>
<P>
   It may be good strategy for a maker of collectible products,
such as Beanie Babies, to keep some items deliberately scarce. But
for most toymakers, it doesn't make good business sense to
disappoint customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's policy is to never manipulate demand,'' says company
spokeswoman Lana Simon.
</P>
<P>
   In evolving from an inventor's idea to a production order at a
Chinese factory and, finally, to a product on a US retailer's
shelf, many toys need lead times of a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with Furby. The idea for Furby was presented
to Tiger in the fall of 1997, leaving the company only 14 months to
develop, ship, and market it, says Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Because the finished toy became available late in the cycle,
Furbys are being shipped from China to the United States by air
rather than by sea, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to ship one to two million pieces by the end of the
year, which is a lot of product for a $30 toy,'' says Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and Christmas, Toys `R' Us has been promised 200,000
Furbys, says chain spokeswoman Rebecca A. Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are hot toy items,'' she says of Furby shipments. ``As
quickly as we get them in, they get sold pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of not having enough of a hot toy can make retailers
very nervous, especially toy retailers, which are seeing such
chains as Wal-Mart and BJ's Wholesale Club eat into their toy
business. Afraid of being left out, toy retailers seemed eager to
jump on the Furby bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiating with Tiger, toy retailers were given chunks of
geography where they were allowed to introduce Furby to the
toy-buying public with much hoo-ha and fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, FAO Schwarz debuted Furby in New York. Toys
`R' Us got Los Angeles. And K-B Toys, the Pittsfield, Mass.
division of Consolidated Stores Corp., was allowed to unveil Furby
in such urban areas as Boston, Miami, and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to say how much K-B spent on Furby's launch,
communications manager John Reilly explained why KB felt compelled
to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our share, too,'' he says. ``We want our chance to
shine with a hit toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Furby got off to a late start, it may not generate the
sales of holiday toy hits of yesteryear. And in vying for the title
of top toy for 1998, Furby may get stiff competition from Blue's
Clues Sing-Along Blue, Bouncing Tigger, Spice Girl Dolls, Talking
Teletubbies, and Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of one toy that sells 5 million items this year, I
think you're going to see five or six toys that sell 1 million or
so items each,'' says Silver of the Toy Book.

LINK BETWEEN HEART DISEASE, AMINO ACID YET TO BE DEFINED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
EDITORS: This story is a re-send of story filed Tuesday, Nov. 10,By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The link between homocysteine and heart disease has yet
to be defined, prompting experts Tuesday to advise against
screening the population for elevated levels of the amino acid or
vitamin treatments except in rare cases.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 studies performed to define the link between homocysteine
_ an amino acid _ and development of cardiovascular disease, six
showed a correlation between high homocysteine levels and five did
not, said Dr. Ronald Krauss, immediate past president of the
American Heart Association's nutrition committee, which wrote the
advisory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that vitamin intake lowers the homocysteine
level, there are no studies to prove that lowering homocysteine
reduces the rate of cardiovascular disease,'' Krauss said at AHA's
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   Folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12, can reduce homocysteine levels
in the blood, Krauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that cereals
and grains be fortified with folic acid, mainly to reduce the rate
of children born with abnormalities of the spinal cord and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss said, however, the fortification adds 100 micrograms (one
millionth of a gram) of folic acid to the daily diet. That plus a
regular eating pattern that includes fruit and vegetables can
reduce homocysteine levels adequately in most people, Krauss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until testing (to determine whether reducing homocysteine
decreases heart disease risk) is done, the emphasis should be
placed on meeting the recommended daily requirements for folic acid
by increasing intake of fruit, vegetables and fortified cereals,''
Krauss said.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, he said, physicians who see patients with
high risks of developing heart disease may want to measure
homocysteine with a test that can cost as much as $100, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an individual physician judgment,'' he said. If it seems
obvious that the patient cannot meet the recommended daily intake
of folic acid and the B vitamins, doctors may prescribe a
multivitamin to deal with the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without adequate levels of vitamins that act as metabolic
co-factors, &UR;  &LR; homocysteine can build up in the blood, Krauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Wilson has evaluated homocysteine levels in 1,947
women and men who are part of the Framingham, Mass., Heart Study
that began 50 years ago. He found that as levels of homocysteine in
the blood climbed, the risk of stroke climbed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not feel that his data are a mandate to
encourage people to eat more than the 400 micrograms of folic acid
now recommended in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough experience with vitamin levels and
homocysteine,'' he said. &QL;

JOHN HANCOCK UNVEILS DRAFT PLAN FOR DEMUTUALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. is providing the first
peek at details of its plans to become a publicly traded company,
from how shares and cash would be distributed to antitakeover
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's first draft proposal, a 32-page plan, delivered to the
Massachusetts Division of Insurance this week, is the initial step
in a ``demutualization'' approval process that could take the
better part of the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the details proposed: how stock and cash distributions to
policyholders and others would take place just before an initial
public stock offering; limits on stock options and awards to top
insiders; and a form of anti-takeover protection that would last
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   It proposes an actual transaction in 2000, leaving open the
possibility of a later date if the stock market is unreceptive to
new issues at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hancock document, sure to be debated and negotiated at
length before approval, is sketchy or outright moot on many other
details.
</P>
<P>
   As a mutual insurance company, Boston-based Hancock is
technically owned by its policyholders and some other customers.
The plan submitted to regulators would give those customer-owners
cash or stock in a new holding company, which would immediately
raise more money by selling additional shares to investors in an
initial public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Hancock would become a publicly traded stock
company.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of mutual insurers into public companies is a
hot topic around the country. Insurers insist they need access to
capital markets to compete in a consolidating financial services
world. Critics worry that policyholders can get left out in the
cold if their interests are not carefully protected by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   MONY Group Inc., the new holding company for Mutual Life
Insurance Co. of New York, is expected to complete the process
today. Shares in an IPO, forecast to raise about $250 million, are
scheduled to be priced by underwriter Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. before
the day is out.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, regulators approved a demutualization plan for
Provident Mutual Life Insurance Co. and its 300,000 policyholders
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hancock plan would create a holding company called John
Hancock Financial Services Inc. That company would own three
subsidiaries: John Hancock Life Insurance Co., managing the
company's domestic business; a Canadian Hancock unit; and a
subsidiary containing all other foreign business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Policyholders could swap their mutual ownership interest for
shares of John Hancock Financial Services or request a settlement
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on cash: Hancock proposes paying out at a rate
commensurate with the stock value set by its IPO or the average
price of its shares over the first 20 days of trading, up to a
maximum of 120 percent of the IPO price. The payout would be pegged
to the higher of the two figures. The Hancock document describes
the plan as ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news on cash: It probably won't be around for everyone
who wants it. Hancock suggested paying out cash, as it lasts,
beginning with the smallest policyholders and working its way up.
Once there is no more cash to distribute, customers would get stock
for their interests. This isn't such a bad deal since the stock
could be sold almost immediately, once the IPO is launched and
there is a public market for the shares.
</P>
<P>
   State Mutual Assurance Co. of Worcester, now known as Allmerica
Financial Corp., demutualized in 1995 and raised about $250 million
in an IPO. About $25 million to $30 million in cash was made
available to policyholders who did not want stock, issued on a
little-guy-first basis similar to the Hancock plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's initial plan does not mention an amount of cash
available, nor does it discuss reserving any portion of money
raised in an IPO to help cash out policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also places some limits on the stock and option
interests of top Hancock brass. It suggests prohibiting awards of
options or stock grants to directors and elected Hancock officials
for six months after the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would limit the stock holdings of that same group
to 5 percent of Hancock stock for the first 2 1/2 years, and 18
percent after that time. It also would prohibit top insiders from
receiving any stock benefits as a consideration for insurance
policies issued after May 11, the day Hancock's board authorized
managers to prepare a demutualization plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's initial plan would prohibit any stockholder from
purchasing more than 10 percent of the company's shares for three
years, effectively creating a limited antitakeover defense. The
company described the three years as ``a reasonable period of time
to implement its strategy as a new public company,'' adding that
the breathing room is specifically authorized in the state law
covering demutualization.
</P>
<P>
   Allmerica received more protection when it converted to public
ownership in 1995, blocking any investor from acquiring more than 5
percent of the stock for one year. Allmerica was also prohibited
from making acquisitions during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Among issues not mentioned in the Hancock plan: what rights, if
any, policyholders should have to buy additional shares during the
IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Shares that mutual insurance companies convert are frequently
priced at a discount to their book value in an IPO. In a
demutualization, policyholders swap for stock at a rate set exactly
to book value, and some consumer advocates suggest those customers
should be allowed to buy more shares in the IPO to compensate for
any dilution they suffer.
</P>
<P>
   That issue came up in the MONY case, but regulators did not
insist on IPO access for policyholders.

FOR TEEN, CHEERS OVERCOME CHILDHOOD DISEASES

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Mass. _ A pile of huge white bows, their ribbons
cascading down the front of a living-room chair, greeted Amanda
Colford Monday night as she breezed in from practice.
</P>
<P>
   Although destined as merry props for a competition this weekend,
they could just as well have been waiting to adorn the raven-haired
17-year-old captain of the Bedford High cheerleading squad, whose
grace and poise and very life are gifts beyond measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these things have faded,'' said her mother, Laurene,
trying to detail the life-threatening illnesses, the crises, the
alarms _ oh, those endless alarms _ that punctuated Amanda's
childhood before she emerged as the leaping, jumping, athletic
cheerleader she is now. ``It doesn't seem real.''
</P>
<P>
   What's real these days is the excitement of mother and daughter
as they look forward to their January trip to Hawaii, where Amanda
will participate in the All-American Scholarship Invitational in
Honolulu and the halftime show of the NFL Pro Bowl. This, on the
heels of being given the Miss New England Cheerleading Association
award at a recent camp at Babson College. And just last month,
Amanda was crowned homecoming queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took it one day at a time,'' said Amanda of the long,
often pain-wracked journey that will soon take her to her 18th
birthday, her graduation, and those sun-drenched islands.
</P>
<P>
   It's like living a fairy tale for Laurene, whose idea of
paradise not long ago was awakening to find her daughter still
alive. Just a day after Amanda came home from the hospital, a
friend of Laurene's hesitantly observed that the newborn didn't
look right. The new mother took her fears to her pediatrician, Dr.
Richard D'Entremont, who sent over a monitoring device to which
Amanda's tiny body was hooked via electrodes. The next morning, he
got a call from Laurene: something's wrong with the machine, it
beeped all night long.
</P>
<P>
   Wake her up, the doctor instructed. Disturb a sleeping newborn,
thought Laurene? ``Now she's crying,'' she reported, annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' said the doctor, relieved. The persistant beeping had
been signaling apnea/bradycardia, a condition that can lead to
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in which Amanda would quit breathing
and her heart would briefly stop while she slept. So Amanda's first
two months were spent in the hospital, and for four years she would
sleep attached to the monitor that would beep when she quit
breathing. The idea was to wait for the beeping to stimulate her to
resume breathing on her own; after 10 beeps Laurene would gently
shake her awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a lot of alarms,'' Laurene said. ``I still wake up at
2 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   When Amanda was 2, a new crisis suddenly appeared. An active
toddler despite the apnea, Amanda loved to attend her little gym
program and was already showing some talent. But one day when her
grandmother came to watch, Amanda began crawling and falling about.
``That's what I get for bragging,'' thought Laurene.
</P>
<P>
   But later that day while reading to her daughter, she looked
down. ``Her ankles were absolutely gigantic,'' Laurene said. The
diagnosis: rheumatoid arthritis. The prescription: 27 baby aspirins
a day, exercise such as dance and gymnastics in lieu of physical
therapy and, even when she's having trouble walking, don't pick her
up all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good thing they said that, too,'' said Amanda.
``It would have been harder for me to learn to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fifth grade, the arthritis abruptly worsened. For a while her
whole body was so stiff she could barely move, and she spent that
summer in a wheelchair. But when school started in the fall, she
slapped a pair of braces on her legs and stubbornly walked to the
bus. ``I never really liked making a big deal of it,'' Amanda said.
``I liked being normal.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as serious as it was, few of her friends and not even
her cheerleading coach knew of her arthritis until recently. ``Yes,
I had it,'' said Amanda. ``But it was no different than if I had
blond hair or black hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, said her doctor. ``A lot of the credit goes to
her and her mom, because a lot of times what happens when you have
a chronic illness is the parents start to overprotect the child and
the child starts to favor the illness,'' said D'Entremont, a
physician with Woburn Pediatrics. ``Suddenly, they're not doing
anything because they're not trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally weaned from the monitor after she outgrew the apnea at
age 4, Amanda and her mother were learning to cope with the
arthritis when the worst hit. At age 5, she was stricken with
epiglotitis, a potentially fatal swelling of the small flap that
covers the airway to the lungs. When Amanda began complaining of a
horrible sore throat and had trouble swallowing her medicine, her
mother became alarmed. Amanda, who was just learning about
ambulances, thought the ride was cool but was upset the siren
wasn't on. (Ironically, Dr. D'Entremont had ordered the siren be
left off so as not to upset the little girl.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long year,'' her mother said. ``That year we just
constantly prayed. I just felt a peace that she was going to be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   She was, except for a few broken bones and torn ligaments
(earned while playing basketball) that would give most teen-agers
something to brag about for years but are mentioned only as an
aside in this household. ``The epiglotitis was kind of like the
final hurrah, knock on wood,'' said Laurene, who still marvels at
what she calls the miracle of her daughter's current health. ``If
just one little part to that chain of events had been different,
she probably wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of eighth grade, Amanda _ the arthritis by now
largely controlled by medication _ was out shopping when a girl who
cheered came up to her and said, hey, you do gymnastics, come on
down to cheerleading tryouts. She made varsity as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   What lingers from Amanda's childhood struggles are the happy
memories and shared anecdotes: how Laurene would somehow turn every
dose of medication, every blood test, every treatment into a game
or party (``It helped me get through a lot of this,'' said her
daughter); how Amanda still sleeps with Pound Puppy, a delightfully
shabby stuffed animal she began using as an extra pillow when she
was 5 and the arthritis hurt too much to get to sleep without him
wrapped around her neck; how they both still jump when the beeper
on the french fry maker at Friendly's goes off because it sounds
exactly like the monitor Amanda was hooked up to until she was 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was a miracle,'' said Laurene of her daughter's
life.

   ATLANTA _ All Hallow's Eve has come and gone, I'm gorged with
candy scarfed up before those annoying little trick-or-treaters
could get it, and the ghost still resides in my computer, turning
it on at midnight every night.

   ATLANTA _ OS 8.5, the latest version of the Apple Computer
operating system, represents another incremental step forward for
the Mac. By and large, OS 8.5 is a collection of small but
important tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is a potentially important new technology
called Sherlock. It's a search engine that replaces the Mac's aging
Find application. But more on that later. R,L,: -

   Microsoft Corp. does not go softly into hardware. When it
decides to enter a hardware niche, it typically has a good reason.
The rise of graphical user interfaces like the Windows shell
demanded a mouse, and Microsoft is now the big cheese in computer
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's game-software division is a powerhouse, so the
company is trying to conquer the market for game paraphernalia like
joysticks, steering wheels and stereo speakers. William H. Gates
became a daddy, and now there is the Microsoft Actimates
Interactive Barney doll.
</P>
<P>
   And now Microsoft is going after the cordless phone business,
which says a lot about the company's vision for the future. It is a
future that blends telecommunications, consumer electronics and
computing, and it envisions increasing reliance on voice commands
to control common household devices _ that, not coincidentally, use
Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest hardware product is a $199 cordless telephone
that connects to a personal computer and uses Windows-based call
management software. In theory, the Microsoft Cordless Phone
System, officially known as the PC Phone System MP-900, is supposed
to harness the power of the PC to improve the way we use the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of weeks of testing the MP-900, I find it hard to
give it a ringing endorsement. Even so, the ideas behind the PC
Phone System MP-900 are so compelling that I eagerly await version
2.0.
</P>
<P>
   The MP-900 is a black, 900-megahertz cordless phone that comes
with a desktop cradle, a base station that connects to a PC and a
CD-ROM disk with call management software. In general,
900-megahertz phones are significantly superior to the
first-generation cordless phones, which operated at 46 to 49 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   The software enables the user to set up a voice mail system,
with separate voice-mail boxes for each member of a family or small
business.
</P>
<P>
   A voice command system lets the user make calls by simply
speaking the name of the recipient, once that name and phone number
are entered in a speed-dial directory. Up to 40 names can be
entered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to call one's bookmaker, one simply presses the
voice command button on the handset and says, ``Call Weasel.''
(Your bookie's name may vary.) The phone looks up Weasel's number
in the PC database, dials it and logs the call.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first successful examples of speech recognition
in my house, certainly more impressive than when I try to summon my
teen-ager by voice.
</P>
<P>
   If the user subscribes to a Caller ID service through the phone
company, the software can recognize calls from certain individuals
and play a custom greeting whenever that person calls.
</P>
<P>
   The phone handset also uses voice synthesis to announce incoming
calls. ``Gates, Bill, calling.'' Thus, the user can screen calls
even when away from the PC. Voice messages are stored on the
computer's hard disk and can be played back, even from a remote
location.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds great in theory. But to be broadly successful,
consumer electronics devices have to be relatively inexpensive,
simple to learn, easy to use, reliable and so compelling that
people eventually wonder how they ever survived without one.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone is one example, and the radio, the television, the
VCR, the stereo and the microwave oven are others.
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, the Microsoft Cordless Phone has not quite
made the connection. First, $199 is a lot to spend on a
single-line, 900-megahertz analog cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   For just a few dollars more, you can get 2.4-gigahertz digital
spread-spectrum cordless phone with greater range, two-line
capability and protection against electronic eavesdroppers. (The
problem with many analog cordless phones is that your conversations
can sometimes be picked up on the neighbor's baby monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   Or you can buy a 900-MHz digital cordless phone with many useful
features for much less than $199. Sony just introduced several new
900-MHz digital phones, for slightly more money, that match some of
the more appealing features of the Microsoft phone, without the
need for a PC.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 70 percent of American households have a
cordless phone already, fewer than 45 percent have a PC, and of
those, not all have the features needed to operate the Microsoft
phone. These include a Pentium 90 processor (or faster) running
Windows 95 or 98, a vacant serial port, 32 megabytes of RAM, up to
100 megabytes of hard disk space and a Windows-compatible 16-bit
sound card with a microphone and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more appealing features require Caller ID, a
subscription service offered by local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The phone will not work with Windows NT, and there are no plans
to create a Macintosh version, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the MP-900 to my Windows PC was harder than I thought
it would be and required much fussing over serial ports. The
software installed easily, but it refused to work until other phone
extensions on the line were disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The phone's battery must be charged for 10 hours before use,
which might frustrate users who require instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The special call management software is relatively easy to
configure. But it was unnecessarily difficult to import the
hundreds of names and telephone numbers I have collected in
Microsoft Outlook into the new phone's directory. The idea of
re-entering all those numbers manually was too much to bear. The
thought of attempting a link with Sidekick or some other
non-Microsoft contact-management software was truly odious.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I tweaked the software, the phone refused to play
the custom announcements I lovingly recorded for special callers _
the Wicked Witch theme song for one, the submarine ``battle
stations'' sound effects for another, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest drawback is that to take advantage of all
the advanced features, you must leave the PC turned on. If the PC
is switched off or crashes, the MP-900 becomes a very expensive
cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a headset option for the MP-900, which disqualifies
it for use as my primary office phone.
</P>
<P>
   The sound quality of messages played back through my computer's
speakers was erratic, fading in and out. On the flip side, my
digital cellular phone is much less reliable, and I still put up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the MP-900 is a clever device, and its call
management software deserves to be incorporated into future
generations of desktop and cordless phones. But the price is still
a bit steep, the inconveniences still outweigh the advantages, and
non-PC cordless phone technologies offer some of the same features.
</P>

   In last week's column about Macintosh OS 8.5, a brief reference
was made to the ``Revision B'' iMac computer. Apple would neither
confirm nor deny what it said were ``rumors'' about the existence
of the new model. Here are the details: Since introducing the iMac
in July, Apple has made several improvements to the original model,
including adding a faster graphics chip and more video RAM (6 MB
versus 2 MB). These Revision B iMacs come from the factory with Mac
OS 8.5 installed instead of 8.1.

   Let the truth be known, I really do miss my Macintosh. I gave up
my Mac a little more than a year ago when I developed a bad case of
tendinitis; to save my hands, I started using Dragon Naturally
Speaking, a continuous speech recognition system. While speech
recognition software is available for the Mac, it doesn't have the
power of Naturally Speaking.
</P>

telephone repairman was working on a switching unit down the
street. I stopped and asked about log-on speeds. He tells me that
in our area where we have fiber-optic cables, that the phone
company uses ``pair gain'' for economic reasons, and that may slow
my connection down. What is pair gain, and is there anything I can
do about it? R,F,: - BC-COMPUTER-ANALYST-FORU, -  &QL;

NETSCAPE'S BROWSER PULLS AHEAD, FOR NOW &QL; 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN &QL; 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Forget the phrase ``browser wars.'' When it comes to creating
software used to surf the World Wide Web, Netscape Communications
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are playing a game of leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   Each company's release of its respective browser is slightly
better than its competitor's _ that is, until the competitor comes
out with a new one. The last time I looked
(www.chron.com/content/chronicle/atchron/97/10/19/compute.html),
Microsoft was in the lead with Internet Explorer 4.01, the
top-notch browser that's also the interface for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Netscape's turn to hop ahead. The Mountain View,
Calif.-based company has released version 4.5 of its Communicator
Internet suite (home.netscape.com), and it's a winner. Microsoft
has been sent back to the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   I spent time with two different versions of Communicator 4.5 _
Windows 95/98/NT and one of the many variations of Unix. I did not
get a chance to review the Macintosh version.
</P>
<P>
   4,000 changes
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has made many changes _ more than 4,000, both internal
and external _ to the way the Communicator Suite works. The
Navigator browser, the Messenger e-mail/-Usenet reader and the
address book have been given overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Communicator's excellence is something called
Smart Browsing, and it's the way Web access should have been all
along. Instead of typing a full Web address into Navigator's
location field _ say, www.houstonchronicle.com _ all you need to
do, in most cases, is enter the name of the site _ in this case,
Houston Chronicle. Is that nifty, or what?
</P>
<P>
   This feature alone makes it worth adopting Communicator as your
primary Internet-access software. It's particularly good for novice
users who may be confused by some of the conventions used in
Universal Resource Locators, or URLs.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing works this way. When you enter the name of a site
instead of a URL, Navigator sends the entry to Netscape's Netcenter
Web site. The name is checked against a large database of known
sites, and you're directed to what Netcenter believes is the
correct one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every location in cyberspace is listed. When
Netcenter can't find a match, it runs the entry through its own
search engine. For example, if you enter my name, you won't go
directly to my Web site _ I guess I just don't have that much
juice! _ but you will get the results of a Netcenter search, and
the first choice is my home page.
</P>
<P>
   A companion feature to Smart Browsing is What's Related, a
button just to the right of the location field. If you visit the
Houston Chronicle's Web site and click on What's Related, you get a
list of other newspaper and news sites. Visit a site that
specializes in shareware downloads, and you'll get a list of other
like archives. If there are no matches, you get the option to
search Netcenter for similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to a very powerful combination, making
Netscape's browser a far more useful tool than Internet Explorer
for getting where you need to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two windows rolled into one
</P>
<P>
   Netscape also has made some changes in the way the Messenger
client works and looks. In Communicator 4.0, Messenger was actually
two separate pieces _ a window that showed you all your message
folders, as well as any discussion groups to which you had
subscribed, and another window with the messages themselves. This
seemed like a lot of wasted real estate, so Netscape consolidated
these two windows into one.
</P>
<P>
   In 4.5, you now have a three-paned window, similar to the design
used by Netscape's 3.0 mail client, or Microsoft's Outlook Express.
To the left are the mail folders and news groups. At the top are
the message headers and below are the message bodies. This makes it
very easy to sort mail _ just drag a header from the top pane and
drop it into a folder in the left one.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you'd rather work with a two-pane message window,
just click a button and the folder pane disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The address book is now much friendlier. It will auto-complete
e-mail addresses for you. Type the first few letters of a mail
recipient's name, and Messenger will finish it for you. If there is
more than one address under a person's name, you'll get a list that
lets you choose which to use.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Communicator 4.5 is perfect. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   It still suffers from a serious case of bloat. While it launches
a bit faster than version 4.0, Communicator still has a bigger
footprint than Internet Explorer 4.0, and thus takes longer to
load.
</P>
<P>
   And while it seems to crash less than 4.0, it still dies more
often than it should.
</P>
<P>
   However, Netscape now has added a neat feature that almost makes
a meltdown worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   When Communicator crashes, it generates a detailed log of what
happened. A dialog box pops up that lets you dispatch the log
directly to Netscape, complete with any additional notes you choose
to add. Presumably Netscape's software engineers will use these
details to make the product more stable.
</P>
<P>
   Communicator 4.5 is available in several configurations for
Windows 95/98/NT, Mac and Unix users _ sorry, no Windows 3.1
version is planned. You can get a base, complete and professional
installation. I recommend the complete installation for most users
_ the base version lacks some handy features, and the professional
version is designed for users on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hefty download, at about 14 megabytes for the Windows
version. But it's more than worth the effort.

(js) &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID FIRESTONE &LR;  &QC;  &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   He is the president of his industry's trade group, a well-known
Internet pioneer who has floated above the red ink that has drowned
so many other entrepreneurs, but Mark Tiarra still asks that a
reporter not mention the northern New Jersey town where he conducts
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stuffy place around here,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So let it simply be said that Tiarra works most days in a
nondescript building in Bergen County, not far from Ridgewood,
producing, marketing and carefully manipulating the most popular
commodity on the World Wide Web: adult entertainment. And as a
measure of how rapidly that industry has grown, Tiarra, who has
been in the business only about four years, has become one of its
elder statesmen, a highly sought-after guru who is now making
plenty of money as a consultant to aspiring Webmasters of
cyberporn. He is 29 years old and has the interview spiel down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with basing a business on human
sexuality,'' he said, relaxing in front of an enormous computer
monitor. ``Of course, we don't even do that many hard-core sites.
There's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn't appeal to my
tastes. Our sites try to cross the line between art and erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   He is mildly dismissive of the thousands of coarse, tumbledown
Web sites that fail to surround their flesh pictures with the
proper graphical environment, but for Tiarra, the president of the
United Adult Sites, there is a limit to condescension. The
nonprofit organization, formed in 1996, is the trade association of
adult Web sites. It has established a code of ethics for its 500
members and lobbied in Washington against restrictions like the
Child Online Protection Act, signed into law last month by
President Clinton and immediately challenged by Internet
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department doesn't even know how it's going to
enforce it,'' he said. ``If I were the Supreme Court, I'd be
insulted that they passed it.'' The law penalizes commercial Web
sites that fail to keep ``harmful material'' out of the hands of
minors.
</P>
<P>
   With his long, limp black hair and faint beard, Tiarra looks
more like the musician and record producer he says he would prefer
to be than the pornography industry authority he has become. But he
is immensely knowledgeable and utterly straightforward about the
details of his work, and though he has no business background,
others in the industry say his marketing abilities are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is known as a genius at directing traffic,'' said Fay
Sharp, who runs the XWebexpo, a trade show held twice a year for
the adult Web industry. ``Someone sets up a site and they need to
have traffic into the site or they die. So they call Mark and they
buy traffic from him, and it's not yucky traffic _ it's people who
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, for the uninitiated, refers to the number of people who
look at a Web page, and ideally, give out their credit card numbers
for a peek at password-protected photos. (According to several
industry estimates, more than half the Internet's bandwidth, or
capacity, is taken up with traffic in adult material.) By setting
up carefully manipulative advertisements on his own popular sites,
Tiarra can send his traffic to other sites, charging them for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, he realized that thousands of people had read
about the gold rush of profit possibilities in cyberporn and were
trying to enter the industry with no knowledge or ability. So, just
as in the mainstream computer world, he began selling his knowledge
to new Webmasters, and is now offering complete packages to
entrepreneurs with cash. The basic package starts at $3,499, for
which a buyer gets two galleries of photos, several completely
designed Web pages and a month of consulting advice. The ``platinum
package'' goes for $34,999 and includes a huge gallery of photos,
live video feeds, credit card processing, advertising and three
months of consulting.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Tiarracorp, now has seven full-time employees and
60 or 70 contractors around the world who design the sites. This,
of course, is where the big money is. Thousands of inexperienced
adult Webmasters have gone under with the increasing competition,
but his company has made several million dollars for the last three
years, and his telephone continues to ring as newcomers seek out an
honest reputation in a rough trade filled with swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he had never seen the Internet, coming
late to the industry. He grew up in Bergen County, the son of a
data-processing executive. He was allowed to play with an Apple 2C
and a guitar in high school. He took music in college and later
worked in a printing business until a friend asked him to design a
Web site for a band. He studied the Internet and by 1994 realized
there was only one likely way to make money with it, appealing to a
very old-fashioned instinct. His Web sites range from the grandiose
(``All the Beauty That Is Woman'') to the crass (``The Girls of
Tiarracorp''), but every evening, they are seen by thousands of Web
surfers, many with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 2-year-old son, and I don't want him seeing these
sites until he knows the difference between love and sex,'' Tiarra
said. ``Nobody wants kids on their sites. They cost you bandwidth,
and they don't have a credit card to buy anything you have.''

 &UR; PROFILE: AT 29, AN ELDER STATESMAN OF INTERNET EROTICA &LR;  &QL; 
(js) &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID FIRESTONE &LR;  &QC;  &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   He is the president of his industry's trade group, a well-known
Internet pioneer who has floated above the red ink that has drowned
so many other entrepreneurs, but Mark Tiarra still asks that a
reporter not mention the northern New Jersey town where he conducts
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stuffy place around here,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So let it simply be said that Tiarra works most days in a
nondescript building in Bergen County, not far from Ridgewood,
producing, marketing and carefully manipulating the most popular
commodity on the World Wide Web: adult entertainment. And as a
measure of how rapidly that industry has grown, Tiarra, who has
been in the business only about four years, has become one of its
elder statesmen, a highly sought-after guru who is now making
plenty of money as a consultant to aspiring Webmasters of
cyberporn. He is 29 years old and has the interview spiel down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with basing a business on human
sexuality,'' he said, relaxing in front of an enormous computer
monitor. ``Of course, we don't even do that many hard-core sites.
There's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn't appeal to my
tastes. Our sites try to cross the line between art and erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   He is mildly dismissive of the thousands of coarse, tumbledown
Web sites that fail to surround their flesh pictures with the
proper graphical environment, but for Tiarra, the president of the
United Adult Sites, there is a limit to condescension. The
nonprofit organization, formed in 1996, is the trade association of
adult Web sites. It has established a code of ethics for its 500
members and lobbied in Washington against restrictions like the
Child Online Protection Act, signed into law last month by
President Clinton and immediately challenged by Internet
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department doesn't even know how it's going to
enforce it,'' he said. ``If I were the Supreme Court, I'd be
insulted that they passed it.'' The law penalizes commercial Web
sites that fail to keep ``harmful material'' out of the hands of
minors.
</P>
<P>
   With his long, limp black hair and faint beard, Tiarra looks
more like the musician and record producer he says he would prefer
to be than the pornography industry authority he has become. But he
is immensely knowledgeable and utterly straightforward about the
details of his work, and though he has no business background,
others in the industry say his marketing abilities are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is known as a genius at directing traffic,'' said Fay
Sharp, who runs the XWebexpo, a trade show held twice a year for
the adult Web industry. ``Someone sets up a site and they need to
have traffic into the site or they die. So they call Mark and they
buy traffic from him, and it's not yucky traffic _ it's people who
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, for the uninitiated, refers to the number of people who
look at a Web page, and ideally, give out their credit card numbers
for a peek at password-protected photos. (According to several
industry estimates, more than half the Internet's bandwidth, or
capacity, is taken up with traffic in adult material.) By setting
up carefully manipulative advertisements on his own popular sites,
Tiarra can send his traffic to other sites, charging them for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, he realized that thousands of people had read
about the gold rush of profit possibilities in cyberporn and were
trying to enter the industry with no knowledge or ability. So, just
as in the mainstream computer world, he began selling his knowledge
to new Webmasters, and is now offering complete packages to
entrepreneurs with cash. The basic package starts at $3,499, for
which a buyer gets two galleries of photos, several completely
designed Web pages and a month of consulting advice. The ``platinum
package'' goes for $34,999 and includes a huge gallery of photos,
live video feeds, credit card processing, advertising and three
months of consulting.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Tiarracorp, now has seven full-time employees and
60 or 70 contractors around the world who design the sites. This,
of course, is where the big money is. Thousands of inexperienced
adult Webmasters have gone under with the increasing competition,
but his company has made several million dollars for the last three
years, and his telephone continues to ring as newcomers seek out an
honest reputation in a rough trade filled with swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he had never seen the Internet, coming
late to the industry. He grew up in Bergen County, the son of a
data-processing executive. He was allowed to play with an Apple 2C
and a guitar in high school. He took music in college and later
worked in a printing business until a friend asked him to design a
Web site for a band. He studied the Internet and by 1994 realized
there was only one likely way to make money with it, appealing to a
very old-fashioned instinct. His Web sites range from the grandiose
(``All the Beauty That Is Woman'') to the crass (``The Girls of
Tiarracorp''), but every evening, they are seen by thousands of Web
surfers, many with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 2-year-old son, and I don't want him seeing these
sites until he knows the difference between love and sex,'' Tiarra
said. ``Nobody wants kids on their sites. They cost you bandwidth,
and they don't have a credit card to buy anything you have.''

 &UR; WEB RADIO EXPANDS LISTENING HORIZONS &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; By RACHEL LEHMANN-HAUPT &QC;  &LR;   &QL; 
 &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was taught not listen to the radio while I worked. One of the
fastest-growing Internet industries, Web radio, is based on
breaking that very rule.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of Web radio, both of which can be heard via
streaming-audio technology. One kind is really ordinary radio that
is heard over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web now makes it possible to tune into an out-of-state
baseball game or listen to your favorite college radio station
without leaving town. The other kind of Web radio was created
exclusively for the Internet. Together, traditional broadcasters
and Internet-only start-ups offer more than 1,700 audio channels
that you can listen to through your computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical mass of choice,'' said Larry Magne, editor of
the original edition of ``Passport to Web Radio'' (International
Broadcasting Service, 1997), which describes stations from Texas to
Taipei. (An updated edition, edited by David Walcutt, appeared
earlier this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like www.broadcast.com and the BRS Radio Directory
(www.radio-directory.com) act as portals to thousands of
traditional and Web-only stations.
</P>
<P>
   Magne said that in traditional broadcast markets, many genres,
like classical, are losing out to programming that draws better
advertising. The Web provides a broader range of choice. For
example, Magne said that Radio Beethoven, a tiny classical station
that broadcasts from Santiago, Chile, is one of the best classical
radio stations around (www.beethovenfm.cl/RealAudio/ index.html).
</P>
<P>
   Many Web-only radio stations were founded on the idea of
countering a trend toward less broadcast diversity. Web technology
allows stations to offer niche programs. Some are homespun pirate
stations or stations devoted to only one band, like
www.deadradio.com, which exclusively plays the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the many independent stations, there are larger
Internet-only networks that offer multiple channels of music and
talk. Three of those reviewed here _ Imagine Radio, Netradio and
Spinner _ have eliminated audio advertisements and disk jockey
chatter. They offer a wide variety of programming and, in the case
of Imagine, personalizing programming.
</P>
<P>
   But personalized programming has made many record labels and the
Recording Industry Association of America worry that Web radio will
threaten CD sales. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was
recently signed into law, further secures copyright protection on
line.
</P>
<P>
   While all Web radio stations are required to pay fees to artists
through Ascap and BMI, this new legislation will force Web radio
stations to pay a licensing fee to record labels as well.
</P>
<P>
   The act says customized stations must negotiate individual
contracts with all the labels whose artists they play, and it
forbids stations to play more than two songs in a row from a single
artist in a three-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Record companies don't yet understand the power of user
customization,'' said John Adams, director of programming for
Imagine Radio. ``They have to realize that it can expose new
artists and increase record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Web radio, you need Real Player, a technology
developed by the Real Networks Corp. that enables an audio signal
to be ``streamed'' over the Internet. Real Player is available free
at www.real.com and takes between 10 and 20 minutes to download.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be found through most Web radio portals and
networks. If your modem uses dial-up access, Web radio will eat up
half your bandwidth, and on any connection slower than an ISDN
line, Web broadcasts are accompanied by an AM radio-style buzz.
</P>
<P>
   But if choice and control are more important, and if you like
the retro charm of the AM buzz, then Web radio can be a listening
adventure.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As late as last year, Microsoft Corp. was so
worried about Netscape Communications Corp.'s lead in Internet
software that its senior executives wanted to delay an upgrade of
Microsoft's Windows operating system to gain an edge in the browser
battle, according to internal Microsoft documents released this
week by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of Microsoft's defense in its antitrust trial is
that its Internet Explorer, or IE, browser is a seamless feature of
Windows _ not, as the government contends, a separate product
bundled with Windows in an effort to give it an unfair advantage
against Netscape. The origins of its product strategy, Microsoft
asserts, date back more than four years to a meeting of its
executives in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But internal Microsoft electronic-mail messages released this
week by the Justice Department seem to cast doubt on these defense
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, argues that the e-mail mostly supports its
legal case. ``It shows that they regarded browsing functionality as
part of Windows and were willing to delay an upgrade schedule to
deliver a superior product,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an e-mail exchange between two senior Microsoft
executives in January 1997 _ more than a year after the company
introduced its software for browsing the World Wide Web _ talks of
competing with Netscape as ``pitting browser against browser'' and
refers to ``browser market share as job 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange suggests that at that late date, within Microsoft,
the browser and the operating system were not viewed as a single,
seamless product.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail on Jan. 2, 1997, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior
vice president, writes to Paul Maritz, a group vice president and
the most senior Microsoft executive scheduled to appear as a
witness in the trial, ``I do not feel that we are going to win on
our current path.'' Later, he adds, ``I am convinced we have to use
Windows _ this is the one thing they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Allchin urges Maritz, ``If you agree that Windows
is a huge asset, then it follows quickly that we are not investing
sufficiently in finding ways to tie IE and Windows together.''
</P>
<P>
   The more tightly Internet Explorer can be entwined in the next
upgrade of Windows, Allchin writes, ``the more Netscape will be cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeating Netscape, the e-mail suggests, was such a priority at
Microsoft that it was seen to outweigh the impact a delay of
Windows would have on the computer industry. Sales of new personal
computers, hardware add-ons and software all typically surge in the
wake of an upgrade of Windows, part of the central nervous system
that controls more than 90 percent of personal computers sold
today.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying Windows to embed the browser, is ``the only thing that
makes sense even if OEMs suffer,'' Allchin wrote, referring to
``original equipment manufacturers,'' jargon for computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz shared that view. In a response on the same day, he wrote
that he saw ``little option'' but to fully integrate the browser in
the operating system, ``even if it means missing the OEM window'' _
the delivery time frame that would allow computer makers to install
the upgrade on machines for the 1997 year-end sales season.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows upgrade, code-named Memphis, was initially
scheduled to be released in August or September 1997. But its
arrival was delayed until June of this year, and it is called
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Microsoft started hinting to software developers
and analysts at industry conferences that Memphis might be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never the reason given in public, but industry insiders
believed that the real reason Memphis was being delayed was to
totally integrate the browser and help Microsoft in its
life-and-death battle with Netscape,'' said Richard Doherty,
president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford, N.Y.
``This e-mail does seem to be proof of what Microsoft's intentions
were back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Memphis was delayed even more than Microsoft had thought in
early 1997, partly as a result of Microsoft's $425 million purchase
in April 1997 of Web TV Networks, an Internet-via-television
service. Afterward, Microsoft also decided to include Web TV
software in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer is fully embedded in Windows 98, but the
company released a stand-alone version of its browser, Internet
Explorer 4.0, in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has also said that it became company
policy after a meeting in April 1994 to ``make a big bet on the
Internet.'' Though few concrete plans were made that day, Microsoft
says, there was agreement that Windows should have built-in access
to the Internet, which eventually became its browser strategy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The meeting occurred a couple of days after Netscape was
founded, and suggests, Microsoft says, that its main intention in
the browser battle was to improve its operating system _ not to
crush Netscape, as the Justice Department contends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an e-mail written on June 10, 1994, Steven Sinofsky, a
Microsoft executive who helped organize the April meeting, portrays
a company ambivalent about the Internet and not yet planning a
browser of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit,'' Sinofsky writes, ``that the thought of
`Internet evangelism' is a little like evangelizing water to
Noah.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes the Microsoft message for Windows 95 as ``all the
plumbing you need to connect to the Internet,'' mostly software
protocols for communicating on the network.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sinofsky wrote, ``We do not currently plan on any other
client software, especially something like Mosaic.'' Mosaic was the
name of the browser developed by the programmers at the University
of Illinois, most of whom went on to help found Netscape. Even so,
Sinofsky added that Microsoft was ``investigating possibilities.''

   A COURTROOM E-MAIL QUERY: WHERE'S BILL?

historic Microsoft antitrust trial.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates _ virtual or real _ wasn't anywhere to
be seen in U.S. District Court here Wednesday. Instead, a
semi-packed courtroom spent the day watching second string Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell lawyer, Theodore Edelman, hammer away at curly-haired
computer scientist Avadis Tevanian Jr., a senior vice president at
Apple Computer, who goes by ``Avie'' in his e-mails. The sparring
centered on Avie's assertion that Microsoft intentionally put bugs
in its operating system, making Apple's QuickTime software crash
with error messages when running on a new version of Microsoft's
popular Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways, between sessions punctuated with laughter at
Avie's in-your-face retorts to Edelman's condescending questions,
though, most observers were whispering about the Main Man, himself.
Bill Gates. Some reporters were peeved that Department of Justice
honcho David Boies had sprung the Gates videotape on them Monday
without warning. A few missed the main attraction entirely. Other
spectators groaned when they learned they wouldn't get another
glimpse of Gates' videotaped deposition until Monday, at the
earliest. ``That's really why I came today,'' confided one DOJ
employee, who just dropped by to check out the action.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Gates is about as far as you can get from
Washington these days. Unlike in many trials, District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson has limited the witnesses in this case to 12
people for each side. Microsoft decided not to call Gates to the
stand. And the Justice Department didn't want to use up its
precious few witnesses with someone hostile to their cause.
Instead, Boies made an end run around the judge's decree by
introducing part of Gates' 20-hour videotaped deposition into court
as evidence. Microsoft's legal team wasn't happy. Of what was
shown, about 40 percent of what was shown was chosen by the
Microsoft legal team.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem hard to believe that Microsoft had a hand in picking
any of the Gates footage. By most accounts, the billionaire
computer whiz came across on a 10-foot courtroom screen as evasive,
defiant, even a bit arrogant. At times, the virtual Bill rocked in
his leather chair, scratching his head, giving short, snappy
answers. Or he'd sit in silence. For seconds. Then he'd give an
obligatory answer.
</P>
<P>
   While it was hardly an Academy Award performance, many find it
inconceivable that Gates' lawyers failed to advise him that the
deposition could be shown in court. Remember Bill Clinton's command
performance in the Lewinsky affair? ``Everyone knows video
depositions can show up in court,'' says one Washington litigator.
``That's why they show up with a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' defense, many lawyers say it's more difficult to
appear convincing and compassionate on video. ``It's still a very
harsh medium,'' says Peter Bleakley, a partner with Arnold &AMP; Porter
in Washington. ``All your mannerisms come across as very
exaggerated.'' In addition, you don't have the benefit of reacting
to the body language of a judge or jury member. For example, Gates
had no way of knowing that Jackson would watch his deposition,
shaking his head and smiling at times _ almost as if he was
incredulous at the CEO's assertion that he didn't remember key
events.
</P>
<P>
   It's true the Microsoft team still could decide to put Gates on
the stand. The judge has given each side a silver bullet of sorts
to call another witness, or introduce a key deposition, if
absolutely necessary. But that's not likely. The Microsoft team
probably remembers Gates' other Washington performance, when he
appeared before Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah's judiciary committee
earlier this year. That time, the real Bill came across as even
more combative and condescending with his
``If-only-you-understood-technology'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   While virtual Bill wasn't terribly helpful to Microsoft's case,
it could be that it's better than having the real Bill take the
stand.

</P>
<P>
   Washington, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- David Boies, the U.S.
government's lead lawyer in its antitrust case against Microsoft
Corp., is the consummate legal warrior who loves courtroom combat.
</P>
<P>
   Once a defense lawyer for International Business Machines Corp.
in its successful 13-year antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice
Department and its competitors in the 1970s, Boies, 57, has
switched sides. He's taken a big pay cut to do battle for the
government against Microsoft in a case that comes to trial
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Boies walked away from a partnership last year at the Wall
Street firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore after a dispute over his
representation of the New York Yankees. That cost him a
compensation package of more than $2 million a year, although it
left him free to pursue work of his own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is a free spirit,'' says Houston lawyer Joe Jamail, both
an adversary and ally in several major court fights. ``He is not a
person who joins a club of collective thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   With the time Boies puts in on the Microsoft case, his
government salary of $100,000 a year translates into an hourly rate
of $50, the Justice Department says, a fraction of the $550 or $600
an hour he usually commands in private practice. Boies also was
required to sell his stock in Microsoft and IBM -- at a profit, he
noted -- to be part of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a handful of significant monopolization cases over
the last 100 years,'' he said. ``This is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest antitrust case since IBM, the Justice Department
and 20 states accuse Microsoft of illegally defending and extending
its Windows monopoly for personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he likes the government's chances of defeating
Microsoft in court because ``there isn't any sensible human being
on the planet -- who is not paid by Microsoft -- who doesn't
believe that Microsoft has monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies said his experience in the IBM case might have been a
small factor in the Justice Department's decision to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is very different from the government's
unsuccessful suit against his old client, Boies said. ``You didn't
have any allegations that IBM restricted the use of its products
once they had been sold the way Microsoft had done,'' he said.
``You didn't have any allegations IBM had gotten together with ...
competitors and tried to restrict competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which rarely hires outside counsel, said
it retained Boies because of his exceptional track record trying
complex cases. ``He's a brilliant litigator, he has a tremendous
amount of experience, he's one of the best in the country,'' says
Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   He's also worked for the government before. Boies was chief
counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the late 1970s and
later represented U.S. bank regulators, helping them recover $1.1
billion from convicted junk bond king Michael Milken and Drexel
Burnham Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's bridge, lawn darts, soccer with his teenage
children or gambling in Las Vegas, Boies relishes competition.
Still, friends say, there's no doubt his favorite arena is the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's exercise is his work,'' said Jonathan Schiller, with
whom Boies started a small firm last year. ``He tends to work every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who lives and practices law in suburban Westchester
County, New York, has crisscrossed the country, taking pretrial
depositions from computer industry executives on the West Coast and
economic experts in Boston. He questioned Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates and other executives at the company's headquarters in
Redmond, Washington. He has worked out of the antitrust division's
main office in Washington and a field office in San Francisco,
where most of the government lawyers on the case are located.
Although he is often on the road, ``he stays in touch quite
frequently. He likes to call home,'' says his wife, antitrust
lawyer Mary Boies, who has her own firm in Bedford Hills, New York.
He will take a ``long flight from Florida'' to get home on a
weekend even if he has to go back Sunday night, she says.
</P>
<P>
   His almost 30-year career includes some of the highest-stakes
battles between large U.S. corporations. Friends and colleagues
attribute his success rate to a phenomenal memory and unusually
heightened powers of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Boies can ``shut everything out of his mind but the moment,''
says Robert Joffee, the new managing partner of Cravath.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only focuses on the critical elements'' of a case, says
George Vradenburg III, a former Cravath colleague on the IBM case
and now general counsel of America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Among Boies' biggest victories was his defense of CBS Corp.
against a $120 million libel suit by Gen. William Westmoreland, the
retired U.S. commander in Vietnam. The suit, challenging a CBS
documentary that said the U.S. military deliberately distorted
enemy strength during the Vietnam War, was dropped before it went
to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Boies successfully defended IBM in a private lawsuit filed by
California Computer Products without ever calling a witness the
trial. The judge threw out the case in mid-trial, persuaded by
Boies that the company's evidence was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Boies also helped Texaco Inc. survive a $10.5 billion jury award
for thwarting Pennzoil Co.'s takeover of Getty Oil. Texaco settled
for $3 billion, allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``For David, if you raise the bar and take away the net, he's
happiest,'' says Mary Boies.
</P>
<P>
   The two met in the late 1970s during the fight over airline
deregulation when she was working in the White House for President
Jimmy Carter and Boies was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He has already tried two other major cases this year. The trials
overlapped for several days, forcing Boies to shuttle between
Florida and New York City. He was in a New York courtroom when the
Florida jury awarded his client $95 million, an experience Boies
likened to ``winning the Kentucky Derby and taking off before you
get the roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies has had plenty of chances to hear juries give his clients
big-money verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he won a $100 million judgment against American
Airlines and $90 million against United Airlines for showing their
reservation systems discriminated against Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   His unorthodox work habits might put off traditionalists in the
bar. ``He will read deposition transcripts at the U.S. Open Tennis
tournament, but not in his office'' or ``call you from an open Jeep
and pay phone in Wyoming,'' Vradenburg said.

   Last summer, Boies interrupted a cross-country Jeep trip with
his 13-year-old son, Alex, to appear at an emergency court hearing
in Philadelphia. ``We parked the Jeep at the airport in
Springfield, Missouri, flew to Philadelphia one night,'' Boies
said. The next day, he said, ``we had the hearing, flew back that
afternoon, got back in our Jeep and continued on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies hardly looks the part of a Wall Street superlawyer. His
slightly shaggy brown hair drops below the collar of his blue suit
that Joffee says ``looks like it was bought off the rack at Sears
Roebuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies drags his suitcase on wheels into courts to be forever
ready for the airplane flight to the next trial date. He wears a
cheap-looking watch with a black rubber wrist band strapped around
the right cuff of his shirt and black Reebok athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a high-school history teacher, Boies grew up in
southern California where, after playing professional bridge and
working such odd jobs as a motel book clerk, he graduated from the
University of Redlands in Redlands, California. He attended
Northwestern University law school in Chicago, then transferred to
Yale where he got his degree.
</P>
<P>
   Married three times, Boies is the father of six children, four
of whom are now lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, loyalty to his favorite baseball team, the New York
Yankees, prompted Boies to give up his Cravath partnership. The
club had retained Boies for its fight with Major League Baseball
over the $93 million Adidas USA Inc. paid to use the team's logos
on sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute put him at odds with one of Cravath's oldest
clients, Time Warner Inc., which owns the Atlanta Braves. Boies had
to choose between a client and the lucrative partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't abandon the client in the middle of
litigation,'' says Boies, who successfully settled the case so
Yankee owner George M. Steinbrenner III could keep the Adidas
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Boies put out his shingle in an office park just north of New
York City and the small firm has grown rapidly. Its client list
includes CBS Corp., Unisys Corp. and comedian Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   Not every case is a winner. In 1993, Boies lost a 1993
price-fixing case that Continental Airlines had brought in Texas
against American Airlines. Such losses aren't occasions for Boies
to fret, says Mary Boies. ``He's not Hamlet, he's always looking
ahead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dislike losing more than most people,'' Boies said. ``But
once it's over, you move on. You strike out. You lose, you wake up
the next morning, You go play again.''

   The next House speaker, Bob Livingston, is 6-feet-4 and is said
to have an explosive temper. Yes, but is he tall and angry enough
to slam-dunk Dick Gephardt?

   Those who know Livingston say he's not shy about using power.
Still, he may find in his new job that wise use of authority is a

   Livingston used to be a prosecutor in New Orleans. One thing
we're sure of is that he didn't leave there because there was no
one left to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a manager,'' Livingston says. If he's right, we can think
of several baseball teams who may make him an offer.
</P>

   After Livingston's mother watched him on TV once as he shouted

office.

</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of this year's elections, the pundits have
spent a great deal of time discussing the impact of the Black vote
and of the Religious Right vote.
</P>
<P>
   But they have ignored the impact of an equally important group
that actually provided more votes for Democrats than the Religious
Right did for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This group could be called the Non-Christian Left -- Jews (3
percent of voters), other non-Christians (7 percent), and those
with no religious preference (9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   According to the exit poll conducted by Voter News Service, the
Non-Christian Left made up 19 percent of voters. In contrast,
whites who identify themselves with the Religious Right made up
only 13 percent of all voters. (White Religious Right voters may
belong to any Christian group).
</P>
<P>
   White Religious Right voters were three-to-one Republican, while
Non-Christian Left voters were two-to-one Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of white Religious Right voters went
Republican and 24 percent voted Democratic. Looked at from a
different angle, white Religious Right Republican voters made up
about 9.5 percent of all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Jews voted Democratic by 78 to 21 percent, other non-Christians
by 58 to 33 percent, and those with no religious preference by 65
to 32 percent. This means that Non-Christian Left Democratic voters
accounted for a little more than 12 percent of all voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Right outnumbers the Non-Christian Left only in
the South (by 19 to 15 percent). The two groups are about equal in
the Midwest, where the Religious Right accounts for 13 percent of
voters and the Non-Christian Left accounts for 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Non-Christian Left is much larger than the Religious
Right in the East and West. In the East, the Non-Christian Left
accounts for 19 percent of voters while the Religious Right
accounts for 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Non-Christian Left accounts for 25 percent of
voters while the Religious Right accounts for 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers view blacks -- one of the most religious groups
in America -- as the Democrats' answer to the Religious Right, and
there's no question that high black turnout was a key to many
Democratic victories this year.
</P>
<P>
   But elections are won by coalitions, and the Non-Christian Left
is a key part of the Democratic coalition, along with blacks, a
majority of Catholics, and a decent-sized minority of mainline
white Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   There are several major reasons why the Non-Christian Left votes
heavily Democratic. First, non-Christians are a minority in the
United States and therefore highly sensitive to the rhetoric of the
Religious Right, which often seems to imply that only Christians
can be good Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Non-Christian Left is generally liberal on social
issues such as abortion and gay rights, which it often sees as
linked to minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, those who make up the Non-Christian Left are far more
likely than the Religious Right to see a positive role for
government in meeting social needs. They don't necessarily think
that a government program is always the best solution, but they are
puzzled by a mindset that celebrates a victory in defeating federal
funds to modernize and build school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Non-Christian Left is a major political force, it
lacks the cohesion -- not to mention the public relations -- of the
Religious Right.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews have long been a potent political force. But no
other non-Christian religion has become highly influential as such,
and there are no organizations representing people with no
religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is no umbrella organization attempting
to bring non-Christians together as a unified political force. That
may be just as well; ``The Non-Christian Left'' is probably not the
most potent organizing label ever devised, and those who make it up
share a belief in inclusion with mainline Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But when you see the umpteenth story about the ups and downs of
the Religious Right, it's a good idea to remember that that's not
the whole story.

Renaissance In Mammoth Computers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
By David Einstein &QL; 
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; Supercomputers are all the rage
these days, with the latest models capable of performing trillions
of calculations per second _ speeds unimaginable just a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And supercomputers, which now are used mostly for government and
academic research, soon will become affordable tools for business,
SGI chief executive Richard Belluzzo told a supercomputer industry
conference this week in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful supercomputers, costing up to $50 million, use
thousands of off-the-shelf chips that work together to solve in
just hours complex mathematical problems that would take an
individual with a hand calculator thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the high end of the market is SGI, with its Cray
division, and IBM, with its SP-class machines. (The Deep Blue
computer that deep-sixed chess champion Garry Kasparov was an IBM
SP.)
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need thousands of chips to have a supercomputer.
In fact, some corporate network computers costing less than $1
million are considered supercomputers even though they have 32
chips or fewer. If it can do about 17 billion calculations a
second, it's in supercomputer territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standard microprocessors and other technologies from the PC
world are making supercomputing systems more cost-effective for
customers and vendors alike,'' Belluzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest supercomputers are being used to simulate weather
and climate changes. They can even predict such things as the path
of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of an amazing renaissance of
supercomputing that suddenly allows us to model, simulate and
forecast extremely complex systems,'' said John ``Beau'' Vrolyk,
senior vice president of SGI's Server and Supercomputer business
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, a report by the British Meteorological
Office predicted that the Amazon rain forest will be dead in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ecosystem model predicts that this dieback will occur over
vast areas of northern Brazil, beginning in the 2040s, resulting
from decreases in rainfall of up to 500 millimeters per year and
increases in temperature of up to 7 degrees,'' the report stated.
``Many regions of tropical grassland will be transformed into
desert or temperate grassland, in areas of India, Africa and North
America.''
</P>
<P>
   One major result of this upheaval, according to the report, will
be a 50 percent increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere by 2050. And that spells runaway global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The report was compiled using a Cray T3E that happens to be one
of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its pedigree, however, the report generated only passing
interest in the media, which appears more concerned with what
supercomputers are capable of doing than with what they actually
do.
</P>
<P>
   The press takes its direction from the industry itself, which is
treating supercomputing like a super-heated competition. Every new
performance record is a cause for boasting, despite the fact that
the computers don't always operate at their limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tendency to focus a little too much on the engine
rather than the activity it's used for,'' Vrolyk conceded.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for instance, grabbed headlines two weeks ago with the
introduction of its latest world-beating supercomputer, dubbed
Pacific Blue. Located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, it
can crunch data at nearly 4 trillion instructions per second,
making it the fastest supercomputer so far.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the speed title from Sandia Red, an Intel computer at
Sandia National Laboratory that has more than 9,000 Pentium chips.

WOLFE IN FULL CRY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The drumbeat for Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in
Full,'' has been sounding for more than a decade now, going all the
way back to 1987. That's when Wolfe painted himself into an
authorial corner by being so rash as to publish a first novel that
rapidly turned into a cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was one of those rare works that
manages to define an era _ in this case the revved-up Reagan '80s.
A fabulous success, the book sold three-quarters of a million
copies in hardcover and bestowed on a grateful vernacular such
immediately ubiquitous terms as ``master of the universe'' and
``social X-ray.'' It also proved that the man who had
revolutionized journalism during the '60s and '70s could shake up
fiction-writing in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   What would the follow-up be? What could the follow-up be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I allowed the pressure to be much too big,'' Wolfe
acknowledges. ``I thought I had to come up with something so
gigantic the world would fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   What he finally came up with was a new novel in which it's the
main character's world that falls down. Charlie Croker, the man
fully in question, is an Atlanta real estate developer who has all
the things money can buy, from a 29,000-acre plantation in south
Georgia to a gorgeous second wife half his age. Alas, a
half-billion dollars of that money belongs to a bank, which rather
eagerly desires its return. How Charlie tries to square his
accounts (financial and otherwise) is to the new book what Sherman
McCoy's efforts to stay out of prison are to ``Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe didn't apply the final touches to ``A Man in Full'' until
August, but the PR percussion began in earnest months ago. Rolling
Stone ran three excerpts last summer. Four weeks before publication
it was nominated for a National Book Award. Two weeks ago Wolfe was
on the cover of Time. Friday the book finally went on sale, and
it's already the best-selling title at the two biggest online
booksellers, amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com. Last night, Wolfe
traded quips with David Letterman on ``The Late Show.'' This
morning he's on ``The Today Show'' and tonight reads at New York's
Town Hall, with a ``60 Minutes'' film crew in tow, kicking off a
nationwide publicity tour with a reading at New York's Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   With 1.2 million copies in print, ``A Man in Full'' is a very
big deal. For pre-tour interviews, Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, Wolfe's
publisher, has taken a $750-a-night suite at the Hotel Carlyle,
JFK's preferred residence when in New York and a citadel of Upper
East Side swank. Wolfe lives barely a dozen blocks away, but FS&AMP;G
is putting its money where its print run is to give him the sort of
PR treatment usually reserved for movie-star junkets.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain logic to Wolfe's getting the full-Hollywood
treatment. The man is a consummate performer, both on the page and
in the flesh _ or, to be precise, in the cloth. ``I must say, I do
enjoy performing,'' he remarks. ``One of the great things about
writing, and about lecturing, which I also enjoy is that you can
become whoever you want to. You don't have to depend on your own
genetic resources, whatever they may be, and that's kind of a nice
thing. Dressing is the same way. People don't realize that dressing
is a way of telling the world both where you think you stand and
how you want to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe says this in a fine, papery baritone. The voice is part of
his performer's arsenal, too, its sedate tones complementing the
flamboyance of his attire.
</P>
<P>
   Today he's wearing a three-piece suit of white wool crepe,
double-breasted, with self-covered buttons, a subtle polka-dot tie
(only Tom Wolfe can make polka dots appear subtle), a white
handkerchief selvaged in brown, off-white socks with blue dots, and
brown-and-white shoes (``I like to think of them as faux spats,''
he says).
</P>
<P>
   The look is very French vanilla, with touches of fudge sauce and
blueberry for contrast. It's easy to believe Wolfe when he says his
favorite leisure-time activity is window shopping and that he owns
only one pair of jeans. ``I bought them in La Porte, Texas:
authentic Double XX Levi's, the kind with stovepipe legs.'' He
utters these words with the avidity of a vicar confessing a
more-than-venial sin. ``I've only worn them when I've had to force
myself to stay in the house to finish some writing, since I knew I
couldn't be seen in public in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he'd probably look pretty good in a pair of jeans.
Wolfe has a Henry Fonda lankiness: a refined angularity. His body
language somehow seems to reside in his joints, and in the
economical way he carries himself one can almost visualize Wolfe as
the college baseball pitcher he once was who, almost 50 years ago,
had a tryout with the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is 67. He and his wife, Sheila, have two children.
Alexandra, 18, is a freshman at Duke, and Thomas, 13, is a junior
squash champion. Two years ago he suffered a heart attack and
underwent quintuple-bypass surgery. But other than a slight tremor
to his hands and a graying at the temples, he presents the same
oddly ageless appearance he has for more than 30 years now. Then,
as now, he seemed far too wise for (itals)enfant
terriblehood.(unitals) Now, as then, he seems far too boyish for
old masterdom. He's the dandy as an updated Dorian Gray (calling
such attention to one's clothes insures little attention is paid to
the person wearing them?).
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's courtly manners match his elaborate style of dress.
They're something he comes by naturally, for behind the foppish New
Yorker is an old-style Virginia gentleman who's the great-grandson
of a Confederate veteran and son of the editor of a journal called
The Southern Planter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For a brief moment, the money manager becomes a
Viennese psychoanalyst, and the investment business seems less the
world of numbers and more the realm of the psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me everything you can about their CEO,'' Fred Kobrick
orders his telephone interlocutor, a stock analyst in Chicago who
follows a hot Internet firm, Lycos Inc., that Kobrick likes. ``What
kind of guy is he? Does he get along with people? How does he cope
with competition?''
</P>
<P>
   It is 9:45 on a clear October morning, and 55-year-old Kobrick,
one of Boston's best-known investment managers, is on a quest for
the unquantifiable. Up to his ears in voice mail and facing an
array of shimmying red and green stock quotes on a computer screen,
Kobrick had long ago crunched numbers on Lycos. Now, 15 minutes
before the Internet company's chief financial officer is due at his
office in Boston's financial district, Kobrick is tackling
intangibles. How he perceives the Lycos culture will later
influence what he does with some of the $250 million that 4,100
investors hold in his three mutual funds and one hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   If the grapefruit-sized crystal ball in Kobrick's 10th floor
office could talk, it might intone that this is the golden age of
the small money manager, even in a market tarnished by volatility.
Having struck out on his own last year with Kobrick Cendant Funds
and Kobrick Capital Management, his mutual fund and hedge fund
firms, Kobrick is among a new breed of independent stock-pickers
staking fresh ground in the heart of America's fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   If the miniature red punching bag nearby had its say, it would
recount the blows Kobrick has endured _ from his partner and fund
distributor, Cendant Corp., a marketing and franchising company
mired in accounting fraud, and from critics, who carp about
Kobrick's surfeit of self-confidence and point out his stumble at
State Street Research &AMP; Management Co. Kobrick eventually managed
$4 billion at the Boston fund house, where his high returns made
him the star attraction for more than a decade before he tripped in
a market that did not share his penchant for small, fast-growing
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Kobrick greets Lycos chief financial officer Edward M.
Philip, who arrives 20 minutes late with two investment bankers in
tow, ``good thing with all this snazzy technology you guys have
that you don't have any competition.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then grins. Philip twitches, then launches a volley
of statements that make Kobrick happy he owns the stock.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the meeting, Kobrick will have asked his visitor
to describe the most fun part of his job as well as his nightmares.
He will have probed how the Waltham-based company handles the
cultural differences between its East Coast and West Coast
operations as well as how executives get along with each other. At
one pointKobrick jokingly asks Philip, a former Disney executive,
if Mickey Mouse signed his paychecks at the entertainment giant.
But mostly, Kobrick alternates between psychologist and cultural
anthropologist, probing how Lycos positions itself in a brutally
competitive industry. It is a style that stands out in Boston's
conservative money culture.
</P>
<P>
   In an era that has turned millions of Americans into steadfast
fund owners and transformed some big fund houses into regimented
bureaucracies, the daily world of the independent asset manager has
a fluid quality. But in a market now deciding which species, bull
or bear, it belongs to after eight roaring years, Kobrick's bouncy
demeanor belies the edginess most fund managers _ himself included
_ feel these days. While the small ``growth'' companies Kobrick has
always favored recently had their best three-week run in two
decades, such stocks have been pummeled in past years. And while
the Dow Jones industrial average has staged a mini-rally in recent
weeks, clawing back half of what it lost from its July peak,
Kobrick is still wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred's still an analyst, looking at companies,'' says Peter S.
Lynch, Fidelity Investments' legendary former stock-picker, who sat
next to Kobrick in 12th-grade English at the old Newton High
School. ``He's flexible; he'll look at all types of companies. Some
people get caught in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Lycos meeting ends at 11:10 a.m., Kobrick strides into
his trading room. Seconds later, like it or not, shareholders in
Kobrick's Capital, Emerging Growth, and Growth funds have cast
their lot with 50,000 more Lycos shares.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick wants not projector slides but a window onto the
corporate soul. Such views are gained over years of analyzing a
company's management. ``If I just heard the stories from the
brokers and never got to do my own grilling, I'd get taken,''
Kobrick says, peering over a wooden ``More buyers than sellers''
sign facing a prominently placed photograph of Kobrick and Clinton.
``I really like to know these companies in depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Large fund firms often send an array of analysts into meetings
with companies, leaving lead managers less leeway to conduct the
unexpected, intuitive questioning that is Kobrick's trademark. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Kobrick nearly engaged in dissection of a different
sort &UR;  &LR; before the sight of a cadaver put an end to his original plan
to become a surgeon. A three-year stint as a Navy photographer took
him to Cuba and southern France before he returned to Boston to
study economics at Boston University. After finishing Harvard
Business School in 1971, he joined a small, local firm, Wellington
Asset Management, before jumping to State Street in the go-go
investment days of the mid-1980s.

SOULFUL AND SEXY: WITH `LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,' MICHAEL'S ARTISTRY
MATURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The irony _ and marketing possibilities _ of a much publicized
sex scandal have not been lost on pop star George Michael, whose
double-disc ``Ladies and Gentlemen _ The Best of George Michael''
(Epic Records), has hit the record stores.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing the required flutter of public scrutiny, which
included his own coming out during a CNN interview, Michael has
turned his April arrest in a Beverly Hills park and lewd conduct
conviction into an unexpected shot of career adrenaline and source
of candid humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside,'' one of two new songs on ``Ladies and Gentlemen,''
is an irresistible slice of retro-disco grooves. The song is
peppered with sly humor, including police sirens and lyrics about
the incident. The accompanying video parodies the park incident and
features Michael dressed in a police uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond manipulating the media, however, ``Ladies and Gentlemen''
displays Michael's continual diversity and maturity as a pop artist
over the past 14 years. Even ``Careless Whisper,'' Michael's first
hit as a solo artist, is infused with a rich, soulful quality
missing from much of today's pop music.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 songs are divided into two sections, ``For the Heart''
and ``For the Feet.'' Every one is worth a listen, and each of
Michael's three solo albums is well-represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith,'' ``Father Figure'' and ``I Want Your Sex'' are
glimmering representations of Michael's late '80s sex-symbol status
(1987's ``Faith'' album); ``Praying For Time'' and ``Freedom 90''
reflect the singer's dismay with his own pop-culture saturation
(1990's ``Listen Without Prejudice: Volume 1''); and ``Jesus to a
Child,'' ``You Have Been Loved'' and ``Spinning the Wheel'' are
overlooked gems from Michael's mature and introspective 1996 album,
``Older.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and Gentlemen'' also points up many of Michael's
artistic achievements beyond the bounds of pop music. He was the
first white male vocalist to duet with soul-queen Aretha Franklin
(``I Knew You Were Waiting For Me''); and ``Faith'' became the
first album by a white solo artist to top the R&AMP;B albums chart.
</P>
<P>
   That soulful intensity is evident on a number of rare gems and
album cuts that pop up on the collection. ``A Moment With You,''
the second new track, is a jazzy, laid-back plea for love; ``Heal
the Pain'' soars on its joyful chorus and delivery; and Michael's
rendition of Bonnie Raitt's ``I Can't Make You Love Me'' is a
pared-down moment of somber beauty that was previously only
available as a hard-to-find import.
</P>
<P>
   Michael stirs things up a bit on ``Desafinado,'' a Brazilian
duet with Astrud Gilberto originally featured on the ``Red Hot +
Rio'' compilation. Also included are ``Too Funky,'' an infectious
dance track from 1990; ``Star People 97,'' a No. 1 club jam from
Older; and ``Killer/Papa Was a Rolling Stone,'' a thundering cover
featured on a 1993 Freddie Mercury tribute EP.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of another artist, ``Ladies and Gentlemen'' might
play like a carefully timed career comeback or, at the very least,
a holiday-planned cash cow. Take Michael's advice, though, and
listen without prejudice. The voice behind the image is still one
of the strongest in the realm of popular music. &QL;

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... Southern Planter.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wolfe's affection for the South is evident throughout the new
novel, and Charlie Croker's first wife pays glowing tribute to his
hometown, noting, ``in Atlanta, things (itals)Richmond(unitals) ...
had (itals)authenticity(unitals).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an extremely happy upbringing,'' Wolfe says. ``I
remember getting down on my knees every night to say my prayers _
we were Presbyterians _ thanking God for letting me live in the
best nation in the world and the best state in the nation. Virginia
did have the most presidents, after all. Is Massachusetts next? Ah,
I guess it's Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an upstairs window in our house, you could watch the
fireworks at the Virginia State Fair each fall. My parents would
give my sister and me a dozen nickels each and send us by ourselves
through the woods over to the fair. We'd spend all day there.
Everything cost a nickel. Imagine, even in Richmond, letting two
children off by themselves like that today. That's how simple life
was.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be so, but it was Wolfe's affinity for the ``wild,
bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping Baroque'' complexity of modern
American life that made his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Virginia's Washington and Lee University
in 1951, he got a doctorate in American studies at Yale. ``I didn't
really know what I wanted to do,'' he explains. ``I always knew I
wanted to write, but that wasn't a job you could just walk into. So
I went to Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he knew he didn't want to do was join the
professoriate. Instead, he entered journalism: three years at The
Springfield Union; three at The Washington Post; and then a
marriage made in media heaven, four years at The New York Herald
Tribune. More than three decades after its demise, the Trib remains
unrivaled in the annals of American newspapering as the
quintessential writer's paper. When it hired Wolfe, it got a
consummate stylist about to burst his journalistic cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   Like the space program, American culture was taking off on
rocket boosters _ and Wolfe was the first one to provide the solid
fuel to put it into prose. Writing for Esquire and the Trib's
Sunday magazine, New York, Wolfe alternately celebrated and mocked
a new breed of eccentric-hero, characters like the record producer
Phil Spector, the stock-car racer Junior Johnson, the disc jockey
Murray the K, Playboy's Hugh Hefner. These were unfettered,
deliriously American creatures, and to limn them Wolfe forged a
comparably idiosyncratic style. Ellipses, italics, exclamation
marks, onomatopoeia, repetition, leitmotifs, a very knowing
hyperbole: the look, sound, and feel of journalism would never be
quite the same again. What Muhammad Ali was in the boxing ring,
Wolfe was in print: dead on precisely because he was so over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   It's long since become legend how Wolfe, facing a tight deadline
and unable to get a handle on the material he'd gathered for an
article about Southern California car customizers, typed up in a
single sitting all his notes for a 49-page memo to Byron Dobell,
Esquire's managing editor. Dobell simply lopped off the ``Dear
Byron'' at the beginning and ran it as ``The Kandy-Kolored
Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby.'' That was 1963, and neither
American journalism nor Wolfe's career has settled down since.
</P>
<P>
   The New Journalism it was called. Wolfe may not have been its
first practitioner (that honor probably goes to Norman Mailer) or
its most daring (that was Hunter S. Thompson during his heyday),
but he was its acknowledged master. Even those who dismissed what
he was doing, such as the critic Dwight Macdonald, conceded Wolfe
was the most exotic of high-wire acts.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to have his finger on the racing pulse of postwar
America as Wolfe did. He offered up a string of titles that became
instant catchphrases: ``radical chic,'' ``the Me Decade,'' ``the
right stuff.'' And even when he went against prevailing fashion _
casting a cold eye on the drug culture in ``The Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test,'' sending up liberalism a la mode in ``Radical Chic,''
deriding modern art in ``The Painted Word'' _ he remained the
center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   The slightness of much of his subject matter could make Wolfe's
stylistic flourishes seem excessive. But given the right subject,
as was in ``The Right Stuff,'' his paean to masculine courage as
personified by the Mercury astronauts and test pilot Chuck Yeager,
Wolfe had no journalistic peer.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Right Stuff'' days give Wolfe a somewhat iconoclastic
perspective on John Glenn's return to outer space. ``The greatest
thing in any country is the man who has protected his fellow
countrymen at the risk of his own life. That's what Glenn did back
then. He was a David against the Goliath of the Soviet Union.
Remember, a lot of NASA's rockets were blowing up. He was laying
his life on the line. It's indescribable how heroic that seemed at
the time. What he just did was boring to most Americans. I didn't
even bother to watch it. It was a great thing for NASA, though, and
they need all the support they can get. They can hardly keep the
lights on down in Houston. You've never heard a peep from them
about flying saucers, have you? They know that what they really
need is a sighting of some truly menacing UFO _ then you'd watch
their budget take off.''
</P>
<P>
   His 11-year struggle with ``A Man in Life`` has left Wolfe eager
to tackle new projects. He wants to write a book on neuroscience
(``What we amount to is a string of molecules hooked up to a
chemical analog computer''), as well as one on status in
contemporary America. Taking up the nonfiction cudgels doesn't mean
he's given up on the novel, though. He's already begun to research
one on education (``whenever I've mentioned this notion to people
it's made them yawn terribly, but I'm convinced it's a very hot and
exciting topic'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm still in love with the notion of what can and
can't be done with fiction. It's new to me, even though I'm 67....
And even though it's taken me a total of 18 years to write these
two novels, it still seems new to me. I'm still committed to
proving that detailed realism _ or naturalism, (the 19th-century
French novelst Emile) Zola called it _ is the only way to do
fiction.''

 &HT;    Cheaper not better in nutcrackers
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There it sits. Sure, an occasional guest will pick up the
flimsy, silver-colored gadget sticking out of the bowl, hoping for
an interactive snack. But chances are they will be frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   What we really need is a more effective nutcracker, the better
to bring the nuggets out of their shells. With that in mind, we set
out to compare:
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous, cheap (Good Cook brand, $1.59 at Kroger, with
two picks) cast aluminum tool is made in China. It has two arms
separately mounted to a third crosspiece. You simply put the nut
between the arms and squeeze with one hand. While it works well
enough if you just need a nut or two, much more and your hand will
be sore tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   A step up is Bonny brand ($3.99, Publix), a handheld version
made in Italy. It has a hinge at the top connecting two coated
metal arms that swing open wide enough to accommodate any nuts or
shellfish. It is difficult to get a good grip on and seems to work
best with small hands and on nuts with soft or medium shells. But
after just a few uses, its painted coating was starting to wear
off. This one would do for a young person parked in front of the TV
watching Thanksgiving Day parades who still wants to make a
contribution to the feast.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, especially for people with larger hands, is the Bar
Works nutcracker made in China and sold by Ekco ($5.57, Wal-Mart).
It doesn't open quite as wide as the Bonny and is top-hinged and
designed to be squeezed with one hand. Its more substantial size
and weight help crack nuts with far less effort.
</P>
<P>
   For really effective nutcracking, though, you have to go beyond
the grocery to a hardware store _ beyond top hinges to tabletop
models employing leverage and cams.
</P>
<P>
   One is Duke's Easy Pecan and Nut Cracker ($9.49, Ace Hardware),
made in China of machined steel. A threaded cone adjusts for sizes
from large walnuts to small hazelnuts. Rest the nut between the
cones and pull down on the lever. With very little effort, you can
crack a lot of nuts in a little time. The design also protects the
nuts, delivering pressure on both ends and cracking them in the
middle, allowing you to remove the shells without mashing the
nutmeats more often than not. The unit sits on a plank of wood and
should be fastened to a work surface or, at least, screwed to a
heavier, wider wood plank like similar models made half a century
ago and still working well.
</P>
<P>
   None we tested compared with the simple charm, though, of an
antique owned by Brock Smith of Dawson County, who found it in an
old house in Florida. When his wife, Gail, needs some nuts for her
holiday baking, Smith attaches the small cast iron unit to the
porch railing at his Lake Lanier home, sending pecan shells flying.
</P>
<P>
   A hammer works, too.

 &HT;    Get Cracking
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a bowl of mixed nuts on your coffee table, remember?
</P>
<P>
   You scooped them out of the bins at the grocery store as one of
the first sure signs of fall and good things to come.
</P>
<P>
   So pretty, so seasonal. And probably, so ... neglected. Chances
are they will sit there decoratively, uncracked, through
Thanksgiving, a couple of holiday parties, maybe even till
Valentine's Day before winding up as squirrel food in the compost
bin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they can be a pain to crack. But what a pity to waste the
crunchy morsels, their various flavors as rich and identifiable as
the shapes, tints and textures of the tough shells in which they
are locked. There may be a few common walnuts and pecans, but what
else? Hazelnuts that look like tiny acorns, dark and exotic Brazil
nuts, teardrop-shaped almonds. If only you had the time to crack
them open, you'd find the ingredients for distinctive holiday
creations, like an almond cake with bits of boiled orange peel or
green beans dressed up with mustard seeds and hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for those of us unwilling to invest the labor, most
nuts are available, year-round, in forms that are just as
convenient as we desire _ cracked, shelled, whole, in halves,
pieces or ground _ so long as you're willing to pay the price.
Hazelnuts in the shell in the grocery bin may cost just $1.99 a
pound in November, but a 2-pound bag of shelled hazelnuts anytime
will set you back $18.50 at Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   If you are lucky enough to have a few pecan trees, there are
still businesses around like Patrick Feed &AMP; Seed in Covington
(770-786-3220), where they will crack the nuts for you for 25 cents
a pound. If you're looking for crackers in other locations, try
asking at hardware or feed stores for the nearest one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are folks eager to put in the effort to crack and
shell nuts, measuring the value in terms other than pounds or
cupfuls.
</P>
<P>
   For Kathy Attaway of Augusta, for instance, it's the memories
they conjure _ of helping her invalid mother make fruitcakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would always make two at one time,'' she recalled, ``one to
have for Thanksgiving and one to keep for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   After her mother, Betty Jane Davidson, became too ill to cook,
she would sit at the kitchen table and instruct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would crack the walnuts or pecans and pick out the nutmeat
pieces _ one nutmeat for me and one for the bowl,'' Attaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Partee's nutcracking memories are not so fond. Through an
ad in the Farmers and Consumers Market Bulletin, she practically
begs scavengers to haul off the droppings of her five-tree
``nuisance'' crop of black walnuts in Social Circle.

   ``It's a good nut, if you can ever get to the meat,'' Partee
said. ``Sometimes, you can hit them with a hammer and it'll just
bounce off.''
</P>
<P>
   She said many older people, some in their 80s, have taken her up
on the deal. ``Up in that age they are willing to fool with them
and do what it takes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And what it takes sounds nutty to some.
</P>
<P>
   Lurene and Rogers Odell of Oakwood go through a ritual that
includes drying the green husks, hanging them in net bags and
cracking them with a hammer. Only then can the retired couple sit
down for one in an almost unbroken chain of long evenings picking
out the walnut bits.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the attraction isn't the $18 a quart they get selling
a quart of nutmeats through the Market Bulletin. It's just
something they've done for 20 years, enjoying both the work and the
result, Mrs. Odell said.
</P>
<P>
   When a cupful goes into a poundcake or a handful into a batch of
brownies, Mr. Odell may grimace at the amount of work being stirred
into the batter. But the result takes Mrs. Odell back to her
mother's kitchen and an icebox fruitcake that defined the holidays
when she was a child.

BREAD PUDDING MAKES IT TO THE BIG TIME

<P>
   Like fruit cobbler, bread pudding is a homey comfort dessert
that's made it to the big time. Devised by thrifty cooks as a way
to recycle stale bread, bread pudding has been traced to Colonial
times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda Hegeman and Barbara Hayford, authors of
``New-Fangled, Old-Fashioned Bread Puddings'' (St. Martin's Press,
$10.95), it must have been an everyday dish. They found no
reference to it in formal menus from Colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   Bread pudding has made a great resurgence in the '90s. Modern
cooks are more concerned with taste than thrift. You'll find bread
pudding on most upscale restaurant menus. Trendy chefs have given
the humble dessert status by using such exotic ingredients as
croissants, specialty breads, gingerbread, apples, white chocolate,
macadamias, hazelnuts, chocolate chips, dried cherries or
cranberries, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, brandy, rum and liqueurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hegeman and Hayford define old-fashioned bread puddings as those
made from the basics _ stale bread, eggs, milk and sugar, with only
raisins and spice thrown in for flair. Newfangled bread puddings
are innovative combinations of ingredients such as those mentioned
above.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs bake extra bread for bread pudding or use leftover
unused bread. Croissants, cinnamon-raisin bread, cranberry-orange
bread, rolls and muffins also can be used; adjust the sugar
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making your own
</P>
<P>
   The following tips are from ``New-Fangled, Old-Fashioned Bread
Puddings:''
</P>
<P>
   Bread:
</P>
<P>
   Use bakery or bakery-quality bread instead of commercial brands.
If you don't have a favorite bakery, check supermarkets; most have
in-store bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   Some acceptable commercial breads: Pepperidge Farm Original for
recipes requiring firm-textured white bread; canned New England
brown bread; and tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, French bread and Italian bread are similar
and may be used interchangeably as long as measurements remain the
same in cups or ounces. Because the shapes of French and Italian
loaves may vary, the number of slices is not an accurate
measurement when making substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Crumbs are made from bakery breads. Never use commercially
packaged crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Day-old or stale bread is bread that has lost some of its
moisture and is firmer, drier and more crumbly than fresh bread; it
is not hard or brittle.
</P>
<P>
   When you cannot use day-old bread immediately to make bread
pudding, wrap it in plastic wrap, overwrap with aluminum foil and
freeze until ready to use. Do not refrigerate bread; this does not
preserve freshness and does not stale the bread.
</P>
<P>
   Leftover bread, cranberry-orange bread, rolls and pastries may
be used instead of plain bread. Adjust sugar accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   To make ``instant'' stale bread: Place fresh bread slices, cubes
or crumbs in a 300-degree oven until they begin to lose some of
their moisture. Or leave bread uncovered to air-dry several hours
or overnight. Do not overdry the bread.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't wish to use the crusts, remove them before drying
the bread; it's harder to do after the bread is stale.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs:
</P>
<P>
   Use Grade A large eggs unless otherwise stipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Do not taste uncooked egg mixtures because of the potential
danger of salmonella poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   When beating egg whites, use a large clean, dry bowl. Egg whites
should be room temperature, Even a speck of yolk in egg whites will
keep them from beating up properly.
</P>
<P>
   Egg substitutes generally can be used instead of eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Milk:
</P>
<P>
   Hegeman and Hayford recommend using whole milk, half-and-half
and/or whipping cream.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts:
</P>
<P>
   Use fresh nuts. Toasting them improves the flavor. Store nuts in
airtight containers in the refrigerator or freezer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About the custard
</P>
<P>
   There are several correct methods for preparing the custard for
bread pudding, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   In many recipes, the liquid is heated before it is added to eggs
or the egg mixture. Heating the liquid tempers the eggs to keep
them from curdling, starts the cooking process and shortens the
final cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   If using this method, bring the liquid just under the boiling
point. Remove from heat when it starts to steam, when a light film
appears on the surface or when bubbles appear at the edge. Add a
bit of the heated liquid gradually to eggs or egg mixture, whisking
constantly until incorporated to keep eggs from curdling. If foam
develops, skim and discard.
</P>
<P>
   In some recipes, the liquid is not heated but is added directly
to the eggs. In sweet recipes, when eggs and liquid are combined
without heating the liquid first, strain the custard through a
fine-mesh sieve.
</P>
<P>
   Some bread puddings are baked in a water bath. Set the bread
pudding pan inside a larger ovenproof pan, place in the oven and
add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the smaller
pan or baking dish. A water bath keeps eggs from cooking too
quickly and helps the pudding cook evenly from the outside to the
center. A pudding with a high ratio of custard to bread should
always be cooked in a water bath. With more bread than custard, a
water bath is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   To test doneness, a sharp knife is inserted into the pudding one
inch from the center; if it comes out clean, the pudding is done.
Lightly press the top of the area where the knife was inserted. If
liquid oozes out of the knife hole, the pudding is not done.
</P>
<P>
   Do not overbake. All puddings continue to cook slightly when
removed from the oven, Hegeman and Hayford say.
</P>
<P>
   When the pudding is done, remove it from the oven and from the
water bath, if used. Place on a wire rack and cool. To store, let
the pudding come to room temperature, cover and refrigerate. Keep
for no longer than five days. &QL;

 &HT;    Get cracking with recipes from Presley's
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTON, Ga._ Georgians know pecans, producing more than any
other state. So it's not surprising that travelers who used to drop
by Presley's Nut House north of Eatonton came looking for pecan
pie.
</P>
<P>
   But Love Presley, who ran the business with her husband, David
Leon Presley, for 15 years, was too busy to bake, what with all her
shopkeeping duties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she sold them the pecans they sought, along with
almonds, peanuts and her own pecan clusters. She also tossed in
tips picked up in the ``retirement'' avocation:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Freeze pecans to keep them fresh. Even if you thaw too many to
use at one time, go ahead and refreeze them. Because they're
oil-based, it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sprinkle almonds on any kind of salad to add a nice crunch.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scatter chopped peanuts on a bowl of soup.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lightly toast any nuts to bring out a richer flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to so many requests for pies and the like led Presley
to publish ``Treasured Recipes,'' a compilation of 48 years' worth
of her own and others' efforts, many calling for nuts. She sold it
as a souvenir, sending her customers home with the book, some nuts
and the potential to experiment on their own.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Georgia pecan crop is expected to be just over half
of last year's _ and the prices will be somewhat higher, making it
an especially good time to fish in the mixed-nut bowl for some
lesser-known nuts and try something new.

   Love Presley's Pecan Pie
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time:
45-50 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Love Presley doesn't know how many of these pies she's made
through the years, but it's one of her favorites. Adding
self-rising flour helps prevent a common problem with pecan pies _
runny filling _ and chopping the pecans before adding them to the
filling makes cutting the pie easier.
</P>
<P>
   3large eggs, slightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>

<P>
   1 1/2cups pecans, chopped or halves
</P>
<P>
   19-inch deep dish pie crust
</P>

<P>
   1 1/2teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   VANILLA GLAZE:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons boiling water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2teaspoons light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   3/4teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   12walnut halves for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Position rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Cut out a circle of
parchment paper to fit inside the pan and press it into the bottom
of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Place the walnuts, Brazil nuts and hazelnuts in the bowl of a
food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process 8 to 10 seconds
or just until the nuts are coarsely chopped. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: Using a triple sifter, sift together the flour,
baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put the eggs in the large bowl of an electric mixer. Using the
beaters or whip attachment, beat on medium-high speed until the
eggs are light in color and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the
sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, taking about 4 to 5 minutes to blend
it in well. Pour in the dark corn syrup in a steady stream,
scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary, and beat for 30
seconds longer. Reduce speed to medium. Blend in the vanilla. Pour
in the melted butter in a steady stream, taking about 30 seconds,
and beat 2 minutes longer. Reduce speed to medium-low. Add the dry
ingredients all at once. Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix for
20 seconds longer. Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in all
the chopped nuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the
pan on a 12-inch square of aluminum foil and bring the edges of the
foil up to form a drip pan.
</P>
<P>
   Center the pan on the rack and bake in the preheated oven 45 to
50 minutes, or until the cake begins to come away from the sides of
the pan and is golden brown, with the top springy to the touch.
(Cakes made with dark corn syrup tend to brown too quickly. If this
happens, place a square of aluminum foil over the top during the
last 10 minutes of baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the cake from the oven and set on a rack to cool for 15
minutes. Run a thin knife around the sides of the cake, then remove
the sides of the springform pan. Invert the cake onto the rack,
lift off the bottom of the pan and carefully peel off the
parchment. Turn the cake top side up. While the cake is still warm,
prepare the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   For the Vanilla Glaze: Put the confectioners' sugar in a medium
mixing bowl. Add the boiling water, corn syrup and vanilla and
blend with a wire whisk until smooth. Brush glaze thinly on the
sides and top of the warm cake, reserving about 1/3 of the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Add the walnut halves to the remaining glaze, turning the nuts
with a fork until coated. (If the glaze is too thick, thin with a
few drops of hot water.) Lift the nuts individually out of the
glaze and position in a circle 1 inch from the edge of the cake,
spacing them evenly. The cake should stand uncovered until the
glaze sets, about a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Storage: Store the cake at room temperature under a glass dome
or in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To toast nuts, preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place nuts in
a single layer on a heavy flat pan with sides, such as a jellyroll
pan. Bake skinned nuts until they turn a light golden color. Bake
unskinned nuts until they develop a sweet, toasted smell. Whole
almonds and hazelnuts can take 12 minutes or more. Stir after 5
minutes and watch carefully so they do not burn.

</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons finely chopped cilantro, plus sprigs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet or wok, heat the butter over moderately high
heat until hot but not smoking. Stir-fry the mustard seeds and
hazelnuts in the butter for 5 minutes, or until the hazelnuts are
browned lightly, and transfer the mixture to a bowl. To the skillet
add the onion, ginger, salt and black pepper and cook, stirring,
until the onions are softened. Stir in the green beans, cayenne,
coconut and chopped cilantro, reduce heat to medium-low and cook,
covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes or until the
beans are crisp-tender. Stir in the hazelnut mixture and lemon
juice, cook until heated through and transfer to a serving bowl.
Garnish with the cilantro sprigs.

<P>
   Note: To clarify butter: In a heavy saucepan over low heat, melt
1-inch pieces of unsalted butter. Remove pan from heat and let sit
3 minutes. Skim the froth from the top, and then strain the butter
through a sieve lined with a double thickness of rinsed and
squeezed cheesecloth into a bowl, leaving the milky solids in the
bottom of the pan. Pour the clarified butter into a jar or crock
and store it, covered, in the refrigerator. _ Adapted from Gourmet

   If you like the intense flavor of orange-slice candy, you'll
love this flourless cake from the Middle East. Boiling the oranges
removes any bitterness from the bits of peel, which nicely balance
the almonds.
</P>
<P>
   2large oranges (preferably seedless navels)
</P>
<P>
   6large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups ground almonds
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   Garnish: Thin slices of peeled orange sprinkled with
confectioners' sugar and a touch of cinnamon, or fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Wash the oranges and boil them whole, with their peels on, in
water to cover until very soft, about 30 minutes. Drain, cool, cut
into quarters and remove the seeds, if any. Process the oranges to
a fairly fine puree in a blender or food processor or by putting
them through a meat grinder. Don't make it too fine. The little
bits of skin, which will not be at all bitter after the long
boiling, are pleasant to bite on.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Beat the eggs in a bowl until
thick, then add the ground almonds, salt, sugar, baking powder and
orange puree and mix well. Pour into a deep 9-inch cake pan that
has been buttered and floured, and bake for 1 hour or longer, until
firm to the touch when pressed with the tip of your finger. Begin
checking after cake has baked for 45 minutes. Remove the pan to a
rack, allow the cake to cool, then turn it out of the pan onto a
serving dish. Serve garnished with orange slices or berries and
whipped cream. _ From ``The New James Beard'' (Knopf, 1981)

<P>
   Even with a ``very prolific'' tree in her yard, food stylist
Mary Ann Clayton of Jasper buys the black walnut meats for these
flavorful, tiny cookies. Husking, shelling and picking out even 1/2
cup of nuts is just too much work when they are readily available
in stores, she says.
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt
</P>

   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped black walnuts
</P>
<P>
   Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sour cream and butter
until smooth. Add the sugar and beat until well blended. Add the
egg and vanilla and beat until well-combined. Stir the flour and
nuts into the wet mixture. Shape into a ball, flatten and cover
with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees and cover cookie sheets with
parchment paper. Divide the dough in half and return one portion to
the refrigerator until ready to use (may be kept refrigerated up to
two days). Roll out the other portion very thinly and cut with a
cookie cutter. Put cookies on cookie sheets and bake for 10 to 12
minutes or until the edges become lightly browned.

   White Chocolate Covered Nuts
</P>

   Makes about 80 pieces Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time:
15-20 minutes Standing time: at least 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   We tested this recipe with hazelnuts, but you can use any nuts
you like. A pound of hazelnuts in the shell will yield about 1 1/2
cups of nuts and, if you've shelled them carefully and not toasted
them too long, which would make them brittle, you should have about
a cup of whole nuts.
</P>
<P>
   1cup whole toasted nuts, such as hazelnuts, almonds, pecans or
walnuts
</P>
<P>
   6ounces (6 squares) white baking chocolate
</P>
<P>
   In the top of a double boiler set over hot water, stir chocolate
squares until melted. Remove pan from heat and let the chocolate
cool until it is no longer runny. Transfer the chocolate into a
small deep bowl and have ready another bowl filled with hot water
over which to set the chocolate if it becomes too thick.
</P>
<P>
   Spear one of the nuts with a clean straight pin and dip it in
the chocolate, coating it completely and letting the excess drip
off. Transfer the nut to a sheet of wax paper and remove the pin
from the nut, gently pressing on the nut with a toothpick or tip of
a sharp knife and make a swirl in the chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the remaining nuts in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   Let the candies stand in a cool place until the chocolate is
set, at least 2 hours. Do not refrigerate. Put them in fluted paper
cases, fitting 3 or 4 in each, or wrap in small foil squares,
available at kitchen specialty shops, and arrange in one layer in
tins.

`L.A. DOCTORS' MISSING A DOSE OF REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Seinfeld'' dead and the ``X-Files'' on life support, I am
in the market for a new favorite television show. My first choice
is WB's ``Dawson's Creek,'' for its hilarious portrayal of Dawson's
parents' open marriage. But there are children in the house, so
``Dawson'' is a forbidden pleasure. Once they are safely in bed, I
can savor ``L.A. Doctors,'' which airs Monday nights at 10 p.m. on
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The ``L.A. Doctors'' in question are four telegenic internists
who have rebelled against Big Medicine and have set themselves up
in a private practice ``where the care isn't managed and patients
matter more than the bottom line.'' Their Santa Monica office has
excellent lighting (and good feng shui, I wager), as well as an
attractive, courteous staff.
</P>
<P>
   Number One Doc Roger Cattan (Ken Olin) drives a Jaguar, dresses
to kill, and has sex with numerous beautiful women. Beautiful
people like basketball star Reggie Miller show up in his examining
room. One male nurse is so beautiful that he posed for
``Playgirl.'' Dr. Sarah Church, played by Sheryl Lee, could be
wearing Spandex on ``Baywatch.'' The lupus patient is beautiful.
She's the one who prepared a home-cooked Chinese dinner for her
care provider, Dr. Evan Newman, played by Canadian actor Rick
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Their beauty is not just skin deep. These docs are noble on the
inside, too. They battle against hard-hearted HMO officials. They
pay more house calls than vaccum cleaner salesmen. They are so
gosh-darned compassionate, I picture them using ouch-less bandages
and penetration-free hypodermics. Judging from the four or five
shows I've watched, the number-one health need in LA is a Viagra
prescription, a conceit that is probably not so far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   In ``L.A Doctors,'' even when things are bad, they're good. Dr.
Newman is the most genteel ex-husband you'd ever want to meet.
Divorced from his beautful, perfect (if hypochondriac) wife, he
sees more of his perfect children that I see of my own (nearly)
perfect children _ and I'm not busy saving the world from corporate
hyenas. Not only does Dr. N have a warm, loving relationship with
his ex-wife, but the writers are setting him up to romance Dr.
Church. On Monday night, she and Dr. Right were engaged in what
Bill Clinton would call inappropriate touching, at least until her
husband showed up. This is LA misery? Throw me in that briar patch!
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with co-executive producer Gardner Stern, I
floated the notion that this practice seemed more glamorous than
many. ``Los Angeles is a minor character in the show,'' he said,
``and there are certain unique characteristics of doing things in
LA. Medicine is not excepted from that.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there are occasional outbursts of crackerjack
writing, mostly accruing to the world-wise Olin character. On
Monday night, he challenged the doctors' code of omerta by
questioning the competence of an assembly-line plastic surgeon. A
couple of weeks ago, he bearded a crooked radiology technician and
explained to him ``how the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, let me explain to you how the television world
works. CBS doesn't care what holier-than-thou columnists think
about its show. It cares about the ratings. So far, the ratings are
not great, but okay. ``L.A. Doctors'' loses its time slot to NBC's
trashy ``Dateline'' and to Monday Night Football, but does well
with female viewers. Stern is cautiously optimistic that the
network will order new shows for spring. A CBS spokeswoman says no
decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   I am not the first to note that ``L.A. Doctors'' continues the
Los Angeles-ification of American television. On the heels of
``L.A. Law'' the networks offered up ``L.A. Firefighters,'' a
special on ``L.A. Lifeguards,'' and ``Leaving L.A.,'' a drama set
in the coroner's office. The logical sequel will be ``L.A.
Journalists,'' about a newspaper where the circulation is always
rising, the editors never speak sharply to reporters, and where the
scrupulously accurate columnists are always, always fair.

   Pumpkin Bread
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL; 
1 cup currants (optional) &QL; 
\ cup spiced rum (recipe developed with Bacardi) &QL; 
1 cup (2 sticks) butter &QL; 
1 \ cups sugar &QL; 
3 eggs &QL; 
1 } cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
2 teaspoons baking powder &QL; 
 &QL; 
{ teaspoon baking soda &QL; 
\ teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
{ teaspoon ground nutmeg &QL; 
[ teaspoon ground cloves &QL; 
1 cup canned pumpkin puree &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 9-by-5-by-3-inch
loaf pan. If using currants, soak them in the rum until it is time
to add to ingredients. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar on medium-high speed
until light and airy. Reduce speed to low and add eggs, 1 at a
time, until well incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   In separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, soda,
salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Stir rum and currants into
pumpkin pure. Add dry ingredients to butter mixture alternately
with pumpkin mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Pour into
prepared pan and bake 1 hour and 40 minutes, until firm to the
touch. Cool 10 minutes in pan, then invert cake onto a wire rack
and let cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   This is best made a day ahead if it is being used for bread
pudding. It can be made 5 days ahead and refrigerated, covered, or
can be frozen as long as 5 months. Makes 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Custard Mixture
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL; 
3 cups half-and-half &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
4 eggs &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 tablespoons gold rum (recipe developed with Bacardi Gold) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mix half-and-half and sugar in saucepan. Bring to a boil,
stirring frequently. Whisk eggs and rum until foamy. Whisk in hot
half-and-half mixture until blended. Makes 4 cups (for 4 servings;
double recipe for 8 servings).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To assemble:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. With a serrated knife, level top of
Pumpkin Bread; loaf should measure 4 { inches wide and 2 { inch
high. Slice Pumpkin Bread in half lengthwise to make 2 square logs.
Cut 16 slices from the first log, then cut each square diagonally
to make 2 triangles. Wrap and freeze second log for another use.
(Or, if making 8 servings, cut second log into slices, then
triangles, in the same manner.)
</P>
<P>
   Place 8 bread triangles in each serving-size custard cup, lining
triangles with points facing up. Pour 1 cup Custard Mixture into
each cup over bread triangles. If desired, scatter 2 teaspoons
chopped candied ginger over each serving. Place cups in a roaster
pan; let sit 10 minutes to allow bread to soak. Place pan in oven.
Pour hot water into roaster pan 1 inch deep around custard cups.
Bake 30 to 35 minutes, until custard is set around edges but still
slightly soft toward the center. Remove custard cups from water as
soon as they are removed from oven. Serve warm. Makes 4 servings.

BEAUJOLAIS ACQUIRES FANS WHO APPRECIATE VALUE, ACCESSIBILITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The third Thursday in November _ Nov. 19 _ is the day the
Nouveau Beaujolais arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Nouveau Beaujolais is the young, fruity wine from the southern
part of France's Burgundy region, originally intended for Paris
bistros. But in the 1970s _ thanks to a lot of hype and promotion _
Le Nouveau caught the world's fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: This is simple quaffing stuff, not something to
lay away for your child's 21st birthday, and the prices reflect it:
Almost all sell for less than $10, sometimes a lot less. That's
good news, Part 1.
</P>
<P>
   Good news, Part 2: Nouveau Beaujolais gets here just in time for
the holidays. Its easy drinkability, affordability, and flavors
that match up well with such holiday fare as turkey, ham and
cranberries make it the perfect holiday wine.
</P>
<P>
   Nouveau-style wines made from gamay grapes are now made in many
other countries, as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red burgundy may be the red wine that inspires the greatest
passion. But it also causes the most frustration.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, there's nothing better; at less than its best, you
want to pour the dreck down the drain and send the winemaker
packing.
</P>
<P>
   Three main problems with red burgundy: very small production,
very high prices and an inconsistent product due to (a) the weather
or (b) lousy winemaking (it's probably a toss-up).
</P>
<P>
   Those old enough to remember when French wines didn't taste like
the rest of the world's know what I'm talking about when I use this
descriptor for red burgundy: barnyard. Doesn't sound very
appetizing, does it? Well, in small doses it can be, as a sort of
complexity index.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, when that barnyard gets too strong ..
</P>
<P>
   That's where the New World or International style of wines comes
in. Such wines are cleaner and usually fruitier. For many American
consumers, that freshness makes up for a lack of complexity that
would be found in the Old Country.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Last January, while on a trip to New Zealand, I
tasted a pinot noir that was quite good. Problem was, it wasn't
available here. Now it is. The 1996 Gibbston Valley Pinot Noir _ 4
stars to 4 { stars _ has bright cinnamon, clove and smoked-bacon
nuances, just like a top red burgundy from, say, Morey St. Denis.
It's not a heavy wine, but it's an awfully appealing one. And it
would grace any holiday table, because the wine can go with so many
foods.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely an International-style pinot noir _ not a
barnyard in sight. It isn't cheap _ in the high $20s _ but you'd
pay two or three times that for a red burgundy that might remind
you of a compost heap.
</P>
<P>
   From Prestige Wine Cellars.
</P>
<P>
   Mention single-malt scotch and don't be surprised to hear
someone say, ``Oh, I just love Macallan.''
</P>
<P>
   Macallan is a Highland single-malt that uses predominantly
sherry casks in which to age its whisky. Those sherry casks give
the whisky a full, round, deeply mellow flavor, unlike the sharp,
peaty scotches, say, from Islay to the west.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, the distillery released Macallan 1874, a
blend especially formulated to imitate that of a bottle of 1874
Macallan purchased at auction for $7,000. The Macallan distillers
sampled the whisky and decided to see if they could replicate it.
They came pretty close. The ``new'' Macallan 1874 would've cost you
around $140 a bottle then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just in time for the holidays, Macallan has released two
more single-malts. One, the 18-Year-Old Gran Reserva, is a slight
variation on the Macallan theme. The other is a vintage 1946
Macallan, and it is completely different from any Macallan I've
tasted, and I think I've tasted most of the commercial bottlings
around, including one called ``As We Get It,'' 107 proof, in
Scotland some years back.
</P>
<P>
   Macallan's main production consists of a 12-year-old, an
18-year-old and a 25-year-old, ranging in price from $40 for the
12-year-old to more than $200 for the 25-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with Macallan director Peter Fairlie and distillery
manager David Robertson one evening at Anthony's, and tasted these
two new scotches.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-Year-Old Macallan Gran Reserva _ 4 stars _ is actually a
1979 vintage whisky, and it's from casks that were
``first-filled,'' meaning the best of the best. Robertson said he
had to sample 150 casks to find the best, and ``that's a difficult
inventory to keep on top of.'' Somehow, he allowed with a smile, he
managed.
</P>
<P>
   The whisky has a deep mahogany color, and from the four
components, Robertson said, ``You get at once a floral quality, a
touch of orange and cloves, a certain oiliness on the palate and a
slightly resinous finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasten your selt belts, folks, it's going to be a bumpy
financial ride. The retail will be $140-$150 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The 1946 Macallan is an equine of another hue.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: For generations, Macallan was known for its smooth
whisky never ``tainted'' by peat. But during World War II,
distilleries didn't have top priority when it came to the use of
coal. So for several years, Macallan had to rely on peat.
</P>
<P>
   The 1946 Macallan reflects that, although not nearly as
pungently as an Islay malt such as Lagavulin. Peatiness in scotch
whisky is measured in parts per million and is referred to in the
business as ``phenolics.'' Lagavulin and Laphroaig, both from Islay
and known for their peaty qualities, have 35-40 ppm. The 1946
Macallan has about 4 ppm, Fairlie said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1946 Macallan _ 5 stars _ is lightish in color and has a
nuance of citrus, almost lemon, along with some peaty
herbaceousness. Surprisingly, it is not woody, although it was in
oak for 52 years. It is more delicate than the ``regular'' Macallan
bottlings, but it is an incredibly complex whisky.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Macallan didn't make a lot of the 1946, and only 90
cases are coming to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? I'm afraid this is one of those cases where, if you
have to ask, you can't afford it. (The answer follows, right before
the calendar.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Viognier is the floral, honeysuckle-laced wine from France's
northern Rhone Valley. Once just an esoteric blip on the wine radar
screen, it's become fashionable in many unlikely growing places,
including California.
</P>
<P>
   Only two problems with many California viogniers: They're too
expensive and they're overoaked, which turns them into chardonnay
wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. Case in point: the 1997 Martine's
Wines Viognier _ 4 stars _ with all the requisite flavors and no
distracting oak. While the wine could use a little more acidity,
it's clean and pure, and thus much better at $17 than some $30
California viogniers that taste like oak paneling.
</P>
<P>
   This wine comes from Martine Saunier, a Frenchwoman who lives in
California and imports many high-end wines, such as Leroy
burgundies.
</P>
<P>
   From Prestige Wine Cellars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bit of silliness:
</P>
<P>
   This from ``SPAM-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf'' by
John Nagamichi Cho (Harper Perennial, $7.95):
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some SPAM wine,
</P>
<P>
   A nineteen-ninety vintage.
</P>
<P>
   It's still quite lumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1946 Macallan will retail for around $2,500 a bottle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a mathematical certainty,'' he said, speaking about
pyramids generally and not specifically about Global, that at least
85 percent of participants will lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Global goes a step further than basic pyramids: Members said
they are pressured to ``step up'' to a second level where they
start the process all over again at a higher cost. They pay $6,250
to attend one of Global's so-called G-II seminars and then must
recruit two more people at the same cost, each of whom recruits
another two. (The July session in Newton was held to persuade
members to take the second step.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as before, members do not make money until the quota is
met. The process starts yet again at a third level, where members
pay $18,000 for a Global III seminar and must recruit others to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Members who do not step up lose seniority in the pyramid _ a
demotion called ``compression'' _ under a Global policy that steers
members to more expensive levels, former members said.
</P>
<P>
   Global has collected from its members in other ways. Some said
they paid as much as $1,500 a month for marketing aids Global
recommended, such as a special phone service, mass-mailed
postcards, and teleconference services. While acknowledging that
some Global leaders profited from companies that provided those
services, Andersen wrote that no members were required to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Another Global leader who contacted the Globe, Lorenzo Lamantia,
claimed most of those who buy the group's tapes and seminars do not
participate in Global's marketing efforts despite having paid
thousands of dollars for the program.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators doubt that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why else would you spend $1,250 for a set of tapes,'' said
Greg Overturf, an attorney with the Montana Office of Consumer
Affairs, which has received numerous complaints about Global.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mike, a construction contractor from Kentucky who asked that
his full name not be used, said he has been trying to make money in
the Global program since he received a Global postcard last year
advertising easy riches. Already a member of an antigovernment
group with chapters nationwide called the Patriots, he said he
decided to give Global a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fellow told me all sorts of things about how the
government is bringing fear and tyranny on the people,'' he said.
``The only way out is through financial freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   So he joined, thinking Global would give him that freedom. He
bought the tapes and listened to what they had to say: The IRS is
an illegal arm of the government; the Federal Reserve aims to
oppress the working classes; citizens should ``go sovereign'' and
close all US bank accounts and open accounts abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best efforts, however, he said he has brought in
only one recruit. Even so, he stepped up to Global's second level
and attended two seminars. He stepped up again, paying $18,000 for
the third level. He said he paid for marketing services and that he
put thousands in the hands of brokers at Global seminars who
promised huge returns in foreign investments. He said that in all
he has spent $45,000 and has yet to make a dime. He plans to spend
more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure if I follow this thing through, I'll be set,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Global, recruiting prospects is a high-tech affair. Former
members said that upon joining they received a pass code, which
allowed them to receive sales forms, lists of prospects, and other
documents from Global's ``fax on demand'' system. The service
transmits forms from a remote computer prompted by commands punched
on a telephone key pad.
</P>
<P>
   The pass code also allowed members to access Global's phone
system, where training sessions and high-pressure group sales calls
are conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening, members were instructed to ``go to the call,'' a
frenetic teleconference on Global's phone network.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent call, Global leaders for 90 minutes exhorted sales
people to ``go for the money.'' They rehearsed sales scripts and
tactics such as ``the quick flush'' and the ``pencil-you-in
close,'' a means of pressuring reluctant prospects by emphasizing
that waiting to join means coming in lower on the pyramid and
therefore making less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for people who have the desire,'' said one
speaker, who identified himself only as Mike. ``I'm looking for
people who want to make $20,000 on a monthly basis. I'm looking for
people who are going to get excited about this and who are going to
come up with the money any way they can. I have an auto mechanic in
Wyoming who sold his motor home and his rifle to buy the program.
That's the kind of excitement I'm looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask them, `When do you want to start making money? Now or
never, yes or no?' You're looking for desire. No in-between. There
isn't a person in America who can't come up with the money. If they
say, `I don't have the money,' I say, `No. What you don't have is
the desire.'''
</P>
<P>
   Former members said that while participating in the scheme, they
flooded the country with solicitations, subscribing to
Global-controlled e-mail services that sent 10,000 pieces of junk
e-mail a week and to other services that sent out massive
quantities of computer-generated faxes, a process known as
``blasting.'' Global's mass mailer &UR;  &LR; sent out millions of postcards
on behalf of individual marketers, the former members said.
</P>
<P>
   Some cruised the Internet for easy marks. Even the Fraud Forum,
a Web site intended for victims of financial scams to share their
experiences, was fair game. The site shut down this year because of
Global solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proved to be impossible to discourage sales people from the
Global Propsperity Group from trolling on a daily basis for sales
prospects among the visitors to the Fraud Forum,'' the forum said
in a message posted on the site. ``In spite of scores of messages
advising (Global that the site) was a forum about fraud and
definitely not a platform for the sale of $1,250 cassette tapes and
a pyramid-type matrix scheme, they would not stop.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Despite its enormous marketing machine, Global remains largely
hidden, investigators say. Members who step up to Global's higher
levels sign confidentiality agreements that, according to Global
materials, are meant to ``maintain the proper relationship with the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Former members said they leased private mail boxes instead of
giving out home addresses. Global's only known addresses are leased
mail boxes in Lancaster, Mass., and Henderson, Nev., investigators
said. Mail is forwarded from Henderson to another box in Renton
that is registered in the name of a trust in the Turks and Caicos
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leaders seem elusive as well, often using mail drops
and unlisted numbers. ``Every individual, including me, has a
Constitutional right to privacy,'' Andersen wrote in his letter to
the Globe. Andersen's father, a Massachusetts developer, said he is
estranged from his son but believes he may have moved recently to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Struckman, according to those who have met him, is more visible.
A flamboyant disciple of get-rich ventures, he has set Global's
evangelical tone, former members say, conducting recruiting
seminars across the country where he reportedly whipped audiences
into near-religious fervors.
</P>
<P>
   The group's recruiting session in July at the Newton Marriott
was just such a meeting, according to members who attended, and it
drew the attention of Massachusetts regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip from a former Global member, the state's
securities division drafted a cease-and-desist order, and the
division's director of enforcement, Matt Nestor, personally served
it at the hotel. But he and other state officials acknowledge that
such orders have had little effect. Indeed, the group held another
recruiting meeting in the state just weeks after the Newton
session, Nestor said. Global never responded to the
cease-and-desist order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administrative action is not going to be enough'' to stop
Global, Nestor said. ``It's time for criminal authorities to step
in and seriously review these operations.''

OLD PYRAMID SCHEME GOES HIGH-TECH 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a July morning last summer, some 200 members of an
organization called the Global Prosperity Group filled a function
room at the Marriott hotel in Newton, Mass. with one idea in mind:
to get rich.
</P>
<P>
   For eight hours, in an atmosphere likened to a revival meeting,
they hung on the words of a tanned figure with gold on his fingers
and fire in his eyes. As he roamed the aisles with a microphone, he
barraged them with visions of wealth. They could become rich, he
told them. The money was there for the taking. All they had to do
was pay $6,250 to become elite members of the group, and the
opportunity to earn a fortune would be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join me,'' he said, according to one member who was there.
``This is my calling. I am here to spread the word. I want you to
have what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, many pledged to pay the money. And in an
evangelical rapture one called ``electric,'' they lined up before a
microphone that broadcast their voices across a vast conference
call to thousands of other Global members nationwide. One by one,
some of them in tears, they stepped forward and proclaimed, ``I
thank God and Global for this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to state and federal investigators, Global's
message of quick riches is anything but an opportunity. Instead,
they say, Global is a sophisticated pyramid scheme, a charge the
group's leaders deny. Global says its members can earn six-figure
incomes if they buy _ and recruit new members to buy _ a $1,250 set
of audiotapes and a series of ``exclusive offshore seminars in
tropical locations'' that costs as much as $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   With roots in Massachusetts, Global appears to have attracted a
nationwide membership that one Internet watchdog group puts in the
tens of thousands. Global has eluded authorities from coast to
coast by continuing to operate despite administrative orders
banning it in at least seven states, including Massachusetts. Some
investigators believe the scheme has already generated tens of
millions of dollars for its top members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge money machine,'' said one federal investigator.
``I've never seen anything quite like it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what sets Global apart, investigators say, is that it
represents a new generation of scheme, employing every means of the
electronic age _ the Internet, a network of phone systems,
prerecorded messages, and fax retrieval services. With those tools,
it has expanded with great efficiency while staying largely out of
reach of regulators, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Global has done something else new: tapped an apparently
lucrative underground market of angry, disenfranchised Americans
who mistrust the government. Global's tapes and seminars espouse
the same kind of fierce antigovernment rhetoric that erupted around
the 1993 siege at Waco, Texas. &UR;  &LR; Global claims a corrupt,
foreign-controlled US government stands between ordinary citizens
and wealth. The group offers ways for members to discard forms of
identification such as Social Security cards and driver's licenses
and to use offshore trusts to shelter income.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant marketing,'' said Gail Sheppick, enforcement
director for South Dakota's securities division, which in February
banned Global from operating in the state. ``It boggles the mind
how much these people lose. And then they won't go to the
authorities. When you don't trust the government, who are you going
to complain to?''
</P>
<P>
   Some former members who have come forward say that after joining
Global, they were mesmerized by greed and the feverish devotion the
group enforces. They participated in nightly telephone motivational
meetings and teleconferenced prayer sessions, where they asked God
for financial success. Despite hours of work, they said that, far
from getting rich, they found themselves hopelessly in debt, having
spent in some cases more than $40,000 in pursuit of Global's vision
of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Global has attracted the attention of investigators
around the country, authorities have been unable to stop it. Global
has simply ignored various state orders. And while federal
authorities including the FBI, Federal Trade Commission, and Postal
Inspection Service are tracking the group, no federal agency has
taken any formal action against it.
</P>
<P>
   Global has no headquarters. Money and documents appear to be
moved around the country by private mail carriers through a system
of mail drops, often leased under names other than Global. And the
group's leaders can be difficult to locate because of Global's
emphasis on privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to grab hold of,'' said Sheppick.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe was unable to find Global founders Dan Andersen of
Fitchburg, Mass. and David Struckman of Renton, Wash. But after
faxing a list of questions to nine high-ranking members in the
group, the Globe received a six-page letter from Andersen through a
Brookline, Mass. attorney. Andersen declined through the attorney
to be interviewed or to disclose his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global was not an illegal pyramid,'' Andersen wrote in the
letter. He said the group did not respond to state investigators
because they sought ``invasive information about our membership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By refusing to compromise the privacy of our members, which we
believe it is our right to do, negative and overbroad rulings were
issued,'' Andersen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, the costs to litigate the constitutionality of
arbitrary and illegal government action in various forums all over
the United States was and is prohibitive.... In essence, these
government rulings against Global are an attempt to deprive persons
in various states, including Massachusetts, the opportunity to
engage in a home-based business.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators, former members, and Global materials depict a
group whose main goal appears to be a quest for prospects and their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They suck you in and squeeze you dry,'' said Marc Douglas of
Escondito, Calif., who said he has tried to expose Global since
losing thousands to the group a year ago. The group claims he is
merely a disgruntled former member who doesn't represent the Global
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the money,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Global's own promotional material describes what government
officials say is a classic pyramid scheme.
</P>
<P>
   To make money, new members first pay $1,250 for Global's
``Gateway to Financial Freedom'' tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The new members give that money to their ``director,'' the
person who recruited them and who sits directly above them in the
Global organization.
</P>
<P>
   Before they can begin making money themselves, however, new
members must recruit two more people to buy the tapes. Those new
recruits in turn each must bring in another two _ for a total of
six. The original recruit keeps none of that money. It all goes to
the new member's director.
</P>
<P>
   Once the quota is met, that original recruit becomes a director.
``Congratulations!'' a taped lecture exclaims. ``You are now in the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, any recruits the new director signs up _ as well
as their first six new recruits in the pyramid _ will pay the
director. As those people scramble to become directors themselves,
the lecture says, money will flow like water.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we get checks every day from the Federal Express
truck,'' the Global lecturer says. ``We call it the Happy Truck.
It's what keeps us smiling here. That's why I'm sitting here
grinning every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Because pyramids require an ever-increasing number of members to
keep the scheme running, at some point they collapse, said Paul
Luehr, a pyramid specialist at the FTC.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? FROM HEMINGWAY TO PGA, FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS
LOOK FOR WAYS TO REEL IN CUSTOMERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MADELEINE McDERMOTT HAMM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ In the movie ``Gypsy,'' the strippers sang
``You Gotta Get a Gimmick.'' Manufacturers at the giant fall
International Home Furnishings Market here have adopted it as their
theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Making good-looking furniture doesn't seem to be enough in
today's highly competitive retail market. Manufacturers feel the
need to offer the consumer something to identify with _ a
well-known name, or a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest Hemingway sat at a writing desk very much like this one
in the wilds of Africa ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 18th-century piece that inspired this painted commode was
designed by Robert Adam for Osterley Park House in London and is
said to have been made in Thomas Chippendale's workshop. The
original is now in London's famous Victoria and Albert Museum ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sleigh bed was designed by Bob Mackie, the same fashion
designer who creates those fabulous gowns for stars such as Cher
and Carol Burnett and Bette Midler ...''
</P>
<P>
   The key to name-brand collections often is a licensing agreement
with a big design name, such as Lane's year-old blockbuster deal
with Eddie Bauer, which just keeps growing. The home furnishings
industry is on a brand-name binge. Lead singer at the recent market
_ the largest home furnishings trade show in the world _ was
Thomasville, with the scene-stealing Ernest Hemingway Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of research and development went into this body of
furniture, accessories, gifts and textiles produced by 12
companies. The Hemingway Collection should be arriving in retail
stores next year in advance of the centennial celebration of his
birth on July 21, 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the worldly lifestyle and fascinating places the
legendary writer called home, the collection was introduced to
furniture buyers and media at market with an elaborate display in
the Thomasville showrooms. Hemingway's first son, Jack _ who at 75
reminds you of ``Papa,'' as his father was known _ announced his
family's approval at the debut reception.
</P>
<P>
   The author's adventurous spirit is reflected in diverse
furniture designs, which range from exotic to luxurious, all with
informal overtones. The 96-piece collection is divided into four
sub-groups, each named for an influential place in Hemingway's life
and writings: Ketchum, Key West, Havana and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Early favorites with the opening night viewers included the
Nairobi Safari writing desk and folding chair, the hefty Papa
Hemingway leather chair and ottoman with nailhead trim, and the
romantic Havana Iron Canopy Bed with scroll design in the headboard
and footboard.
</P>
<P>
   Woven reed ``twill'' cushioned seat, back and arms give a
distinctive look to the peeled rattan Mombasa dining chairs, shown
with a handsome round dining table pedestal of four columns of
crossbanded rattan. Occasional pieces such as the tall, thin Los
Gatos rattan ``etagere'' and the chunky Tanganyika ottoman covered
in an animal-pattern chenille will make welcome accents in both
traditional and contemporary interiors.
</P>
<P>
   To assure authenticity of the licensed furniture, each
upholstered piece inconspicuously displays a small brass nailhead
branded with an ``H.'' Most other pieces have an unobtrusive metal
identification plate.
</P>
<P>
   Universal broke out of the broad pack of indistinguishable,
middle-of-the-road manufacturers several years ago by signing up
menswear designer Alexander Julian for the Home Colours Collection.
It scored an immediate success, giving Universal a new fashion
image, and each new Julian group has proved a winner. Consumers may
not remember the manufacturer, but they know Julian's name.
</P>
<P>
   This market, American Drew, another manufacturer not known for
setting trends or making headlines, made news with a collection by
fashion designer Bob Mackie, famous for glamorous creations worn by
stars on TV and the stage and at the Academy Awards. The debut
party had veteran buyers' heads turning as slinky models in Mackie
finery drifted through the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie focused on lavish detailing, such as ``twisted bracelet''
drawer handles and carving that looks like embroidery. ``I felt a
need for fancier things,'' he said. ``There's enough country and
Mission already.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional 45-piece collection exhibits a definite
flourish, even drama, including silver leaf accents on some pieces.
Explaining the touch of fantasy some pieces evoke, Mackie said,
``When you close your door, your home can be whatever you wish: a
Moroccan palace, a French chateau, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The cherry bedroom, dining and occasional pieces in the Bob
Mackie Home Collection come in two finishes with fashion-inspired
names _ Sable and Baroque Pearl. Some designs incorporate brushed
steel and marble.
</P>
<P>
   This is Mackie's first venture into furniture designing, and he
readily admits that he had ``a lot of help from the pros.'' He is
already talking about upholstery designs for the next market and
the possibility of other Mackie products for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Two other makers of all-American furniture, Kincaid and
La-Z-Boy, hooked up with popular artist Thomas Kinkade to present
major collections inspired by his romanticized paintings of
landscapes, street scenes and cottages.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade's work has the same nostalgic quality as that of his
idol, Norman Rockwell, and his images can be found on a wide array
of home accessories and collectibles, from limited edition
lithographs and pillows to candles and calendars. Furniture from
the licensed Thomas Kinkade Collection ranges from casual to formal
_ but demonstrates little to set it apart from many other
traditional furniture groups.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fans of Kinkade's art will want the furniture because of
the small inscribed metal plate affirming the pieces' origins. Some
of the items _ such as the useful Chandler's Trunk with doors and
drawers instead of a lift top that means moving everything every
time it's opened _ have a charming cottage look.
</P>
<P>
   At least Kincaid did not decorate the solid pine pieces with
reproductions of Kinkade's art as Stanley did with the ill-fated
Norman Rockwell Collection a few years ago. La-Z-Boy's exclusive
fabrics from Mastercraft, however, do include signature tapestries
depicting scenes from Kinkade paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is said to be the highest form of flattery. But the
PGA Tour Home Collections from Keller and Vanguard missed the
subtlety of the popular golf-inspired Palmer Home Collection by
Lexington and the Pinehurst Collection from Drexel Heritage. Take
away the names, and with the exception of a few minor references,
both successful groups offer desirable, livable design.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, on the other hand, couldn't resist temptation in a few
signature pieces. Most obvious is the Chippendale-inspired dining
chair with the carved figure of a golfer worked into the quatrefoil
back splat and the claw foot gripping a dimpled (wood) golf ball.
An avid golfer might want the locker carved with the PGA logo in
his office, but will many hostesses want golf-themed chairs in the
dining room?
</P>
<P>
   Logos work on T-shirts, scarves and handbags, but Ralph Lauren
doesn't put that familiar polo player insignia on his high-priced
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Famous museums' home furnishings collections, such as Colonial
Williamsburg and Historic Charleston, have long been skillfully
reproduced by quality manufacturers and purchased by discerning
consumers. Latest to join the classy ranks of faithful
reproductions, adaptations and inspired-by pieces is John
Widdicomb's V&AMP;A Museum Furniture Collection.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 exquisite pieces make up the beginning of the first-ever
American licensed collection of furniture from London's Victoria
and Albert Museum, considered by many to be the world's finest
museum of decorative art and design. Widdicomb vice president Hugh
Griffith pointed out that while they are starting with 18th- and
19th-century English furniture (Georgian and Regency styles), the
company's intention is to eventually produce designs from other
countries and periods found at the V&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   There are grand pieces, such as the plush, oversized sofa
inspired by an 18th-century settee with undulating back, high
scrolled arms and carved cabriole legs ending in ball-and-claw
feet. There's an absolutely elegant small Louis XVI-style oval
table inspired by David Roentgen, the furniture designer acclaimed
for his work for Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, there's a mahogany stool upholstered so that
the pleated column is tied in the center to form an hourglass
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Accessorizing the Widdicomb showroom were other licensed V&AMP;A
pieces, such as a striking lamp by Lotus Arts &AMP; Windermere Lamps.
The gold base was inspired by a gilt bronze vase in the museum that
is decorated with cloisonne enamels in a flower and trellis motif.
Coincidentally, the traveling exhibit ``A Grand Design: The Art of
the Victoria and Albert Museum'' is at Houston's Museum of Fine
Arts through Jan. 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on strong at the market are Asian themes, often with a
Western twist. Mission, Arts &AMP; Crafts and Shaker have paved the way
for the clean, simple lines of furniture from the Far East, spiced
by the current infatuation with bamboo, rattan and wicker.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't pure Oriental styling. Most new collections,
including E.J. Victor's Boracay and Century's Silk Road, combine
East with West for more adaptable, contemporary looks. The industry
is calling it Asian Fusion, to borrow a term from the culinary
world.
</P>
<P>
   Century called its introduction Silk Road for the ancient trade
route that reached from the Mediterranean through China. This,
explained Century vice president Bill Hayes, allowed the designers
to incorporate diverse cultural influences in the collection.
Actually, it seems more contemporary than Asian.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most stunning pieces in Silk Road is a grand
headboard directly inspired by the graphic design of the famous
high-back, slightly curved chair conceived around the turn of the
century by Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Another is
an entertainment center, also available as a bar, that's pleasingly
scaled for any room at 6 feet tall, 49 inches wide and 26 inches
deep. Pocket doors make it even more flexible. With spare lines and
tapered legs, it could pass for Art Deco.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Classic Leather's Titanic furniture collection,
granted so much attention at the spring market? Insiders report the
company is hoping the release of the movie on video will bring a
new wave of interest and keep the pricey collection afloat. In the
meantime, Classic Leather announced a licensing agreement with
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. We can expect the first rollout of designs
based on furniture in those glamorous flicks from the '20s and '30s
at the April market.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing promises to continue to grow in the furniture
industry. After all, we still haven't seen Martha Stewart-designed
buffets _ to hold her holiday dining menus _ or chaises to collapse
on when the dishes are done.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a big name or a trendy theme to grab the consumers'
attention these days, but in the end, what sells the furniture is
still good design.

INITIATIVE HELPS YOUNG JEWS FIND MEANING IN THEIR FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Jewish community finds itself at a challenging
crossroad. A major rallying point is fading _ the question of
Israel's survival.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, fund-raising, fighting anti-Semitism, and political
support for Israel were the dominant themes in American Jewish
life. But now these once-energizing forces are crumbling because
Israel's existence is no longer as threatened as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   What's left for many Jews and their leaders is a basic question:
Why be a Jew?
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Jewish leaders have been wrestling with that question
for years, pondering the future of a religious community no longer
as concerned about the fate of the Jewish homeland and enjoying,
for the most part, successful integration into American society.
</P>
<P>
   To much national acclaim, the region's Jewish community is
widely recognized as being on the vanguard of a national movement
to create strategies to stem Judaism's weakening hold on American
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren B. Grabelle, a 22-year-old from Cherry Hills, N.J., is
one example of a new direction in Jewish activism. Grabelle is
spending a year working as a community organizer for Health Care
for All, a Boston nonprofit organization that tries to secure heath
care for the uninsured and underinsured.
</P>
<P>
   Grabelle is one of 10 interns working in various Boston agencies
as part of the Jewish Organizing Initiative, a program designed to
train young Jews in community work and to make clear the historical
link between Judaism and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism demands that we participate in `tikkun olam,' the
repairing of the world,'' said Grabelle, a Rutgers University
graduate who plans to become a rabbi. ``We have to be agents of
change in the world because we are commanded to do so by God and
our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   For Grabelle, that means working to make area hospitals,
especially in cities, accountable to their neighbors by sharing
funds and providing low-cost or free health care. ``We're doing
social justice and we're doing it as Jews,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Jewish Organizing Initiative, which pays the
interns an $18,000 stipend, plan on replicating the program in
other US cities. Some of the other agencies sponsoring Jewish
interns include the Allston Brighton Community Development Corp.,
the Citywide Educational Coalition, and United for a Fair Economy.
</P>
<P>
   By training a growing cadre of young Jewish community organizers
to work with low-income families, the program aims to reverse what
is seen as a decline of ``hands-on'' involvement in social justice
as Jews have become more affluent and moved out of cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Organizing Initiative is a response to the challenge
issued the Jewish community by leaders like Barry Shrage, president
of Combined Jewish Philantropies of Boston and a major national
voice among American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the future vitality of a 3,500-year-old religion,
Shrage argues that there needs to be a better connection between
serious Jewish learning and modern social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To survive, Judaism must be a living tradition, one that is
made relevant through the process of engaging with its laws, its
stories, its people, through drawing connections between the past
and the present,'' Shrage wrote two years ago in a paper on
building a Jewish community for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Jews must commit to social justice not just because their faith
commands them to, but ``because we must respond to the ideals of
our children, who want to be part of a community that is commited
to changing the world,'' Shrage wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Levinson, 24, who is trying to secure a union contract for
workers at a Brookline, Mass. nursing home, certainly sees his
effort as ``sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   As he strives to win community support from local rabbis and
other Brookline Jewish leaders for the union, made up mostly of
immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean, Levinson frames
his argument in religious terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not according these people the respect and the dignity
that the Bible demands of us,'' said Levinson, who is interning at
Local 285 of the Service Employees International Union. ``Our duty
goes beyond our civil responsibility. There is something scriptural
behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   Grabelle sees projects like the Jewish Organizing Initiative as
viable strategies to energize younger Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who feel alienated from Judaism
because they don't see that it has something meaningful to say and
bring to their lives,'' she said. ``I think these kinds of programs
show that, yes, Judaism does have something tangible and useful to
offer today.''

   SUSAN-SMITH _ UNION, S.C._ Linda Russell cannot reach into her
daughter's sick mind to understand her horrible crime. So she looks
for answers along the desolate highway where Susan Smith drove the
night she drowned her two little boys in a lake. For the first
time, Russell is talking publicly about the ghastly small-town
tragedy that sent chills down America's spine. Divorced now and
selling the brick ranch house where the saga unfolded four years
ago, the 54-year-old mother portrayed as cold, uncaring and
hard-edged is telling her story. ``I don't know that anybody
realizes how my family has grieved over all of this,'' said
Russell, sipping coffee and smoking Salem Lights on her back-porch
swing. It's the same place she sat, stunned and silent, on the
night of Nov. 3, 1994, after learning that two of her
grandchildren, Michael and Alex, were dead and their mother had
been charged with murder. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   AUS-UT-REGENTS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ UT regents are expected to
approve the creation of a Regional Academic Health Center in the
Rio Grande Valley that is expected to cost an additional $20
million _ money likely to come from the Permanent University Fund
which funds ``excellence'' programs at UT-Austin and other schools.
The Legislature already has appropriated $30 million to build the
health center, which cities in the Valley have been competing for
heavily. This additional money will enable the board to create
medical research and training facilities to placate Valley cities
that lost out on the center. (Roser, Austin American-Statesman)

   EVERGLADES-RESIDENTS _ EAST EVERGLADES, Fla. _ For decades,
they've lived in an odd limbo, halfway between one of American's
toughest urban centers and one of its most primitive natural
settings. Now the 1,600 or so property owners in the 8.5 square
mile East Everglades are being told their soggy ranches stand in
the way of saving the threatened Everglades. State officials are
expected to decide Thursday (Nov. 12) whether they will buy out the
landowners and return the land to its natural state. If not,
residents hope to get federal money to further drain their land and
end flooding problems. Some residents have already sold out, but
others don't want to be forced off the land, which they've grown to
love. (MWilliam, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 7 p.m.

all their donations in the old cafeteria at Southwestern
University, which was vacated last month when a new student center
opened. This week, students are helping box up the supplies. The
first shipment is scheduled to leave Austin on a Medico plane next
week. Will include info on other Austin-area relief efforts.

   ISRAEL-WYE _ JERUSALEM _ On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to finally have his cabinet ratify
the Wye Memorandum. But, ratification, according to a statement
released Tuesday, will be dependent on the Palestinians voting to
revoke the parts of the PLO charter the calls for armed resistance
to Israel. Why is this so important to Israel? Didn't the
Palestinians already do this? Why are Israel and the United States
fighting over it? (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   HAITI-AMWAY _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ Haitians earn an average
of $250 a year. The economy is in shambles. The future is unclear
due to a political vacuum. But that hasn't stopped Amway from
taking Haiti by storm. About 2,200 Haitians now sell Amway products
in this dirt-poor nation. Amway toothpaste sells for nearly $5.
Amway's 20-piece set of cookware sells for $941. The products have
become a kind of status symbol here the same way Tupperware has in
some parts of Latin America. (Emling, Cox News Service).

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  MAYNARD, Mass. _ In Bill Styslinger's perfect world, everyone
in America would watch a new movie at home every night of the week
_ without ever budging from the couch to rent videos.
</P>
<P>
   As with many dreams, this one always seems to be just out of
reach. Nevertheless, Styslinger, a cofounder and the chief
executive of SeaChange International Inc., is staking his company's
future on selling the computerized video servers and software that
will be needed to make it come true.
</P>
<P>
   The technology involved is called ``video-on-demand,'' or VOD.
Viewers will draw down their evening's entertainment with just a
few clicks of their TV remote controls, from centralized libraries
and archives containing hundreds of digital recordings of movies,
sports events, concerts, or historical events.
</P>
<P>
   As with taped videos, but not possible now with pay-per-view or
movie channels, they could fast-forward, rewind, or pause at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can watch what they want, when they want,'' said
Styslinger, 52, as he discussed the prospects for SeaChange's
product line.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its appeal, video-on-demand has long been an elusive
promise. Consumers taking part in pilot tests have liked it, but
technology has always been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, &UR;  &LR; some of those barriers may be receding. Advances in
digital TV technology and the rapid installation of fiber optic
communications cable across America has some analysts predicting
VOD could make its commercial debut, in scattered parts of the
nation, by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Growth could pick up once a new generation of ``interactive''
set-top control boxes and remote-control devices is developed.
That, too, could happen as soon as next year, and if it does,
analysts expect as many as 7 million US homes will be able to buy
video-on-demand through their local cable systems by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely no more than about a quarter of the homes will
subscribe, says Bruce Leichtman of Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But for five-year-old SeaChange and others that make the video
servers and software that will house those movies and deliver them
on command, that could mean $1 billion in sales, with growth to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Leichtman emphasizes this forecast is very uncertain. For
video-on-demand &UR;  &LR; via cable to work at all, the system must be able
to distribute digital signals and to establish two-way, interactive
communications capability, so customers can order up movies
electronically as well as receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Few systems now have both technologies. None of the major
Eastern Massachusetts cable operators do, and upgrading will will
be ``a bit by bit process'' requiring many years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't necessarily see this in Boston very soon,'' said
Leichtman. The question, he said, is whether SeaChange or &UR;  &LR; its
potential competitors ``can last it out.''
</P>
<P>
   One significant competitor for SeaChange, Diva Systems Corp. of
Menlo Park, Calif., with more than $250 million in equity and debt
financing behind it, has pushed forward anyway, with 1,700
Philadelphia area homes now hooked up to its systems in a pilot
test that involves two cable television companies there.
</P>
<P>
   Diva, founded by industrialist Paul M. Cook using technology
developed by the former Stanford Research Institute and RCA Corp.'s
old David Sarnoff Research Center, proposes to retain ownership of
systems it installs at cable-operator locations, paying the
operators fees based on usage.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms interested in this market, including SeaChange,
contemplate outright sale of their units. The list includes both
big companies _ Sony Corp., Unysis Corp., and Sun Microsystems are
a sample _ and small, niche manufacturers such as Concurrent
Computer Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and CyberStorage Systems
Inc. of Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these rivals have chosen to wait out the lull &UR;  &LR; selling
systems to schools, companies, and government agencies for
educational and training use.
</P>
<P>
   SeaChange chose a different strategy. Since its founding by
three Digital Equipment Co. expatriates, SeaChange has targeted
cable systems, selling video server and software packages that are
tailored to insert local ads into network programming.
</P>
<P>
   These ads, bought by restaurants, auto dealers, retailers, and
others, are broadcast during breaks on CNN, ESPN, and other cable
channels, and bring cable operators significant revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Styslinger says cable operators welcomed automated digital
servers as an alternative to tape-driven systems that required
constant monitoring and were prone to frequent errors.
</P>
<P>
   SeaChange says its systems have been popular with cable
operators because, along with delivering better pictures than tape,
they store programming on disc drives in a format that all but
guarantees breakdowns won't interrupt schedules.
</P>
<P>
   This fault-tolerant format also lets multiple users call up
programming almost simultaneously. At cable stations, this means
the same ad can be scheduled on several channels within a matter of
seconds _ not uncommon during on-the-hour breaks _ but that only
one copy of the ad is needed.
</P>
<P>
   For video-on-demand, it means scores of home viewers could
decide right after supper to watch ``Casablanca.'' Again, only one
copy has to be stored. If, by chance, they all clicked on their
choice at once, some might have to wait a second or two _ but not
so long that they probably would notice, Styslinger said.
</P>
<P>
   SeaChange's systems sell for $100,000 for a single unit and $5
million or more for a multi-unit setup of the size now being
installed in Atlanta, a city of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has sold more than 3,000 servers since
production began in 1994 and claims these represent 65 percent of
all such units sold to US cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Even competitors laud SeaChange's focus on cable TV, because
cable is expected to be the primary supplier of video-on-demand &UR;  &LR; to
home subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has allowed them to meet a lot of the folks who are going
to buy new video servers,'' said E.C. Siegel, chief executive of
Concurrent Computer.
</P>
<P>
   SeaChange also won points when it and Concurrent were chosen
earlier this year by Time Warner Cable as the two participants in a
shakedown test that could determine what the cable giant will buy
for its VOD service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things work in the cable industry, everyone is content
to watch Time Warner and see if they stumble,'' said Stewart
Schley, VOD analyst for Paul Kagan Associates.
</P>
<P>
   That test could begin before Christmas. Time Warner, which did
an earlier, three-year pilot study of video-on-demand &UR;  &LR; in Orlando,
Fla., hasn't said where the new trials will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual for a high-tech start-up, SeaChange's strategy also
produced profits for 12 straight quarters, from late 1994 to fall
1997, as sales rose from $5.7 million in 1994 to $67.9 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in November 1996 at $15 per share,
raising $24 million to finance future growth. By December, shares
were trading at 33 3/4. But sales began slipping by summer 1997,
and SeaChange has been in the red since. For the nine months ending
Sept. 30, SeaChange posted $52.5 million in revenues, compared with
$55.2 million for the comparable period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SeaChange's shares hit a low of 5 3/4 last month, and closed
Tuesday at 8, down 1/8, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   High market penetration is partly to blame, but Styslinger says
threats last winter by telephone companies to compete for cable TV
customers has led to systems postponing new orders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, efforts to crack two other potential markets, hotel
movies and broadcast TV, have moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SeaChange last year bought out a Singapore-based hotel-movie
operator to improve its toehold in cable-related installations in
New York, Chicago, and Honolulu. But hotel movies now are dominated
by companies holding long-term contracts with hotel chains, some of
which won't expire until after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   US broadcast TV stations, which are trying simultaneously to
deal with the technical challenges of launching on-air digital
broadcasting, have also have been slow to buy server units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasters are a very snobbish lot,'' added Ralph Turk,
chief engineer at SeaChange's only on-the-air US customer to date,
KVOA in Tucson, Ariz. ``Broadcasters look at cable and say, `That's
too cheap for us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Styslinger said SeaChange expects no significant revenues from
either hotel or broadcast customers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas sales have gone somewhat better, with sales since last
summer in Finland and France and a deal pending in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   SeaChange's beginnings date to when Styslinger, Edward J.
Delaney Jr., 38, and Edward J. McGrath, 46, were working at Digital
on a project that was aimed at creating sales for its high-speed
Alpha chip, which had more power than most customers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The team found no immediate markets, but did identify a future
in cable TV's need to store and recall huge amounts of video
imaging data. Styslinger got the OK from Digital founder Ken Olsen
to set up a new development unit. McGrath was the top technology
officer, the position he holds today at SeaChange, and Delaney
began cultivating customers.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1991. Two years later, before the product could get
off the ground, Olsen's successor, Robert Palmer, closed down the
project as he battled the mounting losses that led ultimately to
Digital's sale to Compaq Computer Corp. this year.
</P>
<P>
   Styslinger, McGrath, and Delaney asked permission to continue on
their own, and got it. With Digital's sale to Houston-based Compaq,
Styslinger now likes to refer to SeaChange as ``the largest
corporate employer headquartered in Maynard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, SeaChange hasn't used Alpha chips, but _ in an
effort to keep its own costs down by using generic ``off-the-shelf
parts'' _ relies on Intel Corp.'s Pentium.

 &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. does not go softly into hardware. When it
decides to enter a hardware niche, it typically has a good reason.
The rise of graphical user interfaces like the Windows shell
demanded a mouse, and Microsoft is now the big cheese in computer
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's game-software division is a powerhouse, so the
company is trying to conquer the market for game paraphernalia like
joysticks, steering wheels and stereo speakers. William H. Gates
became a daddy, and now there is the Microsoft Actimates
Interactive Barney doll.
</P>
<P>
   And now Microsoft is going after the cordless phone business,
which says a lot about the company's vision for the future. It is a
future that blends telecommunications, consumer electronics and
computing, and it envisions increasing reliance on voice commands
to control common household devices _ that, not coincidentally, use
Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest hardware product is a $199 cordless telephone
that connects to a personal computer and uses Windows-based call
management software. In theory, the Microsoft Cordless Phone
System, officially known as the PC Phone System MP-900, is supposed
to harness the power of the PC to improve the way we use the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of weeks of testing the MP-900, I find it hard to
give it a ringing endorsement. Even so, the ideas behind the PC
Phone System MP-900 are so compelling that I eagerly await version
2.0.
</P>
<P>
   The MP-900 is a black, 900-megahertz cordless phone that comes
with a desktop cradle, a base station that connects to a PC and a
CD-ROM disk with call management software. In general,
900-megahertz phones are significantly superior to the
first-generation cordless phones, which operated at 46 to 49 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   The software enables the user to set up a voice mail system,
with separate voice-mail boxes for each member of a family or small
business.
</P>
<P>
   A voice command system lets the user make calls by simply
speaking the name of the recipient, once that name and phone number
are entered in a speed-dial directory. Up to 40 names can be
entered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to call one's bookmaker, one simply presses the
voice command button on the handset and says, ``Call Weasel.''
(Your bookie's name may vary.) The phone looks up Weasel's number
in the PC database, dials it and logs the call.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first successful examples of speech recognition
in my house, certainly more impressive than when I try to summon my
teen-ager by voice.
</P>
<P>
   If the user subscribes to a Caller ID service through the phone
company, the software can recognize calls from certain individuals
and play a custom greeting whenever that person calls.
</P>
<P>
   The phone handset also uses voice synthesis to announce incoming
calls. ``Gates, Bill, calling.'' Thus, the user can screen calls
even when away from the PC. Voice messages are stored on the
computer's hard disk and can be played back, even from a remote
location.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds great in theory. But to be broadly successful,
consumer electronics devices have to be relatively inexpensive,
simple to learn, easy to use, reliable and so compelling that
people eventually wonder how they ever survived without one.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone is one example, and the radio, the television, the
VCR, the stereo and the microwave oven are others.
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, the Microsoft Cordless Phone has not quite
made the connection. First, $199 is a lot to spend on a
single-line, 900-megahertz analog cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   For just a few dollars more, you can get 2.4-gigahertz digital
spread-spectrum cordless phone with greater range, two-line
capability and protection against electronic eavesdroppers. (The
problem with many analog cordless phones is that your conversations
can sometimes be picked up on the neighbor's baby monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   Or you can buy a 900-MHz digital cordless phone with many useful
features for much less than $199. Sony just introduced several new
900-MHz digital phones, for slightly more money, that match some of
the more appealing features of the Microsoft phone, without the
need for a PC.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 70 percent of American households have a
cordless phone already, fewer than 45 percent have a PC, and of
those, not all have the features needed to operate the Microsoft
phone. These include a Pentium 90 processor (or faster) running
Windows 95 or 98, a vacant serial port, 32 megabytes of RAM, up to
100 megabytes of hard disk space and a Windows-compatible 16-bit
sound card with a microphone and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more appealing features require Caller ID, a
subscription service offered by local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The phone will not work with Windows NT, and there are no plans
to create a Macintosh version, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the MP-900 to my Windows PC was harder than I thought
it would be and required much fussing over serial ports. The
software installed easily, but it refused to work until other phone
extensions on the line were disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The phone's battery must be charged for 10 hours before use,
which might frustrate users who require instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The special call management software is relatively easy to
configure. But it was unnecessarily difficult to import the
hundreds of names and telephone numbers I have collected in
Microsoft Outlook into the new phone's directory. The idea of
re-entering all those numbers manually was too much to bear. The
thought of attempting a link with Sidekick or some other
non-Microsoft contact-management software was truly odious.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I tweaked the software, the phone refused to play
the custom announcements I lovingly recorded for special callers _
the Wicked Witch theme song for one, the submarine ``battle
stations'' sound effects for another, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest drawback is that to take advantage of all
the advanced features, you must leave the PC turned on. If the PC
is switched off or crashes, the MP-900 becomes a very expensive
cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a headset option for the MP-900, which disqualifies
it for use as my primary office phone.
</P>
<P>
   The sound quality of messages played back through my computer's
speakers was erratic, fading in and out. On the flip side, my
digital cellular phone is much less reliable, and I still put up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the MP-900 is a clever device, and its call
management software deserves to be incorporated into future
generations of desktop and cordless phones. But the price is still
a bit steep, the inconveniences still outweigh the advantages, and
non-PC cordless phone technologies offer some of the same features.

   In last week's column about Macintosh OS 8.5, a brief reference
was made to the ``Revision B'' iMac computer. Apple would neither
confirm nor deny what it said were ``rumors'' about the existence
of the new model. Here are the details: Since introducing the iMac
in July, Apple has made several improvements to the original model,
including adding a faster graphics chip and more video RAM (6 MB
versus 2 MB). These Revision B iMacs come from the factory with Mac
OS 8.5 installed instead of 8.1.

   Let the truth be known, I really do miss my Macintosh. I gave up
my Mac a little more than a year ago when I developed a bad case of
tendinitis; to save my hands, I started using Dragon Naturally
Speaking, a continuous speech recognition system. While speech
recognition software is available for the Mac, it doesn't have the
power of Naturally Speaking.
</P>
<P>
   So I was a bit curious when Apple Computer Inc. sent me a review
copy of its newest operating system, MacOS 8.5. Seizing the
opportunity, I decided to try it out with my friend Aaron, a
Mac-intosh enthusiast. U,A,9 - BC-COMPUTERS-COLUMN-BOS, -  &QL;

   Q. I have been unable to log on to my ISP with a v.90 modem at
speeds faster than 26.4K with either my laptop or desktop. But on a
recent trip to the Boston area, I was able to log on much faster
than I ever have here at home using my laptop. The other day a
telephone repairman was working on a switching unit down the
street. I stopped and asked about log-on speeds. He tells me that
in our area where we have fiber-optic cables, that the phone
company uses ``pair gain'' for economic reasons, and that may slow
my connection down. What is pair gain, and is there anything I can
do about it? R,F,: - BC-COMPUTER-ANALYST-FORU, -  &QL;

NETSCAPE'S BROWSER PULLS AHEAD, FOR NOW &QL; 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN &QL; 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Forget the phrase ``browser wars.'' When it comes to creating
software used to surf the World Wide Web, Netscape Communications
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are playing a game of leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   Each company's release of its respective browser is slightly
better than its competitor's _ that is, until the competitor comes
out with a new one. The last time I looked
(www.chron.com/content/chronicle/atchron/97/10/19/compute.html),
Microsoft was in the lead with Internet Explorer 4.01, the
top-notch browser that's also the interface for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Netscape's turn to hop ahead. The Mountain View,
Calif.-based company has released version 4.5 of its Communicator
Internet suite (home.netscape.com), and it's a winner. Microsoft
has been sent back to the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   I spent time with two different versions of Communicator 4.5 _
Windows 95/98/NT and one of the many variations of Unix. I did not
get a chance to review the Macintosh version.
</P>
<P>
   4,000 changes
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has made many changes _ more than 4,000, both internal
and external _ to the way the Communicator Suite works. The
Navigator browser, the Messenger e-mail/-Usenet reader and the
address book have been given overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Communicator's excellence is something called
Smart Browsing, and it's the way Web ccess should have been all
along. Instead of typing a full Web address into Navigator's
location field _ say, www.houstonchronicle.com _ all you need to
do, in most cases, is enter the name of the site _ in this case,
Houston Chronicle. Is that nifty, or what?
</P>
<P>
   This feature alone makes it worth adopting Communicator as your
primary Internet-access software. It's particularly good for novice
users who may be confused by some of the conventions used in
Universal Resource Locators, or URLs.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing works this way. When you enter the name of a site
instead of a URL, Navigator sends the entry to Netscape's Netcenter
Web site. The name is checked against a large database of known
sites, and you're directed to what Netcenter believes is the
correct one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every location in cyberspace is listed. When
Netcenter can't find a match, it runs the entry through its own
search engine. For example, if you enter my name, you won't go
directly to my Web site _ I guess I just don't have that much
juice! _ but you will get the results of a Netcenter search, and
the first choice is my home page.
</P>
<P>
   A companion feature to Smart Browsing is What's Related, a
button just to the right of the location field. If you visit the
Houston Chronicle's Web site and click on What's Related, you get a
list of other newspaper and news sites. Visit a site that
specializes in shareware downloads, and you'll get a list of other
like archives. If there are no matches, you get the option to
search Netcenter for similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to a very powerful combination, making
Netscape's browser a far more useful tool than Internet Explorer
for getting where you need to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two windows rolled into one
</P>
<P>
   Netscape also has made some changes in the way the Messenger
client works and looks. In Communicator 4.0, Messenger was actually
two separate pieces _ a window that showed you all your message
folders, as well as any discussion groups to which you had
subscribed, and another window with the messages themselves. This
seemed like a lot of wasted real estate, so Netscape consolidated
these two windows into one.
</P>
<P>
   In 4.5, you now have a three-paned window, similar to the design
used by Netscape's 3.0 mail client, or Microsoft's Outlook Express.
To the left are the mail folders and news groups. At the top are
the message headers and below are the message bodies. This makes it
very easy to sort mail _ just drag a header from the top pane and
drop it into a folder in the left one.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you'd rather work with a two-pane message window,
just click a button and the folder pane disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The address book is now much friendlier. It will auto-complete
e-mail addresses for you. Type the first few letters of a mail
recipient's name, and Messenger will finish it for you. If there is
more than one address under a person's name, you'll get a list that
lets you choose which to use.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Communicator 4.5 is perfect. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   It still suffers from a serious case of bloat. While it launches
a bit faster than version 4.0, Communicator still has a bigger
footprint than Internet Explorer 4.0, and thus takes longer to
load.
</P>
<P>
   And while it seems to crash less than 4.0, it still dies more
often than it should.
</P>
<P>
   However, Netscape now has added a neat feature that almost makes
a meltdown worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   When Communicator crashes, it generates a detailed log of what
happened. A dialog box pops up that lets you dispatch the log
directly to Netscape, complete with any additional notes you choose
to add. Presumably Netscape's software engineers will use these
details to make the product more stable.
</P>
<P>
   Communicator 4.5 is available in several configurations for
Windows 95/98/NT, Mac and Unix users _ sorry, no Windows 3.1
version is planned. You can get a base, complete and professional
installation. I recommend the complete installation for most users
_ the base version lacks some handy features, and the professional
version is designed for users on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hefty download, at about 14 megabytes for the Windows
version. But it's more than worth the effort.

 &UR; AT 29, AN ELDER STATESMAN OF INTERNET EROTICA &LR;  &QL; 
(js) &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID FIRESTONE &LR;  &QC;  &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   He is the president of his industry's trade group, a well-known
Internet pioneer who has floated above the red ink that has drowned
so many other entrepreneurs, but Mark Tiarra still asks that a
reporter not mention the northern New Jersey town where he conducts
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stuffy place around here,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So let it simply be said that Tiarra works most days in a
nondescript building in Bergen County, not far from Ridgewood,
producing, marketing and carefully manipulating the most popular
commodity on the World Wide Web: adult entertainment. And as a
measure of how rapidly that industry has grown, Tiarra, who has
been in the business only about four years, has become one of its
elder statesmen, a highly sought-after guru who is now making
plenty of money as a consultant to aspiring Webmasters of
cyberporn. He is 29 years old and has the interview spiel down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with basing a business on human
sexuality,'' he said, relaxing in front of an enormous computer
monitor. ``Of course, we don't even do that many hard-core sites.
There's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn't appeal to my
tastes. Our sites try to cross the line between art and erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   He is mildly dismissive of the thousands of coarse, tumbledown
Web sites that fail to surround their flesh pictures with the
proper graphical environment, but for Tiarra, the president of the
United Adult Sites, there is a limit to condescension. The
nonprofit organization, formed in 1996, is the trade association of
adult Web sites. It has established a code of ethics for its 500
members and lobbied in Washington against restrictions like the
Child Online Protection Act, signed into law last month by
President Clinton and immediately challenged by Internet
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department doesn't even know how it's going to
enforce it,'' he said. ``If I were the Supreme Court, I'd be
insulted that they passed it.'' The law penalizes commercial Web
sites that fail to keep ``harmful material'' out of the hands of
minors.
</P>
<P>
   With his long, limp black hair and faint beard, Tiarra looks
more like the musician and record producer he says he would prefer
to be than the pornography industry authority he has become. But he
is immensely knowledgeable and utterly straightforward about the
details of his work, and though he has no business background,
others in the industry say his marketing abilities are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is known as a genius at directing traffic,'' said Fay
Sharp, who runs the XWebexpo, a trade show held twice a year for
the adult Web industry. ``Someone sets up a site and they need to
have traffic into the site or they die. So they call Mark and they
buy traffic from him, and it's not yucky traffic _ it's people who
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, for the uninitiated, refers to the number of people who
look at a Web page, and ideally, give out their credit card numbers
for a peek at password-protected photos. (According to several
industry estimates, more than half the Internet's bandwidth, or
capacity, is taken up with traffic in adult material.) By setting
up carefully manipulative advertisements on his own popular sites,
Tiarra can send his traffic to other sites, charging them for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, he realized that thousands of people had read
about the gold rush of profit possibilities in cyberporn and were
trying to enter the industry with no knowledge or ability. So, just
as in the mainstream computer world, he began selling his knowledge
to new Webmasters, and is now offering complete packages to
entrepreneurs with cash. The basic package starts at $3,499, for
which a buyer gets two galleries of photos, several completely
designed Web pages and a month of consulting advice. The ``platinum
package'' goes for $34,999 and includes a huge gallery of photos,
live video feeds, credit card processing, advertising and three
months of consulting.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Tiarracorp, now has seven full-time employees and
60 or 70 contractors around the world who design the sites. This,
of course, is where the big money is. Thousands of inexperienced
adult Webmasters have gone under with the increasing competition,
but his company has made several million dollars for the last three
years, and his telephone continues to ring as newcomers seek out an
honest reputation in a rough trade filled with swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he had never seen the Internet, coming
late to the industry. He grew up in Bergen County, the son of a
data-processing executive. He was allowed to play with an Apple 2C
and a guitar in high school. He took music in college and later
worked in a printing business until a friend asked him to design a
Web site for a band. He studied the Internet and by 1994 realized
there was only one likely way to make money with it, appealing to a
very old-fashioned instinct. His Web sites range from the grandiose
(``All the Beauty That Is Woman'') to the crass (``The Girls of
Tiarracorp''), but every evening, they are seen by thousands of Web
surfers, many with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 2-year-old son, and I don't want him seeing these
sites until he knows the difference between love and sex,'' Tiarra
said. ``Nobody wants kids on their sites. They cost you bandwidth,
and they don't have a credit card to buy anything you have.''

 &UR; WEB RADIO EXPANDS LISTENING HORIZONS &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; By RACHEL LEHMANN-HAUPT &QC;  &LR;   &QL; 
 &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was taught not listen to the radio while I worked. One of the
fastest-growing Internet industries, Web radio, is based on
breaking that very rule.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of Web radio, both of which can be heard via
streaming-audio technology. One kind is really ordinary radio that
is heard over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web now makes it possible to tune into an out-of-state
baseball game or listen to your favorite college radio station
without leaving town. The other kind of Web radio was created
exclusively for the Internet. Together, traditional broadcasters
and Internet-only start-ups offer more than 1,700 audio channels
that you can listen to through your computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical mass of choice,'' said Larry Magne, editor of
the original edition of ``Passport to Web Radio'' (International
Broadcasting Service, 1997), which describes stations from Texas to
Taipei. (An updated edition, edited by David Walcutt, appeared
earlier this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like www.broadcast.com and the BRS Radio Directory
(www.radio-directory.com) act as portals to thousands of
traditional and Web-only stations.
</P>
<P>
   Magne said that in traditional broadcast markets, many genres,
like classical, are losing out to programming that draws better
advertising. The Web provides a broader range of choice. For
example, Magne said that Radio Beethoven, a tiny classical station
that broadcasts from Santiago, Chile, is one of the best classical
radio stations around (www.beethovenfm.cl/RealAudio/ index.html).
</P>
<P>
   Many Web-only radio stations were founded on the idea of
countering a trend toward less broadcast diversity. Web technology
allows stations to offer niche programs. Some are homespun pirate
stations or stations devoted to only one band, like
www.deadradio.com, which exclusively plays the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the many independent stations, there are larger
Internet-only networks that offer multiple channels of music and
talk. Three of those reviewed here _ Imagine Radio, Netradio and
Spinner _ have eliminated audio advertisements and disk jockey
chatter. They offer a wide variety of programming and, in the case
of Imagine, personalizing programming.
</P>
<P>
   But personalized programming has made many record labels and the
Recording Industry Association of America worry that Web radio will
threaten CD sales. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was
recently signed into law, further secures copyright protection on
line.
</P>
<P>
   While all Web radio stations are required to pay fees to artists
through Ascap and BMI, this new legislation will force Web radio
stations to pay a licensing fee to record labels as well.
</P>
<P>
   The act says customized stations must negotiate individual
contracts with all the labels whose artists they play, and it
forbids stations to play more than two songs in a row from a single
artist in a three-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Record companies don't yet understand the power of user
customization,'' said John Adams, director of programming for
Imagine Radio. ``They have to realize that it can expose new
artists and increase record sales.''
</P>
<P>

   WASHINGTON _ As late as last year, Microsoft Corp. was so
worried about Netscape Communications Corp.'s lead in Internet
software that its senior executives wanted to delay an upgrade of
Microsoft's Windows operating system to gain an edge in the browser
battle, according to internal Microsoft documents released this
week by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of Microsoft's defense in its antitrust trial is
that its Internet Explorer, or IE, browser is a seamless feature of
Windows _ not, as the government contends, a separate product
bundled with Windows in an effort to give it an unfair advantage
against Netscape. The origins of its product strategy, Microsoft
asserts, date back more than four years to a meeting of its
executives in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But internal Microsoft electronic-mail messages released this
week by the Justice Department seem to cast doubt on these defense
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, argues that the e-mail mostly supports its
legal case. ``It shows that they regarded browsing functionality as
part of Windows and were willing to delay an upgrade schedule to
deliver a superior product,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an e-mail exchange between two senior Microsoft
executives in January 1997 _ more than a year after the company
introduced its software for browsing the World Wide Web _ talks of
competing with Netscape as ``pitting browser against browser'' and
refers to ``browser market share as job 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange suggests that at that late date, within Microsoft,
the browser and the operating system were not viewed as a single,
seamless product.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail on Jan. 2, 1997, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior
vice president, writes to Paul Maritz, a group vice president and
the most senior Microsoft executive scheduled to appear as a
witness in the trial, ``I do not feel that we are going to win on
our current path.'' Later, he adds, ``I am convinced we have to use
Windows _ this is the one thing they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Allchin urges Maritz, ``If you agree that Windows
is a huge asset, then it follows quickly that we are not investing
sufficiently in finding ways to tie IE and Windows together.''
</P>
<P>
   The more tightly Internet Explorer can be entwined in the next
upgrade of Windows, Allchin writes, ``the more Netscape will be cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeating Netscape, the e-mail suggests, was such a priority at
Microsoft that it was seen to outweigh the impact a delay of
Windows would have on the computer industry. Sales of new personal
computers, hardware add-ons and software all typically surge in the
wake of an upgrade of Windows, part of the central nervous system
that controls more than 90 percent of personal computers sold
today.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying Windows to embed the browser, is ``the only thing that
makes sense even if OEMs suffer,'' Allchin wrote, referring to
``original equipment manufacturers,'' jargon for computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz shared that view. In a response on the same day, he wrote
that he saw ``little option'' but to fully integrate the browser in
the operating system, ``even if it means missing the OEM window'' _
the delivery time frame that would allow computer makers to install
the upgrade on machines for the 1997 year-end sales season.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows upgrade, code-named Memphis, was initially
scheduled to be released in August or September 1997. But its
arrival was delayed until June of this year, and it is called
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Microsoft started hinting to software developers
and analysts at industry conferences that Memphis might be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never the reason given in public, but industry insiders
believed that the real reason Memphis was being delayed was to
totally integrate the browser and help Microsoft in its
life-and-death battle with Netscape,'' said Richard Doherty,
president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford, N.Y.
``This e-mail does seem to be proof of what Microsoft's intentions
were back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Memphis was delayed even more than Microsoft had thought in
early 1997, partly as a result of Microsoft's $425 million purchase
in April 1997 of Web TV Networks, an Internet-via-television
service. Afterward, Microsoft also decided to include Web TV
software in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer is fully embedded in Windows 98, but the
company released a stand-alone version of its browser, Internet
Explorer 4.0, in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has also said that it became company
policy after a meeting in April 1994 to ``make a big bet on the
Internet.'' Though few concrete plans were made that day, Microsoft
says, there was agreement that Windows should have built-in access
to the Internet, which eventually became its browser strategy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The meeting occurred a couple of days after Netscape was
founded, and suggests, Microsoft says, that its main intention in
the browser battle was to improve its operating system _ not to
crush Netscape, as the Justice Department contends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an e-mail written on June 10, 1994, Steven Sinofsky, a
Microsoft executive who helped organize the April meeting, portrays
a company ambivalent about the Internet and not yet planning a
browser of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit,'' Sinofsky writes, ``that the thought of
`Internet evangelism' is a little like evangelizing water to
Noah.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes the Microsoft message for Windows 95 as ``all the
plumbing you need to connect to the Internet,'' mostly software
protocols for communicating on the network.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sinofsky wrote, ``We do not currently plan on any other
client software, especially something like Mosaic.'' Mosaic was the
name of the browser developed by the programmers at the University
of Illinois, most of whom went on to help found Netscape. Even so,
Sinofsky added that Microsoft was ``investigating possibilities.''

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates _ virtual or real _ wasn't anywhere to
be seen in U.S. District Court here Wednesday. Instead, a
semi-packed courtroom spent the day watching second string Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell lawyer, Theodore Edelman, hammer away at curly-haired
computer scientist Avadis Tevanian Jr., a senior vice president at
Apple Computer, who goes by ``Avie'' in his e-mails. The sparring
centered on Avie's assertion that Microsoft intentionally put bugs
in its operating system, making Apple's QuickTime software crash
with error messages when running on a new version of Microsoft's
popular Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways, between sessions punctuated with laughter at
Avie's in-your-face retorts to Edelman's condescending questions,
though, most observers were whispering about the Main Man, himself.
Bill Gates. Some reporters were peeved that Department of Justice
honcho David Boies had sprung the Gates videotape on them Monday
without warning. A few missed the main attraction entirely. Other
spectators groaned when they learned they wouldn't get another
glimpse of Gates' videotaped deposition until Monday, at the
earliest. ``That's really why I came today,'' confided one DOJ
employee, who just dropped by to check out the action.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Gates is about as far as you can get from
Washington these days. Unlike in many trials, District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson has limited the witnesses in this case to 12
people for each side. Microsoft decided not to call Gates to the
stand. And the Justice Department didn't want to use up its
precious few witnesses with someone hostile to their cause.
Instead, Boies made an end run around the judge's decree by
introducing part of Gates' 20-hour videotaped deposition into court
as evidence. Microsoft's legal team wasn't happy. Of what was
shown, about 40 percent of what was shown was chosen by the
Microsoft legal team.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem hard to believe that Microsoft had a hand in picking
any of the Gates footage. By most accounts, the billionaire
computer whiz came across on a 10-foot courtroom screen as evasive,
defiant, even a bit arrogant. At times, the virtual Bill rocked in
his leather chair, scratching his head, giving short, snappy
answers. Or he'd sit in silence. For seconds. Then he'd give an
obligatory answer.
</P>
<P>
   While it was hardly an Academy Award performance, many find it
inconceivable that Gates' lawyers failed to advise him that the
deposition could be shown in court. Remember Bill Clinton's command
performance in the Lewinsky affair? ``Everyone knows video
depositions can show up in court,'' says one Washington litigator.
``That's why they show up with a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' defense, many lawyers say it's more difficult to
appear convincing and compassionate on video. ``It's still a very
harsh medium,'' says Peter Bleakley, a partner with Arnold &AMP; Porter
in Washington. ``All your mannerisms come across as very
exaggerated.'' In addition, you don't have the benefit of reacting
to the body language of a judge or jury member. For example, Gates
had no way of knowing that Jackson would watch his deposition,
shaking his head and smiling at times _ almost as if he was
incredulous at the CEO's assertion that he didn't remember key
events.
</P>
<P>
   It's true the Microsoft team still could decide to put Gates on
the stand. The judge has given each side a silver bullet of sorts
to call another witness, or introduce a key deposition, if
absolutely necessary. But that's not likely. The Microsoft team
probably remembers Gates' other Washington performance, when he
appeared before Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah's judiciary committee
earlier this year. That time, the real Bill came across as even
more combative and condescending with his
``If-only-you-understood-technology'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   While virtual Bill wasn't terribly helpful to Microsoft's case,
it could be that it's better than having the real Bill take the
stand.

Rowley &LR;  &QC;  &UR; c.1998 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;  (Repeating story published earlier

</P>
<P>
   Washington, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- David Boies, the U.S.
government's lead lawyer in its antitrust case against Microsoft
Corp., is the consummate legal warrior who loves courtroom combat.
</P>
<P>
   Once a defense lawyer for International Business Machines Corp.
in its successful 13-year antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice
Department and its competitors in the 1970s, Boies, 57, has
switched sides. He's taken a big pay cut to do battle for the
government against Microsoft in a case that comes to trial
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Boies walked away from a partnership last year at the Wall
Street firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore after a dispute over his
representation of the New York Yankees. That cost him a
compensation package of more than $2 million a year, although it
left him free to pursue work of his own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is a free spirit,'' says Houston lawyer Joe Jamail, both
an adversary and ally in several major court fights. ``He is not a
person who joins a club of collective thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   With the time Boies puts in on the Microsoft case, his
government salary of $100,000 a year translates into an hourly rate
of $50, the Justice Department says, a fraction of the $550 or $600
an hour he usually commands in private practice. Boies also was
required to sell his stock in Microsoft and IBM -- at a profit, he
noted -- to be part of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a handful of significant monopolization cases over
the last 100 years,'' he said. ``This is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest antitrust case since IBM, the Justice Department
and 20 states accuse Microsoft of illegally defending and extending
its Windows monopoly for personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he likes the government's chances of defeating
Microsoft in court because ``there isn't any sensible human being
on the planet -- who is not paid by Microsoft -- who doesn't
believe that Microsoft has monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies said his experience in the IBM case might have been a
small factor in the Justice Department's decision to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is very different from the government's
unsuccessful suit against his old client, Boies said. ``You didn't
have any allegations that IBM restricted the use of its products
once they had been sold the way Microsoft had done,'' he said.
``You didn't have any allegations IBM had gotten together with ...
competitors and tried to restrict competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which rarely hires outside counsel, said
it retained Boies because of his exceptional track record trying
complex cases. ``He's a brilliant litigator, he has a tremendous
amount of experience, he's one of the best in the country,'' says
Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   He's also worked for the government before. Boies was chief
counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the late 1970s and
later represented U.S. bank regulators, helping them recover $1.1
billion from convicted junk bond king Michael Milken and Drexel
Burnham Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's bridge, lawn darts, soccer with his teenage
children or gambling in Las Vegas, Boies relishes competition.
Still, friends say, there's no doubt his favorite arena is the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's exercise is his work,'' said Jonathan Schiller, with
whom Boies started a small firm last year. ``He tends to work every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who lives and practices law in suburban Westchester
County, New York, has crisscrossed the country, taking pretrial
depositions from computer industry executives on the West Coast and
economic experts in Boston. He questioned Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates and other executives at the company's headquarters in
Redmond, Washington. He has worked out of the antitrust division's
main office in Washington and a field office in San Francisco,
where most of the government lawyers on the case are located.
Although he is often on the road, ``he stays in touch quite
frequently. He likes to call home,'' says his wife, antitrust
lawyer Mary Boies, who has her own firm in Bedford Hills, New York.
He will take a ``long flight from Florida'' to get home on a
weekend even if he has to go back Sunday night, she says.
</P>
<P>
   His almost 30-year career includes some of the highest-stakes
battles between large U.S. corporations. Friends and colleagues
attribute his success rate to a phenomenal memory and unusually
heightened powers of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Boies can ``shut everything out of his mind but the moment,''
says Robert Joffee, the new managing partner of Cravath.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only focuses on the critical elements'' of a case, says
George Vradenburg III, a former Cravath colleague on the IBM case
and now general counsel of America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Among Boies' biggest victories was his defense of CBS Corp.
against a $120 million libel suit by Gen. William Westmoreland, the
retired U.S. commander in Vietnam. The suit, challenging a CBS
documentary that said the U.S. military deliberately distorted
enemy strength during the Vietnam War, was dropped before it went
to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Boies successfully defended IBM in a private lawsuit filed by
California Computer Products without ever calling a witness the
trial. The judge threw out the case in mid-trial, persuaded by
Boies that the company's evidence was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Boies also helped Texaco Inc. survive a $10.5 billion jury award
for thwarting Pennzoil Co.'s takeover of Getty Oil. Texaco settled
for $3 billion, allowing it to emerge from bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``For David, if you raise the bar and take away the net, he's
happiest,'' says Mary Boies.
</P>
<P>
   The two met in the late 1970s during the fight over airline
deregulation when she was working in the White House for President
Jimmy Carter and Boies was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He has already tried two other major cases this year. The trials
overlapped for several days, forcing Boies to shuttle between
Florida and New York City. He was in a New York courtroom when the
Florida jury awarded his client $95 million, an experience Boies
likened to ``winning the Kentucky Derby and taking off before you
get the roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies has had plenty of chances to hear juries give his clients
big-money verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he won a $100 million judgment against American
Airlines and $90 million against United Airlines for showing their
reservation systems discriminated against Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   His unorthodox work habits might put off traditionalists in the
bar. ``He will read deposition transcripts at the U.S. Open Tennis
tournament, but not in his office'' or ``call you from an open Jeep
and pay phone in Wyoming,'' Vradenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Boies interrupted a cross-country Jeep trip with
his 13-year-old son, Alex, to appear at an emergency court hearing
in Philadelphia. ``We parked the Jeep at the airport in
Springfield, Missouri, flew to Philadelphia one night,'' Boies
said. The next day, he said, ``we had the hearing, flew back that
afternoon, got back in our Jeep and continued on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies hardly looks the part of a Wall Street superlawyer. His
slightly shaggy brown hair drops below the collar of his blue suit
that Joffee says ``looks like it was bought off the rack at Sears
Roebuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies drags his suitcase on wheels into courts to be forever
ready for the airplane flight to the next trial date. He wears a
cheap-looking watch with a black rubber wrist band strapped around
the right cuff of his shirt and black Reebok athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a high-school history teacher, Boies grew up in
southern California where, after playing professional bridge and
working such odd jobs as a motel book clerk, he graduated from the
University of Redlands in Redlands, California. He attended
Northwestern University law school in Chicago, then transferred to
Yale where he got his degree.
</P>
<P>
   Married three times, Boies is the father of six children, four
of whom are now lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, loyalty to his favorite baseball team, the New York
Yankees, prompted Boies to give up his Cravath partnership. The
club had retained Boies for its fight with Major League Baseball
over the $93 million Adidas USA Inc. paid to use the team's logos
on sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute put him at odds with one of Cravath's oldest
clients, Time Warner Inc., which owns the Atlanta Braves. Boies had
to choose between a client and the lucrative partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't abandon the client in the middle of
litigation,'' says Boies, who successfully settled the case so
Yankee owner George M. Steinbrenner III could keep the Adidas
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Boies put out his shingle in an office park just north of New
York City and the small firm has grown rapidly. Its client list
includes CBS Corp., Unisys Corp. and comedian Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   Not every case is a winner. In 1993, Boies lost a 1993
price-fixing case that Continental Airlines had brought in Texas
against American Airlines. Such losses aren't occasions for Boies
to fret, says Mary Boies. ``He's not Hamlet, he's always looking
ahead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dislike losing more than most people,'' Boies said. ``But
once it's over, you move on. You strike out. You lose, you wake up
the next morning, You go play again.''

</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of this year's elections, the pundits have
spent a great deal of time discussing the impact of the Black vote
and of the Religious Right vote.
</P>
<P>
   But they have ignored the impact of an equally important group
that actually provided more votes for Democrats than the Religious
Right did for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This group could be called the Non-Christian Left -- Jews (3
percent of voters), other non-Christians (7 percent), and those
with no religious preference (9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   According to the exit poll conducted by Voter News Service, the
Non-Christian Left made up 19 percent of voters. In contrast,
whites who identify themselves with the Religious Right made up
only 13 percent of all voters. (White Religious Right voters may
belong to any Christian group).
</P>
<P>
   White Religious Right voters were three-to-one Republican, while
Non-Christian Left voters were two-to-one Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of white Religious Right voters went
Republican and 24 percent voted Democratic. Looked at from a
different angle, white Religious Right Republican voters made up
about 9.5 percent of all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Jews voted Democratic by 78 to 21 percent, other non-Christians
by 58 to 33 percent, and those with no religious preference by 65
to 32 percent. This means that Non-Christian Left Democratic voters
accounted for a little more than 12 percent of all voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Right outnumbers the Non-Christian Left only in
the South (by 19 to 15 percent). The two groups are about equal in
the Midwest, where the Religious Right accounts for 13 percent of
voters and the Non-Christian Left accounts for 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Non-Christian Left is much larger than the Religious
Right in the East and West. In the East, the Non-Christian Left
accounts for 19 percent of voters while the Religious Right
accounts for 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Non-Christian Left accounts for 25 percent of
voters while the Religious Right accounts for 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers view blacks -- one of the most religious groups
in America -- as the Democrats' answer to the Religious Right, and
there's no question that high black turnout was a key to many
Democratic victories this year.
</P>
<P>
   But elections are won by coalitions, and the Non-Christian Left
is a key part of the Democratic coalition, along with blacks, a
majority of Catholics, and a decent-sized minority of mainline
white Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   There are several major reasons why the Non-Christian Left votes
heavily Democratic. First, non-Christians are a minority in the
United States and therefore highly sensitive to the rhetoric of the
Religious Right, which often seems to imply that only Christians
can be good Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Non-Christian Left is generally liberal on social
issues such as abortion and gay rights, which it often sees as
linked to minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, those who make up the Non-Christian Left are far more
likely than the Religious Right to see a positive role for
government in meeting social needs. They don't necessarily think
that a government program is always the best solution, but they are
puzzled by a mindset that celebrates a victory in defeating federal
funds to modernize and build school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Non-Christian Left is a major political force, it
lacks the cohesion -- not to mention the public relations -- of the
Religious Right.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews have long been a potent political force. But no
other non-Christian religion has become highly influential as such,
and there are no organizations representing people with no
religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is no umbrella organization attempting
to bring non-Christians together as a unified political force. That
may be just as well; ``The Non-Christian Left'' is probably not the
most potent organizing label ever devised, and those who make it up
share a belief in inclusion with mainline Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But when you see the umpteenth story about the ups and downs of
the Religious Right, it's a good idea to remember that that's not
the whole story.

Renaissance In Mammoth Computers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
By David Einstein &QL; 
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; Supercomputers are all the rage
these days, with the latest models capable of performing trillions
of calculations per second _ speeds unimaginable just a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And supercomputers, which now are used mostly for government and
academic research, soon will become affordable tools for business,
SGI chief executive Richard Belluzzo told a supercomputer industry
conference this week in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful supercomputers, costing up to $50 million, use
thousands of off-the-shelf chips that work together to solve in
just hours complex mathematical problems that would take an
individual with a hand calculator thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the high end of the market is SGI, with its Cray
division, and IBM, with its SP-class machines. (The Deep Blue
computer that deep-sixed chess champion Garry Kasparov was an IBM
SP.)
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need thousands of chips to have a supercomputer.
In fact, some corporate network computers costing less than $1
million are considered supercomputers even though they have 32
chips or fewer. If it can do about 17 billion calculations a
second, it's in supercomputer territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standard microprocessors and other technologies from the PC
world are making supercomputing systems more cost-effective for
customers and vendors alike,'' Belluzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest supercomputers are being used to simulate weather
and climate changes. They can even predict such things as the path
of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of an amazing renaissance of
supercomputing that suddenly allows us to model, simulate and
forecast extremely complex systems,'' said John ``Beau'' Vrolyk,
senior vice president of SGI's Server and Supercomputer business
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, a report by the British Meteorological
Office predicted that the Amazon rain forest will be dead in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ecosystem model predicts that this dieback will occur over
vast areas of northern Brazil, beginning in the 2040s, resulting
from decreases in rainfall of up to 500 millimeters per year and
increases in temperature of up to 7 degrees,'' the report stated.
``Many regions of tropical grassland will be transformed into
desert or temperate grassland, in areas of India, Africa and North
America.''
</P>
<P>
   One major result of this upheaval, according to the report, will
be a 50 percent increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere by 2050. And that spells runaway global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The report was compiled using a Cray T3E that happens to be one
of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its pedigree, however, the report generated only passing
interest in the media, which appears more concerned with what
supercomputers are capable of doing than with what they actually
do.
</P>
<P>
   The press takes its direction from the industry itself, which is
treating supercomputing like a super-heated competition. Every new
performance record is a cause for boasting, despite the fact that
the computers don't always operate at their limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tendency to focus a little too much on the engine
rather than the activity it's used for,'' Vrolyk conceded.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for instance, grabbed headlines two weeks ago with the
introduction of its latest world-beating supercomputer, dubbed
Pacific Blue. Located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, it
can crunch data at nearly 4 trillion instructions per second,
making it the fastest supercomputer so far.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the speed title from Sandia Red, an Intel computer at
Sandia National Laboratory that has more than 9,000 Pentium chips.

<P>
   Minutes after the sun rises, Damaris Molero is up and about,
preparing for a 25-mile drive to Miami International Airport _ to
her secretarial job and her son's on-site public school.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 p.m., Molero has eaten lunch with her seven-year-old
son, Cesar, chatted with his teacher, checked his schoolwork, and
greeted other airport employees who stop by the classroom to see
children.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Molero, 28, of South Dade County, Fla., and she will
tell you she has found the answer to an overwhelming problem: How
to balance the demands of her job with the educational and
emotional needs of her young son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my son was in a school where I live, I'd have to hire
somebody to pick him up,'' she said. ``That wouldn't work for us,
but having him in school downstairs from my job does.''
</P>
<P>
   Work-site schools are a hot topic these days. The concept has
spread from its origins in Florida more than a decade ago to
Minnesota, Kentucky, and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and corporate sponsors hail the concept. But some
workplace experts have voiced fear that the desire for more
flexibility and less stress is causing too many people to shape
lives around the demands of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ask ourselves: `Do we really want society to
basically conform to the corporation _ spatially, temporally, or
even in terms of governance?''' said a Harvard University
economist, Juliet B. Schor. ``That seems to be the trend here as
corporate life takes over, and we try to fit everything else,
including our children's schools, around the structure of the
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   If corporations exist for the purpose of making profits, Schor
argues, then the more we build our social structures around the
corporate entity, the more difficult it is to organize our society
around other commonalities.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, work-site schools are catching on.
Hewlett-Packard, First Bank, Mall of America, IDS Financial
Services, and Target Stores have all created on-site schools for
the children of employees.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the Minneapolis School Department has joined with
companies to create public schools based at employee work sites. In
Belleview, Wash., Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a national
child-care chain based in Boston, launched a private school in
September for the children of employees from 20 local firms.
</P>
<P>
   Called Chestnutt Hill Academy, the school, grades 1 through 4,
serves employees of Microsoft, Eddie Bauer, and other local firms.
Working parents pay $8,000 per year to enroll one child in the
school, which says it wants to promote community feeling within the
school's four walls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Regarded as an experiment, and the first private institution
of its kind in the country, the school currently enrolls 50
children, and is open 11 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft business manager Maureen O'Hara, 43, of Redmond,
Wash., the school's summer program and lengthy school year have
eliminated worries about after-school care and camp for her two
boys, 6 and 10. ``Here, school ends in July and then summer camp
begins. That means we don't have to reinvent the wheel every
summer.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Green, a pioneer of work-school arrangements and
president of Jefferson Community College in Louisville, Ky., was a
human resources manager at Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis eight
years ago when he helped develop a high school for teen mothers, on
the corporate campus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the program has 50 students, and a similarschool has
opened at a work site in a Minneapolis suburb. While other at-work
schools served only employees of a given firm, this program was
developed by a company trying to serve its community.
</P>
<P>
   Most work-site schools are run either by private entities such
as Bright Horizons or by public systems that hire teachers, develop
curriculums, and manage classrooms. Employers finance construction
and maintain the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absenteeism among employees is lower. The beauty of it is that
working parents now have time to take care of the meetings with
teachers and the school events,'' says Esterlene Lewis, Miami
Airport liaison to the Miami Dade County schools, which opened the
$470,000 school building at the airport in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the school-at-work concept is a novel idea, one that
points to a fundamental shift in the way we think about schools and
community, say critics. If, in the not-so-distant past, education
belonged to the community triad of home, work, and school, does
this new concept mean we are shifting our schools even further away
from the neighborhoods we barely have time to inhabit?
</P>
<P>
   Caryl Rivers, co-author of ``She Works, He Works: How Two Income
Families are Happy, Healthy and Thriving'' (Harvard University
Press, $15.95), says the school-at-work concept is part of a trend:
Americans are moving back to ``village'' living. These new villages
revolve around work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, people worked and lived right where their
kids were,'' Rivers said. ``They did not have to worry about what
the children were doing, because the children were right there.
Now, we are seeing corporations returning to a village culture. The
up side is that it offers parents reliable child &UR;  &LR; care and
flexibility. You don't have to worry about driving a half-hour to
speak to a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The down side? ``It could lock people into jobs,'' says Rivers.
``If you're unhappy at work and want to leave, you're going to have
to think twice about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McKinley, principal of a Montessori school developed by
Target Stores and the Minneapolis public school system, says that
hasn't been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when parents leave jobs at Target, we keep their kids,''
she said. ``Our school offers more diversity than suburban
districts, and parents like the curriculum, its proximity to
downtown, and the small classes. All those things count.''

TEAM WILL TELL WHETHER CARROLL CAN GET THE JOB DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It is the players who will eventually get
Pete Carroll exalted or fired. The next step in whichever process
is under way comes today, when the Patriots players and coaches
return to work toward what could be the most crucial game of the
Carroll regime _ Sunday in Buffalo against Doug Flutie and the
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Bob Kraft is nowhere near a microphone or a
telephone this week. Last year, after the Patriots had just lost to
Tampa Bay to drop to 6-5, he declined to issue a vote of confidence
to his first-year coach, who, with the help of the players, turned
things around.
</P>
<P>
   The same situation is unfolding this year. Kraft was nowhere
near Foxboro Stadium Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Kraft has said many times that when Bill Parcells left, the
organizational philosophy changed. Though winning was still
expected in the short term, the team got a lot younger.In fact,
they have the second-youngest team in the league. The feeling was
this would enable the Patriots to be a playoff-caliber team for
many years. They would be young, fresh, and competitive and every
few years more younger players would supplant the aging ones.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is times such as these when that philosophy is
tested. When injuries take several core players off the field, it
leaves the Patriots with young replacements who may not necessarily
be ready to start in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   That point is proven by the fact that this year's second
first-round pick, cornerback Tebucky Jones, despite being patted on
the back and verbally praised by his coaches, hasn't made it onto
the field in a key situation even with Chris Canty struggling and
Steve Israel coming off injury problems.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the slide can't be blamed completely on young players
who aren't ready. Willie Clay and Ted Johnson have been missing
tackles; Max Lane, Todd Rucci, and Bruce Armstrong have been
allowing penetration and not opening holes for rookie running back
Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   But it all comes back to a philosophy. If Carroll's job is in
jeopardy, then the philosophy is as well. &UR;  &LR; In many ways, Carroll is
the anti-Parcells, a nicer guy who uses a different approach to
players. He challenges them in private, but never berates them in
public, which is how Parcells seemed to do his best motivating.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial time for the Krafts. It is important for them
to remain a very good team while they sort out their stadium
options.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons and others, the Patriots need to rebound. They
need their veteran players to show leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Clay has already come out and lambasted himself for his poor
play of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself one of the leaders on this team,'' he said,
``and if I can come out and say how bad I've been and show that I'm
doing everything I can to change it, then other guys can do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in situations where there have been a lot of one-on
one tackles rather than having 11 guys around the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually lead by example, by playing well, and I haven't done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said Carroll indeed challenged the team Monday, but he
added, ``All of the guys watched that film, and whether or not you
thought you played good, you have to challenge yourself.
Collectively, to turn this around, it's going to take 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play here and a play there. If a guy messes up one play
here or one play there _ and that's what's happening _ you're going
to have a bad game. It takes 11 guys to make things work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said the team probably won't be able to make many changes
because of the injury situation. Terry Glenn, Willie McGinest, and
perhaps even Vincent Brisby may be back this week, though
linebacker Todd Collins (groin) and Henry Thomas (ankle) look less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Henry, Chris (Slade), they tried,'' said Clay.
``They're hurt. We've got to have guys out there. Just their
presence will make us play better. We have young guys who aren't
ready to be thrown into the fire yet on this level. Maybe on
another team you can work with them. We've got to get our guys
healthy and get our aces back, or it might be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue that has come up is whether players are taking more
time to return from injuries than they did under Parcells. Has Clay
noticed a difference in the recuperative powers of his teammates in
the Carroll era?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Clay. ``It's a matter of, when you're hurt,
you want to play, but you want to be effective when you play. If
you can play, you can play; if you're hurt, you're hurt. When
they're ready to come back, they'll come back. Everybody has to
play with some pain or else you shouldn't play in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said there is no magic potion for turning the team around.
The Patriots need a chemistry check; they need offense and defense
to work toward a common goal.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll must do his best motivational work, because there's
nothing wrong with the X's and O's on offense. Carroll must instill
in his players an attitude that they will not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do anything different,'' said Clay. ``We didn't do
anything different after that Tampa Bay game. We just played up to
our capability. You can practice great but unless you bring it out
there, it don't mean crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what the Patriots could be if the players
don't respond.

AIR ATTACKS LEAVE PATRIOTS DEFENSELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes defensive ranking text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year ago, after 10 weeks of the 1997 National Football
League season, the Patriots' defense was ranked eighth in the
league in giving up first downs via passing.
</P>
<P>
   Today they stand 30th. Last.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Jimmy Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one change in the starting defensive lineup
_ Hitchcock was traded to Minnesota during the draft last spring
for a future third-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday the Patriots can explain how you trade away a
starting NFL cornerback for a third-round pick, especially when
that cornerback becomes a starter for the team with the best record
in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to put the demise of the Patriots' defense so far
this season on the shoulders of Chris Canty. This has been a team
effort.
</P>
<P>
   They have been terrible on pass defense. There is no getting
around it. Right now the big hole in the secondary is the thing
that will keep them out of the playoffs unless they repair it in a
hurry. You cannot win consistently in the NFL while giving up an
average of 14 first downs per game via the pass.
</P>
<P>
   The problem starts up front, where the Patriots have been
getting absolutely no pass rush. Their only sack against Atlanta
last week came on a safety blitz by Steve Israel. In fact, that is
their only sack in the last two games. In nine games this year, the
six defensive linemen have combined for 14 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no consistent pressure on opposing passers. Most of the
time, the Patriots have to resort to blitzing defensive backs, and
when they do that, they leave the secondary vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense can't get off the field. There was one big
game, against Kansas City, when the Patriots held the ball for 41
minutes 48 seconds. But they average 28:46 in time of possession,
23d in the league. Without the Kansas City game, they would be dead
last.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, they miss Terry Glenn more than anything else. The
first thing out of Atlanta defensive back Eugene Robinson's mouth
after last Sunday's game was: ``When (Glenn) doesn't play for them,
it makes a big difference. They have no one to go to right away
with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Patriots, they are 21-10 when Glenn is in
uniform. When he is not, they are 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn and Troy Brown are playing, opponents do not press
the Patriot wide receivers at the line or blitz as much. When the
Dolphins beat New England last month, they blitzed the Patriots
more than they had any other opponent this year. The same is true
for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This has put quarterback Drew Bledsoe in a bind. This year's
offense, under Ernie Zampese, is built on timing. When Bledsoe
drops back to pass, whether he takes three, five, or seven steps,
the ball is supposed to come out of his hand as soon as he sets up,
with the receivers presumably in certain spots on the field. That
timing is destroyed when the cornerbacks are better than the
receivers they are covering and can bump-and-run with them.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case last Sunday. Bledsoe was forced to stand back
there waiting to throw much longer than the passing scheme called
for. That's why he got sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   No opponent fears the Patriot running game. It has not been
productive on a regular basis in decades. The Patriots are fourth
in the league in passing yardage but lack the offensive balance to
consistently score a lot of points.
</P>
<P>
   This coming Sunday in Buffalo, they will face one of the best
defenses in the league in long-yardage situations. The Bills, led
by Bruce Smith, can bring a lot of pressure in a hurry, though to
date, they have not been a big blitz team. But when they see how
Miami and Atlanta have blanketed the Patriots by jamming the
receivers and applying blitz pressure, don't be surprised if they
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   For the New England defense, the key is not to stop Doug Flutie.
The way to beat Buffalo is to shut down the running game. The Bills
average 30 carries a game for 132 yards, better than 4 yards per
carry. What Flutie does best _ play-action and rollouts _ happens
after he fakes a handoff. When the Jets closed down the Bills'
ground game last Sunday (18 carries for 48 yards), Flutie had his
worst game in years.
</P>
<P>
   But the only thing that will keep the Patriots in the playoff
hunt is a defense that finds a way to stop giving up first downs
via the pass at such an alarming rate.

PHOTOS PUT ATHLETES IN A NEW LIGHT

</P>
<P>
   You may have seen these athletes before, but probably not like
this. If women _ and men _ have long grappled with the issues of
sports and femininity, a new book dramatically portrays the two as
easily, gracefully intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a favorable review in Publisher's Weekly asserted
that ``Women Who Win: Stories of Triumph in Sports and Life,''
published by Universe Publishing, would have been stronger if it
had resisted the temptation to show the feminine side of the 22
athletes portrayed.
</P>

   ``Without the more feminine portraits, the athletes wouldn't
have wanted to be involved,'' said Christina Lessa, author and
photographer. ``They don't (often) get a chance to show their
femininity like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In her foreword to the 152-page, oversize book, which
intersperses essays by the athletes with photos both traditional
and surprising, skier Picabo Street agrees, writing that it is
``especially rare and wonderful to be portrayed ... as a person,
not just an athlete. I'm glad to show people that there is more to
me than a ski outfit and an action shot. The audience that reads
this book will see us in a different light and hear us in our own
voices.''

   Lessa, a 32-year-old from New York whose ``Gymnastics: Balancing
Acts'' was published last year, was motivated to immediately
propose the book by the women's Olympic ice hockey team that won
the gold medal in Nagano. After 2 1/2 months of frenzied contacts
and travel, it went to press in June. ``It was pretty grueling,''
said Lessa, whose son, Jake, just turned 1. ``I even went in and
out the same day to the West Coast a couple of times,'' she added,
to get home in time to care for the baby so her husband, actor Owen
Taylor, could get to his job appearing in ``Cats'' on Broadway.

`GREAT BEAR RAINFOREST' MAKES CASE FOR CONSERVATION BEAUTIFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since B.C. Ferries began its ``Lost Coast'' service from Port
Hardy to Bella Coola, hundreds of American kayakers have
experienced the fjords, waterfalls and bears of British Columbia's
central coast.
</P>
<P>
   This fiercely beautiful place has become the center of a fierce
political struggle, which has spurred publication of ``The Great
Bear Rainforest: Canada's Forgotten Coast'' by Ian &AMP; Karen
McAllister.
</P>
<P>
   Using the expansive exhibit format, the McAllisters detail their
explorations of 80 virtually untouched watersheds along the wild
coast and their enchantment with the grizzly bears and wolves with
which they have kept company.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a gorgeous and effective piece of propaganda. Many
of the pristine valleys are scheduled for logging in the next few
years. Having preserved some critical areas, the British Columbia
government has sided with the forest products industry on opening
the rest to road building and chainsaws. B.C. Premier Glen Clark
made headlines last year by referring to Greenpeace protesters as
``enemies of British Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Exaggeration is a fundamental tool of the conservation movement,
and much is on display here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever had country like that in the United States, we've
long since destroyed it with failed forestry practices,'' New York
environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. writes in the book's
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! Just north of British Columbia, giant tracts of Alaska
rain forest have been protected in the Misty Fjords and Admiralty
Island national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   RFK Jr. goes on to talk about British Columbia setting aside
only ``small tracts'' as parks. Kennedy ignores the 850,000-acre
Kitlope Heritage Conservancy Protected Area, touted by
conservationists in the early 1990s as the largest undisturbed
tract of temperate rain forest on Earth. Once a place gets saved,
the environmental movement seemingly forgets about it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the McAllisters get out in their trimaran, however, the
book gains credibility. They make a compelling case that the
coastline has been callously exploited. For instance, more than 3
million sockeye salmon used to return to Rivers Inlet and
watersheds around Owikeno Lake. After nearly 30 years of
clear-cutting and inattentive fisheries management offshore, the
runs have declined to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   The McAllisters find a wolf den with ``a little mound of grey
pups'' in the still-wild Takush Valley off Smith Inlet. A dynamite
blast shatters the silence. International Forest Products is
building a road and soon will be logging the Takush. Interfor is
the same company whose shore-to-summit clear-cuts at Kyuquot Sound
on Vancouver Island were pictured in a National Geographic spread
that should be seen by all connoisseurs of ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   The authors are at their best photographing and writing about
grizzly bears. Convinced that grizzlies can sense when a human
intruder is dangerous, the McAllisters have gone gently into their
habitat. The result is a close-up look at one of the world's great
predators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its agility and ferocity, ursus horribilis is vulnerable
to man and has been driven from the vast bulk of its habitat in
North America. One of the few hospitable places grizzlies have left
is the British Columbia coast.
</P>
<P>
   But grizzlies fishing for salmon are easy prey for hunters. The
McAllisters stumble on an illegal hunting blind in Fiordland
Recreation Area, as well as the skeletal remains of an illegally
killed female grizzly. The British Columbia government has no
reliable population figures, but it permits trophy hunting to
continue. The book accurately conveys a sense of lax regulation and
enforcement, and points to a poaching problem that the province is
loathe to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Bear Rainforest'' has one great weakness: Its
authors seem to have little contact with and little interest in
two-legged inhabitants of the wild coast. The book offers aerial
shots of Prince Rupert and Bella Coola. The McAllisters depict the
smelter-pulp mill town of Kitimat as a pit.
</P>
<P>
   But the book's purpose is not to find common ground with
loggers. It is to keep them out of wild places. The fight over
British Columbia's central coast is not for the fainthearted. With
a hostile government and an industry that still strips trees from
stream banks, international pressure is environmentalists' one
reliable weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its exaggerations, ``The Great Bear Rainforest'' makes a
compelling case that a big chunk of this country _ particularly
timbered estuaries where the grizzlies feed _ should be saved.
Canada is free with its environmental advice to other countries.
Here, it deserves to be on the receiving end.

FUNDAMENTALIST BAPTISTS SPLIT WITH MODERATE TEXAS CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUZANNE HOHOLIK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two Baptist groups met in the same city on the same
day, yet they couldn't have been farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both camps call themselves Baptists. They believe in
Jesus Christ, send missionaries around the world to convert
nonbelievers and read the same Bible.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   Some call themselves fundamentalists. Others like to be referred
to as moderates. They have been unable to see eye-to-eye for more
than a decade on issues that go to the core of their faith: how to
interpret the Bible, whether women and homosexuals can be ordained
to lead congregations, and the role of women in their religion.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, for the first time, the fundamentalists broke away
from the more moderate Baptist General Convention of Texas to meet
as a separate group _ the Southern Baptists of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The General Convention met Tuesday at the George R. Brown
Convention Center with nearly 5,400 delegates, called messengers,
attending. Meanwhile, the 700 messengers of the Southern Baptists
of Texas gathered at a local Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeff Harris, pastor of the Castle Hills Church
Northwest in San Antonio, said the General Convention interprets
the Bible in ways inconsistent with Baptist beliefs. For example,
he pointed to the discussion among moderates that Jesus may not
have been born of a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain issues we don't feel you can waiver on,'' he
said. ``They may say it's a gray area. We don't feel it's a gray
area. They don't draw the hard line.''
</P>
<P>
   At the General Convention gathering, the Rev. Judson Edwards,
pastor of Woodland Baptist Church in San Antonio, said he found the
division sad, but maybe for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for Baptists that we all can't get along, but there's
always been tension and dissension, and that's not good. We've been
dealing with that for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptists of Texas began organizing about four years
ago, aligning themselves with the Southern Baptist Convention, the
fastest-growing Protestant denomination in the United States with
15 million members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The national group agreed to boycott the Walt Disney Co. for its
policy of providing benefits to unmarried partners of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also approved a resolution last summer at their annual
convention stating that wives should be submissive to their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist General Convention of Texas is aligned with the
smaller Baptist General Convention, which has about 2.7 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Because their churches support both organizations financially,
Harris and the Rev. Gordon Graham, associate pastor at Castle Hills
First Baptist Church, attended both conventions.
</P>
<P>
   They said there was no grandstanding when they left the Baptist
General Convention of Texas meeting, no loud comments from the
fundamentalist Baptists, just a ``peaceful exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Graham said he had a lot of friends ``over there,'' he
said he was ``more comfortable'' with the Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not agree on fundamentalist differences. They don't
believe the Bible is the infallible word of God, which I do,'' he
said. ``They feel there's room for interpretation.''

</P>
<P>
   Before adjourning Tuesday, General Convention messengers
approved a motion to pray for leaders of the Southern Baptists of
Texas as they formed their rival convention.
</P>
<P>
   In leading the prayer, a lay leader, Mary Humphries of San
Marcos, noted that Texas Baptists are diverse in their beliefs but
are united in God and Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ruben Hernandez, staff evangelist of Village Parkway
Baptist Church in San Antonio, attended the General Convention for
15 years, but said the Southern Baptists of Texas fill a void he's
felt for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you continue losing vote after vote you start to get the
message,'' he said. ``I believe it really started to come to a head
in 1991 when the Baptist General Convention of Texas went to
extremes. They see things in a more liberal way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was quick to say the General Convention does good
things in Texas and around the world, but basic beliefs are what
come into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much what they do not do, but what they believe
in, like the ordination of women,'' he said. ``I do not believe
that to be biblical.''

WHY THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT FAILED TO DELIVER -- AGAIN

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1844, thousands of American evangelicals fully expected Jesus
to return. When the predicted moment passed with no Lord in glory
appearing in the clouds, his saddened followers dubbed it ``The
Great Disappointment.''
 &HT;    For conservative Christians, the 1998 midterm elections may be
the second Great Disappointment.
 &HT;    The Republican party -- heavily dependent on a base of
evangelical voters -- failed to capitalize on the biggest
presidential scandal since Watergate. Even in the South, religious
right candidates like Alabama Gov. Fob James lost.
 &HT;    In the morning-after spin, Randy Tate, president of the
Christian Coalition, and his boss, Pat Robertson, accused
mainstream Republicans of ignoring their moral concerns -- thus
alienating the party's religious right base.
 &HT;    William Bennett used the moment to hawk books -- moaning about
the ``death of outrage'' and accusing a lax electorate of caring
more about money than morals.
 &HT;    Overall, it was a bad year for religious conservatives.
 &HT;    It did not start that way. In January, as rumors of a
presidential affair circulated, Christian conservatives could
barely contain their glee: Clinton's been caught with his pants
down! As the sordid details became public, America's neo-Puritans
predicted a religious right electoral landslide in November.
 &HT;    On television and radio, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Gary Bauer
and Pat Robertson self-righteously smirked over sin while privately
tallying impeachment votes.
 &HT;    What happened? Most of the die-hard religious right candidates
lost.
 &HT;    In 1996, I covered the Republican National Convention for a
local newspaper. Standing on the floor -- surrounded by true
believers -- I felt I'd witnessed Gettysburg. Although half of the
delegates in attendance claimed allegiance to some conservative
religious cause, it seemed evident that they had reached their
numerical limit in the party -- and were trying the patience of
more politically skilled mainstream Republicans. They could not go
any further than this, I mused.
 &HT;    That year, they failed to deliver for Bob Dole. This year, they
failed to deliver once again. In spite of getting Christian
conservatives to the polls, they lost.
 &HT;    The problem? Numbers. Quite simply, there are not enough
religious conservatives to actually win an election. Candidates may
win with them as part of a broader constituency. But the religious
right can not win alone.
 &HT;    University of Chicago historian Martin Marty has noted that,
since the 18th century, evangelicals make up somewhere between 25
to 33 percent of America's religious population -- rarely less and
never more. Therefore, evangelical political movements depend on
the appeal their causes have for people outside their churches. In
order to succeed, they must build coalitions around common American
concerns.
 &HT;    In Texas and Florida, the Bush brothers recognized this fact.
They won with the support of the religious right, but also the
support of Hispanic, African-American, women, and some Democratic
voters to whom a more moderate agenda -- like George Bush's
``compassionate conservatism'' -- appealed.
 &HT;    The Bush brothers are not themselves evangelicals -- a crucial
fact. Conservative evangelicals generally see the world in black
and white terms and are unable, by virtue of their own theology, to
compromise with anything they view sinful. By nature,
coalition-building is difficult for them -- leaving them dependent
upon Christian conversion for new voters.
 &HT;    Therefore, conservative evangelical candidates such as Fob
James, whose political agendas were lock-step with religious right
concerns, lost. They failed to reach beyond a particular ideology
and include voters not identified with those causes. In short,
their beliefs make them unable to build a constituency -- a crucial
failure for any politician.
 &HT;    Thus, single-mindedly waving their Bibles, these darlings of the
religious right became Tuesday's biggest losers.
 &HT;    Because they hold such clear beliefs, however, when voters want
ideology evangelicals deliver. But idea-motivated elections -- such
as the 1994 midterms -- are rare events in American history.
Instead, the electorate usually casts votes for local concerns and
economic prosperity -- and it is difficult for most people to trust
television preachers with their money.
 &HT;    An economically contented electorate will be predisposed to vote
against religious right candidates -- popularly perceived as
narrow-minded and dangerous. Their moral crusades -- including
impeaching a repentant president -- frighten many Americans who
believe conservative evangelicals would undermine individual
freedoms and derail economic prosperity. Their moral agenda strikes
most of us as preachy and somehow un-American.
 &HT;    Thus, 1998 is a great disappointment. The religious right should
now realize their 1994 victory was a fluke. If Fob James can not
even win Alabama, they must understand their agenda is not
America's agenda. And Jesus did not even return to rescue the
cause. After all that work and prayer, their ``Christian'' America
is not to be.
 &HT;    What a relief for the rest of us. Thanks be to God.

least $10,000 worth of antiques in the last three months _ on the

Burros.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're high on the sodium count this week.
</P>
<P>
   A reader writes looking for a recipe from a now-defunct tearoom
in Arlington, Texas. However, in our files, I found this recipe,
which sounds quite similar.
</P>
<P>
   The sodium is high, but if you use low-sodium tomato juice, the
numbers drop dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   SNAPPY TOMATO BOUILLON
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 cups
</P>
<P>
   46-ounce can tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   1 celery rib, with leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped scallion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   3 beef bouillon cubes, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   2-3 drops hot sauce, or more
</P>
<P>
   8-12 lemon slices, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Pour 2 cups tomato juice in small saucepan. Add celery with
leaves, onion, parsley, bouillon cubes, sugar, salt, pepper and hot
sauce. Bring to a boil, simmer 5 minutes over medium heat. Pour
into blender or food processor. Process until nearly smooth;
strain.
</P>
<P>
   In large pitcher, combine strained juice with remaining tomato
juice. Refrigerate until ready to use. Garnish with lemon slice, if
desired. Serve with cheese straws or cheese wafers.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per cup: 92 calories, trace fat, 19 grams
carbohydrates, 4 grams protein, trace cholesterol, 2,409 milligrams
sodium, trace of calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   More from the salt mines: Pat Havelaar of Arlington saw our
request for a seasoned salt to package for Christmas gifts. As a
member of a community club in Rapid City, S.D., she made this salt
as a fund-raiser, packaging it in miniature fruit jars that had a
handle and a shaker top.
</P>
<P>
   SEASONED SALT
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 42 ounces
</P>
<P>
   26 ounces table salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 ounce red pepper, or less
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces chili powder
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces Accent, optional
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 ounces onion powder
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces celery salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1/8 ounce ground oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces paprika
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients; blend well. This is good for seasoning
meats, stews, soups, eggs, cottage cheese and vegetables, and is
especially good on pinto beans.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per teaspoon: 4 calories, trace fat, 1 gram
carbohydrates, trace protein, 0 cholesterol, 1,219 milligrams
sodium, 28 percent of calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   Requests:
</P>
<P>
   Melody Smith of Fort Worth would like a recipe for a salad
called ``pink.'' Her daughter sampled the salad and thinks it
included cherries, nuts and Cool Whip but isn't sure what the pink
ingredient might be. Smith thinks maybe it also included coconut.
It's sweet enough to serve as a light dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Goode is looking for a recipe for broccoli rice casserole
that includes eggs. It has almost a souffle texture.

A RELUCTANT FOODIE REVEALS A GROCERY GOLD MINE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I'm cheap and I'm proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not how much money you earn, it's how much you save. And,
honey, I'm a champ.
</P>
<P>
   I know the days that my neighborhood supermarket triples
coupons.
</P>
<P>
   I know to call Fort Worth Forestry Administration when the trees
on my easement need trimming.
</P>
<P>
   I use coupons from my neighborhood newsletter to get my hair
cut.
</P>
<P>
   I know which days the clothing stores have senior-citizen
discounts. I'm not there yet, but I'm planning ahead.
</P>
<P>
   I don't use any credit card other than Discover because, with
that one, I get cash back. I use it everywhere. The grocery store,
the post office, the doctor's office. And, yes, I pay it off every
month.
</P>
<P>
   But my biggest secret for saving money? Town Talk.
</P>
<P>
   My parsimonious pals are cringing. Every time I've mentioned
exposing the salvage grocery in print, they've threatened me with
body slams.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Town Talk has been around in one form or another for
more than 40 years, it's barely a blip on most shoppers' radar
screens.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who live for bargains, this concrete-floored metal
building in east Fort Worth is the Valhalla of value. Nowhere else
can you find cans of artichoke hearts for 99 cents, 5-pound bags of
frozen hash-browned potatoes for $1.50 and frozen yellow-fin tuna
for $3 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the greatest cross section of customers. We've got
people who walk two miles to come here to shop because they can't
afford to own a car,'' owner Tom Potthoff says. ``We've got people
who drive here from Oklahoma and Austin. We've got a woman who
comes in once a year from Alabama. We've got a lot of Armenian
Muslims who shop here, and a lot of Mennonites drive up from
Johnson County.''
</P>
<P>
   On just about any weekday, cars in the parking lot range from a
'68 Impala to a Jaguar to a custom Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, there are customers such as Arlington residents
Sharon Gargano and Julie Reiser, each the mother of six children.
Last week, they were packing the trunk with their finds.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-pound box of puff pastry was $2. A 4-pound box of butter
was $3.95. A bottle of flavored olive oil was $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cook a lot, and we cook from scratch,'' Reiser said. ``I
can buy one of the big institutional cans of tomato sauce for $1.95
here and make spaghetti sauce. And this puff pastry was only $2.
I'll look in some cookbooks and do something with it. Even if it
doesn't work out, I'll have made up the $2 it costs with what I
saved on the oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shop other stores, too, so we know what this stuff costs.
Shopping here, I can try things I couldn't afford otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the restaurant owners and caterers (and I
recognized you, so don't duck behind the shelves), buying groceries
way under wholesale and charging customers full retail. Is America
a great country or what?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's America's free-enterprise system that allows
stores such as Town Talk to exist. That 18-wheeler in the ditch off
Interstate 20? You might see its cargo of peanut butter,
marshmallows and canned tuna on Town Talk's shelves next week. That
cute little fancy-food store in Waco? Bad management led to
bankruptcy, and the balsamic vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil now
are on the shelves at the discount store. Those 500 cases of beef
fillets that were intended for a major steak chain? They were cut
an ounce too small and were refused by the restaurant, and they're
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Like his groceries, Potthoff came to Town Talk following a
circuitous route. A certified registered nurse anesthetist,
Potthoff found himself, much to his displeasure, working
constantly. His father-in-law, Bill Dafcik, had owned Town Talk
restaurant (next door to the Ridglea Theater) since the 1950s. By
the time Potthoff was ready to change direction in the 1980s, Town
Talk had morphed into a salvage grocery store and had moved to the
present location on Beach Street.
</P>
<P>
   Potthoff bought a majority of the Town Talk enterprise and began
learning the grocery business from the kitty litter up. When
Safeway pulled out of North Texas in 1987, Potthoff had learned
enough to see the opportunities ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called them and offered to buy the contents of one of their
stores,'' Potthoff said. ``They wouldn't do that, but they said
they'd sell me the contents of 35 stores.'' He and his crew removed
the entire inventory from the 35 stores in 31 days.
</P>
<P>
   Potthoff buys his inventory from bankruptcies, insurance claims,
factory overruns, discontinued items, promotional items or dated
products. And he often has to jettison 20 percent of a purchase.
Last week, he culled a pallet of chicken feet from a shipment.
</P>
<P>
   And he goes far afield for his findings. Last week was fairly
typical.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he and a crew went to Houston to clean out a
frozen-food distribution warehouse that had been sold. His crew
loaded up cheese, french fries, steaks, frozen vegetables and ice
cream. The next day, he was in Oklahoma City to buy an insurance
claim of a grocery truck that had been in a wreck. The take
included flour, sugar, canned vegetables and detergent. Wednesday
saw him in Austin, where he bought in bulk discontinued items such
as cups, spice blends and paper products manufactured for a
restaurant chain that had changed suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the flea market of food,'' says Potthoff. ``It's not
for everyone. My wife isn't a Town Talk shopper. If she wants pork
chops, she wants pork chops, and she's going to buy them at the
nearest grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who want some color in our shopping, who
want to find the deal of the century and who are willing to cook
with what the larder yields, Town Talk is the word.
</P>
<P>
   And the very best part of Town Talk? It accepts the Discover
card.

FISHERMEN, GREEN GROUPS OPPOSE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Commercial fishermen and environmentalists say
California's ambitious plan to distribute water statewide and
restore the ecological health of the San Francisco Bay will
accelerate the destruction of the dwindling salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition chose Tuesday, the start of the fall Chinook
salmon run through the Golden Gate Bridge, to criticize the CalFed
state and federal water program as a threat to fishing.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the day that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt was in
Sacramento to discuss with CalFed officials a plan acceptable to
farmers, urban water users and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The CalFed Bay-Delta program was launched in May 1995 to devise
a plan to restore the ecological health of the Bay and delta and
improve water management.
</P>
<P>
   CalFed is scheduled to release a draft of its preferred plan in
mid-December. The fishermen and environmentalists say that it will
recommend more dams, offstream storage and possibly some version of
a peripheral canal to ship water around the delta to Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Nelson, a senior consultant to the Save San Francisco Bay
organization, said he had examined a draft of the plan, and
``basically it's a suggestion that CalFed should commit to a new
wave of dam construction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CalFed must emphasize conservation and habitat restoration,
not new dams,'' said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific
Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. ``Dams kill fish,
threaten the fishing industry and waste taxpayer money.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition accused CalFed of ignoring alternative ways to
boost water supplies in Central California, such as demanding more
efficient water use from agricultural buyers, who are major users
of water.
</P>
<P>
   A CalFed draft report in March found that recycling and
conservation in urban areas can reduce the state's water use by 4
million acre feet a year _ nearly enough to fill Shasta Lake, the
biggest reservoir in California. But the CalFed recommendations for
agricultural users would take a fraction _ less than 1 percent _ of
the 33 million acre feet of water that California farmers use every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson's administration has expressed interest in
several major dam projects that the coalition of fishermen and
environmentalists oppose. Those projects are enlarging Shasta Dam
and the Los Vaqueros reservoir in Contra Costa County, building
reservoirs on Stone Corral and Funks Creeks in Colusa and Glenn
counties, and building Los Banos Grandes, an off-stream storage
reservoir in Merced County.

</P>
<P>
   If we look at life from one viewpoint, everything may seem
unstable. Changes can take place so rapidly that it may seem
nothing in the world could be looked upon as permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Friends may come and go. Possessions may be here today and gone
tomorrow. The home of our childhood may have been razed for a new
office building. The babe in arms grows into the young adult.
Relationships begin and end. People die.
</P>
<P>
   We may suffer from what is called ``a broken heart'' at one time
or another. This could result from the loss of a loved one, the
diminishment of physical or mental health, or the loss of a job
that provides much-needed income.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out toward a goal that, for whatever reason, never
materializes can cause upset and grief. Some of our cherished goals
may go unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at the universe from another viewpoint, everything
is alive and growing. Everything is in joyous motion. New
combinations appear. New beauties touch our souls. New
opportunities spring up.
</P>
<P>
   When the waves of change come rolling into our lives -- and it
has been said that ``change is the one constant in life'' -- it may
be upsetting to us if our heart is too attached to material things
or we are too established in an erroneous concept of permanence. If
there is little or no understanding of how to handle change, it can
seem heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   How do we deal with the pain of loss that seems to touch
everyone's life at some point? If we are open and receptive to
God's presence in every change, we ride safely on the crest of the
wave.
</P>
<P>
   When a seed falls or is planted in the darkness of the earth,
the seed's outer shell must break so that new life can emerge.
Jesus said, ``Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and
dies, it remains only a single seed.... But if it dies, it produces
many seeds'' (John 12:24).
</P>
<P>
   When our outer shells break in pain, when our hearts seem
broken, it is important to learn the lesson that Jesus set out to
teach us. Whenever we lose something we may, in some way, gain
something at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   We can then come to understand and appreciate that life offers
unexplainable experiences that may notalways make rational sense.
This understanding becomes a precious gift in and of itself. We
might think that if we could just do everything ``right'' we could
keep ourselves from pain. But life is often more complicated and
mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   The very pain we experience may be the shell of our
understanding, our wisdom, our maturity and compassion, breaking
forth its gift, its new life. This understanding is not a drug to
dull or deny the pain of the experience. Rather, it can be a means
to open ourselves to pain's mystery, to what it has to offer, as
well as what it takes away.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the prospect of making changes can be greeted more
cordially by remembering that the journey of life is forward and
progressive. And as you grow and progress, changes come.
</P>
<P>
   Have you considered that to say, ``This is not the time for
change,'' could be the equivalent of saying, ``this is not the time
for new blessings to come into my life''? It is important to grow
physically, mentally, and spiritually. The fact that changes come
about in our life means that we should be prepared to handle them
courageously. Have faith in your soul's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you feel some shell breaking in your heart, feel
it fully and deeply, and take comfort in knowing that living with
and through pain can help you become a more understanding and
compassionate person toward yourself and others.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity can be a rich and educational gift. Adversity can be a
milestone in your mental and spiritual growth. Find it in your
heart to welcome change and rejoice in the opportunities for
growth.

<HEADLINE>
AND THE WINNER IS ... THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c. 1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Book Awards ceremony is only one of several
prominent celebrations of annual ``best-ofs'' in literature; the
Pulitzer Prizes and the National Book Critics Circle Awards are
others.
</P>
<P>
   But with the most recent titles by Gayl Jones and Tom Wolfe
included among its five finalists in the fiction category, the
National Book Foundation award ceremony Nov. 18 in New York City is
certain to attract the most attention this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' ``The Healing'' (Beacon Press, $23) received enough rave
critical commentary upon publication to attract law-enforcement
notice to her husband, Bob Jones, who had been a fugitive from
justice since 1984, when he was indicted on an illegal weapons
charge. When Lexington, Ky., police were alerted, they surrounded
the couple's home, and Bob Jones committed suicide. Gayl Jones,
after being placed in ``emergency detention'' and subsequently
released, now communicates with her publisher only by fax.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $28.50)
was still a month from its Nov. 6 publication when its nomination
was announced. Scoffers suggest the book owes its presence on the
list of five solely to the fame of its author. Although thoughtful
evaluation may eventually suggest ``A Man in Full'' is a worthy
finalist, its inclusion has drawn the wrath of supporters of
writers such as Cormac McCarthy and Pam Houston, whose
well-received, ``already'' published novels didn't pass National
Book Award muster.
</P>
<P>
   But controversy is always part of the National Book Awards.
Besides Jones and Wolfe, the 1998 awards will probably be
remembered for its selection of John Updike as recipient of the
National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to
American Letters.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Book Award nominees:
</P>
<P>
   FICTION:
</P>
<P>
   Allegra Goodman, ``Kaaterskill Falls'' (Dial Press, $23.95):
Three Orthodox Jewish families confront secular challenge in
upstate New York. Critics have lauded Goodman for including minute
details about Orthodox life; her characters are fully dimensional,
too. ``Kaaterskill Falls'' is Goodman's first full-length novel,
and its depth has convinced literati that she has a superlative
career ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gayl Jones, ``The Healing'' (Beacon Press, $23):
Free-association remembrances by an African-American woman who has
lived a varied, interesting life. Jones had not published a novel
for 20 years. Her previous titles, ``Corregidora'' and ``Eava's
Man,'' resonated with anger. ``The Healing'' is gentler; for the
first time, Jones uses humor as well as pathos to make her points.
</P>
<P>
   Alice McDermott, ``Charming Billy'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux,
$22): Mourners at Bill Lynch's funeral recall his life. McDermott's
writing style has always avoided grand scenes. She prefers a
delicate approach and is more Jane Austen than Sylvia Plath.
Because of her innate delicacy, McDermott remains a writer whose
reputation among critics far surpasses her familiarity to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stone, ``Damascus Gate'' (Houghton Mifflin, $26): A
journalist becomes embroiled in a terrorist plot in Jerusalem.
``Damascus Gate'' is just the latest in a long list of impressive
Stone fiction _ ``Dog Soldiers,'' ``A Flag for Sunrise,'' ``Bear
and His Daughter'' and other novels and story collections have been
praised in most literary quarters. Stone is often compared to
Flannery O'Connor; his latest yarn follows his pattern of tossing
an American protagonist into unfamiliar foreign territory.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe, ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux,
$28.50): Atlanta entrepreneur Charlie Croker tries to save his
crumbling business empire. ``A Man in Full'' has earned about 90
percent positive critical notices. Detractors say Wolfe has
indulged too much in florid details and that the ending is shaky.
But for sheer ability to weave complex, colorful tales of modern
American society, Wolfe is now the acknowledged master.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Stone's ``Damascus Gate'' gets the nod. He is a past
winner, and giving Wolfe the award would be overkill. Dark horse:
McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   NONFICTION:
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ball, ``Slaves in the Family'' (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, $30): The author examines his own slave-holding family
history. Ball admits his family forbade discussion of five topics:
Religion, sex, money, death and ``the Negroes.'' Courageously, he
delineates his family's past, tracking mixed-race relatives and
even visiting Africa to better understand where his
African-American relations came from.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Bloom, ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''
(Riverhead Books, $35): Examination of the Bard's work; less
scholarly than might be expected. Bloom is an outspoken expert, and
offers decided opinions on individual plays and characters. Many
believe the real value of this book will be in encouraging readers
to go back and re-read their Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yaffa Eliach, ``There Once Was a World: A 900-Year Chronicle of
the Shetl of Eishyshok'' (Little, Brown, $40): Nine centuries of
Jewish life in Eastern Europe. The author is best-known for
creating the Tower of Life that has become one of the most famous
attractions at the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
``There Once Was a World'' is endlessly _ scoffers suggest
``tediously'' _ detailed. One sympathetic critic termed the book
``painfully personal microhistory.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Kephart, ``A Slant of Sun: One Child's Courage'' (Norton,
$23): The author's infant son, Jeremy, is diagnosed with a disorder
related to autism. Kephart makes her living as a free-lance writer
of mostly magazine-length stories, but reader reaction to ``A Slant
of Sun'' probably means she'll concentrate on books from now on.
Her honesty in admitting she initially blamed her son's physical
problems on her self-perceived flaws as a mother would touch any
parent's heart. Jeremy, incidentally, has progressed enough to
express himself coherently.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Mayer, ``All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the
Abolition of American Slavery'' (St. Martin's Press, $32.50): A
study of the editor/crusader, who the author argues was a key
figure in the anti-slavery ranks. ``All on Fire'' is, in fact,
revisionist history. Though Garrison is usually considered a
second-line character in most Civil War studies, Mayer argues he
belongs alongside Lincoln. The book is hampered, though, by
repetition. Its 700 pages could easily have been trimmed by
one-fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Ball. ``Slaves in the Family'' is a mesmerizing
read. Eliach's ``There Once Was a World'' could just edge Ball out.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Awards also recognize poetry and young
people's literature. This year's finalists include:
</P>
<P>
   POETRY: B.H. Fairchild, ``The Art of the Lathe''; Alicia Suskin
Ostriker, ``The Little Space: Poems Selected and New, 1968-1998'';
Linda Pastan, ``Carnival Evening: New and Selected Poems
1968-1998''; Carl Phillips, ``From the Devotions''; Gerald Stern,
``This Time: New and Selected Poems.''
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG PEOPLE'S LITERATURE: Ann Cameron, ``The Secret Life of
Amanda K. Woods''; Jack Gantos, ``Joey Pizga Swallowed the Key'';
Anita Lobel, ``No Pretty Pictures: A Child of War''; Richard Peck,
``A Long Way From Chicago''; Louis Sachar, ``Holes.''

EUTHANASIA SUPPORTERS TO RALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Californians may find physician-assisted suicide
on the public agenda again soon with a conference on the subject
opening here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo-based Death with Dignity National Center is
organizing the conference with San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and
the San Francisco Medical Society, aimed at gathering support to
change state law so terminally ill patients who are suffering can
get a doctor's help in ending their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the people fighting for a similar law in Michigan, or the
more fringe Hemlock Society, the Death with Dignity Center is
trying to be mainstream, moderate and to attract powerful people
who can lend credibility to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   That has the Catholic Church, right-to-life groups and others
opposed to assisted suicide concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's definitely the prelude to legislation somebody
will introduce, or court action,'' said Ned Dolejsi, executive
director of the California Catholic Conference. ``We've got to
watch it and recognize it, and be on guard.''
</P>
<P>
   With Oregon voters' recent reaffirmation that they support the
first physician-assisted suicide law in the nation, proponents
appear to be gaining momentum. Polls have shown that a majority of
Americans favor having the option at the end of their lives. And
AIDS groups have been in the forefront of the fight to allow dying
people to take charge of the way their lives come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But physician-assisted suicide is opposed by mainstream groups
like the American Medical Association, as well as hospice and
disability-rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Californians defeated a physician-assisted suicide measure on
the ballot in 1992. It was a bruising campaign and proponents were
heavily outspent by the Catholic Church, conservative Christians
and medical groups, which also have raised large amounts to fight
initiatives in Oregon, Washington and Michigan. It left advocates
little enthusiasm for another try, according to Michael H. White, a
Los Angeles lawyer who helped organize the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic tack may be to try to round up support in the
state Legislature to introduce a narrowly worded bill, perhaps
modeled after Oregon's law.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the issue say they don't like to use the word
suicide because polls show that people are more uncomfortable with
the idea when it is presented that way.
</P>
<P>
   Dolejsi thinks the group is being deceptive not only in the
choice of words, but also in promoting the conference as a kind of
forum, since there are no opponents on the agenda. No Catholic or
other opposition groups were asked to the invitation-only
conference, although an invitation was extended after Dolejsi's
office called, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the conference is an attempt to paint one side
of the issue, rather than have a full and open airing of the
subject,'' he said. ``It's a much more controversial issue that the
proponents appear willing to acknowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents see the conference as a way to build a broad base of
support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is a very good starting place for our legislators,
our health officials, the leaders in our communities, to be aware
of what the facts are on this issue,'' said Charlotte Ross,
executive director of the Death with Dignity National Center.
``They need to know what patients and their families are going
through with end-of-life issues.''

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of lives lost, certainly it was not on scale with TWA
Flight
</P>
<P>
   800 and Swissair Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each
of those
</P>
<P>
   crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly
two-thirds
</P>
<P>
   of the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this
crash is not
</P>
<P>
   only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary
</P>
<P>
   M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine
to Texas to Alaska -_ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files of the National
Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken during the ensuing
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9 minutes and 20 seconds of
horror aboard
</P>
<P>
   that doomed aircraft as it fell to earth, the fire that consumed
the broken fuselage, as well as how the tragedy has reshaped lives.

<P>
   DAY 1 _ Nov. 15
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-THEFALL _ ASA Flight 529 was more than three miles high
when a propeller blade broke off its left wing. The twin-engine
Atlantic Southeast Airlines plane carrying 29 people shuddered and
fell.
</P>
<P>
   In window seat 2-A, a young woman who had served in the Army
thought she'd heard a small cannon explode. She looked out and saw
the propeller declare war on the left wing. She slammed shut her
window shade, frightened by the sight and what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant Robin Fech grabbed the metal kitchen galley
where the passengers' drinks were stored to steady herself. Soda
cans trembled. Under her breath, Fech cursed. .. Of the 29 people
aboard, 19 would live to tell about it. In the telling, survivors
almost without exception have asked themselves the same question
about those nine minutes and 20 seconds:Was it really that long?
(Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DAY 2 _ Nov. 16
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-THE FIRE _The little propeller-driven plane with 29 people
aboard fell out of the sky at 140 miles per hour. It sliced through
treetops and bore down on a hayfield in Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   The left wing tip gouged the earth first. The wing ripped away
from the body of the plane as dirt clods and rocks flew. Jet fuel
spilled from its ruptured tank.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's nose next skidded on its underside.
</P>
<P>
   Then the one-winged plane went airborne again, bouncing up a
ridge about 100 feet, the first killing steps in a macabre dance of
physics.
</P>
<P>
   A plane made in Brazil and bound for the Mississippi coast
became a carnival ride gone berserk. It skidded through the
hayfield, its belly cutting a narrow groove 4 inches deep and 150
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The fuselage shattered into two primary sections. Twisted by
torque, the front section _ carrying the pilot and first officer _
spun to its right, with its nose finally stopping at a right angle
to the plowed groove.
</P>
<P>
   The back section slid tail first around the nose, then rolled
onto its right side, so curiously situated that its underbelly
nearly faced the pilot's window.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was in pieces, connected only by a common fate.
(Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DAY 3 _ Nov. 17
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-2NDCHANCE _ David McCorkell ran from the fuselage before
the flames set in. But images of suffering all across the hayfield
compelled the computer trainer from Minnesota to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Circling closer, he heard first officer Matt Warmerdam's pleas
for help from inside the smoky cockpit. Warmerdam, trying to break
free, told McCorkell he didn't have enough room to swing his
hatchet. He passed the hatchet through a hole in the glass to
McCorkell and put his life in the hands of a man he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   As McCorkell banged away, shards of glass flew into his hair and
face. Warmerdam pointed to show him where to hit. McCorkell's left
hand tired, so he switched the hatchet to his right. Black smoke
thickened as Warmerdam pressed his face to the hole, gasping for
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, McCorkell widened the hole enough for Warmerdam to
stick out his head and one arm.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkell heard a loud pop underneath the cockpit. A blast of
heat shot at his legs, pushing him back several steps.
</P>
<P>
   Scared, McCorkell wondered what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to let me die, are you?'' Warmerdam cried
out. (Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DAY 4 _ Nov. 18
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-KENNEDY _ Sitting at his kitchen table in Roswell, Ga.,
about 10 p.m., his dinner growing cold, his wife on the phone
across the room, Barrington thought about those who died in the
crash: people he did not know but might have saved. That included
Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He'd spotted Kennedy in the fuselage, eyes closed, beneath
debris. He'd reached to him and said, ``Get up!''
</P>
<P>
   But then Barrington was distracted by another passenger, who was
dangling from a seat belt above, screaming. In the confusion,
Barrington reached to help the dangling man, then forgot Kennedy,
leaving him behind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, realizing funerals were only a day away, Barrington's
thoughts took him to the grave sites of Kennedy and the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you do everything you could to help my father/my mother/my
son?''
</P>
<P>
   He imagined a grieving family asking him this question.
Barrington thought, ``Unless you died in the attempt, you did not
try hard enough.'' He heard himself say aloud, ``I'm alive,'' and
so the answer had to be, ``No, I didn't do everything I could have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   This admission brought tears and sobs. He fell from his chair to
the floor. (Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DAY 5 _ Nov. 19
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-ATTENDANT _ Robin Fech had tried once to get back into an
airplane. But she made it only as far as the flight attendant's
jump seat near the door.
</P>
<P>
   She kept that door open _ and left through it when fear overcame
her.
</P>
<P>
   Her psychotherapist's plan was to slowly desensitize Fech to an
airplane so she could fly again. First she did nothing more than
park at the Macon airport to watch planes take off and land. Next
she walked into the terminal. The first time she moved onto the
tarmac, she cried.
</P>
<P>
   It was so unlike the person she had been, so full of sass and
moxie that she once explained her nature with the laugh line, ``I
don't get my panties in a wad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now each step toward recovery revived the terror. She couldn't
so much as use a curling iron without being reminded of the smell
of fire.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a month passed before Fech could step into an empty
Brasilia identical to the crash plane and stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, she did a necessary thing. She sat in each of the 30
seats. Closing her eyes, she tried to become the passengers who
fell from the sky with her.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to know what they had felt in the last nine minutes
and 20 seconds of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529.
(Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DAY 6 _ Nov. 20
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-BLADEMAN _ TYLER, Texas _ The broken propeller stub showed
signs typical of fatigue cracking. It also yielded the most
important clue: serial number 861398.
</P>
<P>
   The paper chase now was on: Maintenance records revealed blade
861398 had been repaired 11 months earlier after failing an
ultrasonic inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Hamilton Standard, has produced aluminum blade
propellers since 1958. Three times in the year and a half before
the ASA crash, Hamilton Standard blades had broken in flight due to
fatigue cracks _ first in Canada, then Brazil and finally
Luxembourg. All three planes landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   Following the paper trail, investigators discovered the repair _
a sanding job _ had been made by a mechanic who signed himself in
small, tight handwriting: ``CSB.''
</P>
<P>
   So when NTSB investigators arrived at Hamilton Standard's repair
shop in Rock Hill, S.C., a week after the crash, they wanted to
know: ``Who is CSB?''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Scott Bender, young, blond and earnest, is a
mechanic no more. He's 27, a Bible student now. Although the crash
is never far from his thoughts, he still knows few details of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows that it was his blade that broke, and he's often
wondered: Was it my fault?
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that something I even touched my hands on could have
done something like that ...,'' he says. (Pomerantz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of lives lost, certainly it was not on scale with TWA
Flight
</P>
<P>
   800 and Swissair Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each
of those
</P>
<P>
   crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly
two-thirds
</P>
<P>
   of the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this
crash is not
</P>
<P>
   only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary
</P>
<P>
   M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine
to Texas to Alaska -_ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files of the National
Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken during the ensuing
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9 minutes and 20 seconds of
horror aboard
</P>
<P>
   that doomed aircraft as it fell to earth, the fire that consumed
the broken fuselage, as well as how the tragedy has reshaped lives.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Nov. 15, CoxNet will move Pomerantzi seven-part

DON'T THINK YOU WON'T HEAR FROM GINGRICH AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If his detractors were thinking that they'd heard the last of
Newt Gingrich, they'd better think again.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-retire U.S. House speaker showed up on television
Monday night, reminding some of his most devoted followers that his
decision to surrender the congressional gavel should not be
interpreted as an all-out retreat from public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public office is not the same as public service,'' Gingrich
said. ``There are many avenues for a public life beyond the
speakership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich didn't elaborate, saying only that he will be an
``active citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. Would an ``active citizen'' run for president?
</P>
<P>
   Newt for president? The guy just got himself hounded out of the
top leadership post in the House of Representatives _ by his own
party, no less. If he's goofy enough to run for president, who the
heck will support him?
</P>
<P>
   You might be surprised. Whatever his failures, Gingrich is still
looked upon as one of the great prophets of conservatism. He still
has a major constituency.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake. Newt remains one of the most effective
political fund-raisers on the planet. He'd have no trouble at all
scrounging up enough cash to finance a serious run for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about this, either: I am ``not'' predicting that
Gingrich will run for president. I am merely raising the
possibility that this is one of the activities he might choose as
he seeks ways to remain an active citizen.
</P>
<P>
   You won't catch me making any predictions about Gingrich _ pro,
con or neutral. Not after last week's wild-eyed guess that he would
hold onto his job as speaker despite an uprising by rebellious
House members who blamed him for Republican losses in the Nov. 3
elections.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hazards of making predictions in public, of course,
is the possibility _ the likelihood _ that the prediction will be
wrong. If I could make predictions with 100 percent accuracy, I
wouldn't be wasting my time trying to outguess politicians; I'd be
collecting zillions of dollars in lottery jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I still believe that Gingrich would have prevailed if
he had fought for his job. Who would have figured that a political
alley-fighter like Newt would throw in the towel without so much as
reaching for the razor in his shoe?
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to me that he'd just up and quit. It never
occurred to me that Newt Gingrich would back down in the face of a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In his televised speech to GOPAC, the political action committee
that he once used to promote his conservative agenda, Gingrich
insisted that his motives for quitting were selfless and noble.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a disruptive intraparty battle over his speakership,
Gingrich said, he ``had to make a decisive choice between my own
interests and what I believed to be the more important cause of the
country and my party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday it became clear to me that if I were to remain in
the House, I would be an excuse for divisiveness and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas are too big, the issues are too important, for any
one person to put their office above the good of the country and
the party. That is why I announced my retirement on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. That's his story, and he's sticking to it. I'm sticking to
my theory that Newt just plain lacked the stomach for one more
rough-and-tumble political showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the truth lies somewhere in between. Maybe Gingrich
split the difference between selflessness and self-preservation,
sparing both the party and himself a bruising battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Newt somehow seemed energized by his decision to quit
the speaker's job and his House seat. The Gingrich who spoke to
GOPAC sounded like the Republican prophet who rallied the nation
behind conservative precepts such as smaller government, lower
taxes and military readiness. He even made a pitch for one of
Ronald Reagan's pet projects: a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't heard the last of Newt Gingrich, not by a long shot.

   Corn, beans and squash are enduring and familiar staples in our
gardens and on our tables, but to many American Indian tribes they
are nothing less than sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Three Sisters,'' they are revered as a treasured
gift from the Great Spirit, delivered from Heaven, by a crow, to
sustain and protect through all time.
</P>
<P>
   Legend holds that it was directed that the sisters should never
be apart from one another.
</P>
<P>
   So for thousands of years, they have been planted together,
eaten together and celebrated together by Native Americans, whose
spirituality recognizes the interconnectedness of all life.
</P>
<P>
   The sturdy cornstalks are used to support the twining beans, and
the spreading squash vines provide shade that traps moisture for
the growing crop. Bacteria in the bean roots then capture nitrogen
from the air and release some of it into the soil to nourish the
corn.
</P>
<P>
   In the past half-century, as modern agricultural science has
developed chemical fertilizers, herbicides and other technically
sophisticated (and sometimes environmentally harmful) methods to
increase the world's food supply, the story of the Three Sisters is
being viewed as more than just allegory. Scientists are
appreciating that there is much to learn from these growing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the season of the harvest, you may want to enrich
your knowledge of Native American legend and lore, increase your
appreciation of the Three Sisters and maybe find an authentic
Native American dish to add interest to your holiday table.

 &HT;    ATTACK OF THE POETS; IN BRITAIN, POETS INVADE WITH RHYME, REASON
 &HT;    EDs: ALL names are CQ.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle

<P>
   LONDON _ For more than a year, lawyers at the prestigious London
firm of Mischcon de Reya have been receiving poems mingled among
their e-mails about boosting billable hours and other office
tedium.
</P>
<P>
   Far from flirtations, these verses are part of the job, weekly
readings selected by the firm's resident poet, Lavinia Greenlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw, who also penned a haiku for corporate Christmas cards,
selects poems to inspire, provoke or to just make the lawyers
think. ``Throughout the day they would write back with their
suggestions or their own poems,'' she said. ``Sometimes they were
baffled or amused, or simply didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least they were touched by poetry, which is the point of
the year-old ``Poetry Places'' project, funded by a $750,000 grant
from the National Lottery. The program is run by the national
Poetry Society, which intends to place 100 poets in schools,
businesses and other environments throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting in that it makes people think about their lives,
to think creatively and about the importance of words and poetry,''
said Christina Patterson, who manages the program for the Poetry
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Poets have been assigned to the BBC, the huge department store
chain Marks &AMP; Spencer, the London Zoo, the Botanical Gardens at Kew
and the Barnsley soccer club. The program also has dispatched poets
to inspire and be inspired by such disparate endeavors as garbage
collection -- verses are planned for trash bags -- and
fish-and-chips shops. The society also is considering placing a
poet on a natural gas platform in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   What the poets actually do at their workplaces varies. ``In most
places there would be some general meeting with staff, or a maybe
they'd go have a drink and talk about poetry,'' Patterson said.
``We want to get them to think about writing poetry, and in some
places there might be workshops with the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   John Agard, the resident poet at the BBC, holds workshops and is
pushing for poetry spots in programming. ``Poetry is often
presented in the media as something very precious,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``But there's no reason why, if there's a program
on gardening or cooking, you can't have a poem on gardening or
cooking. Poetry can be presented in a much more vibrant way.''
</P>
<P>
   Agard believes the importance of poetry in ordinary life is
underestimated. ``People say they don't read poetry but they seek
out their favorite poems for weddings and funerals. So much of our
lives are marked out with linear maps -- poetry gives another
map.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Heloise Paull, spokeswoman for the law firm Mischcon -- with 32
partners, a staff of more than 200 and counts among its clients the
Princess Diana Memorial Fund -- considers having a resident poet an
employment benefit that enhances the firm's morale and culture.
``We really benefited enormously by it,'' Paull said. ``Lots of
staff have written poems who would never have thought about it
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows of lawyers who would spend their mornings languishing
in the dry precision of legalese and then emerge from lunchtime
poetry sessions revitalized from contemplating the mysteries of
verse.
</P>
<P>
   The poets also are rewarded, said Tobias Hill, the resident poet
at the London Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry can be lonely business if you're just sitting around
writing by yourself everyday,'' Hill said. ``This gets me out
meeting people. It's a gift in terms of material.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is fascinated by what he calls ``the dark side of zoos.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the zoo's staff, Hill tries to reach the people
who come to see the animals, particularly children, with readings
and a poetry contest. He has created a poetry trail, displaying
verses to match the animals. D.H. Lawrence's ``Snakes'' is at the
reptile house.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to Hill and other poets are the stipends
-- up to $16,000 a year -- which help them focus more on their art
rather than the other occupations -- such as journalism -- they
pursue to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows me to buy time as a poet,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional poem follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sample from Peter Street, the fish-and-chips resident
poet:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mates''
</P>
<P>
   Last night's newsprint, tasting of chips wet, tanner a bag
</P>
<P>
   Folded artistically, to stop all that pea juice, dripping onto
best
</P>
<P>
   hand-me-downs.
</P>
<P>
   Walking home after last bus with mates you confess everything to
good
</P>
<P>
   friends, together
</P>
<P>
   in a meeting place, smelling of fish and chips.

 &HT;    CHINESE LEADERS IRRITATED AT CLINTON OVER TIBET, TAIWAN
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese leaders are irritated at President Bill
Clinton, who no longer looks the wise and benevolent partner they
thought he was this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing fierce verbiage, these officials are expressing
``strong displeasure'' over President Clinton's decision to
dispatch U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson this week to Taiwan.
And on the resurgent issue of Tibet, the Chinese are sounding just
as hurt and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton may get a chance to hear some of the Chinese
criticism first-hand. He plans to meet for an hour with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, in a mini-summit during a break in the
meetings of 21 world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tibet, the Chinese are voicing frustration that Clinton met
the Dalai Lama at the White House for 30 minutes Tuesday,
disregarding China's loud objections that Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader is ``playing tricks'' to win Tibetan independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama has for a long time engaged in activities to
split the motherland and preached independence for Tibet,'' foreign
ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, he has not repented,'' Zhu said. ``We ask U.S.
leaders not to meet the Dalai Lama to avoid harming China-U.S.
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Taiwan, Chinese statements reflect a bitterness that Clinton
seemingly let them down by allowing continued official American
contacts with Taiwan, even after his June 30 pledge in Shanghai not
to support Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. side ... has seriously violated the principles in the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the United States commitment
not to have official contacts with Taiwan,'' Zhu said, citing a
quarter-century of American statements dating back to the Nixon
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, Clinton's former U.N. ambassador and diplomatic
troubleshooter, addressed a business meeting in Taiwan and then met
with Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui. Using Richardson's presence
to make his case that Taiwan is an established fact, the Taiwanese
leader said Taiwan's government ``not only exists, but also
strenuously upholds democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   China responded Wednesday by escalating criticism to a higher
echelon of power.
</P>
<P>
   The official Xinhua news agency quoted a top Chinese military
commander as expressing ``serious concern'' over the Taiwan and
Tibet developments.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should ``strictly abide'' by commitments to avoid all
official contacts with Taiwan, Gen. Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
the powerful Central Military Commission, said after a meeting with
the visiting American Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Joseph Prueher.
</P>
<P>
   China's recent words reflect a remarkable change in tone,
compared to the warm glow that suffused most Beijing rhetoric about
the United States for the first three months after Clinton's June
23-July 3 state visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise and practical move,'' said the Chinese foreign ministry
in July, after Clinton signed a trade measure. And in September,
when Clinton faced possible impeachment, China declared that the
president's ``difficulties'' would not affect American-Chinese
ties, which had reached ``a new stage of development'' thanks in
part to Clinton's ``active contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six weeks, China's rhetoric has perceptibly
cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Trade Criticism Unfair,'' headlined an editorial in the
official China Daily on Sept. 30, after U.S. officials warned about
China's estimated $60 billion-a-year trade surplus with America.
Two weeks later, China accused the U.S. House of Representatives of
``a rude infringement of China's sovereignty'' for supporting
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   China has so far refrained from using the heaviest bludgeons in
its diplomatic vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, China did not say it ``strongly demands''
compliance with its wishes, as it did this summer when it sought to
dislodge its smaller neighbor Vietnam from a disputed reef in the
South China Sea.

 &HT;    WIRING SCHOOLS COULD COST BILLIONS AND YIELD LITTLE, SAY
DOUBTERS
 &HT;    830&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A band of dissenters is warning that as America
prepares to spend billions of dollars to wire classrooms to the
Internet, there is little proof that it will improve education.
</P>
<P>
   These doubters, most of them computer specialists, foresee a
generation of children who can point and click, but not think and
imagine. They speak of students who can send e-mail to pals across
the ocean, but not relate to classmates sitting next to them.
</P>
<P>
   And where proponents see vast information treasures in
cyberspace, techno-skeptics see mostly a time-consuming wasteland,
or worse. A few clicks, for example, can bring up video sex scenes
or on-line manuals for hacking into computer systems or building a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism has spurred a conference at Columbia University,
a handful of critical books, and a publication on the Internet
raising questions about the nation's infatuation with computers in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a bluntly worded essay in Time magazine last May, Yale
University computer science professor David Gelernter assailed
President Clinton's program to wire up every schoolroom, a
centerpiece of the administration's education agenda, as ``toxic
quackery.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Gelernter: ``First learn reading and writing, history and
arithmetic. Then play Frisbee, go fishing or surf the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the push to computerize is driven by expectations of
academic gains, researchers have yet to provide convincing evidence
that it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to do research to measure achievement gains
and increases in 'higher-order' thinking of kids who use and don't
use computers,'' said Edward Miller, who surveyed a broad range of
findings when he was editor of Harvard University's Education
Letter. ``The bottom line is that the research is inconclusive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study yet on technology in schools, the
Educational Testing Service concluded in September that while
proper use of technology helped some students, computers offered so
little promise in elementary grades that they may not be worth the
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have not dampened enthusiasm for high technology
among school boards and politicians, however. ``In the scholarly
community of people who try to do serious research on the impact of
technology, there is a lot of caution and doubt,'' Miller said.
``But the people who make education policy don't pay much attention
to those folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The total expense of computerizing schools has been estimated as
high as $100 billion for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Because high-tech companies stand to reap enormous profits,
``there's a juggernaut,'' said Peter Cookson, director of
educational outreach at Columbia University's Teachers College,
which late last year sponsored a conference on the potential
pitfalls in computerized education. ``I'm concerned that lots of it
is being driven by money. Education is a $600 billion business, and
there's the hardware and then the software.''
</P>
<P>
   These business interests work actively to keep educators and
policy-makers on their side. A major education software company,
Lightspan Partnership, recently teamed up with the American
Association of School Administrators to conduct a poll designed to
rebut the high-tech doubters. In their survey, released Oct. 13,
educators gave a ringing endorsement for spending more money for
technology, and 80 percent reported student gains through use of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the high-tech push comes as many schools have far more
fundamental problems, such as buildings that are crumbling, teacher
shortages, too few textbooks, and many children who arrive in the
mornings too hungry or too frightened by neighborhood violence to
concentrate on studies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, teachers have raised no concerted objections to the new
stress on the hot new technologies, although some are beginning to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're making a huge mistake'' in forcing computers on
young pupils, said Russell Monke, who teaches advanced computer
science at a public high school in Des Moines, Iowa. His experience
in the classroom, plus his research, have convinced him that
computer training is unnecessary and perhaps harmful until high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a serious change, a dramatic revolution in
the way that kids learn, and I don't see that the change is
particularly beneficial to children,'' Monke said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, the most computer-savvy students often do
poorly in his class because they lack more important life
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these kids live in a world that is abstract. They
spend time on TV, computers and video machines, and they aren't
getting involved with the community and neighborhood friends, or
even just climbing trees,'' he said. ``They need to bring into my
class at least a budding sense of moral and ethical sensibilities.
They need some sense of the world around them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As for falling behind on computer education, Monke said that
high school students can easily catch up on those mechanical
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Monke writes about such concerns in FutureNet, a twice-monthly
publication on the Internet edited by Steve Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott has traced the history of inventions, starting with the
radio and then the television, that were supposed to revolutionize
the classroom. ``The last piece of technology that has actually
stayed is the blackboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that the computer, like radios and televisions, will
become no more than tools for educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proponents of these new technologies have taken their eyes
off the educational ball,'' he wrote in his newsletter. ``They have
not first identified an education problem and then gone out and
determined that, yes, computers do indeed look like the best of all
possible solutions to this problem. Instead, bedazzled by the
technology, they simply assume its necessity and try to figure out
how it should be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone listening to such advice? Monke said he believes
people are beginning to hear. ``It's almost like we've been drunk
from technophilia and we're going to have a long hangover, but I
think we're going to get sober and look at what's happening in
these kids' lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proponents are asking questions, as well. Michael
Hannafin, who holds a chair as ``eminent scholar'' of
technology-enhanced learning at the University of Georgia, said,
``My whole career lies in the future of technology and learning, so
I'm very hopeful.'' But he added that he saw both ``enormous
potential and enormous peril.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To wire every classroom (to the Internet) is a pretty naive
view,'' he said. ``A lot of people believe that's the answer.
People talk about building information highways, but you'd like to
have desirable destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole lot of money to spend if we don't get some
additional value. ``

   The signals are strong and unmistakable: Being handy with a
computer is becoming a requirement for anybody who expects to
succeed in college or in the workplace, and this fact of life will
become even more pronounced in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere. Many colleges expect students to show
up with computers, and some others give laptops to all incoming
students and expect them to know what to do with them. Starting
this fall, the only way to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Well-prepared professionals from automobile maintenance to
graphic design cannot leave home without the computer, or a good
understanding of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to use a computer has now become so basic, to come
to work without it would be like a carpenter reporting without a
hammer,'' said Bart Keith, a training supervisor with Siemens AG,
the German electrical engineering and electronics company.
</P>
<P>
   Given this new reality that governs education and the workplace,
what about young people who fail to become computer-literate?
</P>
<P>
   The computer have-nots could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with educators, employers and policy-makers underlined the
importance of young people gaining not just a knowledge of computer
technology, but also a comfort level that comes most readily from a
home environment that includes the computer and an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no longitudinal studies yet that track the experience
of a youngster with a home computer, against a youngster without
one, to show what happens later to each of them,'' said Kathy
O'Neill, director of instructional technology at Georgia State
University. ``But we do know that kids who have access at school
and at home gain a better familiarity with computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts emphasized that once young people get the computer
bug, it is best that they get everyday access that allows them to
become comfortable with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an overall advantage to all our employees to be
computer-literate,'' said Nancy Seipel, a human resources
specialist with Georgia Power. ``Though we do not require the
ownership of a computer when we talk to job candidates, it is my
opinion that it would be extremely helpful if a person used a
computer every day at home, where they could get a working
knowledge of the machines and the software that makes them run.''
</P>
<P>
   For students, experts emphasize the need to learn the range of a
computer's uses, and to learn that it is most of all a window on a
larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child needs connection to the Internet because that is
what expands her access to knowledge,'' said Richard Skinner,
president of Clayton College and State University in suburban
Atlanta. ``In my view, without Internet connection, your computer
is not much more than a typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states and cities have fully embraced that idea, making
Internet research an integral part of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month in Judy Mack's third-grade classroom at
Normandy Elementary in Centerville, Ohio, a group of girls
clustered around a computer connected to an Internet site about the
sun. The girls rattled off solar facts, carefully recording their
findings on pads of paper. Beside them, Annie Lee, 8, surfed sites
as she developed a report on Neptune, excitedly announcing to her
neighbors that Voyager II visited the planet the same year she was
born.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthier school districts are more likely to provide such
technological enhancements. About 75 percent of students in richer
districts, where most students don't qualify for federally
subsidized lunch programs, used the Internet at school, the
Education Department reported in 1996. At poorer districts, where
most students were in the lunch program, only about half used the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For some districts, getting computers is only half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whittier Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, is eligible to
receive top-of-the-line Pentium computers, but the building's
electrical system cannot handle the load of four computers switched
on at one time in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have these computers, but if you can't plug them in
they are a paperweight,'' said Principal Judy Warren.
</P>
<P>
   At Belmont High School, Dayton's computer technology magnet
school, the only Internet access is through teacher David Kraus's
laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Nealon, chief information officer for Dayton Schools, said
wider Internet access depends on the district getting ``e-rate''
funding, money from telecommunications companies that is now being
held up by bickering in Congress and challenges from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts believe that children can significantly
improve their computer skills by using them at schools or
libraries, others are certain computers are needed in homes _ as
long as they are used for more than just playing games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have learned is that familiarity with computers
develops other skills, skills that could be just as attractive as
computing skills,'' said Nancy Hamilton, program director of a
nonprofit agency called Apple Corps, which offers free computers to
parents who volunteer to learn the machines and then commit
themselves to service in the schools of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you cannot run a computer without reading. You can't
work a computer very long without being a problem-solver. You learn
flexibility as a computer operator,'' said Hamilton. When that
screen suddenly goes blank, you have to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What industry wants is problem-solvers, and people with the
flexibility to keep learning, keep developing in school and
competence. Well, familiarity with the computer is the beginning of
a lot of those skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as wealthier school districts are often better equipped
with technology, home computers are found mostly in high-income
households. More than 75 percent of U.S. households earning more
that $75,000 owned a computer in 1997, the Commerce Department
reported, compared to about less than 20 percent of households
earning under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   This has sparked efforts by some private groups to create
computer centers where children can have ready access.
</P>
<P>
   Some centers have been established by businesses and church
groups. In Georgia, DeKalb County has established a half dozen
``family computer'' centers where children and parents can use the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the falling prices of computers and allied equipment
such as printers and monitors, financial affordability may become
less of a factor in who owns a home computer, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   New computers are now available for less than $500, the price of
a fancy cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems beyond dispute to me,'' said Lyndon Wade, president
of the Atlanta Urban League, ``that computers must become at least
as handy as telephones, because they are that kind of basic need.''

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ After decades of barely scraping by,
Lionel Benjamin is now on a fanatical quest to make his life
better.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher has called on friends, neighbors, and anyone else he
can think of, goading them to attend a motivational seminar at the
dilapidated Rex Theater.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them come.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the gathering attracts an overflow crowd of 300 people,
who are all waiting to hear a speaker's roaring discourse on how to
make dreams a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin is just a small part of one of the most peculiar
expansions in business today -- the expansion into Haiti of Amway
Corp., the giant, Michigan-based direct seller of vitamins,
shampoo, toilet paper, and a smorgasbord of household products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My salary as a teacher just wasn't sufficient to support my
family,'' said Benjamin, wearing a flashy, well-tailored suit.
``Now I'm in a business that's booming, a business that I truly
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's been urging people to attend Amway's monthly meetings
for about three years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country
doesn't deter his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Haiti's 8 million people earn less than $250 a year
while living in grass huts with no access to safe water or adequate
sanitation. With an economy in shambles, Haiti also suffers from an
unemployment rate of more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than 2,300 people here are pushing Amway, successfully
marketing a wide range of products. These products include
everything from toothpaste, sold for $4.68, to a 20-piece set of
cookware, sold for $941.
</P>
<P>
   Even company officials acknowledge that, at first, Amway and
Haiti may seem like an odd mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered how this could work in Haiti . . . but I've been
very impressed with the people there,'' said Kelly Savage, director
of Amway North America Administration. ``We are attracting middle-
and upper-class people there (as distributors) who have worked hard
and have a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that Haitians, in general, are keenly interested
in nutrition so that vitamins and nutritional supplements have
become big hits, as have diapers, cosmetics, and skin-care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Amway is performing so well that the company launched its 49th
affiliate here in September -- Amway Haiti Limited.
</P>
<P>
   And Amway just finished work on a new service center, which sits
behind concrete walls across from a cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre sight, this modern investment by a
multibillion-dollar operation that is passed daily by scores of
poor peasants gracefully balancing huge baskets of rice, beans, and
various other foods on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the new center enables Haiti's growing number of
distributors to place orders one day and pick them up the next,
whereas before they might have had to wait months for orders to be
imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Amway was founded in 1959, and is supported by more than 450
personal care, household and other items. Today, the company has
more than 3 million distributors who peddle products in 80
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1998, Amway's worldwide sales totaled $5.7
billion, a drop from $7 billion the year before. The decline is
blamed on economic problems in Asia, where sales suffered a decline
of 18 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Amway products have been marketed in Haiti for nearly 20 years,
with the number of distributors continuing to climb steadily.
</P>
<P>
   The company's success in Haiti is not really that surprising.
Amway champions the dual themes of Christian morality and free
enterprise, both of which appeal to a conservative population fond
of the American lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the enticing incentive program doesn't hurt. The
company rewards its distributors -- or ``ambassadors'' in
Amway-speak -- with a portion of the sales that are generated by
those they've recruited, or sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent motivational meeting, a young, well-dressed man
named Al Colas took the stage like a flamboyant televangelist.
</P>
<P>
   As Amway's top distributor in Haiti, Colas even enjoys a
regal-sounding title: Diamond Haiti Distributor.
</P>
<P>
   He presented the Amway program as he might a passion for
religion -- whooping, stomping, hollering, and flapping his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of prospective clients loved it, wildly applauding any
shot they might have at becoming rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amway allows us to take responsibility for ourselves, to be
our own bosses,'' said Freddie Clermont, who has distributed Amway
here for nearly two years. ``I know that the products cost a lot,
but they truly are excellent products.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the shampoo, which costs more than $6 -- or more
than a week's salary for many Haitians -- might last three times
longer than local brands.
</P>
<P>
   She added that two of the most popular Amway products in Haiti
are soap and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Knowles, president of the Haitian-American Chamber of
Commerce here, said Amway products have become status symbols in
Haiti, the same way Tupperware products are throughout much of
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very poor country, but we do have a tiny, tiny
minority of people who have a lot of money, and they want to spend
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Amway has been criticized in books and
articles for offering over-priced products and making promises it
can't keep.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't dampened the enthusiasm of Haitian entrepreneurs
like Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do Amway because I have lots of love in my heart and I
really want people to be happy,'' he said earnestly. ``The cookware
set, for example, comes with a lifetime guarantee, and you can't
beat that.''

 &HT;    E-RATE PROGRAM TO WIRE SCHOOLS MIRED IN PARTISAN SQUABBLE
 &HT;    660&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The once lofty goal to open up the high-tech
glories of the Internet to all of America's schoolchildren has
degenerated into an increasingly nasty partisan squabble.
</P>
<P>
   In this fall's election campaign, Republicans accused the
Democrats of backing an illegal tax on all telephone users to
underwrite an ineffective bureaucracy that so far has done little,
if anything, to help more than 100,000 eligible schools get the
equipment and service they need to put the Internet in every
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats portrayed a Republican-led bid to alter the funding
plan, known as the ``e-rate,'' as a move against improving
education, creating more useful libraries and investing in the
nation's future work force.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators find themselves trapped in the middle of
this political fight, which will resume in the next Congress.
Although the e-rate program remains in force, it has been
substantially scaled back by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) in the face of sharp congressional protests.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the nation's large telecommunications companies, or
telcos, guardedly watch events unfold. They have a huge financial
stake in the eventual outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Under the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act, the telcos are
obliged to offer all schools, from kindergarten through the 12th
grade, as well as all public libraries, discounts on their lowest
institutional rate for telephone and Internet services. These
discounts range from 20 to 90 percent, depending on economic need
as measured by the percentage of students eligible for the national
school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers originally saw it, the e-rate discounts _ the ``e''
stands for ``education'' _ would be relatively painless to
consumers because the telcos could offset their costs with some of
the additional revenue they earned through deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the telcos, faced with a spate of mergers amid a newly
ultra-competitive climate, declined to continue a 60-year-old
tradition of hidden subsidies. Starting in July, they insisted that
their costs of subsidizing the school wiring effort _ a small part
of a longstanding ``universal access'' fee _ appear as a separate
charge on most phone statements.
</P>
<P>
   This fee increasingly began to be portrayed by opponents of the
program as yet another federal tax _ and worse yet, one that
Congress had never specifically voted into law.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans even had a politically convenient label, the ``Gore
tax,'' thanks to the vice president's prominent role in driving the
school wiring bill through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the e-rate, Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said, ``the
FCC is incorrect in its contention that the 'Gore Tax' is a fee. A
fee is a charge for a service rendered; however, long-distance
users are not receiving a service. Thus, if a charge is levied and
no direct service is provided then it is characterized as a tax,
regardless of whether it shows up on your IRS 1040 form or your
telephone bill, and only Congress can impose a tax under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Weller, Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., wants the Congress
that will convene in January to cut the current 3 percent telephone
excise tax that pays for the hookups to 1 percent, and earmark that
money for state block grants for schools and libraries. Both
members sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all
revenue legislation originates.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, the telcos saw the changes made
to the universal service funding mechanism in the 1996 law as a
chance to once more put the entire question before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans is considering a case from Texas that challenges the
legality of the whole universal service program, including the
e-rate. A ruling on this issue could come by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The e-rate program builds on 1936 federal legislation that
created a special fund to subsidize basic telephone service to
every home in the nation, offering phone companies the financial
means to deliver a dial tone to even the most rural, sparsely
populated areas, where connections would otherwise be prohibitively
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 percent of classrooms in U.S. libraries and schools
have Internet connections. Roughly 2 million more need to be
connected, and within the next five years, some 10,000 new schools
will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The universal service fund was supposed to provide $2.2 billion
for Internet modernization in 1998. Since the total tab from the
approximately 30,000 schools and libraries that have applied for
aid came to slightly more than $2 billion, it appeared at first
that the federal kitty would more than fully support the actual
demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress soon raised alarms, fueled in part by a General
Accounting Office report that labeled the e-rate program a prime
candidate for fraud, waste and abuse. In response, on June 12 the
FCC cut e-rate funding by 43 percent, to $1.3 billion. And the
agency stretched out overall funding by six more months to June 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress originally saw the discounts as an entitlement to all
schools,'' noted David Byer, vice president for government affairs
for the Software Publishers Association. But, as matters stand,
only the very poorest school districts in the country will qualify
for inside (Internet) wiring.''
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on the discounts, Congress had failed to take into
full account that low-cost hookups were of little value to schools
unless they could be supported by a full panoply of switches,
routers and wires, to say nothing of training, needed to make the
system function effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But in focusing on the supportive Internet hardware, some school
administrators saw a fresh source of federal funds to fix up their
schools under the guise of making them ``Internet-ready.'' Reports
of such attempted end runs incensed key members of Congress and
helped force the FCC's decision to stretch out and scale back
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of June, the FCC had collected about $650
million to fund the e-rate program. Regulators plan to limit
collections for each subsequent quarter through mid-1999 to $325
million per quarter. Since the federal program can pay out no more
than has been collected, it's evident that many eligible schools
and libraries will not get the funding they want until well into
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Held up since July, the first allocation of $2.25 billion in
funds was to be paid out in late October. Meantime, the FCC
extended the application deadline for the next funding period to
Dec. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I fear we may be losing our perspective on these
matters,'' said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore, a strong backer of the
e-rate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-distance phone bills are now at their lowest point in
history,'' he said. ``The telecommunications industry has saved
billions in costs as a result of telecommunications reform to date.
And yet a controversy has erupted over one element that would
represent less than one cent per day per customer line to provide
Internet access for America's schools and libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Blumenauer: ``Schools and libraries across the country
took the federal government at its word. They spent countless hours
and tens of thousands of dollars preparing applications to receive
funds from the FCC under the e-rate program. We must not break that
commitment.''

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY FOCUSES ON TEACHING, NOT HARDWARE
 &HT;    With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By MICHAEL E. KANELL
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When high-tech America began a high-profile critique of
education in the early 1980s, many executives rebuked schools for
churning out students whose math and science skills were inferior.
</P>
<P>
   When the personal computer boom arrived, the technology
companies campaigned to get the machines into classrooms, often
donating hardware or software, or offering discounts. With the
establishment of a national Net Day, the companies sent employees
into schools to install connections for linking to the global
information network.
</P>
<P>
   But as the millennium edges closer, the businesses are still
worried that future progress, innovation and growth will be stymied
by an inadequate work force.
</P>
<P>
   And while they continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars
to supercharge the connection between education and technology, the
larger companies have a new focus _ on the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Turning education into an industry clone would miss the point,
said Robin Willner, IBM director of social policy and programs.
``Vocational education has its role, but that's not what this is
about. We are not having trouble hiring entry-level workers for the
factory floor.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, with offices around the nation and the world, wants a
well-educated citizenry and a strong economy wherever it operates,
she said. ``You can't have a successful business in an unsuccessful
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching computer skills should not be the top priority, Willner
said. ``The priority is basic academic competence. If you have
basic academic skills, I can teach you how to use a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM in 1994 committed $35 million to a program it is called
``Reinventing Education.'' Wary of the stereotype of a high-tech
company ridding itself of obsolete products while boasting of
philanthropy, the company tries to work with a school the way it
would with a customer, Willner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not coming to back up the truck and give you whatever
happens to be in the warehouse,'' she said. ``We work the same way
as we do with our best customers. We focus on a special problem
that you want to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie(cq) Bishop, AT&AMP;T corporate affairs director, said the
company sees a distinction between vocational training and the kind
of experience that makes someone a better employee. Programs
supported by AT&AMP;T are not intended to just teach the narrowest of
skills that might be used in the workplace, she said. ``I don't see
it as job training, but I do see it as preparation for work. I'm
from the liberal arts point of view. If I teach you how to learn,
you can teach yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are a key focus for AT&AMP;T, too. But the technology
brought to schools should not be seen as an end in itself, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the equipment in the world is not going to make any
difference until teachers understand it,'' Bishop said. ``I would
like to see teachers viewing technology the same way they view
textbooks, filmstrips and videotapes. They are tools.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T in 1997 committed $150 million to a long-term education
program known as the Learning Network. While infrastructure is a
large part of the picture, much of the effort is aimed at teachers,
Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have similar approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. helps shape and pay for programs
in which teachers get out of classrooms to see how other jobs look
and feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent of teachers have never worked outside
education. This is designed to create models of how teachers can be
engaged in the workforce,'' a spokesman said. ``It is not just to
watch. Teachers have to deliver value.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Thomas, executive director of the Morris Brown
Research Institute, which trains teachers and administrators, uses
a studio in Atlanta that can broadcast training sessions to schools
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to be a vehicle to help teachers better understand and
utilize technology as a tool in the classroom. We are sure can't
manufacture more time for teachers, but we can help them utilize
their time much better.''

 &HT;    TECH GAP DIVIDES THE RACES
 &HT;    With DIGITAL-DIVIDE and DIGITAL-RACE-DATA. Moving in (a)
national and (f) financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barry Cooper remembers how it easy it was for him
and other black teenagers to get a job in his home town of
Wilmington, N.C., in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though they were racially troubled times, coming out of
high school, if you were big and strong and had a good work ethic,
you could have a job in one of the factories _ with no training at
all,'' Cooper, now 42, recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as experts predict that high school graduates will
need computer skills to compete for even entry-level jobs, minority
students remain on the wrong side of a widening ``digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, white households have been acquiring computers
at a faster pace than black or Hispanic households, Commerce
Department studies show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still raising basketball goals in housing projects and
community centers,'' said Cooper, founder and general manager of
Black Voices, perhaps the most popular World Wide Web site among
African Americans. ''The day must come when the truck arrives at
the community center and it's loaded with computers instead of
athletic equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   That day has come in Houston. Two years ago, the Boys and Girls
Clubs built a new sports facility near a public housing project.
Now, with the donation of computers from Compaq, the facility is
expanding its computer education program to meet the growing
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the computer program has now eclipsed sports in
popularity, said John Havard, president of the Houston area clubs.
''My staff told me it would, but I'm still surprised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 children, mostly African Americans and Hispanics, took
computer classes at the Houston Boys and Girls Clubs last year.
Bilingual staff members are available to help Hispanic children
overcome language barriers.
</P>
<P>
   To try to close the technology gap between affluent and
low-income communities, the Commerce Department has funded 332
projects in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first _ and most successful _ is ``Plugged In,'' a
program in East Palo Alto, Calif., that operates a community center
with computers and Internet access. It has spawned ``Plugged In
Enterprises,'' in which kids are operating their own computer
services business of producing Web pages for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Private efforts are well under way at the local level as well,
and have intensified as the demands of the information age have
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the nonprofit Boys Harbor youth agency, which
educates underprivileged children in New York's Harlem and the
Bronx, introduced computers to the curriculum ''just to get them
comfortable with technology that we thought was going to be
essential in the future,'' said Bob Wallace, the agency's
curriculum director. ''We had no idea then how important it already
has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts at the federal and local levels, the digital
divide has widened in terms of race and ethnicity, according to a
recent study by the Commerce Department that used Census Bureau
survey data from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ''Falling Through the Net II,'' found that
while the ownership of personal computers and access to on-line
services have grown significantly for minority groups since 1994,
African Americans and Hispanics still lag far behind the national
average _ and the gap between the races is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is not limited to personal owership of PCs. It extends
to the schools, according to a recent survey by Vanderbilt
University researchers. That survey, published last April in the
journal ''Science,'' found that while 78 percent of the nation's
public schools have some sort of Internet access, only 63 percent
of the schools in communities with high percentages of poor or
minority students are connected.
</P>
<P>
   ''A significant segment of our society is in danger of being
denied equal access,'' said Donna Hoffman, who co-authored the
Vanderbilt study.
</P>
<P>
   But if government efforts have fallen short, the high-tech
industry that has spawned thousands of millionaires has been slow
to lend a hand in trying to bridge the technology gap, according to
critics such as like Barbara Moran, author of the ''Dummies''
series book, ''Internet Director for Kids &AMP; Parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The private sector ought to be ashamed of itself for not doing
more, especially the high-tech industry,'' she said. ''If nothing
else, they ought to be interested in building future customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing her book, Moran worked for two high-tech firms as
editor of their childen's divisions. ''Our teams begged for a van
to take to poorer neighborhoods just to introduce parents and kids
to computers,'' she said. ''Didn't happen. Not 'cost effective.'
Too many 'liability issues'.''
</P>
<P>
   With prices of PCs and on-line services dropping so
dramatically, there may be little need for other incentives from
the private sector, however.
</P>
<P>
   A year and half ago, Cooper's ''Black Voices'' Web site was
experiencing about 1.4 million hits a month. Then the price of PCs
dropped below $1,000 and America Online, the nation's largest
on-line service, replaced hourly rates with a flat monthly rate.
Within months, Internet traffic to ''Black Voices'' doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's affordable and easy, the kids will play,'' said
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech in June to the National Urban League's summit on
technology, Larry Irving, President Clinton's top
telecommunications adviser, warned of the difficulties in
refocusing minority youths ''from high-tops to high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most kids would rather grow up to be Michael Jordan than
(Microsoft founder) Bill Gates and spend time on a basketball court
than in a computer room,'' said Irving, who is black. ''Our
children should know as much about Paul Allen, the co-founder of
Microsoft and owner of the Portland Trailblazers NBA team) as Paul
Pierce (the Boston Celtics first-round draft pick), and as much
about Michael Dell (founder of Dell Computers) as Michael Jordan.
And our children should have a shot _ better than a three-pointer _
at being one of those computer success stories.''

 &HT;    SCHOOLS WITH COMPUTERS NOW FOCUSING ON TEACHER TRAINING
 &HT;    640&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By SHARON JAYSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nine-year-old Erik Park leaned toward the
computer monitor as he and Amy Byars, his fourth-grade teacher,
stared at an animated lion meandering across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Creating that lion and making it move was a small step for the
pair, part of a group from Pflugerville, Texas, who spent a
half-day away from their classrooms learning a software program
called Hyperstudio that enhances student reports with sound,
graphics and movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness he's here,'' Byars said of Erik. ``I think
children are better sponges than adults are. He's taking it all in,
and I'm kind of fighting to remember everything that she's teaching
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As technology gains ever-wider use in classes from math to
social studies, Pflugerville school officials believe that this
buddy system will make them more effective teachers and users of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is an example of how school districts around the
country are changing their focus on technology in education. Now
that they've spent billions of dollars to put computers in the
classroom, they are spending billions more to teach teachers how
technology can be used for more than word processing or an Internet
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are not doing the long-term planning and investment in
professional development to take advantage of the hardware they're
putting in,'' said Jane Park, project director of the CEO Forum, a
Washington, D.C.-based partnership of business and education
leaders founded to promote equal access to technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft of a report to be released in February, the Forum
concluded, ``As we push forward to full technology integration, we
must ensure that all schools provide children with access to
technology and with teachers who can help them make the most of
that technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge in teacher training is partly spurred by the
realization that over the next decade, about two-thirds of the
nation's teachers will be replaced. An estimated 2 million new
teachers must fill those jobs, and knowing technology will be a
prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   But training millions of teachers across the country _ those
currently in the classroom and those preparing to enter it _ is
trickier than it sounds. Skill levels run the gamut, from those who
know little more than word processing to those who incorporate
computers in their daily lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anywhere near the robustness of a professional
development system that we need, because it's really expensive,''
said Cheryl Lemke, executive director of the Milken Exchange on
Education Technology, which aims to advance effective use of
technology in America's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of training is getting teachers to think beyond their
traditional role and move into the role of facilitator. Using
technology in the classroom means students often work in groups
instead of sitting quietly as the teacher lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the learning is project-based, which means students may
do an Internet search one minute and create a graphic or add sound
to a report the next.
</P>
<P>
   About 540 students use the Kettering Middle School's technology
lab each school day, typing in a code name to begin answering
questions specifically targeting their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   One student may be doing fractions, another word problems and a
third pre-algebra. Poor readers can hear the questions read aloud
over headphones to make sure their reading skills don't limit their
ability to answer the question. Teachers circle the room offering
assistance and checking students' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we ever do this in the classroom?'' asked lab teacher
Deborah Schlarb.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Technology forces teachers to re-examine their methods, and if
the teachers aren't comfortable with it, the students won't be
using it.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders in this professional development push are Florida,
Texas and California, due to their large numbers of teachers and
students as well as the big role high-tech plays in their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Texas in 1988 became the first state to form a long-range plan
to ensure that the state's 250,000 teachers and almost 4 million
students are among the most computer-literate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Revised in 1996, the plan now includes more than a dozen
initiatives to help bring technology into schools and help teachers
use it. It includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A state financial technology allotment of $30 per student per
year to every
</P>
<P>
   district. The total projection for Texas schools during the
1998-99 school year is $111 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, established in 1995,
that requires telecommunications companies to contribute to school
technology. Companies offer discounted services to schools and
contribute a total of $1.5 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
   to wire public schools, libraries, higher education, and
nonprofit health care facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ A set of 12 technology standards that define computer
proficiency for teachers in the classroom. New certification
requirements for teachers will require a minimum level of
technology for all educators.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $33 million in state-administered federal grants for
teacher technology training this school year, plus $500,000 in
grants to school districts for exemplary technology programs that
can be shared with other districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ A variety of supplemental training aids available through
professional development sites, a statewide satellite audio and
video network, a videoconferencing network and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Texas Educational Network, the nation's first large-scale
electronic system to
</P>
<P>
   let teachers communicate via computer with a phone line and
modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are providing staff development through more
variety of opportunities than in many states,'' said Anita Givens,
senior director of instructional technology at the Texas Education
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   For those just entering the profession, the stakes are higher.
The Texas Board for Educator Certification is developing technology
requirements that should become part of the certification process
by 2001, said the agency's Stephanie Korcheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind on the educator preparation side,'' she said.
``The state has invested an awful lot of money in technology.
Schools generally have more technology on campus than teachers are
really able to utilize effectively. The training and support
teachers need has not been as adequate as it needs to be.''

 &HT;    WIRING SCHOOLS COULD COST BILLIONS AND YIELD LITTLE, SAY
DOUBTERS
 &HT;    830&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A band of dissenters is warning that as America
prepares to spend billions of dollars to wire classrooms to the
Internet, there is little proof that it will improve education.
</P>
<P>
   These doubters, most of them computer specialists, foresee a
generation of children who can point and click, but not think and
imagine. They speak of students who can send e-mail to pals across
the ocean, but not relate to classmates sitting next to them.
</P>
<P>
   And where proponents see vast information treasures in
cyberspace, techno-skeptics see mostly a time-consuming wasteland,
or worse. A few clicks, for example, can bring up video sex scenes
or on-line manuals for hacking into computer systems or building a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism has spurred a conference at Columbia University,
a handful of critical books, and a publication on the Internet
raising questions about the nation's infatuation with computers in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a bluntly worded essay in Time magazine last May, Yale
University computer science professor David Gelernter assailed
President Clinton's program to wire up every schoolroom, a
centerpiece of the administration's education agenda, as ``toxic
quackery.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Gelernter: ``First learn reading and writing, history and
arithmetic. Then play Frisbee, go fishing or surf the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the push to computerize is driven by expectations of
academic gains, researchers have yet to provide convincing evidence
that it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to do research to measure achievement gains
and increases in 'higher-order' thinking of kids who use and don't
use computers,'' said Edward Miller, who surveyed a broad range of
findings when he was editor of Harvard University's Education
Letter. ``The bottom line is that the research is inconclusive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study yet on technology in schools, the
Educational Testing Service concluded in September that while
proper use of technology helped some students, computers offered so
little promise in elementary grades that they may not be worth the
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have not dampened enthusiasm for high technology
among school boards and politicians, however. ``In the scholarly
community of people who try to do serious research on the impact of
technology, there is a lot of caution and doubt,'' Miller said.
``But the people who make education policy don't pay much attention
to those folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The total expense of computerizing schools has been estimated as
high as $100 billion for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Because high-tech companies stand to reap enormous profits,
``there's a juggernaut,'' said Peter Cookson, director of
educational outreach at Columbia University's Teachers College,
which late last year sponsored a conference on the potential
pitfalls in computerized education. ``I'm concerned that lots of it
is being driven by money. Education is a $600 billion business, and
there's the hardware and then the software.''
</P>
<P>
   These business interests work actively to keep educators and
policy-makers on their side. A major education software company,
Lightspan Partnership, recently teamed up with the American
Association of School Administrators to conduct a poll designed to
rebut the high-tech doubters. In their survey, released Oct. 13,
educators gave a ringing endorsement for spending more money for
technology, and 80 percent reported student gains through use of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the high-tech push comes as many schools have far more
fundamental problems, such as buildings that are crumbling, teacher
shortages, too few textbooks, and many children who arrive in the
mornings too hungry or too frightened by neighborhood violence to
concentrate on studies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, teachers have raised no concerted objections to the new
stress on the hot new technologies, although some are beginning to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're making a huge mistake'' in forcing computers on
young pupils, said Russell Monke, who teaches advanced computer
science at a public high school in Des Moines, Iowa. His experience
in the classroom, plus his research, have convinced him that
computer training is unnecessary and perhaps harmful until high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a serious change, a dramatic revolution in
the way that kids learn, and I don't see that the change is
particularly beneficial to children,'' Monke said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, the most computer-savvy students often do
poorly in his class because they lack more important life
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these kids live in a world that is abstract. They
spend time on TV, computers and video machines, and they aren't
getting involved with the community and neighborhood friends, or
even just climbing trees,'' he said. ``They need to bring into my
class at least a budding sense of moral and ethical sensibilities.
They need some sense of the world around them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As for falling behind on computer education, Monke said that
high school students can easily catch up on those mechanical
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Monke writes about such concerns in FutureNet, a twice-monthly
publication on the Internet edited by Steve Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott has traced the history of inventions, starting with the
radio and then the television, that were supposed to revolutionize
the classroom. ``The last piece of technology that has actually
stayed is the blackboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that the computer, like radios and televisions, will
become no more than tools for educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proponents of these new technologies have taken their eyes
off the educational ball,'' he wrote in his newsletter. ``They have
not first identified an education problem and then gone out and
determined that, yes, computers do indeed look like the best of all
possible solutions to this problem. Instead, bedazzled by the
technology, they simply assume its necessity and try to figure out
how it should be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone listening to such advice? Monke said he believes
people are beginning to hear. ``It's almost like we've been drunk
from technophilia and we're going to have a long hangover, but I
think we're going to get sober and look at what's happening in
these kids' lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proponents are asking questions, as well. Michael
Hannafin, who holds a chair as ``eminent scholar'' of
technology-enhanced learning at the University of Georgia, said,
``My whole career lies in the future of technology and learning, so
I'm very hopeful.'' But he added that he saw both ``enormous
potential and enormous peril.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To wire every classroom (to the Internet) is a pretty naive
view,'' he said. ``A lot of people believe that's the answer.
People talk about building information highways, but you'd like to
have desirable destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole lot of money to spend if we don't get some
additional value. ``

 &HT;    ECONOMIC FUTURE DARKENING FOR COMPUTER HAVE-NOTS
 &HT;    With DIGITAL-SCHOOLS, DIGITAL-INDUSTRY, DIGITAL-RACE,
DIGITAL-ERATE and DIGITAL-DISSENT. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.

   The signals are strong and unmistakable: Being handy with a
computer is becoming a requirement for anybody who expects to
succeed in college or in the workplace, and this fact of life will
become even more pronounced in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere. Many colleges expect students to show
up with computers, and some others give laptops to all incoming
students and expect them to know what to do with them. Starting
this fall, the only way to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Well-prepared professionals from automobile maintenance to
graphic design cannot leave home without the computer, or a good
understanding of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to use a computer has now become so basic, to come
to work without it would be like a carpenter reporting without a
hammer,'' said Bart Keith, a training supervisor with Siemens AG,
the German electrical engineering and electronics company.
</P>
<P>
   Given this new reality that governs education and the workplace,
what about young people who fail to become computer-literate?
</P>
<P>
   The computer have-nots could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with educators, employers and policy-makers underlined the
importance of young people gaining not just a knowledge of computer
technology, but also a comfort level that comes most readily from a
home environment that includes the computer and an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no longitudinal studies yet that track the experience
of a youngster with a home computer, against a youngster without
one, to show what happens later to each of them,'' said Kathy
O'Neill, director of instructional technology at Georgia State
University. ``But we do know that kids who have access at school
and at home gain a better familiarity with computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts emphasized that once young people get the computer
bug, it is best that they get everyday access that allows them to
become comfortable with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an overall advantage to all our employees to be
computer-literate,'' said Nancy Seipel, a human resources
specialist with Georgia Power. ``Though we do not require the
ownership of a computer when we talk to job candidates, it is my
opinion that it would be extremely helpful if a person used a
computer every day at home, where they could get a working
knowledge of the machines and the software that makes them run.''
</P>
<P>
   For students, experts emphasize the need to learn the range of a
computer's uses, and to learn that it is most of all a window on a
larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child needs connection to the Internet because that is
what expands her access to knowledge,'' said Richard Skinner,
president of Clayton College and State University in suburban
Atlanta. ``In my view, without Internet connection, your computer
is not much more than a typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states and cities have fully embraced that idea, making
Internet research an integral part of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month in Judy Mack's third-grade classroom at
Normandy Elementary in Centerville, Ohio, a group of girls
clustered around a computer connected to an Internet site about the
sun. The girls rattled off solar facts, carefully recording their
findings on pads of paper. Beside them, Annie Lee, 8, surfed sites
as she developed a report on Neptune, excitedly announcing to her
neighbors that Voyager II visited the planet the same year she was
born.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthier school districts are more likely to provide such
technological enhancements. About 75 percent of students in richer
districts, where most students don't qualify for federally
subsidized lunch programs, used the Internet at school, the
Education Department reported in 1996. At poorer districts, where
most students were in the lunch program, only about half used the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For some districts, getting computers is only half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whittier Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, is eligible to
receive top-of-the-line Pentium computers, but the building's
electrical system cannot handle the load of four computers switched
on at one time in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have these computers, but if you can't plug them in
they are a paperweight,'' said Principal Judy Warren.
</P>
<P>
   At Belmont High School, Dayton's computer technology magnet
school, the only Internet access is through teacher David Kraus's
laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Nealon, chief information officer for Dayton Schools, said
wider Internet access depends on the district getting ``e-rate''
funding, money from telecommunications companies that is now being
held up by bickering in Congress and challenges from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts believe that children can significantly
improve their computer skills by using them at schools or
libraries, others are certain computers are needed in homes _ as
long as they are used for more than just playing games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have learned is that familiarity with computers
develops other skills, skills that could be just as attractive as
computing skills,'' said Nancy Hamilton, program director of a
nonprofit agency called Apple Corps, which offers free computers to
parents who volunteer to learn the machines and then commit
themselves to service in the schools of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you cannot run a computer without reading. You can't
work a computer very long without being a problem-solver. You learn
flexibility as a computer operator,'' said Hamilton. When that
screen suddenly goes blank, you have to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What industry wants is problem-solvers, and people with the
flexibility to keep learning, keep developing in school and
competence. Well, familiarity with the computer is the beginning of
a lot of those skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as wealthier school districts are often better equipped
with technology, home computers are found mostly in high-income
households. More than 75 percent of U.S. households earning more
that $75,000 owned a computer in 1997, the Commerce Department
reported, compared to about less than 20 percent of households
earning under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   This has sparked efforts by some private groups to create
computer centers where children can have ready access.
</P>
<P>
   Some centers have been established by businesses and church
groups. In Georgia, DeKalb County has established a half dozen
``family computer'' centers where children and parents can use the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the falling prices of computers and allied equipment
such as printers and monitors, financial affordability may become
less of a factor in who owns a home computer, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   New computers are now available for less than $500, the price of
a fancy cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems beyond dispute to me,'' said Lyndon Wade, president
of the Atlanta Urban League, ``that computers must become at least
as handy as telephones, because they are that kind of basic need.''

 &HT;    E-RATE PROGRAM TO WIRE SCHOOLS MIRED IN PARTISAN SQUABBLE
 &HT;    660&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The once lofty goal to open up the high-tech
glories of the Internet to all of America's schoolchildren has
degenerated into an increasingly nasty partisan squabble.
</P>
<P>
   In this fall's election campaign, Republicans accused the
Democrats of backing an illegal tax on all telephone users to
underwrite an ineffective bureaucracy that so far has done little,
if anything, to help more than 100,000 eligible schools get the
equipment and service they need to put the Internet in every
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats portrayed a Republican-led bid to alter the funding
plan, known as the ``e-rate,'' as a move against improving
education, creating more useful libraries and investing in the
nation's future work force.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators find themselves trapped in the middle of
this political fight, which will resume in the next Congress.
Although the e-rate program remains in force, it has been
substantially scaled back by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) in the face of sharp congressional protests.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the nation's large telecommunications companies, or
telcos, guardedly watch events unfold. They have a huge financial
stake in the eventual outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Under the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act, the telcos are
obliged to offer all schools, from kindergarten through the 12th
grade, as well as all public libraries, discounts on their lowest
institutional rate for telephone and Internet services. These
discounts range from 20 to 90 percent, depending on economic need
as measured by the percentage of students eligible for the national
school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers originally saw it, the e-rate discounts _ the ``e''
stands for ``education'' _ would be relatively painless to
consumers because the telcos could offset their costs with some of
the additional revenue they earned through deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the telcos, faced with a spate of mergers amid a newly
ultra-competitive climate, declined to continue a 60-year-old
tradition of hidden subsidies. Starting in July, they insisted that
their costs of subsidizing the school wiring effort _ a small part
of a longstanding ``universal access'' fee _ appear as a separate
charge on most phone statements.
</P>
<P>
   This fee increasingly began to be portrayed by opponents of the
program as yet another federal tax _ and worse yet, one that
Congress had never specifically voted into law.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans even had a politically convenient label, the ``Gore
tax,'' thanks to the vice president's prominent role in driving the
school wiring bill through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the e-rate, Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said, ``the
FCC is incorrect in its contention that the 'Gore Tax' is a fee. A
fee is a charge for a service rendered; however, long-distance
users are not receiving a service. Thus, if a charge is levied and
no direct service is provided then it is characterized as a tax,
regardless of whether it shows up on your IRS 1040 form or your
telephone bill, and only Congress can impose a tax under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Weller, Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., wants the Congress
that will convene in January to cut the current 3 percent telephone
excise tax that pays for the hookups to 1 percent, and earmark that
money for state block grants for schools and libraries. Both
members sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all
revenue legislation originates.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, the telcos saw the changes made
to the universal service funding mechanism in the 1996 law as a
chance to once more put the entire question before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans is considering a case from Texas that challenges the
legality of the whole universal service program, including the
e-rate. A ruling on this issue could come by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The e-rate program builds on 1936 federal legislation that
created a special fund to subsidize basic telephone service to
every home in the nation, offering phone companies the financial
means to deliver a dial tone to even the most rural, sparsely
populated areas, where connections would otherwise be prohibitively
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 percent of classrooms in U.S. libraries and schools
have Internet connections. Roughly 2 million more need to be
connected, and within the next five years, some 10,000 new schools
will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The universal service fund was supposed to provide $2.2 billion
for Internet modernization in 1998. Since the total tab from the
approximately 30,000 schools and libraries that have applied for
aid came to slightly more than $2 billion, it appeared at first
that the federal kitty would more than fully support the actual
demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress soon raised alarms, fueled in part by a General
Accounting Office report that labeled the e-rate program a prime
candidate for fraud, waste and abuse. In response, on June 12 the
FCC cut e-rate funding by 43 percent, to $1.3 billion. And the
agency stretched out overall funding by six more months to June 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress originally saw the discounts as an entitlement to all
schools,'' noted David Byer, vice president for government affairs
for the Software Publishers Association. But, as matters stand,
only the very poorest school districts in the country will qualify
for inside (Internet) wiring.''
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on the discounts, Congress had failed to take into
full account that low-cost hookups were of little value to schools
unless they could be supported by a full panoply of switches,
routers and wires, to say nothing of training, needed to make the
system function effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But in focusing on the supportive Internet hardware, some school
administrators saw a fresh source of federal funds to fix up their
schools under the guise of making them ``Internet-ready.'' Reports
of such attempted end runs incensed key members of Congress and
helped force the FCC's decision to stretch out and scale back
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of June, the FCC had collected about $650
million to fund the e-rate program. Regulators plan to limit
collections for each subsequent quarter through mid-1999 to $325
million per quarter. Since the federal program can pay out no more
than has been collected, it's evident that many eligible schools
and libraries will not get the funding they want until well into
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Held up since July, the first allocation of $2.25 billion in
funds was to be paid out in late October. Meantime, the FCC
extended the application deadline for the next funding period to
Dec. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I fear we may be losing our perspective on these
matters,'' said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore, a strong backer of the
e-rate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-distance phone bills are now at their lowest point in
history,'' he said. ``The telecommunications industry has saved
billions in costs as a result of telecommunications reform to date.
And yet a controversy has erupted over one element that would
represent less than one cent per day per customer line to provide
Internet access for America's schools and libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Blumenauer: ``Schools and libraries across the country
took the federal government at its word. They spent countless hours
and tens of thousands of dollars preparing applications to receive
funds from the FCC under the e-rate program. We must not break that
commitment.''

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY FOCUSES ON TEACHING, NOT HARDWARE
 &HT;    With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By MICHAEL E. KANELL
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When high-tech America began a high-profile critique of
education in the early 1980s, many executives rebuked schools for
churning out students whose math and science skills were inferior.
</P>
<P>
   When the personal computer boom arrived, the technology
companies campaigned to get the machines into classrooms, often
donating hardware or software, or offering discounts. With the
establishment of a national Net Day, the companies sent employees
into schools to install connections for linking to the global
information network.
</P>
<P>
   But as the millennium edges closer, the businesses are still
worried that future progress, innovation and growth will be stymied
by an inadequate work force.
</P>
<P>
   And while they continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars
to supercharge the connection between education and technology, the
larger companies have a new focus _ on the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Turning education into an industry clone would miss the point,
said Robin Willner, IBM director of social policy and programs.
``Vocational education has its role, but that's not what this is
about. We are not having trouble hiring entry-level workers for the
factory floor.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, with offices around the nation and the world, wants a
well-educated citizenry and a strong economy wherever it operates,
she said. ``You can't have a successful business in an unsuccessful
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching computer skills should not be the top priority, Willner
said. ``The priority is basic academic competence. If you have
basic academic skills, I can teach you how to use a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM in 1994 committed $35 million to a program it is called
``Reinventing Education.'' Wary of the stereotype of a high-tech
company ridding itself of obsolete products while boasting of
philanthropy, the company tries to work with a school the way it
would with a customer, Willner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not coming to back up the truck and give you whatever
happens to be in the warehouse,'' she said. ``We work the same way
as we do with our best customers. We focus on a special problem
that you want to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie(cq) Bishop, AT&AMP;T corporate affairs director, said the
company sees a distinction between vocational training and the kind
of experience that makes someone a better employee. Programs
supported by AT&AMP;T are not intended to just teach the narrowest of
skills that might be used in the workplace, she said. ``I don't see
it as job training, but I do see it as preparation for work. I'm
from the liberal arts point of view. If I teach you how to learn,
you can teach yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are a key focus for AT&AMP;T, too. But the technology
brought to schools should not be seen as an end in itself, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the equipment in the world is not going to make any
difference until teachers understand it,'' Bishop said. ``I would
like to see teachers viewing technology the same way they view
textbooks, filmstrips and videotapes. They are tools.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T in 1997 committed $150 million to a long-term education
program known as the Learning Network. While infrastructure is a
large part of the picture, much of the effort is aimed at teachers,
Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have similar approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. helps shape and pay for programs
in which teachers get out of classrooms to see how other jobs look
and feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent of teachers have never worked outside
education. This is designed to create models of how teachers can be
engaged in the workforce,'' a spokesman said. ``It is not just to
watch. Teachers have to deliver value.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Thomas, executive director of the Morris Brown
Research Institute, which trains teachers and administrators, uses
a studio in Atlanta that can broadcast training sessions to schools
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to be a vehicle to help teachers better understand and
utilize technology as a tool in the classroom. We are sure can't
manufacture more time for teachers, but we can help them utilize
their time much better.''

 &HT;    TECH GAP DIVIDES THE RACES
 &HT;    With DIGITAL-DIVIDE and DIGITAL-RACE-DATA. Moving in (a)
national and (f) financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barry Cooper remembers how it easy it was for him
and other black teenagers to get a job in his home town of
Wilmington, N.C., in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though they were racially troubled times, coming out of
high school, if you were big and strong and had a good work ethic,
you could have a job in one of the factories _ with no training at
all,'' Cooper, now 42, recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as experts predict that high school graduates will
need computer skills to compete for even entry-level jobs, minority
students remain on the wrong side of a widening ``digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, white households have been acquiring computers
at a faster pace than black or Hispanic households, Commerce
Department studies show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still raising basketball goals in housing projects and
community centers,'' said Cooper, founder and general manager of
Black Voices, perhaps the most popular World Wide Web site among
African Americans. ''The day must come when the truck arrives at
the community center and it's loaded with computers instead of
athletic equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   That day has come in Houston. Two years ago, the Boys and Girls
Clubs built a new sports facility near a public housing project.
Now, with the donation of computers from Compaq, the facility is
expanding its computer education program to meet the growing
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the computer program has now eclipsed sports in
popularity, said John Havard, president of the Houston area clubs.
''My staff told me it would, but I'm still surprised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 children, mostly African Americans and Hispanics, took
computer classes at the Houston Boys and Girls Clubs last year.
Bilingual staff members are available to help Hispanic children
overcome language barriers.
</P>
<P>
   To try to close the technology gap between affluent and
low-income communities, the Commerce Department has funded 332
projects in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first _ and most successful _ is ``Plugged In,'' a
program in East Palo Alto, Calif., that operates a community center
with computers and Internet access. It has spawned ``Plugged In
Enterprises,'' in which kids are operating their own computer
services business of producing Web pages for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Private efforts are well under way at the local level as well,
and have intensified as the demands of the information age have
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the nonprofit Boys Harbor youth agency, which
educates underprivileged children in New York's Harlem and the
Bronx, introduced computers to the curriculum ''just to get them
comfortable with technology that we thought was going to be
essential in the future,'' said Bob Wallace, the agency's
curriculum director. ''We had no idea then how important it already
has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts at the federal and local levels, the digital
divide has widened in terms of race and ethnicity, according to a
recent study by the Commerce Department that used Census Bureau
survey data from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ''Falling Through the Net II,'' found that
while the ownership of personal computers and access to on-line
services have grown significantly for minority groups since 1994,
African Americans and Hispanics still lag far behind the national
average _ and the gap between the races is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is not limited to personal owership of PCs. It extends
to the schools, according to a recent survey by Vanderbilt
University researchers. That survey, published last April in the
journal ''Science,'' found that while 78 percent of the nation's
public schools have some sort of Internet access, only 63 percent
of the schools in communities with high percentages of poor or
minority students are connected.
</P>
<P>
   ''A significant segment of our society is in danger of being
denied equal access,'' said Donna Hoffman, who co-authored the
Vanderbilt study.
</P>
<P>
   But if government efforts have fallen short, the high-tech
industry that has spawned thousands of millionaires has been slow
to lend a hand in trying to bridge the technology gap, according to
critics such as like Barbara Moran, author of the ''Dummies''
series book, ''Internet Director for Kids &AMP; Parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The private sector ought to be ashamed of itself for not doing
more, especially the high-tech industry,'' she said. ''If nothing
else, they ought to be interested in building future customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing her book, Moran worked for two high-tech firms as
editor of their childen's divisions. ''Our teams begged for a van
to take to poorer neighborhoods just to introduce parents and kids
to computers,'' she said. ''Didn't happen. Not 'cost effective.'
Too many 'liability issues'.''
</P>
<P>
   With prices of PCs and on-line services dropping so
dramatically, there may be little need for other incentives from
the private sector, however.
</P>
<P>
   A year and half ago, Cooper's ''Black Voices'' Web site was
experiencing about 1.4 million hits a month. Then the price of PCs
dropped below $1,000 and America Online, the nation's largest
on-line service, replaced hourly rates with a flat monthly rate.
Within months, Internet traffic to ''Black Voices'' doubled.

<P>
   ''If it's affordable and easy, the kids will play,'' said
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech in June to the National Urban League's summit on
technology, Larry Irving, President Clinton's top
telecommunications adviser, warned of the difficulties in
refocusing minority youths ''from high-tops to high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most kids would rather grow up to be Michael Jordan than
(Microsoft founder) Bill Gates and spend time on a basketball court
than in a computer room,'' said Irving, who is black. ''Our
children should know as much about Paul Allen, the co-founder of
Microsoft and owner of the Portland Trailblazers NBA team) as Paul
Pierce (the Boston Celtics first-round draft pick), and as much
about Michael Dell (founder of Dell Computers) as Michael Jordan.
And our children should have a shot _ better than a three-pointer _
at being one of those computer success stories.''

 &HT;    SCHOOLS WITH COMPUTERS NOW FOCUSING ON TEACHER TRAINING
 &HT;    640&AMP;add. With DIGITAL-DIVIDE. Moving in (a) national and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Nov. 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nine-year-old Erik Park leaned toward the
computer monitor as he and Amy Byars, his fourth-grade teacher,
stared at an animated lion meandering across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Creating that lion and making it move was a small step for the
pair, part of a group from Pflugerville, Texas, who spent a
half-day away from their classrooms learning a software program
called Hyperstudio that enhances student reports with sound,
graphics and movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness he's here,'' Byars said of Erik. ``I think
children are better sponges than adults are. He's taking it all in,
and I'm kind of fighting to remember everything that she's teaching
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As technology gains ever-wider use in classes from math to
social studies, Pflugerville school officials believe that this
buddy system will make them more effective teachers and users of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is an example of how school districts around the
country are changing their focus on technology in education. Now
that they've spent billions of dollars to put computers in the
classroom, they are spending billions more to teach teachers how
technology can be used for more than word processing or an Internet
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are not doing the long-term planning and investment in
professional development to take advantage of the hardware they're
putting in,'' said Jane Park, project director of the CEO Forum, a
Washington, D.C.-based partnership of business and education
leaders founded to promote equal access to technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft of a report to be released in February, the Forum
concluded, ``As we push forward to full technology integration, we
must ensure that all schools provide children with access to
technology and with teachers who can help them make the most of
that technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge in teacher training is partly spurred by the
realization that over the next decade, about two-thirds of the
nation's teachers will be replaced. An estimated 2 million new
teachers must fill those jobs, and knowing technology will be a
prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   But training millions of teachers across the country _ those
currently in the classroom and those preparing to enter it _ is
trickier than it sounds. Skill levels run the gamut, from those who
know little more than word processing to those who incorporate
computers in their daily lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anywhere near the robustness of a professional
development system that we need, because it's really expensive,''
said Cheryl Lemke, executive director of the Milken Exchange on
Education Technology, which aims to advance effective use of
technology in America's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of training is getting teachers to think beyond their
traditional role and move into the role of facilitator. Using
technology in the classroom means students often work in groups
instead of sitting quietly as the teacher lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the learning is project-based, which means students may
do an Internet search one minute and create a graphic or add sound
to a report the next.
</P>
<P>
   About 540 students use the Kettering Middle School's technology
lab each school day, typing in a code name to begin answering
questions specifically targeting their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   One student may be doing fractions, another word problems and a
third pre-algebra. Poor readers can hear the questions read aloud
over headphones to make sure their reading skills don't limit their
ability to answer the question. Teachers circle the room offering
assistance and checking students' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we ever do this in the classroom?'' asked lab teacher
Deborah Schlarb.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Technology forces teachers to re-examine their methods, and if
the teachers aren't comfortable with it, the students won't be
using it.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders in this professional development push are Florida,
Texas and California, due to their large numbers of teachers and
students as well as the big role high-tech plays in their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Texas in 1988 became the first state to form a long-range plan
to ensure that the state's 250,000 teachers and almost 4 million
students are among the most computer-literate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Revised in 1996, the plan now includes more than a dozen
initiatives to help bring technology into schools and help teachers
use it. It includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A state financial technology allotment of $30 per student per
year to every
</P>
<P>
   district. The total projection for Texas schools during the
1998-99 school year is $111 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, established in 1995,
that requires telecommunications companies to contribute to school
technology. Companies offer discounted services to schools and
contribute a total of $1.5 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
   to wire public schools, libraries, higher education, and
nonprofit health care facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ A set of 12 technology standards that define computer
proficiency for teachers in the classroom. New certification
requirements for teachers will require a minimum level of
technology for all educators.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $33 million in state-administered federal grants for
teacher technology training this school year, plus $500,000 in
grants to school districts for exemplary technology programs that
can be shared with other districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ A variety of supplemental training aids available through
professional development sites, a statewide satellite audio and
video network, a videoconferencing network and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Texas Educational Network, the nation's first large-scale
electronic system to
</P>
<P>
   let teachers communicate via computer with a phone line and
modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are providing staff development through more
variety of opportunities than in many states,'' said Anita Givens,
senior director of instructional technology at the Texas Education
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   For those just entering the profession, the stakes are higher.
The Texas Board for Educator Certification is developing technology
requirements that should become part of the certification process
by 2001, said the agency's Stephanie Korcheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind on the educator preparation side,'' she said.
``The state has invested an awful lot of money in technology.
Schools generally have more technology on campus than teachers are
really able to utilize effectively. The training and support
teachers need has not been as adequate as it needs to be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a popular myth that what counts in computer products is
features, price and performance. But if you listen to the people
who use computer products, or read what they're writing on message
boards and news groups, you get a different picture.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to customers _ and maybe more so _ is getting
good technical support from a company once they have bought a
product. And they are not always getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always 20 or 30 minutes waiting for them to answer the
phone,'' said Bob Dunkelberger, a boat builder in New Jersey with a
two-year-old personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Kaplan, a research librarian for the Delaware County
Library System, said it was not unusual for a support staff member
to throw out a solution, any solution, to end a call quickly.
``Sometimes you know they haven't a clue what the problem is,'' she
said. ``You try it. It won't work. Then you have to call back. When
you finally get back to them, they act surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, support technicians actually refuse to help.
While using Microsoft Access to work on a database project, Michael
Patrick Ellard and Daniel Wright, members of the Berkeley Macintosh
Users Group, tried to get help on Microsoft's premium help line,
which charges $55 each time for solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support person interrupted and said it was not a problem
with Access,'' Ellard said. ``It was with two programs working
together. Since Microsoft didn't support the other program, he
wouldn't try to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the prices of computers and software drop and companies look
for ways to stretch their money, tech support budgets can lose out
to the needs of marketing and research and development departments
or company shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   So companies are seeking ways to cut the cost of offering their
customers help. That often involves charging people who urgently
need help and want to talk to a tech support worker and providing
free online help, recorded help messages on voice mail and fax-back
services that cut down on personnel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all support calls are bad experiences. ``I find
hardware tech support people to be much better,'' Ellard said.
``With companies like Micron and Gateway, it's probably a problem
with a driver and they've heard it 400 times before, so they're
great _ they get you what you need.'' Dunkelberger said, ``The
smaller companies seem to make more of an effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting phone support can still be stressful. Many people do
not like asking for help, and when they pick up the phone, they
often have to wait a long time to speak to anyone _ while toll-call
charges mount.
</P>
<P>
   And technical support personnel sometimes lack basic
communications skills. ``Some people talk down to you, like you're
a child,'' Ms. Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   But members of technical support staff have their own problems.
Some customers ``go into the call with an attitude,'' said Peter
McGarahan, executive director of the Help Desk Institute, a
professional organization. ``The friendly customer support guy gets
someone on the other end who's upset and aggravated.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncommunicative callers can be an even bigger problem. David
Ratti, who has offered technical support on the phone for six years
and is now at Intel's Answer Express, said some callers held back
because they felt responsible for ``breaking something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll deny adding any hardware or software because they feel
they'll be judged,'' Ratti said. ``If a tech is going to do his
job, he'll find out in the end anyway. You can save yourself a lot
of time by 'fessing up right at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Support technicians say callers sometimes get upset if they do
not get the answers they expect. ``One user was complaining, `When
I type, it doesn't show up on screen,''' Ratti said. ``It turned
out he was trying to enter his password, and all he saw was
asterisks. And he didn't accept that there wasn't a problem. He was
upset and wanted to make it work right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual frustration between callers and company representatives
is not the only problem in technical support. In the past few
years, high-tech companies have steadily reduced their technical
support offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the Wordperfect Corp. provided free phone
support through a toll-free number. Nowadays, hardware and software
companies alike are reducing the scope of their free
technical-support offerings. And toll-free support lines are almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   At Wordperfect, many programs now come with only 30 days of free
support, and that applies only to installation problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming more common for people to pay for quick help.
Microsoft has a graduated pay-per-incident scale that ranges from a
$15 flat fee for help with a consumer product like Microsoft Money
to $35 for help with Windows or Office and $55 to $195 for
assistance with programming tools and databases.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, which publishes the popular Quicken software, provides
premium support, which offers faster response time and a toll-free
number, for $49 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes in Intuit's policy of free technical support are
typical of current trends in the industry. In 1989, Intuit provided
unlimited free support but did not have a toll-free number. Then it
scaled back, offering free phone support for registered users for
only one year.
</P>
<P>
   Now only a few problems, like installation, qualify for the
first year's free support. People with other questions are referred
to other sources, like the company's Web site, an
automated-response phone system and fax-back system, and support
programs that charge fees.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's new support policy is more liberal than some other
companies'. Microsoft, for example, provides only 90 days of free
support for Windows 98 (and many have complained that the free
support lines are constantly busy).
</P>
<P>
   Charging for a service that used to be free is bound to make
waves, even if paid support is faster, is offered through a
toll-free number and is covered by a flat rate of $50 a year. So
why are companies moving toward this model? Bill Rose, executive
director of the Software Support Professionals Association,
attributes the changes to tremendous expansion in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, 50 million multimedia PCs appeared under Christmas
trees _ amazingly complex boxes compared to a few short years ago _
and the majority were new users,'' Rose said. ``Most support calls,
about 85 percent, aren't about fixing bugs. They're what we
classify as usability issues. They're how-to calls.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGarahan said: ``The problems that come in have become a lot
harder. In the past, you had to be really technical to set up
networks in your home or publish Web sites. Now your neighbor's
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when your neighbor runs into difficulties, the support
center phones begin to ring. And that means that free support lines
are often busy. Tougher technical problems _ and remedial questions
_ result in longer calls, so customers have to wait longer.
</P>
<P>
   The companies with the most generous support policies often come
across as the least responsive. ``If support is free, then demand
is insatiable.'' McGarahan said. ``Most people want to pick up the
phone and call. You attach a value to support by charging for it.''
</P>
<P>
   If hardware and software makers are going to keep customers,
they clearly cannot charge for all the support they provide, though
the idea of bypassing a half-hour of being on hold on a telephone
makes pay-per-incident charges seem more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   For many how-to issues, companies have turned to the Internet to
dispense help. The medium is well suited to self-help, with its
lists of frequently asked questions, tips and searchable databases,
like Microsoft's Knowledge Base, that quickly focus on problem
areas.
</P>
<P>
   And it is attractive to many customers, too, because online help
is available around the clock. But customers may need to be prodded
to use online help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set up self-help and self-support,'' McGarahan said,
``customers need incentives not to pick up the phone and call.''
The incentive is price. If customers go on line, there is no charge
for anything they find there. For companies, online assistance
reduces the burden on already crowded phone systems and busy
support staffs. And when help is offered by e-mail, that can reduce
the stress on support staffs and callers alike.
</P>
<P>
   On-line help has changed the face of technical support. Rose
said that about 80 percent of such support was provided through
phone calls and 20 percent on line. ``We're hoping to shift it to
60-40,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Larsen, vice president for customer support at Gateway,
said that ``we don't have to staff the call centers to the extent
we did two years ago'' because of self-help services, like
tutorials on CD-ROMs that are shipped with Gateway computers.
</P>
<P>
   Peer groups are another source of technical help. Part of
Intuit's support package for Quicken is a Web-based forum for
customers to discuss problems and issues with other customers. Such
forums are the most popular third-party source of help.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows User Group Network, called Wugnet, manages some 200
support forums, which include message boards moderated by system
operators. To Joel Diamond, Wugnet's technical director, the
strength of the message boards is the diversity of the enthusiasts
and system operators who tackle people's technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a problem with an H-P computer, with a Diamond video
card and a Hayes modem running Windows NT, I could go to four
different vendors to get resolution,'' Diamond said. But if people
with problems post them in the right online message boards, they
can pick the brains of dozens of technical experts to hammer out
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But resources must be chosen carefully. ``A dedicated news
server supplied by a vendor can serve as a superb channel of
support,'' Diamond said, ``but I say caveat emptor. You don't know
what you're getting. Tech support advice from a source you don't
know can be more dangerous to your system than viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many people are turning to professional help
desks to sort out their problems with multiple products. If a
customer is prepared to pay a software developer for technical
support for one product, it is a small step to pay another
organization to support a whole collection of products.
</P>
<P>
   PC Crisis Line, Intel's Answer Express, the Geek Squad and the
grandiose-sounding America's Help Desk are a few of the hired guns
of the tech support world. They charge metered fees that start at
around $3 a minute, flat-rate fees for each call or monthly
subscriptions of $10 or $20.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the support comes from the company that supplies the
goods or another company, one problem remains. ``Good tech support
people are hard to keep,'' McGarahan said. ``People take the job to
get into a company, then go for more glamorous or highly
compensated jobs. In the industry's eyes, tech support hasn't been
a valid career path.'' By some accounts, most phone support workers
stay in their jobs for 8 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage professional standards in the industry, the
Software Support Professionals Association is offering
certification for tech support programs. And the Help Desk
Institute offers certification for help desk staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the certification criteria is aimed at human skills
sets,'' McGarahan said. That means, he said, ``making customers
feel that they're not idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   And some companies have begun to get smarter about keeping good
support representatives on the phones. At Gateway, for example, the
pay structure is based on customer satisfaction and the efficient
resolution of problems, so good tech support workers can advance
their careers without leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   How does that approach sit with tech support customers?
``Anything that keeps good support people on the phone with me is a
good idea,'' Ms. Kaplan said.

   LONDON _ For more than a year, lawyers at the prestigious London
firm of Mischcon de Reya have been receiving poems mingled among
their e-mails about boosting billable hours and other office
tedium.
</P>
<P>
   Far from flirtations, these verses are part of the job, weekly
readings selected by the firm's resident poet, Lavinia Greenlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw, who also penned a haiku for corporate Christmas cards,
selects poems to inspire, provoke or to just make the lawyers
think. ``Throughout the day they would write back with their
suggestions or their own poems,'' she said. ``Sometimes they were
baffled or amused, or simply didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least they were touched by poetry, which is the point of
the year-old ``Poetry Places'' project, funded by a $750,000 grant
from the National Lottery. The program is run by the national
Poetry Society, which intends to place 100 poets in schools,
businesses and other environments throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting in that it makes people think about their lives,
to think creatively and about the importance of words and poetry,''
said Christina Patterson, who manages the program for the Poetry
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Poets have been assigned to the BBC, the huge department store
chain Marks &AMP; Spencer, the London Zoo, the Botanical Gardens at Kew
and the Barnsley soccer club. The program also has dispatched poets
to inspire and be inspired by such disparate endeavors as garbage
collection -- verses are planned for trash bags -- and
fish-and-chips shops. The society also is considering placing a
poet on a natural gas platform in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   What the poets actually do at their workplaces varies. ``In most
places there would be some general meeting with staff, or a maybe
they'd go have a drink and talk about poetry,'' Patterson said.
``We want to get them to think about writing poetry, and in some
places there might be workshops with the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   John Agard, the resident poet at the BBC, holds workshops and is
pushing for poetry spots in programming. ``Poetry is often
presented in the media as something very precious,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``But there's no reason why, if there's a program
on gardening or cooking, you can't have a poem on gardening or
cooking. Poetry can be presented in a much more vibrant way.''
</P>
<P>
   Agard believes the importance of poetry in ordinary life is
underestimated. ``People say they don't read poetry but they seek
out their favorite poems for weddings and funerals. So much of our
lives are marked out with linear maps -- poetry gives another
map.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Heloise Paull, spokeswoman for the law firm Mischcon -- with 32
partners, a staff of more than 200 and counts among its clients the
Princess Diana Memorial Fund -- considers having a resident poet an
employment benefit that enhances the firm's morale and culture.
``We really benefited enormously by it,'' Paull said. ``Lots of
staff have written poems who would never have thought about it
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows of lawyers who would spend their mornings languishing
in the dry precision of legalese and then emerge from lunchtime
poetry sessions revitalized from contemplating the mysteries of
verse.
</P>
<P>
   The poets also are rewarded, said Tobias Hill, the resident poet
at the London Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry can be lonely business if you're just sitting around
writing by yourself everyday,'' Hill said. ``This gets me out
meeting people. It's a gift in terms of material.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is fascinated by what he calls ``the dark side of zoos.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the zoo's staff, Hill tries to reach the people
who come to see the animals, particularly children, with readings
and a poetry contest. He has created a poetry trail, displaying
verses to match the animals. D.H. Lawrence's ``Snakes'' is at the
reptile house.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to Hill and other poets are the stipends
-- up to $16,000 a year -- which help them focus more on their art
rather than the other occupations -- such as journalism -- they
pursue to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows me to buy time as a poet,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional poem follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sample from Peter Street, the fish-and-chips resident
poet:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mates''
</P>
<P>
   Last night's newsprint, tasting of chips wet, tanner a bag
</P>
<P>
   Folded artistically, to stop all that pea juice, dripping onto
best
</P>
<P>
   hand-me-downs.
</P>
<P>
   Walking home after last bus with mates you confess everything to
good
</P>
<P>
   friends, together
</P>
<P>
   in a meeting place, smelling of fish and chips.

 &HT;    CHINESE LEADERS IRRITATED AT CLINTON OVER TIBET, TAIWAN
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese leaders are irritated at President Bill
Clinton, who no longer looks the wise and benevolent partner they
thought he was this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing fierce verbiage, these officials are expressing
``strong displeasure'' over President Clinton's decision to
dispatch U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson this week to Taiwan.
And on the resurgent issue of Tibet, the Chinese are sounding just
as hurt and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton may get a chance to hear some of the Chinese
criticism first-hand. He plans to meet for an hour with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, in a mini-summit during a break in the
meetings of 21 world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tibet, the Chinese are voicing frustration that Clinton met
the Dalai Lama at the White House for 30 minutes Tuesday,
disregarding China's loud objections that Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader is ``playing tricks'' to win Tibetan independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama has for a long time engaged in activities to
split the motherland and preached independence for Tibet,'' foreign
ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, he has not repented,'' Zhu said. ``We ask U.S.
leaders not to meet the Dalai Lama to avoid harming China-U.S.
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Taiwan, Chinese statements reflect a bitterness that Clinton
seemingly let them down by allowing continued official American
contacts with Taiwan, even after his June 30 pledge in Shanghai not
to support Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. side ... has seriously violated the principles in the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the United States commitment
not to have official contacts with Taiwan,'' Zhu said, citing a
quarter-century of American statements dating back to the Nixon
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, Clinton's former U.N. ambassador and diplomatic
troubleshooter, addressed a business meeting in Taiwan and then met
with Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui. Using Richardson's presence
to make his case that Taiwan is an established fact, the Taiwanese
leader said Taiwan's government ``not only exists, but also
strenuously upholds democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   China responded Wednesday by escalating criticism to a higher
echelon of power.
</P>
<P>
   The official Xinhua news agency quoted a top Chinese military
commander as expressing ``serious concern'' over the Taiwan and
Tibet developments.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should ``strictly abide'' by commitments to avoid all
official contacts with Taiwan, Gen. Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
the powerful Central Military Commission, said after a meeting with
the visiting American Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Joseph Prueher.
</P>
<P>
   China's recent words reflect a remarkable change in tone,
compared to the warm glow that suffused most Beijing rhetoric about
the United States for the first three months after Clinton's June
23-July 3 state visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise and practical move,'' said the Chinese foreign ministry
in July, after Clinton signed a trade measure. And in September,
when Clinton faced possible impeachment, China declared that the
president's ``difficulties'' would not affect American-Chinese
ties, which had reached ``a new stage of development'' thanks in
part to Clinton's ``active contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six weeks, China's rhetoric has perceptibly
cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Trade Criticism Unfair,'' headlined an editorial in the
official China Daily on Sept. 30, after U.S. officials warned about
China's estimated $60 billion-a-year trade surplus with America.
Two weeks later, China accused the U.S. House of Representatives of
``a rude infringement of China's sovereignty'' for supporting
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   China has so far refrained from using the heaviest bludgeons in
its diplomatic vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, China did not say it ``strongly demands''
compliance with its wishes, as it did this summer when it sought to
dislodge its smaller neighbor Vietnam from a disputed reef in the
South China Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ After decades of barely scraping by,
Lionel Benjamin is now on a fanatical quest to make his life
better.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher has called on friends, neighbors, and anyone else he
can think of, goading them to attend a motivational seminar at the
dilapidated Rex Theater.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them come.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the gathering attracts an overflow crowd of 300 people,
who are all waiting to hear a speaker's roaring discourse on how to
make dreams a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin is just a small part of one of the most peculiar
expansions in business today -- the expansion into Haiti of Amway
Corp., the giant, Michigan-based direct seller of vitamins,
shampoo, toilet paper, and a smorgasbord of household products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My salary as a teacher just wasn't sufficient to support my
family,'' said Benjamin, wearing a flashy, well-tailored suit.
``Now I'm in a business that's booming, a business that I truly
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's been urging people to attend Amway's monthly meetings
for about three years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country
doesn't deter his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Haiti's 8 million people earn less than $250 a year
while living in grass huts with no access to safe water or adequate
sanitation. With an economy in shambles, Haiti also suffers from an
unemployment rate of more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than 2,300 people here are pushing Amway, successfully
marketing a wide range of products. These products include
everything from toothpaste, sold for $4.68, to a 20-piece set of
cookware, sold for $941.
</P>
<P>
   Even company officials acknowledge that, at first, Amway and
Haiti may seem like an odd mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered how this could work in Haiti . . . but I've been
very impressed with the people there,'' said Kelly Savage, director
of Amway North America Administration. ``We are attracting middle-
and upper-class people there (as distributors) who have worked hard
and have a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that Haitians, in general, are keenly interested
in nutrition so that vitamins and nutritional supplements have
become big hits, as have diapers, cosmetics, and skin-care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Amway is performing so well that the company launched its 49th
affiliate here in September -- Amway Haiti Limited.
</P>
<P>
   And Amway just finished work on a new service center, which sits
behind concrete walls across from a cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre sight, this modern investment by a
multibillion-dollar operation that is passed daily by scores of
poor peasants gracefully balancing huge baskets of rice, beans, and
various other foods on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the new center enables Haiti's growing number of
distributors to place orders one day and pick them up the next,
whereas before they might have had to wait months for orders to be
imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Amway was founded in 1959, and is supported by more than 450
personal care, household and other items. Today, the company has
more than 3 million distributors who peddle products in 80
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1998, Amway's worldwide sales totaled $5.7
billion, a drop from $7 billion the year before. The decline is
blamed on economic problems in Asia, where sales suffered a decline
of 18 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Amway products have been marketed in Haiti for nearly 20 years,
with the number of distributors continuing to climb steadily.
</P>
<P>
   The company's success in Haiti is not really that surprising.
Amway champions the dual themes of Christian morality and free
enterprise, both of which appeal to a conservative population fond
of the American lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the enticing incentive program doesn't hurt. The
company rewards its distributors -- or ``ambassadors'' in
Amway-speak -- with a portion of the sales that are generated by
those they've recruited, or sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent motivational meeting, a young, well-dressed man
named Al Colas took the stage like a flamboyant televangelist.
</P>
<P>
   As Amway's top distributor in Haiti, Colas even enjoys a
regal-sounding title: Diamond Haiti Distributor.
</P>
<P>
   He presented the Amway program as he might a passion for
religion -- whooping, stomping, hollering, and flapping his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of prospective clients loved it, wildly applauding any
shot they might have at becoming rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amway allows us to take responsibility for ourselves, to be
our own bosses,'' said Freddie Clermont, who has distributed Amway
here for nearly two years. ``I know that the products cost a lot,
but they truly are excellent products.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the shampoo, which costs more than $6 -- or more
than a week's salary for many Haitians -- might last three times
longer than local brands.
</P>
<P>
   She added that two of the most popular Amway products in Haiti
are soap and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Knowles, president of the Haitian-American Chamber of
Commerce here, said Amway products have become status symbols in
Haiti, the same way Tupperware products are throughout much of
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very poor country, but we do have a tiny, tiny
minority of people who have a lot of money, and they want to spend
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Amway has been criticized in books and
articles for offering over-priced products and making promises it
can't keep.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't dampened the enthusiasm of Haitian entrepreneurs
like Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do Amway because I have lots of love in my heart and I
really want people to be happy,'' he said earnestly. ``The cookware
set, for example, comes with a lifetime guarantee, and you can't
beat that.''

 &HT;    DEBATE GEARS UP ON PRIVATE ACCOUNTS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a bumpy ride in the stock markets and an
election shake-up in Congress, both political parties are keeping
the door open to setting up personal investment accounts in the
Social Security overhaul expected for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to look at it,'' House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., said this week on CNBC's ``Hardball.'' House
Budget Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, restated his support for
putting a portion of workers' Social Security taxes in individual
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has urged that his
party make its first goal next year to use the federal budget
surplus to begin ``creating a personal Social Security savings
account'' for every worker who pays into the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``great historic opportunity,'' Gingrich told
members of his party in his valedictory address Monday that such a
plan would ``save Social Security'' for current retirees, improve
it for the baby boom generation and guarantee retirement benefits
for their children in an account that ``no Washington politician
can touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts are sharply divided on whether such a plan would work,
and the debate is only beginning in Washington, where the House
Ways and Means will hold a hearing on Nov. 19 on reforming Social
Security. President Clinton has called a White House conference on
the subject for Dec. 8-9.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have objected to privatization, and their success
in turning out votes for Democratic candidates for the Nov. 3
elections could give them more say.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, a longtime ally of labor, set strict limits for
considering individual accounts. He said the investments must be
directed by the Social Security's trustees or else reduced to three
safe options, much as the federal government oversees similar
accounts for its employees.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate gears up, extremes on both sides are offering
contradictory views, beginning with whether the program even needs
to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weisbrot, of the liberal research group Preamble Center for
Public Policy, is preparing a book for early next year accusing
politicians of building up a ``phony crisis'' in Social Security so
they can ``save'' it. Weisbrot has written in opinion columns that
the system is fundamentally sound for 75 years. He traces the talk
of privatization to Wall Street financial firms that hope to reap
profits from the expanded market.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the libertarian Cato Institute is mounting a public
education campaign arguing that privatizing Social Security is a
``win-win'' proposal that would save money, make retirement
benefits more secure, and help blunt the antagonisms between
generations.

THE PRACTICE OF READING
</HEADLINE>
  By Denis Donoghue 
 307 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $30 
 ------ 
 ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE 
 By PETER BROOKS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the more polemical moments of ``The Practice of
Reading,'' Denis Donoghue proposes that we should teach English
language and literature as if they were a foreign tongue and a
foreign literature. Our problems, he says, arise from the
assumption that our students know the language and are qualified to
undertake a study of the literature, and ``if we taught English as
a second language and a second literature, we would become more
responsive to the mediating character of the literary language, the
opacity of language as such: we would not assume that the language
is transparent to our interests.'' This may be implausible as a
practical proposal of reform, but it effectively highlights
Donoghue's overriding concern in his new book: that the arduous and
exciting business of close attention to the language of literature
may be suffering from perilous neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue has for many years been worrying about how we read --
and how we should read. As a leading ``practical critic'' -- to use
I. A. Richards's term -- with a broad and deep literary culture,
Donoghue has always been ready to skewer theories that he thinks
stand between the reader and a direct experience of texts. His
allegiances lie most of all with the tradition of the New Critics
and other ``close readers,'' from T. S. Eliot and Richards through
William Empson, F. R. Leavis, R. P. Blackmur, Kenneth Burke. But
whereas in earlier books, for instance ``Ferocious Alphabets''
(1981), his critique was directed toward post-structuralists like
Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man, now what he calls
``ideologically opportunistic'' criticism draws his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue is right (and hardly alone) in detecting an ideological
and political turn in criticism, part of the movement often
referred to as cultural studies, which (under the general influence
of Michel Foucault, among others) tends to see literature as just
one among many discourses reflective of dominant ideological
practices and to study it as a cultural artifact without any
special claim to independent status or superior insight. He is
right, too, in his claim that most critics of this persuasion don't
read with the patient attention to language characteristic of the
New Critics: ``Their metier is not verbal analysis but the
deployment of themes, arguments and morally charged conclusions. .
. . They take language for granted as providing direct access to
reality and fantasy.'' In one of his liveliest chapters, Donoghue
takes on recent commentaries on ``Macbeth'' that, he says, ``issue
not in analyses of the language of the play but in an invidious
account of the ideology that the play allegedly sustains: for that
purpose, a reading of the play in the detail of its language is
thought to be a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting result of Donoghue's warfare on this new front is
a newly relaxed attitude toward the deconstructive readings of
Derrida and de Man, who in fact gave very close attention to texts,
though with austere and unsettling results. De Man, after all,
proposed a ``return to philology'' as ``an examination of the
structure of language prior to the meaning it produced.'' It's not
theory Donoghue is hostile to, he has asserted -- in fact, we don't
have enough good theory in literary study -- but ``the prosecution
of principles and ideologies under the pseudonym of theory.''
Indeed, literary study at present is sometimes held to be
post-theoretical, and that has often meant the neglect of poetics
-- the study of the conditions of meaning of texts -- as well as
scrupulous reading, in favor of a search for sociopolitical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Donoghue generally aligns himself with formalism, as the
attention to the shape and texture of literary works, his larger
ambition is the rehabilitation of the esthetic, particularly as it
was formulated two centuries ago by Schiller. The esthetic to
Schiller is not marginal or decorative, it is central to human
experience: the realm of human freedom, of the Spieltrieb -- the
human capacity for play -- for reformulating the givens of reality.
The word Donoghue keeps coming back to, here and elsewhere, is
``imagination'': the capacity of the mind to encompass other forms
of life, a fictional sphere where, in the line of one of his
favorite poets, Wallace Stevens, ``the world imagined is the
ultimate good.'' He also likes the word ``Romanticism,'' not as set
in sterile opposition to Classicism but as a ``permanent category''
of human aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These are crucial and complex issues. The problem is that ``The
Practice of Reading'' doesn't provide much scope for their full
development. A series of eight mainly short occasional essays on
critics and practices of reading, followed by seven readings of
individual texts, the book never provides an extended argument on
any one topic. The problem isn't made any easier by the fact that
the book refuses to tell us what the occasion for most of the
essays originally was (most were journal pieces or lectures), which
makes some of them float a bit weightlessly. Donoghue's arguments
are often given in a kind of shorthand, leaving this reader, at
least, largely unsatisfied. When, for instance, he takes on de
Man's interpretation of Wordsworth's famous, and famously
problematic, ``Boy of Winander,'' he concludes by calling it
``formidable but perverse,'' and simply asserts to the contrary,
``I have to remind myself that Wordsworth . . . wrote some of the
most moving poems in the language.'' To be sure, but this is not an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue's magisterial tone and his readiness to pass trenchant
judgment can be bracing, but they can also confuse and even
trivialize important issues now much debated. Nor are definition
and clarity advanced by his tendency to refer in a litany to
critics he likes -- Leavis, Empson, Blackmur, Burke especially --
while taking unexplained swipes at those he doesn't, sometimes, one
feels, without much sense of what they are really saying. The
result is a book that is somehow less than the sum of its parts.
Donoghue is a formidably gifted critic whose range of reference is
truly impressive and whose commitment to what he calls (he is
paraphrasing Blackmur on Stevens) ``the superior impersonal reality
of words'' is profound and, in the current context, salutary. But
his book never really gets to the business of telling us how and
why the practices of reading he approves are the right and powerful
ones.

   When Jackie Mullins suggested to her husband, Houston, that they
celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary in East St. Louis, Ill.,
a largely black city known for its social problems, he didn't think
there would be much worth seeing there. Gradually, she persuaded
him, and the couple came up from Memphis and signed in at the
Parker Garden Bed and Breakfast, a 1912 Tudor-style home owned by
Herrett and John Parker.
</P>
<P>
   There the Mullinses ate homemade honey-nut wheat bread and
omelets for breakfast, and relaxed in a whirlpool bath. Parker, a
game enthusiast, taught them how to play mancala, an ancient
African board game somewhat like Chinese checkers. And they got the
real flavor of St. Louis from their hosts, who drove the couple
past blues clubs; the TWA Dome, where the football Rams play; Busch
Memorial Stadium, home to Mark McGwire; the St. Louis Black History
Museum and the Black Repertory Theater, and the flamboyantly
colored pink and lime-green historic houses of Lafayette Square,
with their turn-of-the-century French styling.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Mullins said, her husband just went along because
she had planned the trip, but he fell in love with their hosts.
``He really liked the way they treated us,'' she said. ``He has
been telling everybody about Parker Garden and East St. Louis _ his
co-workers, everybody. He won't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker Garden, barely a year old, is one of a growing number of
bed-and-breakfasts owned by African-Americans, many in inner-city
neighborhoods. The success of the B&AMP;Bs, often in the face of
skeptical neighbors and associates, surprises many people, who
expect such areas to be overwhelmed by poverty and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is changing the way people look at our communities,''
said Monique Greenwood, who, with her husband, Glenn Pogue, operate
Akwaaba Mansion in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
``People are saying, `This is what this neighborhood is really
about.' It is like an awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two years, 11 inns owned by African-Americans
have opened, bringing the national total to 30, according to the
African American Association of Innkeepers International, a group
formed to increase public awareness of black-owned inns and to help
aspiring innkeepers get started. A decade ago, there were fewer
than 10 inns owned by African-Americans, out of an estimated 30,000
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the new B&AMP;Bs are in inner cities; some have sprung up in
less urban destinations, like in Canoncito, N.M., and on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. On the Vineyard, Doris Clark, owner of the Twin
Oaks Inn, is known for her homemade granola, which she says she
sent to President Clinton during his August stay on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark, who is the president of the African American
Association of Innkeepers International, said that the practice of
charging room rates for guests in one's home and serving them
breakfast was popular in the African-American community long before
the current trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Barbara Mandrell song, `She was country when
country wasn't cool'; we were innkeepers when being innkeepers
wasn't cool,'' Ms. Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks couldn't stay in hotels, so they had to stay in other
black people's homes whenever they traveled,'' she continued,
recalling stories her grandparents told of their travels from
Boston to Savannah. ``In black neighborhoods, there was always at
least one house that rented out rooms, because they knew of the
need. After you stayed in someone's house, they would pack food for
you when you were leaving for the next part of the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Adams, chairman of the department of Afro-American
studies at Howard University, remembers traveling from Baltimore
along U.S. 1 to visit his grandparents in Quitman, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nowhere we could stay between Baltimore and Georgia,
so we stayed at the homes of African-Americans _ they were called
tourist homes,'' he recalled. If travelers didn't know where to
find these places, Adams said, they went to black barbershops,
where they knew everything going on in the black community. ``If
you couldn't find a black barbershop, you just had to sleep in the
car, which is what we did a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Black travelers could also consult ``The Colored-American Travel
Guide,'' which was published in African-American newspapers and
listed ``accommodations for the colored traveler.'' A 1954 guide
informed travelers that in Mobile, Ala., they could choose from
Ezell's Rooming House, Mrs. W.S. Gallery's tourist home or the
black YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   When Adams was a student at Morehouse College in the 1950s, he
once stayed with a prominent doctor in Houston. He recalled: ``On
his mantel were autographed pictures of people like Marian
Anderson, educator Mary McLeod Bethune, Lester Granger _ then head
of the National Urban League _ and Walter White _ then head of the
NAACP. When I asked him how he had met all of these people, he
said, `They can't stay in any of the hotels when they visit, they
have to stay with me. So I just charge them an autographed
picture.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark's roots on the Vineyard go back to her great-uncle, a
Jamaican immigrant who in 1900 founded the Bradley Memorial Church
in Oak Bluffs. Ms. Clark worked 26 years as a stewardess for United
Airlines before opening her B&AMP;B in 1991, with tips from the
International Association of Innkeepers and the book ``So You Want
to Be an Innkeeper'' (Chronicle Books). After she married Jay
Clark, he built a gazebo and deck onto the house.
</P>
<P>
   Gigi Langston, a court clerk in Essex County, N.J., stayed at
Twin Oaks in October. ``That was my first time to Martha's
Vineyard, and I'm planning a trip back to stay with Doris again,''
Ms. Langston said. ``It was like going to visit a relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pioneering owners of black B&AMP;Bs say they faced
skepticism. When Jessie Smallwood opened LaMaison B&AMP;B 12 years ago
in the Lower Garden District of New Orleans, a longtime innkeeper
warned her that no one would go to her inn because ``it was in the
ghetto.'' Indignant, Ms. Smallwood sought out other
African-American owners to see if they were having such problems
and found only a handful. Now she is part of the African American
Association of Innkeepers International, which currently has 18
members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker encountered similar doubts. ``When people hear East
St. Louis, all they know about it is the typical things people say
about urban cities _ gangs and other things that they read in the
paper'' she said. ``Most of the people in this neighborhood are
hard-working, like us. Once the guests get here, they realize it's
just like any other city.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the B&AMP;Bs say their guests come from a variety of
backgrounds, and include many international travelers. Lester and
Francoise Roddy, owners of the Woods House Bed &AMP; Breakfast in
Ashland, Ore., get the greatest number of guests during the town's
annual Shakespeare Festival. Although they are satisfied with their
clientele, which is 99 percent white, they joined the
African-American association in hopes of also attracting
African-American customers.
</P>
<P>
   Theron and Ava Bowers, who own the Apache Canyon Ranch in
Canoncito, N.M., have seen their clientele change. ``In our first
year, in 1996, you could count the number of African-Americans
coming to the inn on one hand,'' Ms. Bowers said. ``Now 15 percent
of our clients are African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Helene and Kenneth Barnett opened their bed-and-breakfast in New
Orleans three years ago. In the 1980s, when Ms. Barnett was a
teen-ager, she loved to entertain her friends in the top-floor
apartment where her family lived. The structure was actually a
raised Acadian cottage, built in 1904. By 1992, it had been
abandoned and was covered in weeds that reached as high as the
crumbling terra-cotta roof. Trees and vines were growing through
the floorboards and windows, and vagrants had claimed the house to
store stolen goods. Her childhood retreat was an eyesore in a
neighborhood of Victorian-style homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett, who began her career in the hotel business in
Charlotte, N.C., first as a concierge, then as a sales manager for
Embassy Suites, dreamed of one day running a B&AMP;B with her husband,
an interior designer. But they lacked the resources to buy an inn.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett's mother, Helen Morgan, who owned a
financial-consulting firm, believed in the talents of the young
couple and provided the capital for them to buy and renovate what
is now the Lagniappe Guest House (from the Creole-French word
meaning an unexpected surprise). They got the house for only
$43,000, but renovations were so extensive _ $200,000 _ that it was
two years before they were able to actually move to New Orleans.
During Mardi Gras in February 1995, the couple quit their jobs and
opened the inn.
</P>
<P>
   Lagniappe House is located in the Garden District of the city,
near the French Quarter. The rooms, decorated by Barnett, include
the 1800s Room, with century-old antiques, including a high-backed
mahogany bed; the Garden Room, done with floral prints and withs a
six-foot-long clawfoot bathtub, and the Josephine Baker Room, which
has black-and-white portraits of Baker lining the walls, and opens
onto a private veranda where guests can take in the garden,
rosebushes and banana trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnetts and their daughter, Camille, 3, live on the top
floor _ in the same space where Ms. Barnett lived as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Ms. Greenwood said, people are still surprised to
come upon a B&AMP;B in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Yet the Akwaaba has
attracted guests from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing a documentary on the Akwaaba Mansion, Hisami, who
traveled alone from Osaka, Japan, stayed a week at the B&AMP;B. Ms.
Greenwood said that she made it clear to her that the mansion would
not be like a Manhattan hotel. Hisami said that a hotel in
Manhattan wasn't what she was looking for. She wrote in the
registry, ``I learned a lot from you, your family and your people.
I'll keep myself more interested in your culture. Please come to
Japan so that I can show you my country and people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, Ms. Clark's register lists guests from
France, Switzerland, Australia and Ireland. Tom and Pat Doyle from
Waterford, Ireland, wrote in Gaelic, ``Slainte Go Deo,'' which
means, ``Good health to you forever,'' before they finished in
English: ``Visiting your home was like visiting old friends, your
warm friendly welcome leads us to believe that you must have Irish
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marita Golden, a highly acclaimed essayist and novelist
from Washington went on book tours, she never expected her name to
be known in the hotels where she stayed. She was surprised, then,
when a member of her church told her that she had seen one of Ms.
Golden's books in the library of the Akwaaba Mansion. The author
booked a weekend there, and she loved the place so much she came
back again last month to hold a book-signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African-American, it was uplifting and inspiring to see
what she and her husband had done with the place,'' said Ms.
Golden, who is also the director of creative writing at Virginia
Commonwealth University. ``They are strong role models for people
who want to do creative things in terms of revitalizing our
communities. And she is a wonderful hostess _ she makes you feel
like you're at your grandmother's house.''

TURNING JAPANESE
</HEADLINE>
  By David Galef 
 Permanent Press, paper, $16  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his second novel, TURNING JAPANESE (Permanent Press, paper,
$16), David Galef captures the allure and peril of living as an
expatriate. And through the eyes of his young narrator, a
22-year-old aspiring writer named Cricket Collins, we see the
experience not just for Cricket and his fellow Americans but also
for those Britons and Australians who join them as English teachers
in Japan, flocking to the Orient in search of an alternative to the
traditional European adventure. It is the late 1970's, when life in
Japan is particularly enticing to an aimless recent college
graduate, and Cricket and his peers find the elegant beauty of the
tea ceremony, the calming discipline of Aikido and the politeness
of the Japanese people to be both alien and irresistible. But Galef
adds a layer of complexity to this account of Cricket's adventures,
revealing the vulnerability that may result from too rapid an
effort to shed one's own cultural skin. When Cricket hooks up with
a Japanese girlfriend, he hopes their relationship will increase
his sense of well-being, making him feel more firmly established in
her country. Not surprisingly, and much to his chagrin, his
contentment is brief -- and is followed by a breakdown that leaves
him weakened and shamed. In the months that follow, as Cricket must
choose between returning to a homeland where he no longer truly
feels at home and remaining in a place where he may never be truly
accepted, Galef produces a chilling denouement for this nicely
detailed exploration of cultural dislocation. _ PAULA FRIEDMAN

   &UR; JOSANIE'S WAR &QL; 
 &UR; By Karl H. Schlesier &QL; 
 &UR; University of Oklahoma, $22.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late spring of 1885, five bands of Chiricahua Apaches
decided to flee their reservation in Arizona, setting off the last
great Apache war. This novel follows the fortunes of one of these
groups, led by an Indian war captain named Josanie, as it struggles
against the combined military might of the United States and
Mexico. Brief alternating chapters present the action from both
sides, including incendiary news clippings, thus providing the
social context in which the tribe embarks on one last fight for its
land. But the anthropological detail by which Karl H. Schlesier
illustrates the Apaches' resourcefulness, spirituality and humanity
gets in the way of his storytelling. With little character
development, the individuals in his pages wind up being largely
indistinguishable; what's missing is fiction's imaginative leap
into feeling. ``Josanie's War'' is a readable and informative
re-creation of a tragic episode in the history of the American
West. Through its detailed documentation, it takes us into a harsh
world, showing how injustice and prejudice proved despicably,
needlessly destructive. But as a novel, it fails to explore the
internal war that must have gripped these warriors just as
fiercely. _ PETER BRICKLEBANK

   &UR; SAVAGE LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; By James Rogers &QL; 
 &UR; Serpent's Tail, paper, $12.99 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set in London as the grasping '80s give way to the uncertain
'90s, bursting with foul language and fouler deeds, ``Savage Life''
follows the violent misadventures of Gaz Hoskins, an aspiring
burglar from the lower classes, and Colin Nutter, a rudderless life
insurance salesman with a tenuous grip on yuppiedom. What connects
these two sorry souls is the vile personage of Dorian Savage.
Misanthropic, immoral and rich, he's Colin's boss and personal
hero. Somehow, the hapless Gaz becomes convinced that Dorian is his
long-lost father and begins a plaintive quest for recognition that
sets in motion a train wreck of events. Three murders (and one
attempted murder) ensue, and no one comes to a good end by the
close of this aptly titled work. Full of vivid writing, the novel
brings to mind some of Martin Amis's dark comedies. Like Amis,
James Rogers has a talent for measuring the class divide and
bringing odious characters to life. Unfortunately, he skimps when
it comes to the central character of Colin, whose past history is
perfunctorily disgorged late in the novel. The book's weakest link,
Colin seems merely an alcohol-soaked nincompoop -- or is he
something more? If you're curious, ``Savage Life'' will keep you
reading to the bitter -- and I do mean bitter -- end. _ EILS LOTOZO

   &UR; FLORA'S SUITCASE &QL; 
 &UR; By Dalia Rabinovich &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Flamingo, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dalia Rabinovich's first novel tells the story of Flora and Dave
Grossenberg, a young Jewish couple who leave America for Colombia
in the 1930's, intent on starting a business with his extended
family. Told primarily from Flora's point of view, the novel traces
the couple's arduous journey and their trials and tribulations in
Medellin. Unfortunately, this basic plot is marred by bizarre
twists that are introduced with great fanfare only to vanish almost
immediately. Worse yet, Rabinovich plunges headlong into her own
brand of magic realism, in which physical characteristics are
erased by acts of nature and people can sleep for 10 days and
awaken with no memory of their previous lives or language. Despite
the exotic surroundings in which their story unfolds, the
characters in ``Flora's Suitcase'' have interior lives that remain,
for the most part, featureless and colorless, unknown to the
reader. _ BETSY GROBAN

   &UR; NO SAFE PLACE &QL; 
 &UR; By Richard North Patterson &QL; 
 &UR; Knopf, $25.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable coincidence of bad luck for Bill Clinton and good
luck for Richard North Patterson has conferred topicality upon ``No
Safe Place,'' Patterson's torrid, breathlessly plotted novel about
a sexually compromised Presidential candidate and the female
journalist he loves. Kerry Kilcannon has risen from the boxing gyms
of Newark to the United States Senate. Though his older brother,
James, was killed while campaigning for the presidency, Kerry still
wants to pry the Democratic nomination away from the vapid Vice
President, Dick Mason. Unfortunately, Kilcannon harbors a secret --
a passionate affair with a reporter named Lara Costello that may
have resulted in an abortion. Patterson's vastly contrived plot
puts Lara into the press corps on the Kilcannon campaign, while
Sean Burke, a fanatical anti-abortion crusader, decides that
Kilcannon should die for his abortion rights views. Cutting rapidly
between Burke's determined stalking and the machinations of a
loathsome reporter who's out to reveal Kerry and Lara's liaison,
Patterson offers mawkish, rites-of-passage flashbacks, treating the
practice of politics as he does the law in his popular legal
thrillers. There, as lonely, well-intentioned professionals get
their fill of sex, sensationalism and scheming villains, love
conquers what it must and heroes always do the right thing. _ BILL

   &UR; A LIFE FOR A LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; By Ernest Hill &QL; 
 &UR; Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Earl visits a 15-year-old boy named D'Ray in his
prison cell, he whispers ``in a voice laced with a bone-chilling
calmness: 'Everything you took from me, you gonna give it back.'''
Despite this seeming threat, Ernest Hill's second novel, ``A Life
for a Life,'' isn't about revenge. Not much earlier, D'Ray had been
given another ultimatum by a ruthless dope dealer who was holding
D'Ray's 10-year-old brother, Little Man, hostage for $100 the older
boy owed him: ``You ain't back with my money in a hour, you can
tell your mama she got one less mouth to feed.'' Desperate, D'Ray
decided to rob a convenience store and in the process fatally shot
the store's young clerk. The murder confirmed what his mother and
the people around him always expected: ``It's just a matter of time
before he end up like World'' -- his father, a convicted murderer.
But Henry Earl, the dead clerk's father, has an agenda. Earl's son,
Stanley, was an honor student who won a National Merit Scholarship;
somehow, D'Ray will be made to fulfill some of that promise. And
so, through the years of D'Ray's incarceration, Henry Earl
faithfully visits him, hoping to inspire him to move forward. Hill
is a skilled storyteller, and though ``A Life for a Life'' is a
straightforward account of the conflicting forces that shape the
lives of young men like D'Ray, he keeps the reader in suspense.
Despite Henry Earl's iron determination, D'Ray's redemption is far
from a foregone conclusion. _ FRAN HANDMAN

 THE DJINN IN THE NIGHTINGALE'S EYE 
 Five Fairy Stories 
 By A. S. Byatt 
 Vintage International, $12  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These fairy tales may be full of magic and quests, but they're
also spun from contemporary cloth as they explore the lives of
characters who feel imprisoned by their prescribed fate. ``Byatt is
a storyteller who could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for
a thousand and one nights,'' Nancy Willard wrote here in 1997.

   &UR; HUNTING MISTER HEARTBREAK &QL; 
 &UR; A Discovery of America &QL; 
 &UR; By Jonathan Raban &QL; 
 &UR; Vintage Departures, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This English author displays a quirky eye and restless energy in
his account of a two-year odyssey to American locales as varied as
Alabama, Seattle and New York, where he indulges in a full-scale
cultural deconstruction of Macy's department store. ``In an era of
jet tourism, he remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of .
. . Robert Louis Stevenson,'' Justin Kaplan wrote in these pages in
1991. ``He has a gift for vivid observation, description, anecdote
and personal encounter.'' Soft City (Harvill, $12), an earlier book
by Raban that has just been restored to print, is both a sharp
portrait of London and its comfortable middle-class young in the
1970's and a spirited defense of urban life. '' 'Soft City' shows
how, in the midst of physical decay, a city can flourish by
fulfilling an elemental human need, the need to play out fantasies
of self,'' Richard Sennett said here in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ILIAD &QL; 
 &UR; By Homer &QL; 
 &UR; Translated by Robert Fagles &QL; 
 &UR; Penguin, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This translation of Homer's tale of the Trojan War is marked by
free, cadenced lines and simple, direct language that resembles
real speech. ``His narrative has real pace, it presses onward,
leading the reader forward with an irresistible flow,'' Oliver
Taplin wrote here of Fagles in 1990. ``His version is imbued with
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPEACHMENT: A HANDBOOK &QL; 
 &UR; By Charles L. Black Jr. &QL; 
 &UR; Yale University, $6.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a guide written during the Watergate era but reissued in the
shadow of the Clinton impeachment investigation, a constitutional
scholar stresses the need for caution and common sense as he
outlines the process for removing a President from office. In 1974
our reviewer, Mary Ellen Gale, called this an ``elegantly written,
lucid, intelligent and comprehensive handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPRINGS OF AFFECTION &QL; 
 &UR; Stories of Dublin &QL; 
 &UR; By Maeve Brennan &QL; 
 &UR; Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These 21 tales by a former writer for The New Yorker who died in
1993 dwell on the small joys, hurts and unrealized dreams tucked
away in the red-brick houses of a single Dublin neighborhood.
``Brennan's book is full of small miracles presented in elegant but
simple prose,'' Jay Parini wrote in the Book Review last year. The
narrator of ``An Irish Eye,'' by John Hawkes (Penguin, $11.95), is
a 13-year-old orphan whose bizarre adventures include a romance
with an aging World War I veteran and enslavement by the mistress
of a manor house. In 1997 our reviewer, Liam Callanan, called this
novel ``an engaging blend of genres and literary traditions ...
that ultimately becomes a kind of post-modern picaresque.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY BROTHER &QL; 
 &UR; By Jamaica Kincaid &QL; 
 &UR; Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $10 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing her brother's life and his death from AIDS in
their native Antigua, Kincaid refuses to romanticize her story,
choosing instead to follow the circular flow of her memory to
portray death as it really is, not as we might prefer it to be. The
result is ``a sustained meditation on the grinding wheel of family,
with mother always at the hub; on the countries of our past, both
real and emotional, which we have fled and in which we have felt
like strangers,'' Anna Quindlen wrote here in 1997. In ``Daughter
of the Queen of Sheba,'' by Jacki Lyden (Penguin, $12.95), a
National Public Radio correspondent recalls growing up in the
Midwest as the daughter of a manic-depressive woman whose
delusional behavior was dazzlingly bold and exotic. Last year in
these pages, Caroline Knapp said Lyden succeeds in ``vividly
capturing both the horror of her mother's illness and the
seductive, transporting power of her insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrei Makine &QL; 
 &UR; Translated by Geoffrey Strachan &QL; 
 &UR; Scribner, $7.99 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This French novel by a Russian emigre tells of how a remarkable
woman with a dual allegiance to her French past and her Russian
destiny endows her grandson with a sensibility that enables him to
endure life in the Soviet Union. ``Makine employs a highly poetic
voice to blend memory and imagination,'' Victor Brombert wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLANET QUEST &QL; 
 &UR; The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems &QL; 
 &UR; By Ken Croswell &QL; 
 &UR; Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The history of extrasolar planetary astronomy is one of
frustration and false promises, but advances in the 1990's have
turned the field into an exciting growth industry. '' 'Planet
Quest' is of no practical use whatever ... but it is fascinating
and worthwhile nonetheless,'' John Durant wrote in these pages in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEAVE IT TO ME &QL; 
 &UR; By Bharati Mukherjee &QL; 
 &UR; Fawcett Columbine, $12.95  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heroine of this raucous road novel is a misfit adoptee who
sets off from Schenectady, N.Y., to California on a vengeful (and
ultimately lethal) quest for her true parents. She is ``a brilliant
creation -- hilarious, horribly knowing and even more horribly
oblivious,'' Lorna Sage wrote here last year.

SEASONS OF HER LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  A Biography of Madeleine Korbel Albright 
 By Ann Blackman 
 Illustrated. 398 pp. New York: A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $27 
 ------ 
 FREQUENT FLIER 
 By JACOB HEILBRUNN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foreign policy makers are unlikely celebrities. Henry Kissinger
was the first. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is another.
Though Albright has never claimed to be an intellectual
heavyweight, the similarities between her career and Kissinger's
are striking. Like Kissinger, she is a refugee from Nazism who used
an academic post as a launching pad to public acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Seasons of Her Life,'' Ann Blackman, a veteran reporter for
Time, provides a revealing portrait of Albright. Blackman, who
writes with economy and dispatch, has combed the archives and
conducted almost 200 interviews with Albright's friends and
associates, including President Clinton. Her spadework has paid
off. Albright emerges as someone who has again and again reinvented
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was decisively shaped by her father, Josef Korbel. Some
of Blackman's most original research centers on him. A Czechoslovak
diplomat, Korbel joined his country's government in exile in London
after the Nazi takeover. Blackman shows that while Korbel worked
briefly with the Communists following the war, he may have fudged
this fact after he defected to the United States. ``He sought to
bury any suggestion that he might have at one time believed that
Communists and democrats would work together in Czechoslovakia,''
Blackman writes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most far-reaching step Korbel and his wife, Anna,
took was to abandon their Jewish heritage. In 1997, when the story
of Albright's Jewish ancestry made headlines, she was forced to
confront her past. Albright does not seem to have been eager to do
so. The Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs, who broke the
story, told Blackman that Albright was reluctant to give him the
name of a surviving cousin living in Prague. According to Blackman,
``Albright appeared to be struggling to understand the motives of
her father. ... The careful cocoon he had woven ... had split
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, however, had already encountered some bumps in her
life. After graduating from Wellesley in 1959, she married the
newspaper scion Joseph Albright. In 1982, he asked her for a
divorce. Albright was stunned. She started anew teaching at
Georgetown University, where she dazzled students with her outgoing
personality and blunt speaking style. She also devoted much effort
to running a salon in her Georgetown home as the Democrats worked
to regain the White House. She took a decidedly dovish line in the
1980's that she jettisoned with the end of the cold war. After
working on several political campaigns, including Michael Dukakis's
ill-fated run for the Presidency, Albright was chosen by President
Clinton to become Ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Together with her savvy aide, James P. Rubin, currently her
press secretary, Albright worked tirelessly to promote herself in
the news media. (In her introduction, Blackman says Rubin implied
that Albright would cooperate with her in exchange for favorable
coverage in Time. Blackman refused.) With Warren Christopher as
Secretary of State and Anthony Lake as national security adviser,
Albright was the only member of the Administration who could
communicate effectively. In the mold of such previous United
Nations Ambassadors as Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane
Kirkpatrick, Albright won the spotlight as a doughty proponent of
American democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of women's groups and Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Albright was sworn in as Secretary of State in 1997. The going has
been rockier than at the United Nations. Albright's record as
Secretary of State is still inconclusive, and Blackman is, of
course, able to give it only abbreviated treatment. Nonetheless,
she has done a fine job of explaining Albright's astonishing
ascent.

THERE ONCE WAS A WORLD

  A Nine-Hundred-Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok 
 By Yaffa Eliach 
 Illustrated. 818 pp. Boston: Little, Brown &AMP; Company. $40; after
Dec. 31, $50 
 ------ 
 THOUSANDS OF ORDINARY LIVES 
 By STEPHEN J. DUBNERx 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the Holocaust had claimed its final victims, the
Jews of Eastern Europe who managed to survive began assembling
yizkor (memorial) books, designed to recall the vibrancy of the
Jewish life that had been destroyed and to chronicle the
destruction itself. They are bittersweet documents: pictures of
robust, smiling families juxtaposed with alphabetical lists of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The act of remembering has since become the most tortured, if
necessary, of Jewish pursuits. The torture lies in the delicate
balance of acknowledging the extraordinary horror of the killings
while mourning the victims, who until the Nazis came to power had
led ordinary lives. At the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
in Washington, there is but one major attempt to commemorate this
normal life: the Tower of Life, a three-story exhibit of 1,500
photographs from the shtetl of Eishyshok (the village called
Ejszyszki in Polish and Eisiskes in Lithuanian), in what is now
Lithuania. They were collected by Yaffa Eliach, an Eishyshok native
and Holocaust survivor who emigrated to Palestine with an aunt and
uncle in 1946. A member of President Carter's Holocaust Commission,
she is a professor in the Judaic studies department of Brooklyn
College.
</P>
<P>
   The Tower of Life, as it turns out, was but a shard of Eliach's
mission of remembrance, for she has now written ``There Once Was a
World,'' an exhaustive and kaleidoscopic history of a town whose
3,500 Jews were nearly all slaughtered either by the Germans, the
Lithuanians, the Poles, the Russians or some combination thereof.
It is Eliach's own yizkor book, undertaken with a personal ferocity
that often magnifies but sometimes impairs her aim.
</P>
<P>
   It would be churlish to voice anything other than admiration for
Eliach's determination to reclaim her shtetl. She spent 17 years on
the book, traveling to six continents while interviewing survivors,
refugees and emigres, gathering documents and photographs, often at
great personal expense. ``For one photograph of the market square
on market day,'' she writes, ``I paid with a color TV, a VCR, a
radio, four jogging suits and four pairs of Reebok sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Eliach lays out the deep history of Eishyshok, ``the
Eastern European Jewish equivalent of Podunk.'' The oldest Jewish
gravestones dated from 1097; over the centuries the Jews, who
became a majority, lived under any number of national governments,
some far more tolerant than others, and endured any number of
pogroms and anti-Semitic measures. ``The rest of this book,''
Eliach writes at the end of the first section, ``is an account of
life before death, of what was lost in the massacre of 1941.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated at a crossroads some 40 miles from Vilna, the town had
a thriving market and was known for its brand of sincere but
levelheaded piety. Eliach delineates the town's religious and
social hierarchies; she relates the custom called ``the delay of
the Torah reading,'' whereby a local Jew, perhaps distraught over
his inability to get a share of the kosher meat concession (the
politics in Eishyshok were very local), would disrupt synagogue
services until his grievance was aired. She painstakingly shows how
religion began to cede its pride of place: by the 1930's, a typical
young Eishyshkian would rather own an automobile than become a
Torah scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Eliach's book, containing hundreds of photographs and many
patches of oral history, is organized like a textbook (albeit a
beautiful one, in the Eastern European tradition), and it sometimes
reads like one. Chapters called ``Handicrafts'' and ``Holidays''
and even ``Zionism'' tend to veer toward the generic, which works
against the ultraspecific rendering that Eliach is attempting.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a greater conflict at work. As devoutly as Eliach
professes her desire to dwell on the life of the town, she is
plainly consumed by its death -- and justifiably so: more than 200
of her relatives died with it. Throughout the book, usually in the
photo captions, she tells us how each Jew would meet his end. These
terse forecasts inadvertently diminish the humanity of the eventual
victims by stressing their victimhood over their humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's final 100 pages, titled ``The Bitter End,'' Eliach
writes of the killings in gut-churning detail. The massacre took
place over two days in September 1941, when she was 4 years old.
Her father, Moshe Sonenson, was among the town's most powerful men.
Recognizing the Jews' doom, he buried his gold and went into hiding
with his wife, Zipporah, and children. They were among the few
families to escape, and would spend the rest of the war in
desperate straits. At one point, the Sonensons were hiding in a
hayloft with several other Jews when a pair of German soldiers
approached. Just then, the Sonenson baby began to whimper, and the
other Jews threw their coats over him, suffocating him. After
liberation, the family returned to Eishyshok, where, Eliach says,
Polish soldiers, intent on having a country free of Jews, murdered
Zipporah and a second baby son.
</P>
<P>
   Yaffa Eliach's portrayal of these events is heartbreaking and
gripping. It is also oddly distanced, for she chose to write in the
third person (``Yaffa watched in horror''). This mixture of emotion
and seemingly journalistic history is jarring, if understandable:
while the stated ambition of her book is to commemorate Eishyshok
before the horror, the facts of her own existence would not seem to
allow that.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, worth noting that the book's closing image, a
1983 photograph, is celebratory: Moshe Sonenson in Israel, dancing
at the wedding of his granddaughter, Yaffa Eliach's daughter.
Having lost faith in both God and man, he still endorsed his
daughter's audacious mission, so that ``at least the people, and
perhaps even God, will remember that there once was a world filled
with faith, Judaism and humanity.''

ARLENE SARDINE
</HEADLINE>
  Written and illustrated by Chris Raschka 
 Orchard, $15.95. (Ages 3 to 8)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the words ``easy-open book'' stamped in one corner and
``net wt. 12 oz.'' in another, the cover of ``Arlene Sardine'' is a
jaunty visual pun on a sardine can. The colors are a gorgeous swirl
of greens, pinks, yellows, reds and oranges. The first line of the
story, ``So you want to be a sardine,'' may initially strike the
reader as odd. But in this bright and cheery context, it seems
simply whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Raschka's cozy text -- ``I knew a little fish once who
wanted to be a sardine'' -- tells the story of Arlene, who was
``born in a fjord.'' ``She was a happy little brisling because she
had about ten hundred thousand friends.'' Raschka has painted a
school of them swimming along in sun-struck blue and yellow waters.
</P>
<P>
   Then Arlene swims ``into a big net, a purse net, a big purse
net.'' She ``swam around in the net for three days and three nights
and did not eat anything, so her stomach would be empty. There is a
word for this. The word is thronging.'' Another word is euphemism,
in this case for ``starving,'' but wait, the worst is yet to be:
``Here, on the deck of the fishing boat, Arlene died.''
</P>
<P>
   How many readers, of any age, will balk at the sudden transition
from Arlene-as-friend to Arlene-as-food? Death, of course, has an
established place in children's literature. Fairy tales do it
grimly; smart writers, like Judith Viorst in ``The Tenth Good Thing
About Barney,'' do it gently. Leo Lionni does it bravely. In his
classic ``Swimmy,'' a small fry's family is eaten by a big fish,
but Swimmy joins with new friends to frighten the predator away.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear, though, that ``Arlene Sardine'' is
intended to be about death. Raschka's prose is eerily detached:
``Delicately smoked was she.'' ``I'll bet Arlene felt well rested
on the conveyor belt.'' (Make that heavenly rested.) Arlene is
``closed up with no air inside, hermetically, and cooked in her
can.'' At its best, the text is a social studies lesson on sardine
processing, complete with new vocabulary. At its worst, it's a
twisted, prekindergarten version of Heaven's Gate, minus the comet.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Raschka is the author and illustrator of many wonderful
children's stories, such as ``Mysterious Thelonious,'' ``Can't
Sleep,'' ``The Blushful Hippopotamus'' and ``Yo! Yes!,'' a
Caldecott Honor Book. Unfortunately, with ``Arlene Sardine'' he has
missed his mark, whatever it may have been. _ MARGARET MOORMAN

   &UR; YOU CAN'T TAKE A BALLOON INTO THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM &QL; 
 &UR; By Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser. &QL; 
 &UR; Dial Books for Young Readers, $16.99. (Ages 5 to 9) &QL; 
 &UR; HOW TO TAKE YOUR GRANDMOTHER TO THE MUSEUM &QL; 
 &UR; By Lois Wyse and Molly Rose Goldman &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Marie-Louise Gay &QL; 
 &UR; American Museum of Natural History/City &AMP; Company/Workman, $12.95.
(Ages 5 to 9) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question I hope my 3-year-old granddaughter, Rebecca, will
ask is, Where's Grandpa? He is not to be sighted in either of these
colorful accounts of young cuties who go courting culture with
their grandmas: one at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one at the
American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   While the grandma and granddaughter of Jacqueline Preiss
Weitzman in ``You Can't Take a Balloon Into the Metropolitan
Museum'' are shown in Robin Preiss Glasser's illustrations bingeing
wordlessly on masterpieces, their yellow balloon floats
mischievously around Manhattan, inciting chaos and finding
improbable connections between city scenes and paintings. Isn't
that Central Park Lake George Washington is crossing?
</P>
<P>
   Over on the West Side, meantime, in ``How to Take Your
Grandmother to the Museum,'' 10-year-old Molly Rose Goldman,
narrator and know-it-all, is showing off her acquaintance with
civilization from the dinosaurs to the museum shop, where her
grandma (Lois Wyse in real life, as drawn by Marie-Louise Gay)
comes across with a snowflake obsidian for Molly's rock collection.
(Molly, who is given to making pronouncements like ``We have to
save our wildlife,'' even sounds like a museum-shop artifact.)
</P>
<P>
   Both couples are evidently in training for the ladies-who-lunch
crowd at watering spots with a cultural ambience. (See Mary
Cassatt's ``Lady at the Tea Table.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the true cultural message is one of female refinement and
male superfluity. Where are the old gents? Have they passed on,
leaving the widows comfortable enough to spring for museum
admission fees and tchotchkes from the shops? Or have the bounders
gone to greener pastures? (Catch that top-hatted coot exiting a
limousine at the Plaza with a bride; maybe she's his granddaughter,
but she could be the bounder's fourth wife, a third his age. Molly
would never approve.)
</P>
<P>
   Are the men of the family still working away, without time or
inclination or aptitude for bonding with grade-school girls? Or,
and here's my suspicion, are grandmas being invested with the role
of culture carrier while grandpas are consigned to a television
stupor watching a ball game?
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for Rebecca seems to be that you can't take grandpa
to cultural playgrounds. It's the women who bear the higher values
of the human race, or as Molly would surely declare, ``We have to
save the good, true and beautiful.'' When female writers and
illustrators decide to send grandma and granddaughter on a visit to
the Metropolitan Opera, count on a glimpse of grandpa snoozing
during the big aria. _ WALTER GOODMAN

<P>
   &UR; THE 20TH CENTURY CHILDREN'S BOOK TREASURY &QL; 
 &UR; Celebrated Picture Booksand Stories to Read Aloud &QL; 
 &UR; Selected by Janet Schulman &QL; 
 &UR; Knopf, $40. (All ages) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are 44 of the century's most cherished picture books and
stories, chosen by one of publishing's most esteemed editors. The
volume is handsome, the color reproductions sparkling and the
selections unimpeachable, with everything from classics like
``Goodnight Moon'' to contemporary gems like ``Good Night,
Gorilla.'' Everything is here -- except the magic.
</P>
<P>
   In producing this volume the publisher has overridden the
obvious -- that the power of a picture book arises from the play
between the pictures and the text, and that the pictures are as
important as the words. All but two of these stories contain the
complete texts, but in every single case, the art has been altered,
with changes ranging from reformatting pictures to leaving some out
altogether. This version of Robert McCloskey's ``Make Way for
Ducklings,'' for example, retains only a third of the pictures. All
the books have been redesigned, so that as many as five pages'
worth of pictures now fit on a single page. The greater the art,
the worse it fares. Maurice Sendak's ``Where the Wild Things Are''
is reproduced in two tiers (with some of the art, unfortunately,
disappearing when it crosses the binding from left page to right);
readers can see the ``place where the wild things are,'' but,
reminded so strongly of the confines of the page, they no longer
have the illusion of being able to enter that place. Sendak's work,
like that of the others here, becomes a story instead of a world.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the originals and these versions can be
subtle -- but then, so is the difference between good work and a
work of art. In ``Madeline,'' Ludwig Bemelmans used two
illustrations to show Miss Clavel, ``afraid of a disaster,''
rushing to the girls' dormitory in the middle of the night: ``Miss
Clavel ran fast'' (the nun swoops down a hall) ``and faster'' (the
nun advances farther down the same hall); the visual and verbal
rhythms accentuate each other. In one of the many alterations in
this ``Madeline,'' the whole sentence is paired with the second
picture. While this may seem a minor loss, such instances multiply,
and the reader's experience diminishes.

   This anthology is not without its place, but the true audience
for ``The 20th Century Children's Book Treasury'' is limited to
those who already know the works. To offer these half-strength

<P>
   Two new picture books with the same title, CAT UP A TREE, could
not be more different. The one by Ann Hassett, illustrated by John
Hassett, is funny and whimsical and engaging, while the one by Anne
Isaacs, illustrated by Stephen Mackey, is just pretentious. The
Hassetts' Nana Quimby, plump and bespectacled in sneakers, apron
and purple polka-dot house dress, is in the middle of baking
chocolate chip cookies when she sees a cat who needs help. Five,
then 10, then 15, on up to 40 cats end up in the tree outside Nana
Quimby's window. She calls the Fire Department: '' 'Sorry,' said
the firehouse, 'we do not catch cats up a tree anymore. Call back
if that cat starts playing with matches.' '' The police are
interested only if the cats rob a bank, and the pet store says,
``Call back if the cats wish to buy a dog.'' The zoo, the post
office, the library, City Hall, nobody wants to help, so Nana
Quimby throws the telephone out the window and into the tree, and
the cats walk across its wire and into her arms. When the town that
wouldn't help finds itself overrun with mice and calls her, they
find out just how much help they can expect in return: '' 'Sorry,'
said Nana Quimby, 'the cats do not catch mice anymore. Call back if
you wish to hear cats purr.' '' John Hassett paints a delightful
world with grape jelly-bean clouds and noodle cats with spaghetti
tails who curl and drape and leap in every which way and every
which color. This is a book to read and reread, with cats to count
and recount, and little visual details like satellite dishes and
mice on windowsills to spot with each new pass. Sadly, Anne Isaacs,
the author of the Caldecott Honor book ``Swamp Angel,'' loses her
footing with her collection of poems about a cat up a tree. The
verse is filled with embarrassing metaphysical vocabulary: how does
one explain phrases like ``Pour down your cold, transmuting fire''
to a small or medium-sized child, and why would one bother? John
Donne meets T. S. Eliot this ain't; and Stephen Mackey's murky oil
paintings of poets, pyramids and moonlight lack spark and wit.

</P>
<P>
   Noise, action and color -- the three basic food groups for
nourishing the imaginations of younger readers -- are amply
displayed in this offbeat board book about cars and driving. Using
a pop-art palette that runs to hot pinks and psychedelic pastel
swooshes, the author follows a family of brown dogs as it cruises
down city streets in multicolored autos, gets into a (painless)
fender-bender, is towed to a garage and, finally, merges back into
traffic, smiling. There's a loopiness to the computer-animated
drawings: most of the vehicles are vintage 1950's Chevys, Buicks,
Cadillacs and other classics that have been so fancifully retouched
that it seems completely appropriate to see them flying off the
roads into the air, leaving behind trails of colored stars. The
very simple text takes a back seat to the flashy visuals, but it is
sharp and lively. And what child won't enjoy hearing noisy lines
like ``Whiz, bang,/ka-BOOM'' and ``be-bop,/ka-ZOOM''? _ SCOTT VEALE

   &UR; NO, DAVID! &QL; 
 &UR; By David Shannon &QL; 
 &UR; Blue Sky/Scholastic, $14.95. (Ages 2 to 6) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   First, let's give David Shannon his due as a deeply serious
illustrator of children's books. He has collaborated with the
estimable Jane Yolen on such worthy volumes as ``Encounter,'' the
story of Columbus's discovery of the New World as recounted in
halting English by a native Taino boy, and the based-on-fact
proto-feminist fable ``The Ballad of the Pirate Queens.'' His
portrayal of America's mythic giant, Paul, avec famille et ox in
Audrey Wood's book ``The Bunyans'' earned an ABC Children's
Booksellers' Choice award. And the sports fable Shannon wrote and
illustrated, ``How Georgie Radbourn Saved Baseball,'' was a 1994
New York Times Best Illustrated Book. So it is with great relief
for children everywhere that I can now report David Shannon is
applying his considerable talents to the sillier side of life. To
wit: earlier this year ``A Very Bad Case of Stripes'' (a colorful
ode to self-acceptance) and now his latest book, NO, DAVID! (Blue
Sky/Scholastic, $14.95; ages 2 to 6) -- a hilarious compilation of
toddlers' wrongdoings. As the author's note explains: ``A few years
ago, my mother sent me a book I made when I was a little boy. It
was called 'No, David' and it was illustrated with drawings of
David doing all sorts of things he wasn't supposed to do.'' Shannon
remains true to the spirit of this earlier work with a restrained
prose style -- ``No, David!'' ``I said no, David!'' and ``That's
enough, David!'' Likewise, the quasi-stick-figure drawings of
little David are a clearly humorous homage to his original
depictions. Parents might weary of the chastising tone -- until
they start chuckling, probably about where I did, at the two-page
spread of an open-mouthed David hollering through a mouthful of
vegetables. Children, on the other hand, will recognize immediately
that they have found a kindred spirit. _ M. P. DUNLEAVEY

   &UR; WHO ORDERED THE JUMBO SHRIMP? &QL; 
 &UR; And Other Oxymorons &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Oxymoron is not a word that shows up on many school vocabulary
quizzes, but kids being kids, which means smarter than they're
given credit for, they know one when they see one. Actually, as
every parent knows, they wrote the book (so to speak) on spotting
the contradictions in the grown-up world. But thanks to Jon Agee's
delightfully ticklish ``Who Ordered the Jumbo Shrimp?'' defining or
spelling an oxymoron is a total waste of time when it comes to
enjoying some of the finer nonsensical phrases in life. Agee, who
also has two books of palindromes and a shelf of prize-winning
picture books to his credit, lets his nimble drawing do all the
talking. To verbalize a bit of the author-illustrator's line of
vision and to reveal an open secret about this almost perfect
collection of some 60 word pictures: it would be a near miss, if
not a minor catastrophe, not to take the calculated risk of
treating the whole family to this instant classic. If you don't,
good grief, things could even get pretty ugly. _ ABBOTT COMBES

THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND
</HEADLINE>
  By Giles Foden 
 335 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $25 
 ------ 
 PRESIDENT FOR LIFE 
 By MICHAEL UPCHURCH 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm not made for this kind of thing.'' That's the plaintive
sort of response that a young Scottish doctor named Nicholas
Garrigan gives whenever he's asked to take a stand on anything to
do with the repressive reign of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone bother trying to involve Nicholas in Uganda's
bloody politics? Because he is Amin's personal physician and, as
such, has a ``ghastly ringside seat'' to a number of the cruelties
inflicted on Ugandans by their self-proclaimed ``President for
life'' through much of the 1970's. Still, suggestions that Nicholas
use his privileged position to do something that might rub Amin the
wrong way _ or rub him out altogether _ are destined to fail. For
Nicholas, the narrator of this venturesome first novel, is the very
essence of evasion and appeasement. He may be the protagonist here,
but he's definitely not the hero. And therein lies the admirable
risk the British author Giles Foden takes in ``The Last King of
Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   Foden, a literary journalist and editor who spent much of his
childhood in Africa (including Uganda), has written a tale of
terror as witnessed by a man who is, by his own admission, ``mired
in cowardice and indecision.'' The paradox of the novel is that
while it's easy enough to condemn Nicholas, it's far more difficult
to admit the truth of the matter _ that the average citizen, put in
Nicholas's place, might very well behave as weakly and indecisively
as he does. This unsettling realization makes the reader more
sympathetic to the hapless Scotsman than pure conscience might
dictate.
</P>
<P>
   Foden has drawn his material from dozens of authors and
interviewees, including ``personal informants'' who wish to remain
anonymous. Mentioned by name in the novel are a British hostage,
Denis Hills; Gottfried Lessing, the former East German Ambassador
to Uganda (and also the former husband of the writer Doris
Lessing); Amin's doomed wife Kay and several of the dictator's
children. Foden has invented a standard-issue British Ambassador to
fill in for the real-life British High Commissioner, Richard Mercer
Keene Slater, who served in Uganda in the early 1970's. The book's
facts feel reliable, and Foden's fiction blends in with them
smoothly, although the novel occasionally carries the whiff of the
library stacks, not to mention the sweat of a journalist diligently
stringing his notes together.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Foden has a trump card on hand that serves to electrify
his narrative any time he cares to play it: Amin himself, whose
brutality is so laced with buffoonery that he would be hard to take
seriously if it weren't for the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 deaths
that resulted from his eight years of misrule.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens with a tantalizing first glimpse of Amin in
action at a diplomatic dinner party attended by Nicholas. There
Amin offers ``a few introductory remarks concerning domestic and
international affairs'' whose mix of solicitous concern and daffy
non sequitur evokes a wildly volatile personality. ``I have noticed
there can be bad drunkenness in Uganda and indeed across the whole
world, from beer and from spirits,'' Amin declares. ``Yes, some
people look as though they are painted with cosmetics just because
of too much drinking of alcohol. And cosmetics too can be bad
themselves, and wigs: I do not want Ugandans to wear the hair of
dead imperialists or of Africans killed by imperialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the main course is over, Amin is discussing the taste of
``human meat'' with an air of authority: ``It is very salty, even
more salty than leopard meat.'' True confession or put-on? It's
difficult to say. And it's especially difficult for Nicholas to
say, even with ``the dubious benefit of hindsight.'' Holed up in
Scotland's Inner Hebrides, where he is trying to live down his
much-publicized association with Amin, Nicholas still appears to be
unsure of what happened to him, of how much he was to blame. All he
can do is go over the sequence of events that kept him so close to
Amin's side.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Nicholas's bad timing seems like a portent. He
manages to arrive in Kampala on the very eve of the 1971 coup that
put Amin in power. Nicholas's posting is in a provincial town, so
he doesn't stay long in the capital. But when chance leads him to
treat Amin for a minor car-crash injury, an invitation soon follows
to be the dictator's in-house doctor, as well as a staff member at
Kampala's Mulago Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The preamble to this job offer occupies roughly a hundred pages
and isn't riveting in itself _ Foden resorts too readily to
formulas like ``infectious smile'' or ``nodded sagely'' _ but it
does supply pertinent information. The grim diseases that Nicholas
deals with are graphically described, and are evidence that he has
a strong stomach and can, when he chooses, be a reliable observer.
Nevertheless, he focuses more on immediate details than the big
picture, and there are hints that he's in the habit of tuning out
anything he doesn't want to hear. (It's no coincidence that he's
plagued with a sound-dulling ear infection almost from the moment
of his arrival.)
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, his blundering manner with women signals
a raw immaturity of which he's well aware. His failure to return to
Scotland for his parents' funerals (his father and mother die in
quick succession shortly after his move to Uganda) indicates, more
disturbingly, that ``something in me had begun to close down.''
</P>
<P>
   In his favor are his instinctive kindness and his desire to put
his medical skills to much-needed use (his rationale for staying on
in Uganda when common sense suggests fleeing). His absence of
racial prejudice would be reassuring, too, if it weren't somehow
linked to his absence of confidence. Far from embodying the
Brits-know-best attitudes of his colonial predecessors, Nicholas
doesn't seem to know a thing. He's a power vacuum waiting to be
filled _ and Amin does the filling admirably, bringing Foden's
prose to life while he's at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SCOTLAND-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: he's at it.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foden's Amin, again apparently an amalgam of reportage and
invention, sets rooms aquiver with tension and fear as soon as he
enters them, even when he's in his most affable mood. In this
portrait, his intimidating physical presence, whimsical tyranny and
freewheeling dementia are powerfully persuasive, as is his uncanny
mind-reading ability when it comes to his personal physician.
</P>
<P>
   What does Amin see in Nicholas? Not just a skilled doctor, it
turns out, but a potential fellow malcontent whose country has been
oppressed by the English for even longer than Uganda. Indeed, Amin
sees himself as a de facto Scottish freedom fighter: ``Many of the
Scottish people already consider me last King of the Scots.'' The
undiluted zaniness of Amin's fervor on these and other matters
elicits a feeling of protective fondness in Nicholas. There's even
a queasily erotic element in Nicholas's rapport with his
dangerously sensitive patient. Both of these factors distract
Nicholas from registering just how bloodily anarchic Uganda is
becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Reality checks _ in the form of Hitler comparisons voiced by
Kampala's British officialdom _ fail to penetrate. As Nicholas
grows more isolated and then more fearful, he squirms, flails and
babbles. When at last he tries to run away, it's a mistake _ not
just for Nicholas, but for the book. For whenever Amin slips too
far from sight, Foden's prose becomes less inspired, making us
wonder whether it's Foden's authorial resourcefulness or his
fidelity to the historical record that galvanizes this strange
horror story.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the novel is plain enough, and embroidered with
enough detail to flesh it out convincingly. ``It only takes one
good man to do nothing for evil to triumph,'' Nicholas is told.
Nicholas is that good man _ one who, unfortunately, has all the
resolve of a wet paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   What we're left with, ultimately, is the real Amin alive and
well and living in exile in Saudi Arabia _ and a fictional Nicholas
not much wiser than when he started. He's regretful, sure, but
mostly because he wishes none of these terrible things had happened
to him. He clearly recognizes the mechanism by which he sidesteps
reality. ``My problem,'' he admits, ``is that because the world
doesn't deliver what I seek, I don't admit facts.'' But
recognition, it seems, isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, it bears repeating, may be more our kindred spirit
than we like to think. And Foden, in this ambitious debut, does his
best to let us know it.

 LIVES OF A SAINT 
 By MARINA WARNER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to be a saint in a world without God is one of the hardest
questions of our time, observed Albert Camus. Though Camus didn't
invoke Joan of Arc, he could have, because her remarkable life
escapes so many of the normal, defining features of Christian
sainthood. She is, rather, a pre-eminent female hero of history,
and her example has been an inspiration in this century to writers,
actors, activists, patriots -- and young women and girls far beyond
her native France. Two vivid new picture books continue the
tradition of telling her story.
</P>
<P>
   Joan of Arc didn't renounce the world; she didn't convert from a
life of sin; she didn't give away her goods to the poor (she didn't
have any); she wasn't a queen or an abbess or a scholar; and above
all, she was tried for heresy by a Roman Catholic Church tribunal
and burned as a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   It's rumored that the Vatican is considering rehabilitating the
fiery monk Girolamo Savonarola, who was hanged and then burned in
Florence, almost 70 years after Joan of Arc died in Rouen. If so,
Savonarola will be eligible to join Joan as one of the few
canonized saints who was, in fact, martyred by the church.
</P>
<P>
   The philosopher Bernard Williams, in a recent discussion,
pointed out that, as the defining principle of truth, accuracy has
been gradually eclipsed by sincerity. If what you are saying is
incorrect, it may still carry the force of conviction if it is
spoken from the heart. In the last century, Thomas Carlyle defined
``sincerity, a deep, great, genuine sincerity,'' as ``the mark of
the hero.'' In this respect, Joan of Arc is a truly modern figure,
a person who expresses unflinching, subjective truthfulness: under
protracted interrogation, she held to the reality of her visions,
the divine origin of her mission and her need to keep wearing male
dress. Like Galileo, she embodies the individual under duress, a
romantic rebel with a cause.
</P>
<P>
   In these retellings by the British writer Josephine Poole and
the American Diane Stanley, Joan of Arc's life has the quality of a
wonder tale, all the more wondrous because it took place. Poole's
version begins, ``This is a true story.'' She keeps the plot clear
and the psychology simple; chivalry and the love of God animate her
heroine. ``Joan simply did what God told her to do,'' she writes,
``and nothing, nobody could prevent her.'' The illustrations, by
Angela Barrett, recall millefleurs tapestries and ``Les Tres Riches
Heures du Duc de Berry'' and other illuminated manuscripts, and use
a wide, horizontal format with eloquence and energy. They also
heighten the intensity of the narrative, often picturing the
heroine in isolation, so that Joan seems truly a creature set
apart, marked by radical difference from the strife and pageantry
and pomp surrounding her.
</P>
<P>
   In one striking image, for example, Barrett shows Joan cutting
off her hair with a pair of carefully rendered medieval shears,
while beyond the mullioned window the willows are pollarded as if
to echo her action. Barrett also changes the viewpoint now and
then, to maximum effect: the English siege of Orleans is shown from
a dark, enclosed gun emplacement, with a gunner lighting the powder
on a cannon from a red-hot brazier. The most haunting illustration,
however, shows Joan on the riverbank, looking down at the corpse of
an English soldier, half submerged in a running stream, like John
Everett Millais's painting of Ophelia. ``And Joan wept for pity of
him, and of all who died that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Stanley, a prolific artist and a writer who has done a
number of illustrated biographies, provides a more complex,
historical understanding of Joan of Arc, and adds other pedagogic
features to help interactive reading: a guide to French
pronunciation, a map of France in 1429, a helpful introduction to
the dynastic tangles behind the Hundred Years' War and a thoughtful
afterword, where she admits, ``Sometimes, in studying history, we
have to accept what we know and let the rest remain a mystery.''
Her own illustrations also draw on contemporary illuminations, but
of military chronicles and other documents: she has faithfully
followed Jean Fouquet's portrait of Charles VII, complete with
piggy eyes and bulbous nose.
</P>
<P>
   Her Joan is a good little girl, her body language meek and
demure: she makes daisy chains as she tends the sheep, and is seen
spinning in the family kitchen, with a butter churn behind her and
her mother sweeping the dirt floor. ``The future savior of
France,'' writes Stanley, ``was much like all the other little
girls in the village of Domremy.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while the awkward questions about Joan's personality and
career -- her visions and actions -- are raised, Stanley often
interprets them in the most bland and kindly light. Joan's father
does indeed threaten to have her drowned if she leaves home to go
to war, but his earlier plan to marry her off is attributed to
loving paternal provision. Joan's male dress is a simple practical
measure. Her banner protects her from killing anyone in battle. Her
brothers are solid in support. Miracles are not much in evidence.
Toward the end, the old excuse is suggested, that male clothes were
left in her cell after she had recanted in order to trick her into
lapsing again.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on historical context, Stanley's storytelling is
hampered by her anxiety to explain or, indeed, explain away, Joan's
story: ``It is important to remember,'' Stanley writes, ``that she
lived in the Middle Ages, a time when even educated people believed
in fairies, curses, prophecies, witches and magic.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Poole is all too brief, and Stanley occasionally loses
narrative focus, these are both beautifully produced picture books
that will introduce readers -- especially school-age girls -- to an
eternally inspiring story. At a moment when political opportunism,
historical fabrication, national corruption and individual
equivocation poison public life from Belgrade to Washington, Joan
of Arc's resolute stand makes her a necessary saint, a continuing
hero of our time.

BLUE LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  By Walter Mosley 
 296 pp. New York: Little, Brown &AMP; Company. $24 
 ------ 
 PRIMARY COLOR 
 By MEL WATKINS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The central metaphor in Walter Mosley's new novel was
foreshadowed in his short-story collection of last year, ``Always
Outnumbered, Always Outgunned,'' when the protagonist, Socrates
Fortlow, recalled his aunt telling him that God ``ain't black. ...
If he was there wouldn't be all this mess down here. Naw. God's
blue.'' She went on to explain: ``Blue like the ocean. Blue. Sad
and cold and far away like the sky is far and blue.'' In ``Blue
Light'' _ perhaps best described as fable-cum-science fiction _
that analogy is extended and stretched to its metaphysical limit.
Mosley moves far afield from genre fiction and the familiarly
gritty Los Angeles-based domain of his affably private detective,
Easy Rawlins. The setting for this visionary meditation on
spirituality, evil, race and the ultimate fate of mankind is the
San Francisco area and the longhaired, mutinous, free-love world of
Haight-Ashbury in the mid-1960's.
</P>
<P>
   The event that sets the novel in motion is the sudden appearance
of multiple shards of a mysterious blue radiance (``God's tears'')
that descends and abruptly shatters the calm of a Bay Area evening.
For those touched, the result is death, madness or bliss _ the
latter a state of heightened strength, perception, energy and
sentience that sets them apart from ordinary humans, who are
described as a ``base stock'' in whom the ``pattern of life''
exists but is ``inert and decaying.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 ``blues'' survive. Principal among them are Orde, a
frail blond former hippie who assumes the Christlike role of
prophet and teacher to the blues' small Close Congregation, and
Horace LaFontaine, a black former convict who is struck by the blue
light an instant after he dies of cancer. Horace's corpse is
immediately revived and used as a host by Gray Man, a powerful,
demonic entity who tells Horace: ``I am your master. . . . Grey
Redstar. Recently from elsewhere.'' Until the novel's final clash,
LaFontaine remains a tortured, wretched shell, whose spirit is
imprisoned in the ``Attica cell'' of Gray Man's mind. Although
numerous characters are introduced and occasionally take center
stage, it is the internal war for dominion between Gray Man (death)
and Horace (life), and the blues' struggle to escape Gray Man's
relentless attempt to annihilate them, that inform and adumbrate
this allegorical tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Light'' is related in a matter-of-fact, near-documentary
style by Lester (Chance) Foote _ later ominously called ``Last
Chance'' _ a half-crazed mulatto Ph.D. candidate who has been
driven to a suicide attempt by his marginal status in America: ``I
spoke the white man's language. I dreamed his dreams. But when I
woke up, no one recognized me.'' After meeting Orde and engaging in
a blood-mixing ritual that leaves him partly endowed with the
blues' powers (``a pool on whose surface shimmered the image of
God''), Chance is rejuvenated as the prophet's acolyte. He drops
out of the University of California, Berkeley, and begins writing
``The History of the Coming of Light.'' ``Blue Light'' is
essentially Chance's account of the struggles between life and
death, man's higher aspirations and baser impulses, that ensue as
Gray Man stalks the blues and faces them in a final encounter at
Treaty, the idyllic Eden to which the spritelike Juan Thrombone
(topiarist to the forest's magical singing and bellowing trees) has
led them.
</P>
<P>
   For readers accustomed to the gut-real encounters, sharp
dialogue and quirky perceptions that enliven the first-person
narrations of Mosley's Easy Rawlins mysteries, both Chance's grave
voice and the surreal nature of ``Blue Light'' may be a
disappointment. Although the novel is not without its fair share of
realistic depictions of mayhem, sexual and physical confrontations
and dramatic tension, it frequently succumbs to the pitfalls that
bedevil most fables and allegories. Chance's recitation often
skirts mundane detail to embrace allusion and abstraction. He and
the characters he describes slip too easily into sermonic discourse
and excursive asides. In too many instances characters are consumed
by caricature and prototype. Flesh-and-blood people meld into
fundamental archetypes in the person of characters such as Teacher,
Alacrity, Evil, Gray Man and even, to some extent, the narrator,
Last Chance.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel that energizes the novel is not its characters but its
plot, and Mosley's exposition of the blue light's puzzling
attributes. In this regard it bears some comparison to Ishmael
Reed's 1972 novel, ``Mumbo Jumbo,'' in the affinity between
Mosley's blue light and ``Jes Grew,'' the mysterious plague that
transformed Reed's characters. For Reed, Jes Grew symbolized a
resurfacing of the spontaneity and creativity of the human spirit,
which was born in Africa and, like jazz, inspired people to forsake
inhibitions and ethnic clannishness and, finally, to celebrate life
or just ``shake that thing.'' It is set against the forces of evil,
racism and artistic stultification that conspired to suppress it
throughout history. Mosley's blue light parallels the spiritual
force in Reed's Manichaean equation in that it alludes to a
spiritual power that transforms humans, freeing them from
repression and unveiling the natural life force within. It is also
driven by the magic of song and dance. ``Everything is singing all
the time,'' Thrombone tells Chance when asked ``What is the blue
light?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing and calling for what is missing. Your science calls it
gravity, but the gods call it dance. They dance and fornicate; they
listen and sing.''
</P>
<P>
   The raucous impiety and historical resonance of ``Mumbo Jumbo''
are missing from ``Blue Light.'' Instead, Mosley advances a
pantheistic belief in the immanence of nature and the natural
instincts of mankind and the oneness of existence _ spiritual and
material as well as racial. Through its final apocalyptic
denouement and the fate of the narrator, Last Chance, the novel
hints that we may have missed our opportunity for atonement and
reconciliation during the revolutionary 60's, when, for a brief
moment, the nation's youth, black and white, assailed traditional
authority with protests over war, racial segregation and misuse of
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it suggests that to the racial problem there is but
one solution. As Orde tells Chance when combining their blood to
initiate him into the realm of the blues, ``See, the blood mixes
itself.'' They watch the ``darker blood and the lighter,'' which
``had formed into longish clumps like fat worms,'' as they
``twisted and turned against each other, sometimes slowly,
sometimes fast. Every now and then two worms would collapse and
fall together and then fall apart.'' Orde makes sure to underline
his point: ``When they're all the same color it will be ready.''

 SOME PEPPERONI ON YOUR LITTLE BOY? 
 By SIGNE WILKINSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one indispensable manual every American parent needs for
successful child rearing has been, of course, Russell Baker's
autobiography, ``Growing Up.'' Now, William Steig's equally helpful
``Pete's a Pizza'' must be added to the strategic bedside shelf of
parenting advice. Just as Baker cleverly disguised his
how-to-raise-a-nonpsychotic-child primer as a gently humorous
memoir, Steig disguises his how-to-be-a-nonpsychotic-parent
treatise as a gently humorous children's book. Actually, the little
gem works brilliantly as both.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete in ``Pete's a Pizza'' presents himself as the classic
child in a funk, seriously sulky because rain has spoiled his
chance to go out and play with friends. Confronted with such an
inconsolable child, the typical parent might logically decide to
</P>
<P>
   A) rush to Penelope Leach and look up clinical depression;
</P>
<P>
   B) rush to the mall for the latest Sony Play Station;
</P>
<P>
   C) rush to refill Pete's Ritalin prescription;
</P>
<P>
   D) rush to the Cineplex to catch the latest Bruce Willis
catastrophe flick;
</P>
<P>
   E) relax and make the kid into a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   While William Steig never directly addresses or speaks ill of
the first four well-used options in American parenting, he strongly
recommends the pizza alternative. Helpfully, he illustrates his
technique with simple drawings that make busy parents want to put
down their I.B.M. Think Pads and pick up a child. In Steig's
drawings, Pete's bemused parents look to be about 75 years old,
which is, perhaps, why they don't take the youngster's foul mood
seriously. Instead, they scoop up the miserable Pete, plunk him
down on the kitchen table like a ball of dough, knead him, twirl
him in the air, stretch him out and then start sprinkling on the
toppings, like oil (water), flour (talcum powder) and tomatoes (red
checkers). By the time the pizza is baked on the couch and ready to
slice, it's laughing and running away. Like the thunderstorm
outside, Pete's dark cloud disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Steig's strategy relies on a couple of old-fangled ideas. First
of all, there are two parents, and neither is taking a meeting.
There's a house with a sturdy kitchen table that isn't so important
to the decorating scheme that a little stray talcum powder will
hurt it. And there are checkers, apparently indicating that it's a
house in which people actually sit down together and play games
that don't need batteries. It's a joyful house, and ``Pete's a
Pizza'' is a joyful little story. America will be a better place if
the Steig family pizza party catches on.
</P>
<P>
   When the 90-year-old Steig isn't writing parenting manuals, he
seems to have time to illustrate stories by his wife, Jeanne. In
``A Handful of Beans,'' the Steigs pair their well-matched talents
to retell six classic fairy tales. Like directors approaching
Shakespeare and making him seem fresh, the Steigs manage to retell
and reillustrate these well-known stories without either taking
them too reverentially or trashing their original intent.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Jeanne Steig's faithfulness, an evil stepmother is
still an evil stepmother in ``Hansel and Gretel.'' Jack still goes
for the gold in ``Jack and the Beanstalk.'' And Little Red Riding
Hood is still a ditz about stopping and talking with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Steig includes plenty of colorful detail (that's a lime
tree the princess in ``The Frog Prince'' is sitting under) without
padding or dragging out the simple tales. Each story ends with a
sprightly rhyme, like Rumpelstiltskin's
</P>
<P>
   And as for the King,
</P>
<P>
   Rapacious old thing,
</P>
<P>
   He got all the loot --
</P>
<P>
   And a princess to boot!
</P>
<P>
   William Steig's colorful full-page drawings, looking as
sumptuously patterned as late Matisses, are interspersed among full
pages of text. Though charming as always, they don't reveal any new
territory, either for him or for the stories. But so what? Coming
upon one is as delightful as coming upon a bright candy house after
a long walk through the dark woods. At first, Steig's characters
look disconcertingly similar. It's hard to get used to a world in
which the witch in ``Hansel and Gretel'' and the princess in ``The
Frog Prince'' are about equally attractive. When the eyes adjust,
however, both dames seem equally believable. His male characters
are slightly more individual, with his wolf in ``Little Red Riding
Hood'' having the satisfyingly creepy look of Jeremy Irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Handful of Beans'' is a pleasant collection, and, as Pete's
parents would probably attest, it's always a good idea to have some
well-written fairy tales on hand for the nights when everyone is
too tired to make pizza.

THE GREEKS AND GREEK CIVILIZATION
</HEADLINE>
  By Jacob Burckhardt 
 Translated by Sheila Stern 
 Edited by Oswyn Murray 
 449 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $27.95 
 ------ 
 LOVING THE UNLOVABLE GREEKS 
 By GARRY WILLS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt is best known for ``The
Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy.'' But that 1860 work was
intended as part of a cultural history of Europe whose most
important part would be the treatment of ancient Greece. ``It is
only the Philhellenism of Rome, the love of a Greece that was still
alive, that was responsible for the survival of the whole culture
of the ancient world,'' he said. ``Hellenistic Rome was the
indispensable basis for the spread of Christianity, and
Christianity, apart from its role as a religion, was to be the
single bridge destined to unite the old world with its Germanic
conquerors. In this whole chain of cause and effect, Hellenism is
the most important link.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he never filled in his great plan, he did write out a
lengthy lecture course on Greek history, which he offered his
students in Basel four different times. He had prepared some of
these for publication before he died, but the complete lecture
course was published (in four volumes) posthumously. Parts of this
massive project were translated into English by Palmer Hilty in
l958. Now another grouping has been translated by Sheila Stern as
``The Greeks and Greek Civilization.'' There is little overlap
between the two books. Oswyn Murray, the classicist who made the
selection and wrote the introduction, omits Volume 3, on the arts,
because that is the least original section. He singles out those
parts that will support his contention that Burckhardt is the
forerunner of modern cultural anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of European history, Sparta was more admired than
Athens, and Rome more than Sparta. A shift in attention from Rome
to Greece had occurred in the 18th century, but it was not until
the 19th that advocates of democracy made Athens admirable in the
political realm as well as in the esthetic. Burckhardt, who feared
the disorder of democracy, had little sympathy with this
development. For him, the great age of Greece was the sixth century
B.C., when aristocrats celebrated the competitive culture typified
by the great Hellenic games. The agon, the contest for excellence,
was peculiarly Greek: ``Only small free aristocracies could allow
the expression of the will to self-distinction among equals before
judges, who were elected or fairly chosen in some other way, and
then only in a nation like the Greeks; the Romans, who differed
from them chiefly in their dislike of anything 'useless,' would
never have developed this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Decline began, for Burckhardt, in the fifth century, when what
had been attendant drawbacks of the agonal spirit moved up to
become the dominant traits, including a belief in the right to lie.
Noble competitiveness shrank to petty litigiousness. License to lie
became a compulsion to lie. Haughty revenge at offenses to honor
was perverted into indiscriminate malice, a ``diabolical delight in
ruining others,'' which the Greeks did not even try to conceal.
Carl Schorske, in ``Thinking With History,'' contended that
Burckhardt stayed in little Basel, his native town, because he
needed its civil atmosphere. He shrank from strife, which may be
why he stopped publishing and confined himself to lectures. When
Leopold von Ranke died in Berlin, Burckhardt turned down the offer
to succeed to his prestigious chair in history. In Athens, he
discovered the exact opposite of his civil and pacific Basel: ``A
permanent terrorism was exercised by the combination of the
sycophants'' -- that is, informers -- ``the orators and the
constant threat of public prosecution, especially for peculation
and incompetence, as well as the ever present risk of being accused
of asebeia (impiety). A certain hardening of the nerves must have
resulted from all this.'' Athenians were eloquent, but eloquence
itself ``became, like the press today, the instrument of very
little good and three-quarters of everything bad; it colored and
enfeebled both poetry and historiography; even the philosophers
were partly, in real life, really rhetoricians.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his fierce dislike of Athens, Burckhardt had a
contrarian streak in him, which made him praise what others
condemned and condemn what they praised. He ridicules Socrates but
defends the sophists -- who did not, after all, teach Athenians to
wrangle (who could have done that?), but brought some degree of
order into the melee. The person who most fascinates him is
Alcibiades, whose magnificent disdain for democracy is seen as a
remnant of the old agonal aristocracy brought down into the cramped
world of envious levelers. In these pages, a charismatic
condottiere seems to have ridden right out of Burckhardt's book on
the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Though Burckhardt does not glorify Sparta, his treatment of
Athenian instability is a throwback to the old pro-Spartan
orthodoxy. Despite this reactionary aspect (which he does not even
advert to), Oswyn Murray claims that the lectures he is introducing
laid ``the foundation of modern approaches to the Greek world.'' He
says that Burckhardt was the first to focus on the agonal character
of Greek culture (though no reader of Pindar could have been
unaware of that) and the first to describe the peculiar nature of
the polis (the city-unit of rule). A serious flaw in Burckhardt's
treatment is his inability to see what was clear to Ernst Curtius
or Basil Gildersleeve, the crucial role religion played in the
contests. Greek myths interested Burckhardt as stories; Greek
ritual did not. Yet ritual (especially sacrifice) was the heart of
Greek religion. Burckhardt's study of Renaissance city-states may
have made him sensitive to the contracted world of the polis, but
he typically grounds the city in the character flaws of the Greeks.
The citizens' disgust at manual labor made them depend on slaves,
who had to be kept within manageable confines. Distrust of the
outside also confined the polis, unable ``to control more extensive
areas, in such a way that its individual settlements would not
become centers of subversion.'' Empires were risked only by Spartan
brutality or Athenian recklessness. Contraction of the sphere meant
that ``internally, the polis was implacable toward any individual
who ceased to be totally absorbed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GREEKS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: in it.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burckhardt can be considered the discoverer of the polis only if
that rather sour picture of it is the true one. Historians like
George Grote had found different explanations for the centrality of
the polis. In fact, Burckhardt sounds like Grote read upside down
or backward. Where the former sees a cramped world of intrusion and
control, the latter sees human scale and participatory democracy.
Burckhardt's polis swallows the citizen. Grote's polis is at the
disposal of the citizen. This ability to see different values in
the same material tends to invalidate Burckhardt's claim, endorsed
by Murray, that a history of attitudes is more certain than a
history of events. The argument suggests that events need
interpreting, but attitudes, since they are already
interpretations, do not need further interpreting. This is
epistemologically naive. Even more questionable is the assertion
that Burckhardt initiated what is now called the study of
``mentalities.'' Arnaldo Momigliano proposed earlier historians of
such cultural ideals (including Burckhardt's own teacher, August
Boeckh), and said that the difference between event-history and
mentality-history is as old as the contrast between Thucydides and
Herodotus. Murray is overstating Burckhardt's legitimate claim to
be the father of modern cultural history, a claim better based on
his Renaissance book than on these lectures. Momigliano, in his
introduction to an Italian translation of the Greek lectures, sees
in them a throwback to romanticism instead of a stride into the
future -- the romanticism that finds a ``soul of the nation'' in
any people.
</P>
<P>
   The soul Burckhardt finds in the Greeks is a dark one. Edmund
Burke said that he did not know how to draw up an indictment of a
whole people, but Burckhardt treats that as an easy task. His
cranky views can be a corrective to the rather gaga (or Edith
Hamilton) idealization of ``the Greek spirit'' on display in John
Heath and Victor D. Hanson's ``Who Killed Homer? The Demise of
Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom'' (Free Press,
$25). But attempts to reduce a complex historical process to
matters of national character are almost always simplistic. It is
better to read Burckhardt for the scattered insights of a lively
mind immersed in Greek literature (but not in Greek inscriptions or
archeology). And there are always the lively if rather cynical
aphorisms. We are told, for instance, that Athenians were bound to
get rather stuck-up, since others ``sang their praises in a way
that can only be compared with the nonsense that is nowadays talked
about Paris.''

DAWN POWELL
</HEADLINE>
  A Biography 
 By Tim Page 
 Illustrated. 362 pp. New York: Henry Holt &AMP; Company. $30 
 ------ 
 ANGEL ON TOAST 
 By LISA ZEIDNER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As far as I know, Dawn Powell's novels are not on a syllabus at
any American university. Yet she is wittier than Dorothy Parker,
dissects the rich better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, is more
plaintive than Willa Cather in her evocation of the heartland and
has a more supple control of satirical voice than Evelyn Waugh, the
writer to whom she's most often compared.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the market for a feminist icon could do worse than Dawn
Powell. She prided herself on being a survivor, not a victim. She
supported herself as a writer through the Depression and two world
wars while nursing an autistic son, an alcoholic husband and her
own parade of illnesses. She took lovers as boldly as a man and
hobnobbed with the influential artists of her time. From this life,
she produced 16 novels, many of them great, not to mention 10 plays
and over 100 stories.
</P>
<P>
   So why is she not better known? You could accept Tim Page's
explanation, in ``Dawn Powell: A Biography,'' that her ``dark,
mordant attitude toward the world . . . rankled.'' She was simply
too unsparing in her satire, offending the very people who might
embrace her. As Powell wrote in her diary: ``I think my great
handicap and strongest slavery is my insistence on freedom. I
require it.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, the chief music critic for The Washington Post, has done
more than write the first Powell biography. To a large extent, we
must thank Page for allowing us to read her at all. Only fitfully
successful during her lifetime, she was almost completely out of
print following her death in 1965. Yet she was not without
admirers: in a 1987 essay, Gore Vidal extolled Powell as a better
satirist than Twain. In 1991, after reading a tribute to Powell by
Edmund Wilson, Page stumbled upon a used copy of one of her novels
and became instrumental in seeing her work reprinted. He edited her
diaries for publication and is now the executor of her literary
estate. Outside of her family, no one loves this complicated woman
or her work as much as Page.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Powell's childhood reads like a parable about overcoming
hardship. Born in 1896 in the small town of Mount Gilead, Ohio,
Powell was the middle of three girls. Her mother died, of a botched
abortion, when Powell was 7. Powell's father, an alcoholic
traveling salesman, remarried and left the girls in the care of a
genuine wicked stepmother -- a woman not only cruel but quite
seriously disturbed. (She forced Dawn's sister Phyllis to watch her
exhume the coffin of a premature newborn so she could change the
corpse's outfit -- into the dress of Phyllis's only doll.)
</P>
<P>
   By 13, Powell had already read Schopenhauer but had been
forbidden to go to high school. She ran away from home to finish
school and live with a nurturing aunt, Orpha May, in Shelby, Ohio,
then sweet-talked herself into a work-study scholarship at Lake
Erie College for Women before arriving in Manhattan in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really one city for everyone just as there is one
major love,'' Powell wrote. Novels like ``A Time to Be Born''
dissect the city's social codes with almost anthropological
precision. For most of her time as a passionate New Yorker, Powell
lived in Greenwich Village with her husband, the adman Joseph
Gousha, and, when he was not institutionalized, her son, Joseph
Gousha Jr., called Jojo. (The autism that afflicted him had not yet
been identified as a condition; the boy was first thought to be
retarded.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Powell contended that she wrote ``because there is no
one to talk to,'' her social life was a whirl of dinners and
parties with good friends like Edmund Wilson and John Dos Passos.
She knew Nabokov, Hemingway, Dorothy Parker and Stella Adler. She
could be brutal in exposing poseurs and had a delectably nasty wit.
Yet she was also ferociously loyal to her family and to old school
chums. And she was never a snob or a social climber. She befriended
Margaret Burnham De Silver at a mental hospital. (Jojo was in love
with De Silver's daughter, a schizophrenic.) De Silver was an
heiress whose anarchist lover would later be assassinated by the
mob -- just the kind of bizarre connections that Powell's Manhattan
offers. The critic who once huffily complained that there was ``not
a wholly normal character'' in a Powell novel would probably be
equally offended by her life.
</P>
<P>
   Powell wrote steadily, sometimes in jubilation, but more often
in a nattering funk. She viewed her career as a horrid Sisyphean
rock. Page chronicles the stupid, ungenerous reviews -- many
written by so-called friends -- and the foolhardy marketing ploys.
(Her publisher actually tried to pawn off the family at the center
of the hard-edged ``My Home Is Far Away'' as ``happy-go-lucky.'')
In spite of spotty recognition, Powell retained a lucid assurance
about the value of her vision.
</P>
<P>
   About her characters, Powell said: ``I give them their heads.
They furnish their own nooses.'' Page captures one of the chief
appeals of Powell's fiction: how her ruthless exposure of her
characters coexists with her buoyant affection for them. Her
realism, Page asserts, ``did not push her work into either gloom or
didacticism.'' In fact, her crisply nuanced social satire has more
in common with Jane Austen than with the contemporaries to whom she
is usually compared. One almost has to stretch back to Austen to
find heroines as confident, complex and sympathetic. In Austen, and
Powell, it's a hard, cold world -- yet nice girls can still
sometimes finish first.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Page began this biography, virtually all of Powell's
intimates were dead. This fact has obviously hindered his ability
to dig up fresh dirt. ``Dawn Powell'' does debunk one morsel of
gossip: that she conducted a lifelong affair with the debonair,
droll editor Coburn (Coby) Gilman, cohabiting with him and Joseph
Gousha in virtually a menage a trois.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's attitude toward sex was, as Page puts it,
``fundamentally sportive.'' She had no patience for women who
whined about romance. Yet Page reveals that Powell did suffer one
major heartbreak: her failed affair with the playwright John Howard
Lawson. Her stubborn longing for Lawson haunted her and clearly
informed much of her best work. But, maddeningly, the affair was so
covert that Powell would not even make reference to it in her
diaries, Page's main (indeed, in many cases, only) source of
information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-POWELL-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: information.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of fresh revelations, the biography attempts to plant
Powell firmly in American cultural history: in the hard-drinking,
money-grubbing, politicized context of her times. But Page is not a
historian. The biography's only weakness is that Page does not
always clarify, or seem able to evaluate, which of his subject's
decisions about love and money were bravely eccentric, which
standard protocol for a Greenwich Village bohemian. What did
Powell's contemporaries make of her declining a spectacular salary
to write for Hollywood at the depth of the Depression -- especially
when she was always strapped for cash, at one point virtually
homeless? Or of enduring a sexless if companionable marriage more
worthy of a Henry James novel than one of her own bawdy,
bed-hopping confections?
</P>
<P>
   In her elusive relationship to the values of her era lies
Powell's greatness -- yet this is also, paradoxically, her most
damning liability. She could be neither marketed as breathlessly
of-the-moment nor lionized as timelessly classical. As usual, she
knew the score. ``The Golden Spur,'' published three years before
her death, contains a scathing self-parody in which Claire, a
failed writer and lonely old crone, brags that ``really good
clothes never go out of style'' -- oblivious of the fact that
people flee from her as if she's a bag lady.
</P>
<P>
   Page exposes Powell for lying about her age. As she hit 30, she
seems to have decided to become a year younger. And he has some
gentle fun with her health bugbears, like her tendency to look upon
any hospitalization, even for the removal of a tumor so large it
cracked open her ribs one by one, as a pampered vacation. But short
of that, this biography is unabashedly celebratory. After all, Page
named one of his sons after Jack Sherman, Powell's cousin. We
confirmed Powellists (Dawnites?) can only applaud him.
</P>
<P>
   His devotion is eerily prefigured in one of Powell's best
novels, ``Turn Magic Wheel,'' in which a male writer is spellbound
by a mysterious older woman. Since it's a Powell novel, the ending
is not triumphant or tragic but qualified and enigmatic. For Page
to become such a vigorous champion allows a satisfying fairy-tale
coda to Powell's career -- not the kind that she herself would have
envisioned, but the kind that she deserves.

PROZAC DIARY
</HEADLINE>
  By Lauren Slater 
 203 pp. New York: Random House. $21.95 
 ------ 
 'THE BIG MAC OF MEDICINE' 
 By D. T. MAX 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it cheating to take a pill that replaces the hard work of
therapy? If you are on Prozac, are you your true self? What does it
mean to be ``on Prozac'' anyway? Wouldn't it be as true to say you
are ``off depression''? These are the sorts of questions invited by
Lauren Slater's ``Prozac Diary,'' a gentle, illuminating memoir of
what it's like to be cured by America's pre-eminent selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
</P>
<P>
   Slater is in an unusual position to ask and answer her own
questions, because thanks to Prozac she has gone from patient to
therapist: since 1994 she has been a psychologist working with
schizophrenics and depressives (a story she tells in her wonderful
earlier book, ``Welcome to My Country'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Prozac Diary'' begins in 1988 at McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Mass., where the 26-year-old Slater encounters the substance she
will soon think of, only somewhat jokingly, as a willful and
powerful lover. Her psychopharmacologist, whom she calls ``the
Prozac Doctor,'' has no interest in the talking cure. He is so
psyched by Eli Lilly's then-new antidepressant that he has a Lucite
Prozac clock, Prozac pen set and Prozac stationery in his office.
</P>
<P>
   And Slater is obviously in need. Nothing has eased the severe
depression that first came over her in her teens. She lives alone
in a basement apartment in Cambridge, having dropped out of a
creative writing program. She has never held a real job or had a
significant relationship. Recently, she has begun to exhibit
obsessive-compulsive symptoms too. She taps and counts things
repeatedly. While once she was the kind of person you didn't notice
_ a pale, anxious, anorexic-looking girl _ now she is the kind of
person you move away from on the bus. So down go the
cream-and-green pills, first one a day, then ultimately four, for
80 milligrams total; ``the Big Mac of medicine,'' as she says.
</P>
<P>
   The results are immediate and spectacular, and make the most
moving reading in the book. ``Those first few mornings,'' Slater
writes, ``were fairy tales, tall tales, replete with all the bent
beauty of a new world.'' Miranda in Cambridge. She is a woman whose
life _ or at any rate her view of that life _ tends toward the
symbolic. A magician at Faneuil Hall calls her out of the audience
to take part in a magic trick. She begins browsing real estate
give-away papers, as if shopping for her new life. She learns how
to set an alarm clock, goes to her first rock concert, gets a new
apartment, takes her first road trip, enters her first real
relationship. It turns out that despite having had sex several
times, she is still technically a virgin. At a clinic a doctor
surgically breaks her hymen.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to read this book. It reminds me of the base-line
truth about Prozac. During the decade in which it has gone from
wonder drug to one of the dominant medications of our time (almost
10 million prescriptions a year in the United States alone), a
considerable and obdurate backlash has formed. True, the walking
worried take Prozac. True, so do their dogs and cats. No doubt
``cosmetic psychopharmacology'' _ the phrase comes from Peter D.
Kramer, the author of the best-selling ``Listening to Prozac'' _ is
a concern. If the natural self isn't perfect, take a pill. But
Slater didn't just have the sniffles. She was more like someone
with pneumonia waiting for the invention of antibiotics. And the
life she has gone on to have with Prozac as her constant companion
is remarkable. Surely no one would wish her back buried alive in a
Cambridge basement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Slater is too capable an observer of her own psyche not to
ask, in living this momentous and very American tale of hardship
overcome with technology, what she may have lost. ``Much has been
said about the meanings we make of illness,'' she writes, ``but
what about the meanings we make out of cure? Cure is complex,
disorienting, a revisioning of the self, either subtle or stark.''
Her cure took away her sex drive, as it does to many users of
Prozac. And at some point the drug became less effective. The brain
apparently adjusts, trying to return to its old ways. In her case,
Prozac also suppressed her creative self, at least at first. Since
childhood she had had voices in her head that took her over when
she sat down to write, inducing a mad scribbling over sheets of
paper. Prozac smothered these voices, and the breaking of her hymen
finished them off. The prose style that replaced those voices
</P>
<P>
   is self-conscious, deliberate, nervous about taking on too much.
Which style is really Slater's? Last, Prozac took away her belief
in God. Depression, anorexia _ these were surely ambiguous gifts.
But if 80 milligrams of fluoxetine hydrochloride is all it takes to
change who you are, then we are all, obviously, just so many
chemical compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Does Slater worry about these questions too much? Perhaps, but
as anyone who has experienced the eerie relief of modern
psychopharmacology can tell you, such thoughts are never far from
the (remade) mind. Does Prozac make you who you are or who you were
never meant to be? For Slater, in the end it's enough to be, almost
and at last, well.

 THE BOYS OF WAR 
 By HENRY MAYER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are various ways to write historical fiction for children.
Gary Paulsen's ``Soldier's Heart'' is a stark, utterly persuasive
novel of combat life in the Civil War that may well challenge
generations of middle-school readers, while Ann Turner's ``Drummer
Boy is an earnest but miscalculated attempt to address the horrors
of warfare in picture-book form.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen has written many successful books (``Hatchet,''
``Nightjohn,''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Island'') that explore the intersection of physical and
moral challenges. ``Soldier's Heart'' is a notable continuation
that traces the fate of a 15-year-old farm boy, Charley Goddard,
from his 1861 enlistment in a volunteer Minnesota regiment through
the discipline and boredom of camp life to the carnage of Bull Run
and Gettysburg. Goddard was a real person (his daguerreotype graces
the frontispiece), but Paulsen has worked up from archival sources
and a scholarly study of the regiment a composite fictional account
that draws its power from a perfectly pitched narrative voice and
authentic detail.
</P>
<P>
   The reader feels the young soldier's awe as he rides a plush
train toward the eastern front and understands his bewilderment as
he sees the first poor farms and subjected black people in the
South. The horrors of combat -- the noise, the fear, the drinking
from a creek stained pink with blood, the piling up of corpses to
make a windbreak for a field surgeon's operating theater --
gradually drive away all thoughts of nationalism or abolition and
force Charley to concentrate on the imperatives of survival.
</P>
<P>
   HE does, but his life is shattered by what we now call
post-traumatic stress disorder and what was then known as
``soldier's heart.'' In a brief epilogue (which might have profited
from more detail), Paulsen sketches the physical and mental anguish
that led to Goddard's death in 1868 at the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a novella just over 100 pages long, Paulsen has not only
rendered a historical epoch with documentary fidelity, but also
created a work that poses the hard questions of all combat
literature: What was it about? Was it worth it? Could I have done
it?
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of ``Drummer Boy,'' the historical experience of
40,000 youngsters in the Union Army cannot be conveyed to very
young readers. Ann Turner's towheaded farm boy is drawn into the
war after seeing Abraham Lincoln on his way to Washington and
brooding about the unfairness of slavery. He runs away, lies about
his age and becomes a drummer. He is appalled by the scenes of
combat, but ministers to the dying and learns that the beating of
his drum covers the sounds of battle and gives courage to the
soldiers. He feels useful, but promises that when he goes home he
will stop off to tell Mr. Lincoln ``how it's all his fault, how his
great sad eyes made me go and see things no boy should ever see.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner chooses her words carefully, but lightens her tale with
so much sentiment that it becomes trivial. Mark Hess's richly toned
paintings are filled with authentically detailed uniforms and
equipment, but in the manner of museum dioramas, they provide scant
character development.

CIRCLE DOGS
</HEADLINE>
  By Kevin Henkes 
 Illustrated by Dan Yaccarino 
 Unpaged. New York: Greenwillow Books. $15. (Ages 2 and up) 
 ------ 
 GRRRRR, GRRRRR, GRRRRR 
 By JAMES MCMULLAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been on juries at graphic art competitions where a book
as handsomely designed and as full of elegantly simplified pictures
as ``Circle Dogs'' would certainly have been given an award. Dan
Yaccarino has illustrated Kevin Henkes's story of a day in the life
of two dachshunds with daringly minimal evocations of the people
and things that constitute the dogs' world. Each page is a
beautifully composed arrangement of sleek shapes that float on a
field of creamy paper, and the dogs of the title have indeed been
turned into circles, their ears into triangles and their tongues
into little ``u'' shapes.
</P>
<P>
   This is sophisticated picture making, but big questions quickly
come to mind. Is the visual ingenuity of this book more appealing
to other designers and visually hip parents than it is to children?
Are kids really interested in dogs that have been reduced to a
level of hieroglyphic flatness? Or in dog tails that enter the
edges of a page as abstract scythe shapes? Does the simplicity of
the pictures give a child enough to look at and to find on the
repeated readings that the text is sure to elicit?
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Circle Dogs'' and references in the text to
geometric terms like ``big square house'' and ``triangle ears''
suggest that at one level the book operates as a find-the-shape
story, and this may have been the conceptual origin of Yaccarino's
style. Yet Henkes's words strike me as having a much richer
intention that that. His simple sentences and words describing
noises suggest everyday experiences in the life of a child, and the
onomatopoeia requires imagination on the part of a listener to hear
the noises described and to figure out what actual physical action
is taking place. This is a typical passage:
</P>
<P>
   Or for the mail to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Stomp, stomp,
</P>
<P>
   whoosh, whoosh,
</P>
<P>
   bam, stomp, stomp.
</P>
<P>
   Grrrrr, grrrrr, grrrrr.
</P>
<P>
   The game, of course, is to imagine the mailman walking across
the porch, putting the mail through the slot, the cover of the slot
banging shut, the letter carrier walking away and the dogs growling
at him through the door. This seems a different and more
appropriate challenge to a child's mind than the relatively adult
challenge of seeing the dog in the circle, or the circle in the
dog.
</P>
<P>
   Henkes's words suggest a real place better than Yaccarino's
abstracted universe does. When I read the story aloud, I imagined a
world in which there is an inside and an outside, a quirky door and
maybe even a quirky mailman. It is a world that might have been
evoked by the lush painterliness of one of Yaccarino's previous
books, ``Goodnight, Mr. Night,'' or by the zany characterizations
in Henkes's own illustrations for his wonderful ``Lilly's Purple
Plastic Purse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Circle Dogs'' is an evocative piece of writing that would be a
joy to read aloud to a child. I can imagine that after the third or
fourth reading a child would have learned some of Kevin Henkes's
wonderfully noisy words and would join in on the wooof, wooofs and
the arf, aarfs. As much as I appreciate the elegant patterning of
Dan Yaccarino's artwork, this is a text for which I imagine
different pictures.

IN SAM WE TRUST
</HEADLINE>
  The Untold Story of Sam Walton and How Wal-Mart Is Devouring
America 
 By Bob Ortega 
 413 pp. New York: Times Business/Random House. $25.95 
 ------ 
 ATTENTION, SHOPPERS 
 By JUDITH NEWMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thinking of buying this book? Chances are excellent you'll be
walking into a Barnes &AMP; Noble or Borders, two of the superstores
that are coming ever closer to obliterating independent
booksellers. And for that, says Bob Ortega, you must either thank
or curse Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton -- because it is Walton's
practices that are driving the trend toward Brobdingnagian chain
stores today. In his ambitious, exhaustive and sometimes exhausting
book, Ortega, a reporter who covers the retail industry for The
Wall Street Journal, asks us to consider a question fundamental to
the way America does business: How high is the cost of low cost?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Sam We Trust'' is really two books in one. Initially, it
comes off as an admiring biography of Sam Walton that tells the
story of his drive to become the biggest of the big among chains
like Sears and Kmart. Because neither Walton's family nor key
Wal-Mart executives would cooperate with the book, to tell this
story Ortega is forced to rely heavily on Vance Trimble's 1990
biography, ``Sam Walton: The Inside Story of America's Richest
Man,'' and on Walton's own 1992 autobiography, ``Made in America.''
Thus many of the credos and habits of the modest, down-to-earth and
``casually relentless'' Walton have already been well documented,
and so have the policies that made Wal-Mart the single largest
private employer in the United States today. In a nutshell: lowest
prices and highest product turnover equals biggest profit.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing rural America as the great unserved population, Walton
opened his stores in small towns where he faced minimum
competition, stole managers and useful ideas from his rivals and
cut deals on merchandise directly with manufacturers. Gentlemanly,
modest and notoriously chintzy -- he made his managers share hotel
rooms on business trips -- Walton was also a gifted leader. He was
one of the first retailers to institute a profit-sharing plan,
because he believed it was the only way to give every worker a
sense of having a stake in the business. (In an age of the paranoid
mogul, it is surprising to learn that Walton always kept a listed
phone number at home, so that even the lowest-level ``associates''
could have access to him.) Walton ``was to the faith of consumerism
what the Mahatma Gandhi was to nonviolence,'' Ortega writes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this treatise, Ortega is seemingly
breathless in his admiration of Walton's achievements. Of the
opening of the first Wal-Mart, he writes, ``As with many epochal
moments in business history, it was decades before the significance
of this date became clear.'' Indeed, how one feels about ``In Sam
We Trust'' depends in part on how inherently dramatic one finds the
rise of discount retailing in America. If the reader's heart beats
a little faster at the start of such paragraphs as ``Meanwhile,
back at the Searcy distribution center,'' then he's come to the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   But midway through the book, the tone and focus change. ``In Sam
We Trust '' becomes another work entirely: an indictment of the
greed and excesses of a company bent on profit, whatever the human
cost. However much he admired the man, Ortega seems to deplore the
business he created.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, an economist at Iowa State University published a study
showing what happened to the economies of small towns after the
opening of a Wal-Mart on the outskirts. It wasn't pretty.
Noncompeting businesses like restaurants and bars did not suffer,
but on average Wal-Mart siphoned off three-quarters of the sales of
competing businesses in town. When the study engendered plenty of
bad press, Walton countered with his own study: a team of
researchers at the University of Missouri were paid a piddling
$10,000 to look at 14 Wal-Marts in that state. To no one's
surprise, their findings concluded that far from being hurt by the
giant stores, the counties ``almost all showed growth or
revitalization after the opening of Wal-Mart.'' At any rate, the
war between Wal-Mart and Main Street was on.
</P>
<P>
   While seeds of discontent had been sown before Sam Walton's
death (in 1992, from bone cancer), his folksy image provided a
shield against public charges of rapaciousness. But once his
handpicked successor, David Glass, took over, the company got
involved in one public relations blunder after another. There was
the bad publicity over the company's selective enforcement of rules
on staff romances (mixed-race couples were punished, for example,
while a married Wal-Mart attorney who got involved with a file
clerk was not) and the debacle over Wal-Mart's ``Made in America''
program (despite its claims to the contrary, much of Wal-Mart's
merchandise was and is made overseas). Then there was Kathie Lee
Gifford, with whom the company had developed a line of clothing.
She became a lightning rod for criticism when union sympathizers
got out the word that her clothing was being produced by children
in Guatemala and sweatshop workers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega veers, not always successfully, between the many stories
he's trying to tell. He'll end a chapter with the promise of the
Kathie Lee Gifford saga, and won't return to it again for another
60 pages. And once he gets there, do we really need a many-paged
recitation of Kathie Lee's entire career history, right down to the
bit parts she used to play on the soap opera ``Days of Our Lives''?
Someone badly needed to take a weed whacker to this manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WALTON-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: manuscript.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, coming from a Wall Street Journal reporter, there's
something a bit overzealous, and perhaps naive, about Ortega's
conclusions. ``The history of the company,'' he writes, ``provides
ample evidence that Wal-Mart, like any corporation, is merely a
machine, an amoral construct with one imperative: the profit
motive. That pursuing that motive to the utmost may have a
corrosive effect on communities or individuals -- including people
within the corporation -- never enters into the equation.'' Duh.
Ortega ends with an exhortation to consumers to take control of
their shopping destinies. ``Whatever the issue -- buy American;
allowing independent monitors into factories; ending sweatshop
conditions and forced and child labor; treating its own workers
with dignity and respect; building stores that help rather than
hurt a town's sense of community -- Wal-Mart . . . will respond to
what the public demands from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortega is right. Unfortunately, what America demands is not
fairness or decency, but cheap goods and lots of 'em. It's called
capitalism.

  His Story 
 Written and illustrated by Tomie dePaola 
 Unpaged. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $16.99. (Ages 5 to 9) 
 ------ 
 A SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
 By PERRY NODELMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Strega Nona's Magic Lessons'' (1982), Tomie dePaola's witch
heroine tells her apprentices the secrets of her art: ``To learn
magic and practice it well . . . you must learn to see and not to
see. You must learn to remember and to forget; to be still and to
be busy. But mostly, you must be faithful to your work.'' These
words might be a description of dePaola's own magical art, as
practiced in the picture books about the witch and her terminally
inattentive assistant, Big Anthony, stories he has been producing
every now and then since ``Strega Nona'' in 1975. The latest, ``Big
Anthony: His Story,'' is as busy, as full of remembering and
forgetting, and of things seen and unseen, as its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The Strega Nona stories all take place in Italy, mostly in
Calabria, at some unspecified time in the past. Red-tiled roofs and
cobblestoned courtyards, happy feasts and joyful baptisms capture
traditional Italian life in authentic detail. But it is a time like
the ``once'' of fairy tales, more sunny and more cheerful, less
occupied with the existence of fleas or war or hunger, than any
time that ever actually existed.
</P>
<P>
   DePaola's illustrations confirm this precarious balance of
authenticity and nostalgia, remembering and forgetting, by seeing
things and not seeing them. With their solid blocks of warm color
surrounded by thick outlines anchoring objects to the page, their
minimal suggestions of eyes and smiles, their simplified shapes and
focus on repetitive patterns, these pictures represent an art so
decorative that it seems to aspire to be wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   What is magical is the energy the pictures manage to convey in
the midst of the decorative stasis. It's not just the bursts of
anarchy, the floods of pasta, bread dough, wart-infested townsfolk
or dance-crazed women produced by Big Anthony's short attention
span, but also the expressiveness of the few lines with which
dePaola captures his characters' gestures and emotions. These very
still pictures are surprisingly busy.
</P>
<P>
   They are also filled with details that make their apparent
simplicity richly informative. The magnetic attraction Strega
Nona's equally substantial chin and nose seem to have for each
other from the moment of her birth implies a sad, unspoken story
about why she remains unmarried and a witch throughout life.
Pictures of Strega Nona's chosen successor, the equally round,
equally unattached and equally chin-and-nose-endowed Bombalona, and
of Strega Nona's lifelong rival, the obviously vain and always
outrageously overdressed Strega Amelia, appear in a number of the
books and add complexity to the tales.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the running joke of Strega Nona's pet rabbit,
peacock and goat appearing through windows or on roofs at weirdly
appropriate moments that make them emblematic of the moral status
of the human characters in the foreground -- their peacocklike
pride or bunnylike inadequacy or goatlike stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel to ``Strega Nona: Her Story'' (1996), which told of
the witch's early years, this latest book tells of Big Anthony's
experiences before he came to work for Strega Nona. Longtime
readers won't be surprised to learn that Anthony's inattentiveness
was causing problems from the time of his baptism. But surprise is
never the point in this comfortably conservative world, whose
citizens thrive on habit and ritual. It's a world in which Strega
Nona's decision to leave college life in the big city for the
stability of home is not a retreat but a victory, in which Anthony
always messes things up, and Strega Nona always fixes them again,
and a witch's duties always involve the same problems of finding
young women husbands and getting rid of everyone's headaches and
warts.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the specific messes dePaola invents here for the
younger Anthony are ingenious opportunities for slapstick,
including run-ins with a great painter in Florence, a cardinal in
Rome and a leaning tower in Pisa. And, as usual, the hard edges of
the comedy nicely control and allow the sentiment that underpins
all these stories. Occasionally, as in the unnecessarily soppy
``Merry Christmas, Strega Nona'' (1986) or in the not-so secret
declaration in ``Strega Nona: Her Story'' that love is the
ingrediente segreto of all magic, the sentiment escapes its bounds.
But usually, as in this book, the softheartedness is seen and not
seen, remembered and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Anthony: His Story'' is enjoyable exactly because it is so
very much like its predecessors. Readers of all ages can be
grateful that dePaola remains so faithful to his work, and
continues to practice his magic so well.

 JUST SAY 'UH-OH' 
 By MARK OPPENHEIMER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm going to write a young-adult novel about drug abuse. It's
easy. I've read three and think I know how to do it: The narrator
must feel oppressed by parents either distant, alcoholic or both;
have a ``shrink,'' who does no good whatsoever; get turned on to
drugs unsuspectingly; run away from home; descend into prostitution
or dealing; and think and write in bad coffee-shop
stream-of-consciousness prose. Short, diary-entry chapters should
begin or end with references to countercultural artists (Lewis
Carroll, Jefferson Airplane, the Buzzcocks). At the end, a minor
character assumes the narration to report the death of our previous
narrator.
</P>
<P>
   So I could write such a book, but it would probably be just as
bad as these three. They all, more or less, use the formula. The
progenitor, ``Go Ask Alice,'' was published in 1971 as a ``real
diary'' about a good girl who is turned on to drugs by friends,
runs away, trades sex for fixes and dies. It is said to have sold
more than 4 million copies. Linda Glovach, since exposed as one of
the ``preparers'' -- let's call them forgers -- of ``Go Ask
Alice,'' has just written ``Beauty Queen,'' about a girl who flees
her alcoholic mother, becomes a stripper and dies of heroin
addiction. And Melvin Burgess's ``Smack,'' published in England as
``Junk,'' portrays a boy who flees his alcoholic parents, sees his
girlfriend turn to prostitution and becomes a heroin addict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go Ask Alice'' is the most palatable, because, while it is
poorly written and incredible, at least it is not derivative. The
book's writers, who also include the author and physician Beatrice
Sparks, have a tin ear for adolescent dialogue and a bad habit of
driving home political points by poking fun at their characters. On
July 9, the normal child Alice goes on her first acid trip. By
Sept. 6, she is complaining, ``I'm getting so that no matter what I
do I can't please the Establishment.'' By December, matters are
grimmer: ``I can't believe that soon it will have to be mother
against daughter and father against son to make the new world.''
Steal this book, she almost begs.
</P>
<P>
   Read more than a quarter-century later, the Vietnam-era themes
seem quaint, and they are laughably written. The ``Alice'' writers,
or editors, were delivering a cautionary tale: Fall in with the
wrong crowd and you will do drugs, turn against America and
dishonor your parents. Assuming the voice of a 15-year-old was a
rhetorical necessity, for teen-agers are not overwhelmed with
respect for their elders' advice.
</P>
<P>
   But such a narrative leap requires talent, strong talent. Some
adults can write first-person adolescents well (of current writers,
Tom Perrotta and Ron Carlson come to mind), but most will overreach
with their lingo, write with too much sophistication or too little,
or fall into anachronism. Yet the ``Alice'' writers faced a real
problem, one that Glovach and Burgess should be respected for
tackling. How can one write for young people about horrible things?
For lesser writers, that is where the formula enters. The young
people must not choose drugs -- drugs must befall them. In ``Beauty
Queen,'' Sam is literally recruited to heroin by Widow, ``this
biker chick who bartends'' at the strip club: ``I told her I think
I'm going to have to quit because I can't take my top off. She told
me she could fix that and next thing you know, she's tying the belt
around my arm.'' LSD comes to Alice when her Coca-Cola is spiked --
without her knowledge, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuspecting first time is a trope irresistible to writers
who wish to keep their characters sympathetic, and typical, despite
drug use. (It's how Brandon had his first taste of alcohol on
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' eight years ago.) In ``Smack,'' Burgess
uses a closely related device to keep Tar, the Dickensian runaway,
and his girlfriend, Gemma, in our good graces. They first try
heroin because they are pressured by Rob and Lily, two squatters
who take Tar and Gemma under their frayed wings. Failed by
biological parents, the runaways seek guidance from another kind.
And of course these books are either diaries or diaryesque, to make
the characters seem childlike and unaware of their slow
dissolution. These cliches are more problematic than they first
appear, for bad writing sacrifices any didactic power. A sheltered
12-year-old will recoil from these graphic dystopias; a
sophisticated one will laugh.
</P>
<P>
   It surely is possible to write a novel both realistic and
cautionary about drug abuse -- how could a good book about heroin
be otherwise? ``Smack'' comes closer than the other two to hitting
the mark, but is no more for children than the book and movie
``Trainspotting.'' I was baffled that it won the Carnegie Medal,
England's prestigious prize for young-adult fiction. The American
publisher, Henry Holt &AMP; Company, is also placing it in adult
sections, which makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think children should read about heroin addiction. But
if they must, it is a moral concern that the book be well written.
A good war movie makes you despise war, a terrible one makes you
grin, but a mediocre one might send you to the recruiting office.
Producing literature that keeps children from shooting up is
possible only if the writing is fresh and skillful, never trite.
These three failed attempts may not send children down the road to
addiction, but they won't have them wearing the path back to the
library, either.

THE RIVER WARREN
</HEADLINE>
  By Kent Meyers 
 271 pp. St. Paul: Hungry Mind Press. $21 
 ------ 
 THE LAST ROUNDUP 
 By JAMES POLK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The easygoing quiet of the Midwestern farming town of Cloten is
suddenly shattered when Two-Speed Crandall, at the wheel of a semi
filled with Leo Gruber's cattle, accelerates down a hill, threads
his way between two trees, sideswipes the mayor's new house,
destroys the facade of the bank, crashes through Angel Finn's
hardware store and plows head on into the barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   Two-Speed, his wife, LouAnn, and most of the animals are dead on
impact; the surviving cattle are so grievously wounded they must be
shot before being wrenched from the remains of the trailer. The
slaughter tears tranquillity from the town in much the same way the
semi tears the facing from all those buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing both from ``Our Town'' and ``Rashomon,'' Kent Meyers
uses his first novel to dissect Cloten and its citizens as they try
to make sense of the disaster. While they do, in a narrative
occasionally overweighted with symbolism (the realism turns magical
too often as a local river becomes prehistoric, filling with
prehistoric fish), he moves cleanly from the event itself to an
insightful inspection of local life and its discontents.
</P>
<P>
   Before anything else, Two-Speed's former neighbors share a deep
uneasiness about him. A magician at the wheel and a brute with a
cattle prod, he was also a drunk, a layabout and a schemer, as
disliked as he was feared by those who had dealings with him. But
even though he's no longer among them, none can seem to forget him,
however much they try. ``Why should someone who had no claim on us
when he was living,'' Leo Gruber's wife, Elizabeth, asks, ``come
into our lives now, when we have no way to make him leave.'' The
reason is that although everyone has an opinion about Two-Speed, no
one has any certainty about him.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Schuh, the gossip with a conscience (``It's not polite to
intrude on someone's strangeness''), thinks there's less to
Two-Speed than meets the eye. (``He never did much of anything
while making it look to everybody else like he did all sorts of
stuff.'') The retarded innocent, Pop Bottle Pete, mutilates himself
rather than confess what he thinks he shares with his friend
Two-Speed. The philosophical fisherman Angel Finn comes closest to
understanding the man's shallows: ``Knew him. Down to the bones.
Just, there was nothing there.'' All the citizens of Cloten have
glimpsed Two-Speed's edges; none appear to have got to his core.
</P>
<P>
   The only one who ever has is his son, Luke. Reflective, curious
and cynical, he recognized early on that ``Dad could always turn
what was into what wasn't, and what wasn't into what should have
been, and what should have been into some reason to get drunk.''
But even Luke didn't really figure out his father until their final
confrontation just before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although he theorizes that children want most of all to change
their parents, this son never imagined that the change he forced on
his father would turn out to be so conclusive. He never imagined
that uncovering Two-Speed's deepest, most closely held secret would
so unhinge him, so effectively strip away his father's veneer, that
he'd be forced to see himself clearly for the first time. And what
he saw was so disruptive of his carefully constructed self-image
that it ultimately sent him and his semi plunging down that hill.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative of ``The River Warren'' circles around the elusive
personality at its center, yet never quite reaches him -- because,
perhaps, Two-Speed's evasions make it impossible. As Luke
eventually realizes (and others suspect), the real truth of his
father's existence is written in lowercase.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a truth surrounded by mystery. And acknowledging
that mystery is the novel's central point: people are afraid of
what they can't understand, and even a man as totally without
substance as Two-Speed Crandall can dominate the thoughts, the most
primitive fears, of those who knew him. He dominates, in fact,
precisely because he is so empty.

 OPTICAL ALLUSIONS 
 By MOLLY E. RAUCH 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything that has ever been lost ends up somewhere _ at the
bottom of the elevator shaft, behind the radiator, beneath the
porch slats, down the drain of the municipal swimming pool. But
imagine that it all ends up in one place, a place where dust and
sludge are miraculously wiped away, where the chaff of material
culture is reunited with a function. And imagine that it organizes
itself, creeping out of its primordial chaos, the way Precambrian
proteins must have organized themselves into the first cells. Enter
Joan Steiner's book ``Look-Alikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The true identity of this land, the Universe of Stray Stuff,
dawns slowly. At first, Steiner's miniature sculptures look like
cluttered, cheerful doll-house scenes, depicting a train station,
circus, general store, harbor and so on, through which the reader
is led by a garishly cheerful redheaded boy made of clay.
</P>
<P>
   But notice the water tower: it is, in fact, constructed of a
flour sifter, a dollar bill, wooden cocktail forks, chopsticks, a
wire whisk, a rubber stamp handle, a needle and thread, and a
fishhook. And once the water tower is deciphered, there are
handcuffs and mouse traps and dice and lipsticks, and there is no
stopping the thrilling wooziness of Las Vegas-style
overstimulation. In a delirium of serial recognition, everything
begins to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner, who made each of the 11 dioramas from (literally)
hundreds of everyday objects, possesses a keen sense of
architectural design, heeding the strong lines of disposable razors
(she stands them back to back as columns) and attuned to the
modern, glinting appeal, on a building's facade, of a nutcracker.
She also has wired many of her look-alike structures (a newsstand,
a jukebox, a merry-go-round, an organ, a chandelier) so they are
realistically lighted from within, and these illuminations mimic
the electric bursts of realization that reward a reader's patience.
</P>
<P>
   The entire book is electrified. Steiner places a tiny bulb
inside the percolator button on the coffee pot that's doubling as a
train engine. It makes a perfect, intimidating headlight. Lights
also shine from the baby-bottle nipples (a k a light fixtures) in
the candy store. And the amusement park is dotted with what must be
hundreds of reflective stickers, lighted against an evening sky.
The bustling fair positively glows.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of the gingerbread house must have influenced
Steiner, that quaint, candy-studded esthetic is to her
``Look-Alikes'' land as Talbot's is to Gaultier. Dried apricots are
stool cushions in the diner, broccoli and kale are the trees in the
courtyard, a building facade is made of Melba toast, chocolate bars
are wood paneling in the swank hotel lobby, jelly beans fill the
ball jump at the amusement park, poppy seeds constitute the
playground's asphalt, and there are pretzels, candy corn, peanuts,
saltines, cheese rounds, pistachios, popcorn, potatoes, dog
biscuits, Fig Newtons, corn kernels, bubble gum, bouillon cubes,
cinnamon sticks, jars of jelly, flat-leaf parsley and black-eyed
peas.
</P>
<P>
   Those who cannot remember what that there thingamajig is called
will find relief in the back of the book, where each scene is
deconstructed, item by item, and every object tallied, so that the
true and proper name of a hair-perming rod, a suction-cup dart, a
potholder-weaving loom or an accordion-peg coat rack can never
again be doubted.
</P>
<P>
   But perusing those lists is not nearly as much fun as staring
into a ``Look-Alikes'' diorama, letting the familiar turn strange
and then back again. The objects that show up over and over _
toenail clippers, clothes hangers, egg slicers, pennies _ form
repeating patterns, like the rules of grammar in a foreign
language. Though the book's text adds little to the experience,
it's easy to ignore it in the face of Steiner's astounding
thoroughness, which has created a coherent, winking universe.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner's craft recalls the successful ``I Spy'' books, which
contain photographs of objects hidden in plain sight. The
photographer of those books, Walter Wick, is responsible for the
lively, dizzying swirl from which Steiner has clearly borrowed, but
he is busy with a different approach to visual acuity. His new
book, ``Walter Wick's Optical Tricks,'' is simple and streamlined,
depicting old-fashioned toys like marbles, wooden balls, toy
soldiers and clay.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the crisply photographed, primary-colored
wholesomeness, something about each of the 12 photographs
confounds. In one, a wooden cube and sphere float in space; in
another, a brightly lighted box casts no shadow. Where the ``I
Spy'' books are fundamentally matching games, this book raises
questions about how the mind works.
</P>
<P>
   Some images are ho-hum (like the toy fish endlessly reflected in
a series of mirrors, a trick many children already will have
discovered in their medicine-cabinet mirrors), but a good number
are disarmingly odd. These are the ones whose riddles hinge not on
special mirrors or fancy lighting but on the principles of visual
perception. Readers (more accurately, observers) will learn that
the brain makes assumptions, based on experience, as it sifts
through information about shadows, light, perspective and color. It
is this system of visual perception that causes impressions in clay
to appear to pop out of the clay when the book is turned upside
down, and it is also what causes a checkered cube to lose all
dimension when it sits on a similarly checkered floor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-LOOK-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: checkered floor) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an intellectual primer, ``Walter Wick's Optical Tricks'' is
stimulating, but as a picture book it is a one-shot deal. The
images themselves are not, for the most part, absorbing or
startling enough to warrant repeat visits. The text doesn't help,
because the illusions are laid bare and the thrill of discovery, so
delectable in Steiner's book, is tempered. Nevertheless, each image
is a reminder that left to its own devices the brain will follow a
well-worn path, even if the resulting perception is altogether
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In our visual culture, sheer appearance can sometimes seem to
dictate everything from popularity to self-esteem. While both
Walter Wick and Joan Steiner have created books that arise from the
culture of artifice, they both also ask the reader to look again.
They show that image is a slave to perception, because things are
not always what they seem.

  A Child of War 
 By Anita Lobel 
 Illustrated. 193 pp. New York: Greenwillow Books. $16. (Ages 10 and
up) 
 ------ 
 WHY ARE THE GROWN-UPS CRYING? 
 By HAZEL ROCHMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should children today read about the Holocaust? Won't it shock
and horrify them, give them nightmares, turn them off reading?
Exciting escape adventure is one thing, but what about the truth?
Will it help them to think about their own moral choices as
potential perpetrators, victims, bystanders? Will they connect that
genocide with other accounts of what racism can do, through history
and now? As more and more states mandate the teaching of the
Holocaust in schools, and as the number of children's books on the
subject has grown to a flood, these have become serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   The search for an upbeat, hopeful message is what lies behind
the longstanding controversy about ``Anne Frank: The Diary of a
Young Girl,'' a controversy that was revived last year. Because her
story has been sentimentalized and that famous sentence about
believing in spite of everything that people are good at heart has
been wrenched out of context and trumpeted on stage and everywhere
else as a message of healing and hope, there are many who say
children should not read the diary -- including Cynthia Ozick, who
wrote in a devastating article in The New Yorker that the diary
should have been destroyed. The argument is that if the diary is
the only book children today read about the Holocaust, they come
away with a distorted view of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That word ``only'' is the problem. Since the diary was first
published in 1947 it has sold more than 25 million copies in 50
languages. You shouldn't deprive young readers of a book that has
such enduring power to move them. But one book cannot do it all.
The answer is not to slam it or ban it, but to add to it from the
wealth of powerful Holocaust literature. Young readers find that it
is the personal accounts, like the diary, that are most moving.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Lobel's disturbing memoir, ``No Pretty Pictures: A Child
of War,'' a finalist for the National Book Award in young people's
literature, is neither sentimental nor exploitative. In fact, Lobel
is adamant that she will not ``sanctify'' herself with ``the pride
of victimhood.'' She is such a fervent New Yorker that it is hard
to believe that she learned English only when she immigrated to the
United States in 1952 at the age of 16. She is widely known for her
joyful, gorgeously colored illustrated books, including the
Caldecott Honor book ``On Market Street'' (1982), and for those she
did with her husband, the late Arnold Lobel. Her pictures give no
hint of her dark, terrifying childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 5 years old when the Nazis came to her comfortable home
in Poland, she spent the next five and a half years in hiding and
on the run, from the ghetto to the countryside to a Benedictine
convent. Her younger brother was always with her, disguised as a
girl to hide his circumcision. Their grown-up protector was their
Roman Catholic nanny, Niania, who pretended to be their mother.
Then the convent was raided and their Jewishness was revealed. The
children were in lineups, marches, transports in trucks and boxcars
to the camps -- first Plaszow, then Auschwitz, then Ravensbruck,
places of hunger, mud, stench, corpses, chimneys. After the war
Lobel spent two blissful years recovering from tuberculosis, nursed
by kind caregivers in a Swedish sanitarium. She learned Swedish and
went to school in Sweden for the first time when she was 12. She
never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Those who expect one book to tell the whole Holocaust history
will not be satisfied. There is no commentary, no context. In fact,
the integrity of the storytelling is in the narrowness of the
child's viewpoint, the physical immediacy, the bewilderment. The
truth is that nothing makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Why are grown-ups crying? Where is her father? What does
``deported'' mean? She is afraid to ask. She is ashamed to be
Jewish. She hates her ``sadly Semitic'' appearance when she is in
hiding and even after the war, when she is the dark one among all
the blond Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no heroics. Lobel is not aware of her courage. She
takes it for granted that she and her younger brother are one
individual. When she finds a raw potato in the mud, he and she
alternate taking bites out of it. She devotes just part of a
sentence to the selections at Ravensbruck, when she dragged him to
the left, away from the chimneys. And his disguise is no big deal;
there's no drama about it until the Nazis raid the convent and make
him pull his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   There's a phys-cal quality to Lobel's memories of the terror.
(``The whispers of the trapped grown-ups sounded like the noise of
insects rubbing their legs together.'') The deprivation is
visceral. (``Feverish, always crouching, diarrhea dripping from my
behind, I dreamed of a day I could sleep in a soft bed with clean
sheets and sit on a toilet that flushed in a lavatory that had a
door that closed.'') Fear is stifled by wave upon wave of hunger.
It is just she and her brother; they are reduced to nothing but two
hungry, itching lumps. All they want is not to be noticed, not to
be singled out. She mourns the loss of her braids when her head is
shaved, but otherwise she barely mourns the loss of anything. She
does not think about her parents. Only Niania.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-PICTURES-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Only Niania.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When she is safe, she celebrates: ``I had no lice in my stubby
hair anymore, no lice in the seams of my pajamas''; she cannot take
for granted the ``fat, slithering, luxurious sweetness'' of butter.
There is no heartfelt family reunion, just as there is no nostalgia
for a pre-Nazi Eden. When her father first writes to her in Sweden,
his words are flowery, as if he is learning to be a father again
after seven years of not having children. In contrast, she is cold,
shut off: ``I had almost forgotten that yes, there would be a
mother and a father. Yes. They had been found. From the other side
of the Baltic I had had letters. Yes. I had written to them. Yes,
of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with her mother has always been distant. When
they meet again after the war, her mother nags her to cut her hair.
``Didn't she know about the shaved heads in concentration camps?''
the child rages. Niania is the one the child loves. That Niania is
sometimes anti-Semitic, not always nice, does not matter. She is
the grown-up who raised and nurtured and sheltered the children.
Lobel misses Niania in the camps, and always.
</P>
<P>
   The memory is raw. The storytelling frames it. The message is
that there is no meaning in this suffering. And yet, if luck was
the most important factor in Anita Lobel's survival, so also was
the humanity of a Catholic woman who mistrusted Jews yet protected
the sister and brother ``with the flapping wings of a demented
angel.''

THIS NEW OCEAN
</HEADLINE>
  The Story of the First Space Age 
 By William E. Burrows 
 Illustrated. 723 pp. New York: Random House. $34.95. 
 ------ 
 WE HAVE LIFTOFF 
 By ALEX ROLAND 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does it mean that humans have walked on the moon, that our
machines have flown out of the solar system, that instruments of
war operate beyond the earth's atmosphere? In the heady aftermath
of the first manned moon landing, the historian Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. opined that future generations would see Apollo as the signal
event of this century. Carl Sagan, in his television series
``Cosmos,'' reckoned that if humanity did not blow itself up, the
great achievements of our era would prove to be survival itself and
the beginning of our journey to the stars. Throughout the 1970s,
the proverbial man in the street asked, ``If we can send a man to
the moon, why can't we ... (fill in the blank)?''
</P>
<P>
   William E. Burrows takes up the question in ``The New Ocean,'' a
narrative history of space flight. He defines ``the first space
age'' as running from the first sputnik in 1957 to somewhere
between the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and
the end of the Cold War in 1991. In hindsight, he attempts to
discern what that era meant and foresee where it is heading.
</P>
<P>
   His history breaks no new ground. He focuses primarily on the
United States, with due attention to Germany in World War II and
the Soviet Union in the cold war. The drama opens with the
obligatory homage to the holy trinity of space flight: the Russian
theorist and visionary Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, the American
rocket experimenter Robert H. Goddard and the German scientist
Hermann Oberth. Thereafter, the usual suspects appear in order.
Wernher von Braun receives all the attention he deserves, and scant
apology for his membership in the Nazi Party and the SS. His
Russian counterpart, Sergei P. Korolev, wins comparable
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, less familiar characters also find a place in
Burrows's story. Nikolai Fyodorov, Tsiolkovsky's librarian,
inspired his client with mystic notions of the unity of nature and
the universality of life. Robert Welch, the founder of the John
Birch Society, argued that sputnik was designed to trick America
into a ruinously expensive space program, a view that was not far
removed from that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Nicholas
Johnson, ``the Hercule Poirot of Soviet space-program analysts,''
had ``a lot of fun'' trying to discern the capabilities of the
Soviet antisatellite program. Michael A. Minovitch, a doctoral
student in mathematics and physics, spent a summer internship at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developing a theory of ``gravity
propulsion'' that revolutionized deep space exploration, an
achievement for which Burrows believes Minovitch was robbed of
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging narrative is not, however, Burrows's greatest
achievement. ``This New Ocean'' is most distinguished by the
successful integration of three different story lines: manned space
flight, the militarization of space and space science. Burrows, a
professor of journalism at New York University, holds uncommon
credentials for such an undertaking. He has previously written
books on satellite reconnaissance and space science. His
familiarity with the secret and arcane minutiae of these subjects
enlivens and enriches the more familiar story of manned space
flight. He juxtaposes developments in the three areas, often
showing how advances in one shaped seemingly unrelated events in
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known, for example, that NASA's space shuttle takes
some of its characteristics from the insistence by the Air Force
that it carry spy satellites. Less well known is what the scientist
James Van Allen called the ``slaughter of the innocent,'' the
transfusion of space science funding to replace the money
hemorrhaging from the shuttle program in the 80's. Though
chronology remains the organizing principle of the book, Burrows's
attempt at integrating three topical threads makes his the most
successful general survey of space history yet to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book has curious omissions. Countries other than the
United States, the Soviet Union and Germany receive scant
attention. Communications satellites, the only commercial success
in space and arguably the space activity that has most transformed
modern life, are barely mentioned. Still less is said about the
so-called ``applications'' satellites for weather, earth resources,
pollution monitoring and mapping. James E. Webb, the managerial
genius who led NASA through most of the Apollo program, acts in
this book but does not think.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest weakness of the book, however, is the failure to
instill meaning into the richly integrated tapestry Burrows has
woven. Rather, the reader is left with a thick description from
which any number of interpretations might be drawn. Burrows implies
some meaning by his periodization, measuring the first space age
from sputnik to the end of the cold war. But exactly what does that
mean? What unifying theme operates within this epoch? I have
likened it to the barnstorming era of atmospheric flight, when
humans flew mostly for the exhilaration of the achievement, before
they found practical applications in war and commerce. But Burrows
ventures no such judgment.
</P>
<P>
   One interpretation implied by his periodization of events is
that Daniel S. Goldin, NASA administrator since 1992, has
introduced a new era in space activity. Goldin has won deserved
praise and credibility for shaking up the agency and imposing his
mantra of ``better, faster, cheaper'' on an ossified bureaucracy.
But, as Burrows' account makes clear, Goldin is simply pursuing the
old agenda more efficiently. His program offers no hint that the
second space age will be different from the first. Sending John
Glenn on a nostalgia cruise suggests how wedded to the past NASA
is.
</P>
<P>
   What does loom, then, on Burrows's space horizon? He raises
tourism, mining and manned missions to Mars, only to knock them
down as currently impractical. Approvingly he presents a proposal
by the physicist Freeman Dyson for ``Astrochickens'' _ small,
self-replicating, exploratory spacecraft combining ``21st-century
genetic engineering, advanced artificial intelligence and solar
electric propulsion.'' These craft also want development, but at
least they conjure an imagined future that is truly original,
rather than a tired repackaging of the first space age. While that
future takes shape, Burrows's work helps to define where we have
been.

 TO EVERY THING THERE IS A SEASON 
 Verses From Ecclesiastes 
 Illustrated by Leo Dillon and Diane Dillon 
 Unpaged. New York: The Blue Sky Press/Scholastic. $15.95.(All
ages) 
 ------ 
 TURN! TURN! TURN! 
 By VALERIE SAYERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even Bible illiterates recognize many lines from Ecclesiastes:
``Vanity of vanities,'' ``The sun also rises,'' ``Cast thy bread
upon the waters'' _ and especially ``To every thing there is a
season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.'' Many of us
cannot hear that last line without mentally humming the musical
version by Pete Seeger, ``Turn! Turn! Turn!,'' which the Byrds made
famous with their recording in the mid-1960's.
</P>
<P>
   Two new books illustrate, to very different effect, those
resonant verses from Chapter 3 of Ecclesiastes. The lines employ
simple rhythms to affirm the balance of life's cycles: planting and
harvesting, gathering and releasing, grieving and celebrating. Bob
Barner's ``To Everything'' aims to capture this simplicity in an
effusive celebration, while Leo and Diane Dillon's ``To Every Thing
There Is a Season'' is a more subdued yet ornate exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Everything'' renders the natural world in lush colors.
Barner's medium is collage, paper torn by hand and glued; his
subjects include monkeys, lions, dolphins, sun, moon and stars. The
effect is vivid and cheery and may be especially pleasing to very
young children. The illustrations, however, highlight Ecclesiastes'
celebratory moments at the expense of the hard times on which the
text also insists. Barner illustrates ``a time to cry'' with one
monkey watching four others scamper about. ``A time to mourn, a
time to dance'' shows hummingbirds flittering to and from a flower,
no mourners among them as far as I can see. ``A time for war, a
time for peace'' is represented by a dove rising above barbed wire,
but the wire, I am sorry to say, is a confusing touch, since it
curls up as prettily as everything else in the illustration.
</P>
<P>
   Adults reading this book to children will have a lot of
explaining to do, and the book provides, in an afterword, many
suggestions for busy discussion. Talking about the pictures is not
a bad thing, but in the case of these rich, straightforward lines,
the verbal balance deserves a visual match.
</P>
<P>
   Leo and Diane Dillon, who have used many styles and techniques
in their often prize-winning books for children, use a much more
elaborate, and indeed a more balanced, approach. They illustrate
each verse in a different historical and cultural style: ``A time
to kill, and a time to heal,'' for instance, is patterned on a
seventh-century Mexican Mixtec screen-fold picture book, and
depicts in one panel a human sacrifice, in the other a healing. ``A
time to keep, and a time to cast away'' is in the mode of ancient
Chinese silk painting. A family painted in graceful strokes and
delicate colors gathers fish into their boat on one page, returns
them to the sea on the page opposite. My favorite panels _ ``A time
to rend, and a time to sew'' _ are acrylic paintings in the style
of medieval Russian iconography. The Dillons' understanding of the
lines is completely and appropriately literal: tailors tear cloth
in one panel, sew it up in the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Dillons provide a useful description of each challenging
illustration and its implications. They also provide a rationale
for their method: ``The timeless words from Ecclesiastes,'' they
write, ``remind us that there are things in life that all people
share, regardless of our diverse beliefs and cultures.'' The only
problem with this approach _ using all of human history, culture
and art for inspiration _ is that it creates an almost random set
of visual responses to what is a tightly unified set of verses.
</P>
<P>
   Each illustration is lovely, apt, sometimes even dazzling, but
the book's hurtling back and forth through times and artistic
styles disrupts the rhythms of Ecclesiastes. It's my guess that
respect for difference could have been much more eloquently
conveyed by concentrating on any one of these styles rather than
giving a nod to all of them (and thereby leaving out plenty of
other possible cultural approaches). The particular is often the
best illustration of what is common to common experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ecclesiastes is a book of seeking, one that moves between
cynicism and acceptance, worldliness and spirituality, anxiety and
serenity. Chapter 3 contains some of its most centered lines, but
the surrounding chapters suggest an underlying plaintive quality.
Though neither of these books captures that tension to my taste,
both honor Ecclesiastes' acknowledgment of the polarities of life
on earth, and both provide their own visual riches.

SCIENCE FICTION
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALD JONAS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a tough job, but someone has to do it: bring the
crime-and-thriller genre known as ``noir'' into the 21st century.
Fortunately, K. W. Jeter is up to the task, and in NOIR (Spectra/
Bantam, $23.95) he lays out the future with a cheerless tenacity
Raymond Chandler might have applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The setting, of course, is Los Angeles _ a city now metastasized
into an endless urban sprawl that has devoured most of the Pacific
Rim. The protagonist is a lone wolf named McNihil. He's a former
operative for the Collection Agency, an organization that has
evolved to protect intellectual property rights in an era of
instant communication and traceless reproduction, all made possible
by Internet technology. One of his clients, a writer whose work has
been pirated, describes noir as ``a literature of anxiety'' that
remains current because it accepts the certainty of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   If you think McNihil's work is limited to computerized snooping
on unscrupulous hackers, think again. The on-the-spot justice he
delivers to software pirates is technologically inventive but
primally brutal. Spelled out in excruciating detail, it will test
the resolve of readers who wonder why they're rooting for McNihil
against the forces of corporate evil, personified by a
``silver-haired'' executive named Harrisch. Not to worry.
Harrisch's scheme to bring capitalism to its logical conclusion _
in which the controllers of production gain ``a stranglehold on the
human brain'' _ is horrific enough to make McNihil's freelance
viciousness look sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter understands that noir as a genre is defined more by style
than by content. He also understands that science fiction, as
Ursula K. Le Guin has pointed out, gives writers the option of
freshening up tired figures of speech by making them concrete. Thus
a rival operative called November observes that ``the dead were
always a good source of information. It was their business'' _ even
as she is in the process of interviewing a dead woman. One of the
novel's conceits is that people who die owing lots of money can be
kept in a quasi-living state by their creditors until they make
good on their debts. Other than the marketable discards they
salvage from garbage dumps, the so-called ``indeadted'' have
nothing to sell but shreds of random gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Jeter's inventions are so apt. McNihil has had his
brain altered so he views the world around him in black-and-white
images that mimic the grainy detective movies of the 1930's and
40's. Aside from the inherent improbability of a street-smart
shamus doing something to his nervous system that interferes with
his perception of reality, this cumbersome device quickly grows
tedious; even the author seems to lose interest in it as the plot
heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Jeter's attempts to anticipate the hard-boiled slang of
the next century _ ``Connect you, mother-connector,'' McNihil
snarls at one point _ provoke the kind of titter that threatens to
destroy the noir spell. But in general Jeter accomplishes his goal
of updating the genre, and he does so with commendable energy and
imagination. If the results are irremediably nasty, McNihil for one
would not be surprised. ``All writers were mean bastards,'' he
notes, adding with italicized approval: ``Must come with the
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In THIS ALIEN SHORE (DAW, $23.95), C. S. Friedman borrows some
big ideas from writers like Cordwainer Smith, Frank Herbert and
Samuel R. Delany, and runs with them. Instead of stumbling under
the burden, she succeeds in making the recycled material her own.
</P>
<P>
   Millenniums ago, the invention of a spaceship drive that was
capable of faster-than-light speeds prompted a wave of emigration
from an overcrowded Earth. The emigrants had barely begun the hard
work of colonizing distant planets when it was discovered that
exposure to the drive played havoc with human DNA. Fearful of
genetic contamination, the authorities on Earth severed all ties
with its colonies. Now the home planet and its much-altered
children have re-established contact, and everyone is jockeying for
control of the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of the new society is that you have to be crazy
_ literally _ to attempt faster-than-light travel. It takes a
special kind of madness, controlled and channeled by specially
tailored drugs, to guide a ship through the spatial short cuts
known as ainniqs. Not surprisingly, a Guild of ``outpilots'' holds
a monopoly on such journeys. With all passengers ``chilled'' in
suspended animation or under heavy sedation, the outpilot fights to
outwit the deadly ``dragons'' that inhabit the other-dimensional
network of ainniqs.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds complicated, it is. And I have yet to mention
the novel's central character, a young girl named Jamisia, who is
plagued by voices in her head. Jamisia is a mystery even to
herself, a wild card in the game of galactic intrigue. Her slow and
painful process of self-discovery tethers the far-ranging plot to a
recognizably human predicament, even as rival groups of
conspirators seek to exploit her maturing powers.
</P>
<P>
   In interweaving the many threads of her narrative, Friedman has
created a potent metaphor for the toleration of diversity _ an
ever-evolving society where ``the genes of wild genius'' are
acknowledged as necessary for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen F. McHugh's MISSION CHILD (Eos/Avon, $20) is not at all
flashy. The story, which follows the coming of age of an orphan
named Janna on a ramshackle colony planet, is full of violent
incident. But in her first-person narration Janna never raises her
voice. The murder of her family, the three gifts she receives from
a dying ``offworlder,'' her decision to pose as a young boy, her
apprenticeship to a shaman, her encounter with the plague are all
treated in a matter-of-fact manner that encourages the reader to
accept everything that happens as natural, commonplace, mundane _
just the way Janna herself does.
</P>
<P>
   As in her earlier novel ``China Mountain Zhang,'' McHugh writes
science fiction from the inside out, with the focus on character.
After a while the reader forgets the extraterrestrial setting and
the fairy-tale devices, concentrating instead on Janna's struggles
to find a purpose in her life. The quiet ending is both unexpected
and an inevitable outgrowth of what has come before.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When F. Scott Fitzgerald told the story of young Amory Blaine at
Princeton University in ``This Side of Paradise,'' he wrote of
``the silent stretches of green, the quiet halls with an occasional
late-burning scholastic light.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same halls are still on the Princeton campus, but
today the tenderness of the night is often shattered by shrill
beeps and a klaxon-like speaker screaming in a robotic voice,
``Please close the door securely.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University, like many other institutions of higher
education, worries about protecting its students. And one way to
protect those students, when you have 4,600 of them, is with an
electronic security system. But when most of those students are
older than 18, the question is: Do they want to be protected?
</P>
<P>
   In the early 90s, Princeton began equipping all dormitories and
other buildings with automatic locks and a system for unlocking the
doors built around slim plastic cards called proximity cards, or
prox cards, one issued to each student.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Princeton increased the level of security by keeping
all dormitories locked all the time, instead of just between 9 p.m.
and 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The change has generated a campus debate over whether students
want to trade the inconvenience and what many perceive as a loss of
privacy for the increased security provided by keeping the
dormitories locked all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy question arises because not only does the security
system read the prox cards to open doors, it also records all card
usage so there is a computer database of students' entries into
campus buildings.
</P>
<P>
   To get into a dormitory, a student places a prox card _ which
doubles as an identification card, library card and charge card for
the university store and dining halls _ near a black plastic box
encasing a tiny transceiver. (The card is called a proximity card
because it just needs to be near the box; it is not inserted into
anything.)
</P>
<P>
   After the card is read, the door is opened, and a record of the
entry is transmitted to the campus police office. Such electronic
records are saved for three weeks before they are written over.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton is not alone in adopting electronic security; a number
of other colleges and universities have similar systems. For the
safety of their students, universities often decide that campuses
cannot be as freewheeling about physical movement as they are about
the exchange of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University uses an electronic pass system similar to
Princeton's and also keeps a record. Cynthia Atwood, a Yale
spokeswoman, said: ``We do have the capability of tracking
individuals and their comings and goings from the residential
college, but since we've installed this card system, we've had no
complaints about privacy. We've not been asked by any authorities
for records of the comings or goings of students.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Doheny, a spokesman for Motorola, which makes electronic
security cards for Princeton and others _ it calls them RF cards,
for radio frequency _ said the company ``had provided several
million RF ID cards over the past year for various applications for
businesses and campuses.'' He did not have figures for how many
were being used for campus security systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the increases in campus security have generated some
opposition on the Princeton campus. Both The Nassau Weekly, a
student newspaper, and The Princeton Alumni Weekly have reported
objections and attempts to foil the system.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Harvey A. Silverglate, who graduated from
Princeton in 1964, doubt whether security systems that keep records
of students' movements are appropriate for campuses. Silverglate is
one of the two authors of ``The Shadow University: the Betrayal of
Liberty on America's Campuses'' (Free Press, 1998), which argues
that speech codes and authoritarian impulses are making campuses
today too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the new security system at Princeton, Silverglate
called it ``just another example of overreaching and overbearing
administrators who insist on controlling student life.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hurley, the director of the Harvard Information
Infrastructure Project, which addresses policy issues involving
information technology, said: ``There are two issues from a privacy
point of view: One is proportionality and the second is the locus
of control. Is the personal data collected proportional to the risk
of harm? I think the answer is no. It's not only an individual's
privacy _ it's freedom of movement and freedom of associations.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``In this case, Princeton is gathering reams of data
about all of its students, and the students are the appropriate
ones to have control and ownership of that data.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurley said she had been distressed to discover that her own
university maintained a record of when she entered and left her
parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton's students have been making their opinions known. A
poll was taken in the last school year about the plan to keep the
dormitories locked all the time _ known as `'24-hour prox'' _ said
Jeff Siegel, a former student body president who is now a trustee
of the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent of the males and only 60 percent of the women
didn't want the 24-hour prox,'' Siegel said. ``The 40 percent of
the women, however, were very adamant.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the arguments for keeping the system active all the time
at the dormitories can be summarized as anticipating ``what if''
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Spies, vice president for finance and administration at
Princeton, said: ``We just began to worry about what were still by
anyone's standards a small number of incidents. But there were
people who werein the dormitories who shouldn't have been there.
We don't want to wake up one morning and find we had a very tragic
incident that we could have prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime statistics reported by the university show 33 burglaries
on campus in 1995, 43 in 1996 and 42 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the new system has led to a new policy governing
when information gathered by the prox card system can be used.
Barry Weiser, a crime-prevention specialist at Princeton, said an
investigating officer who wanted such access must get approval from
both the dean of student life and the head of campus security.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser said the records had been opened only once in the last
six months or so, when the city police subpoenaed the records for
one door in a case involving vandalism. The dean of student life
and the head of security initially rejected the impulse to make the
data available.

 LITTLE ENGINES THAT COULD 
 By ROBIN TZANNES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Railroads hold a special fascination for adults and children
alike. The sweep and change of scenery, the excitement of going
someplace new and the speed and sway of the train itself combine to
make rail travel wonderfully satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Window Music,'' by Anastasia Suen, illustrated by Wade
Zahares, and ``Slow Train to Oxmox,'' by Kurt Cyrus, are both train
stories with beautiful pictures. But while ``Slow Train to Oxmox''
uses the train merely as a device to teach a lesson, ``Window
Music'' is all about the experience of riding on a train.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``window music'' is 1880's railroad slang for passing
scenery, and it is on this scenery that Suen concentrates.
Beginning and ending with ``Train on the track, clickety clack,''
the book strings together easy rhymes that toddlers will love to
hear over and over. The train goes up mountains and down valleys,
passing streets and cars, fields and horses, orchards and ocean.
Finally, we come to the city, and ``into the station, our
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   In illustrating ``Window Music,'' Wade Zahares has used a rich,
earthy palette with brilliant white accents. His drawings are full
of life and will have strong appeal for children. It is mildly
disappointing, however, that given the book's evocative title,
Zahares has disregarded its meaning. Instead of using the train
window as a constant frame for the ever-changing view, he has shown
the journey from the outside; only a few pictures show the
perspective of a passenger looking out the window. However,
Zahares's gorgeous drawings more than compensate for this minor
discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to illustrating the verse, Zahares has created a
lovely story line independent of the text, telling us in pictures
about a little girl returning home after a visit to her
grandparents. The title page just hints at another interpretation:
we see the little girl asleep by an open window, a train climbing a
hill in the distance. Could her entire journey, then, have been
just a dream, evoked by another sort of ``window music,'' the sound
of the train passing by her window at night?
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow Train to Oxmox'' is a different kind of train book, for
slightly older children. Again, the drawings are very fine. Done in
a style reminiscent of Thomas Hart Benton's, they are full of wit
and clever detail. Unfortunately, Kurt Cyrus is a better
illustrator than storyteller. While the tale is well written, the
plot is convoluted and illogical.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts out promisingly enough. Edwin Blink, a busy,
self-important man with a first-class ticket on the Oxmox Express,
finds himself by mistake on the Slow Train. Now you might expect
the story to unfold around the joys of taking one's time, enjoying
the ride, seeing the things you miss if you're always in a hurry.
But no. Oddly enough, this book turns out to be about cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Train is full of strange characters, including a
rooster and a horse. Most of the humans aboard appear to be poor or
elderly; all are unconcerned about being on the inferior train. The
Slow Train begins a long, roundabout route full of obstacles, which
can't be overcome without the passengers' help. When the train
stops for geese, the passengers get out and lift the tracks so the
flock can cross beneath them. When it gets stuck in mud, the
passengers have to push. When the train falls into a creek, we
discover that Edwin is a mechanical engineer who can make bridges
out of rope. Edwin, who'd been in such a hurry before, is now happy
on the slow train, because he is able to help. And the train
rattles on.
</P>
<P>
   This book is unsatisfying for several reasons. For one thing, we
never actually see the train reach Oxmox. Even worse, this train
doesn't behave anything like a train. Trains are massive, powerful
machines, and should not be pushed, twisted and pulled around by
passengers. There is no explanation for why it takes such a
circuitous, difficult route, or why the passengers put up with it.
Are they really trying to get somewhere, or do they take this
arduous journey simply because they like to cooperate?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cyrus is a talented illustrator, and his drawings alone
make this book worthwhile. Young readers may even enjoy the story,
not caring that it doesn't make sense. But if you're looking to
share an old-fashioned train book with your favorite 3-year-old,
take a look at ``Window Music.''

 'PICTURES GREAT,' HIS PUBLISHER TOLD HIM 
 By ADAM GOPNIK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the 18th and 19th centuries, an American artist who
could make painted things look like real ones was regarded as a man
with something up his sleeve. Sargent, Whistler, even Church all
had a touch of the gentleman magician about them, the black cape
and top hat. Eakins claimed the mysterious authority of the
scientist, wrapping his obsessions in the solemn objectivity of
investigation, while lesser lights, like the trompe l'oeil painters
John Frederick Peto and William Michael Harnett, cultivated the sly
charm of the sleight-of-hand man. It was only with the coming of
the 20th century, and the widespread arrival of instant illusion in
the form of photography, that a new aura of honest craft and
stubborn integrity began to cling to the image of the American
realist. The painter of reassuringly recognizable objects had by
now become himself a reassuringly recognizable object _ not fluid
as mercury but solid as rock, a repository of deep, melancholy
truths.
</P>
<P>
   No American family has both suffered from and exploited this
transformation more than the Wyeths of Chadds Ford, Pa. David
Michaelis's book is the first biography of the patriarch of that
family, the illustrator and painter N. C Wyeth. It is a full-scale,
many-voiced, deeply researched study _ somewhat overproduced, one
might think, for a figure whose best-known accomplishments are
illustrating ``Robin Hood'' and fathering Andrew. Yet the author's
confidence in his subject in the end seems fairly won: N. C.'s
accomplishments turn out to be larger than one might have imagined
_ he is the Wyeth who counts _ and his life is larger than his
accomplishments. The Wyeths themselves, the art-obsessed clan who
were his invention, emerge as both more likable and more Gothic
than one had expected: half Pennsylvania Bruegels, half the Addams
Family.
</P>
<P>
   Newell Convers Wyeth was born in Needham, Mass., in 1882.
Despite the all-American name, he was descended, on his mother's
side, from a Swiss-American family, the Zirngiebels. Dominated
throughout his life by his neurotic mother, Hattie, he took her
identity as his own. N. C. _ his family called him Convers _ was a
mama's boy to end all mama's boys. When, at 22, he announced,
tentatively, that he might get married, Hattie had his picture
taken down from the family mantelpiece and replaced it with (as she
explained) ``Your large baby picture. I felt I must get you back in
that form.'' He never rebelled against this mother-love, and
eventually cajoled his wife too into his mother's orbit, keeping
her pregnant and stifled. Although the family valued truth in small
things, it was also the kind of family that could ignore monsters
sitting in the living room. In what is still the Wyeth house style,
the weirdly cryptic sits right alongside the excessively
plain-spoken.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping out of high school, N. C. became the star pupil
of Howard Pyle, the greatest illustrator of the late 19th century.
With Pyle as mentor, he produced a Saturday Evening Post cover (a
cowboy and bucking bronco illustrating Emerson Hough's ``Law at
Heart's Desire'') when he was only 21, and the next year, 1904, he
broke into the even classier Scribner's Magazine with ``The Moose
Call,'' a sepia-toned oil of an Indian hunter in a canoe.
</P>
<P>
   For all his success, N. C was moving into a dying form.
Illustration, which had been an important form of American
reporting and commentary throughout the 19th century _ a genre
strong enough to support the early Winslow Homer and impress van
Gogh _ had given way to the camera, and would soon be able to
support only ``illustration'' in the modern sense: pictures to
dress up a story. N. C. was, as Michaelis says, ``caste
conscious,'' but it is also fair to say that he had an art
conscience, or got one, along with everyone else around that time.
In 1908, after even more commercial success as a cowpunching
illustrator of westerns, he retreated into a house on a hill
overlooking Chadds Ford and announced that ``painting and
illustration cannot be mixed _ one cannot merge from one into the
other.'' But he couldn't go ``modern,'' either. He hated the
contemporary world, though his rage, oddly, was directed less at
photography, which was so obviously devastating his niche, as at
the automobile, a ``vibrating machine'' that would leave people
with nothing more than ``fleeting recollections of fantastic
blurred objects'' _ not a bad summation of the advanced painting
that would soon rise up in Paris and New York and leave him
stranded.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of years he did dutiful landscapes of the
Pennsylvania scenery, dull as a toothache. He also took to reading
Thoreau, whom he called his ``worshiped friend.'' As Michaelis
writes shrewdly, ``The restless me-first individualism of the
American West was supplanted by the rigid me-myself iconoclasm of
Walden Pond.'' What to do? Like E. B. White _ another Thoreau lover
who fled the city to do more lasting work _ Wyeth found what he
needed in children's books. In 1911, Scribners asked him to do a
series of illustrations for ``Treasure Island,'' Stevenson's 1883
classic. Quickly, Wyeth painted 17 full-scale canvases _ the best
things he had ever done. The conventional thing to say about his
book illustrations is that Wyeth made such pictures more dramatic
than his predecessors had done. But in fact his genius lay in
making his pictures much less dramatic than pictures like this had
ever been before _ his gift was for slowing down and sobering up
book illustration so that it took on some of the gravity that had
in the past belonged only to high art. In his ``Treasure Island''
illustrations, there is a constant, spell-inducing tension between
the boys'-book excitements _ the cutlasses and shining swords and
pistols _ and the careful, sober, exact rendition of rigging and
wooden surfaces and late-afternoon shadows. (No one ever used long
shadows more expressively than Wyeth; he turned ``American'' light
into late afternoon light, as it remains to this day.) He called
his technique, poetically, ``sight seen,'' meaning that it was all
seen from the point of view of a single observer, so that the
viewer ``is actually the boy at all times.'' ``We are given,''
Michaelis writes (in one of his better phrases), ``the erotic power
of omnipotent invisibility.'' And something about the safety of
children's books allowed Wyeth to release his own iconography.
Michaelis reveals that the ``Psycho''-style house in the most
haunting painting in the series _ ``Old Pew,'' the blind man
working his way down a lane _ is a carefully rendered moonlight
view of Wyeth's childhood home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WYETH-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: childhood home.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pictures great,'' Scribners wired when they saw the ``Treasure
Island'' paintings, and from that point on, the Scribners
Illustrated Classics became Wyeth's museum, his gallery, his
testament: ``The Boy's King Arthur,'' ``The Black Arrow,'' ``The
Last of the Mohicans,'' ``The Mysterious Island,'' ``The
Deerslayer,'' ``Westward Ho!'' _ more than 350,000 copies of
Wyeth's editions were sold by 1930. Though depression would plague
him in later life, it was never again rooted in disappointment with
his work. He began to raise his own family, and became a robustly
loving father and Santa Claus combined, supplying his five children
with the same fanatic exactitude in the service of fantasy that he
gave to his paintings: ``Early on Christmas morning, in costume, he
climbed a ladder to the roof of the house. Stamping his boots,
ringing sleigh bells, quieting the reindeer, he called down the
bedroom chimneys. Hidden behind a long-whiskered mask with spiky
white eyebrows and a peaked red hat, he would visit each child's
room, filling stockings, carrying 'the beautiful illusion of ``old
Kris'' as far as possible.' '' He even rigged up a dummy Santa so
that the kids would see St. Nick along with their father and not
catch on to the impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   But his was a smothering presence, too. For all his reputation
as a master of silverpoint exactitude, N. C. was a full-blown Grimm
Brothers romantic, who taught his children to ``feel everything'' _
and as Michaelis says, ``the romancing of things made separation
and loss central to their sense of themselves and the world.''
Andrew, the most sensitive and gifted child in the Wyeth art
academy, recalls that one of his earliest memories of Christmas was
of the humiliation of being so terrified by the bearded apparition
that he lost control and wet his pants. (One can't help wondering
if a less enclosing father might have pushed the prodigy Andrew
farther out _ to Paris, to New York, to the world _ and, in that
way, done him more good as an artist in the long run.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end the story takes a strangely incestuous and then a
heartbreakingly tragic turn. In the last years of N. C.'s life,
Howard Pyle's niece Caroline _ a girl so stunning that her sex
appeal still radiates through half-century-old family snapshots _
entered the Wyeth menage, and became a kind of Chadds Ford Lulu.
She flirted with various Wyeths, and eventually married N. C.'s son
Nat. N. C. grew obsessed with her, and may have become her lover;
even Michaelis is not quite sure. What is certain is that one
morning in 1945, he picked up Caroline and Nat's little boy,
Newell, and took him for a drive; the car stopped _ or stalled, no
one knows _ at a railroad crossing, and (it is almost unbearable to
imagine) the grandfather and small boy were killed together by the
milk train arriving at Chadds Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Did he have a heart attack? Did he simply panic? Chadds Ford
locals were sure that they knew the truth. They said that N. C. was
consumed with guilt over his relationship with Caroline, that his
``grandson'' was really his son, and that he killed himself and the
boy in a fit of remorse. Michaelis is convinced, and convinces the
reader, that this is probably just evil-speaking and myth-making.
The oddest thing about the tragedy is that for all they had lost in
one terrible morning _ both the family patriarch and its prince _
the rest of the Wyeths stayed put. They remained in Chadds Ford,
and Andrew continued to paint not far from the railroad crossing
where his father and nephew had died. The family enclosure that N.
C. had built kept them in, as it was meant to.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelis has assembled an excellent account of all these events
_ well written, conscientious and, on the whole, enthralling. He is
a demon researcher and can turn a phrase. (``Fathers who die
violent deaths inhabit shallow graves,'' he says of the aftermath
of N. C.'s death.) And he knows the value of understatement and
indirection. But he takes for granted the one thing you most want
him to prove, and that is the relevance of the Wyeth family story
(and tragedy) to the larger history of American art. In all the
standard telling, after all, N. C. barely rates a footnote. Yet for
Michaelis, the Wyeths might as well be the van Eycks. A reader of
this biography would have no idea that there were people who
doubted the importance or even the relevance of the Wyeths, or that
the world of illustration and realist painting that the book
describes was only a tiny microworld within a larger American art
world that was undergoing a revolution a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelis would probably say that he was leaving this work to
the reader, and perhaps it can be quickly done. In retrospect,
Wyeth had two accomplishments, neither neglible. One was to
``package'' or popularize the line of stoic American melancholy
that begins in Homer and Eakins. The long, still shadows, the
careful, indiscriminate inventory, in which a dying hero and the
turn of a bedpost are given the same sober, positive caress _ all
this, though generally derived from Northern European painting, has
a particular American point and poignancy, and Wyeth was the first
to take it from the margins and inject it right into the nation's
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   His other achievement, closely related , was still larger. By
mixing the tight-lipped empirical inventory with fantasy stories,
he helped give birth to the visual style of American movies. The
movies, after all, are a form where pinpoint exactitude and
elaborately engineered fantasy are not just the goal but the given
_ all there is. Wyeth's influence on the movies has been immense.
Douglas Fairbanks begged him to come out to Hollywood, and the
style of Fairbanks's ``Robin Hood'' and ``Thief of Bagdad'' is
impossible to imagine without Wyeth's example; even the 1946 film
of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's novel ``The Yearling'' closely
follows the design of Wyeth's illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth's peculiar inventions, or discoveries _ the omnipresent
viewpoint, the low, child's-eye view of violence and horror, the
``sight seen'' manner, all breaking with the conventions of the
proscenium stage, which haunted illustration up to to his time _
continue to be one of the dominant ways in which the movies see. A
lot of what we think of as somehow naturally ``cinematic'' begins
in his illustrations. If Steven Spielberg is to be placed in a
family tree of visual artists, then N. C. Wyeth is one of his
ancestors. (Spielberg famously collects Rockwell, but does he
collect the older Wyeth? He should.) A more expansive history might
elevate the Wyeth Michaelis has given us not by overpraising his
``serious'' art, but by folding him into a larger history of
popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   If one imagines the history of American art as a many-chambered
mansion, where a peculiarly American dialogue between fantasy and
exactitude, between transcendentalism and literalism, gets acted
out, then N. C. Wyeth's particular version of that dialogue _
adventure stories told as solemnly as psalms _ occupies a pretty
small room. But it was large enough to raise a family in, and it
had a big window.

THE CHAN'S GREAT CONTINENT
</HEADLINE>
  China in Western Minds 
 By Jonathan D. Spence 
 279 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $27.50 
 ------ 
 ORIENTEERING 
 By STEPHEN GREENBLATT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young, impressionable Scottish woman, shortly after arriving
in China in 1859, sends home an account of a boat trip she has
taken on the Wusong River:
</P>
<P>
   ``On each side hung weeping willows, dropping their bending
branches into the limpid stream. Back from the river were numerous
fields waving with golden corn, and many a neat farmhouse peeped
out amid a very luxuriance of trees. We were now nearing a
beautifully arched bridge, green with flowering creepers. . . . On
the top of a pretty green hill stood a time-worn pagoda, its
numberless corners and juttings, edged with bronze and brass,
catching a glow from the morning rays, and glittering in the fair
sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   She is no doubt describing exactly what she saw, but she is
also, of course, describing the wallpaper and porcelains and
delicately figured boxes that had been the rage in Europe since the
18th century and have remained a staple of interior decoration ever
since. When I was a child, I gazed at the same scenes on the walls
of my parents' house in suburban Boston, and when I went to China
in the 1980's, I reached for my camera to photograph certain
landscapes because they looked, well, so much like China -- which
is to say, so much like that wallpaper. No doubt I was careful to
exclude from my snapshots whatever did not fit.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan D. Spence's wonderful new book, ``The Chan's Great
Continent: China in Western Minds,'' is about the history of these
``sightings,'' as he calls them, the numerous glimpses of a country
that has fascinated and on occasion obsessed Western observers
since the publication of Marco Polo's ``Travels'' in the late 13th
century. My own childhood store of China sightings included more
than chinoiserie: I was intrigued by Charles Finney's surreal novel
``The Circus of Dr. Lao'' and, at a younger age, terrified by the
devilish cunning of Sax Rohmer's villain, Dr. Fu-Manchu. These
purveyors of exotic stereotypes find their place in Spence's
wide-ranging essays, which are based on a series of lectures first
given at Yale University in the spring of 1996. They are joined by
an enormous cast of missionaries, soldiers, traders, scholars,
satirists, philosophers, linguists, poets, playwrights, painters,
diplomats, scientists, adventurers, spies, visionaries, politicians
and picture-taking tourists. As he moves through seven centuries of
encounters, Spence makes time for figures as various as Jane Austen
and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bret Harte and Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an overarching order to these multifarious
perspectives? Spence thinks not, and consequently his book, loosely
organized in chronological order, does not offer any theory of the
West's long encounter with China or any general account of the
structure of its representations. The very term ``sighting,'' drawn
from navigation and exploration, connotes something fleeting,
intermittent and partial, sufficient perhaps to get one's bearings
or even, in gunnery, to get off an accurate shot, but not nearly
enough to take in the whole. An extreme example, too phantasmic to
merit more than a brief mention, is Columbus's glimpse in 1492 of
what he thought was China.
</P>
<P>
   But Columbus was carrying with him an immensely influential
account of China that Spence does discuss at some length, that of
the Venetian Marco Polo. Though Polo, who claimed to have lived in
China for 17 years, does not mention tea or Chinese calligraphy or
the bound feet of the women, his work has enough detail to bear
witness to a contact that is more than imaginary. Spence suggests
that the weird omissions may be explained by the possibility that
Polo's book was designed ``in part as a commentary on his own
native city, as much as an accurate representation of life in
China.'' This suggestion corresponds to a scene in Italo Calvino's
haunting 1972 fantasy, ``Invisible Cities,'' discussed in one of
Spence's later chapters, in which the Khan complains to his foreign
visitor that he has never described the place he has come from:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'There is still one of which you never speak.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Marco Polo bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Venice,' the Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marco smiled. 'What else do you believe I have been talking to
you about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The emperor did not turn a hair. 'And yet I have never heard
you mention that name.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And Polo said: 'Every time I describe a city I am saying
something about Venice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Much in Spence's book bears out this perception, often
intensifying its irony: again and again, gifted observers strain to
capture the essence of what seems to them the radically and
irreducibly alien, only to construct displaced accounts of their
own existence. The long, twisting road through the realm of the
exotic often seems to lead back home. Small wonder that along with
Calvino's ``Invisible Cities,'' the ``esthetically most perfect
fictions about China,'' according to Spence, are two claustrophobic
masterpieces, ``The Garden of Forking Paths,'' by Jorge Luis
Borges, and ``The Great Wall of China,'' by Franz Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the West's China sightings are not finally trapped within
the walls of the familiar. ``The curious readiness of Westerners
for things Chinese was there from the beginning,'' Spence writes
with a blend of wonder and bafflement. The early readers of Marco
Polo were excited not by his finding in China's ruler the
prudential values of the Venetian paterfamilias but by his
proffered glimpse of silks and spices, paper money and teeming
cities, along with unicorns, assassins, gardens of sensual delights
and other trappings of the medieval romantic imagination.
Subsequent observers were fascinated by such marvels as cormorant
fishing, the use of two small sticks for eating, the meticulous
collecting of night soil for fertilizer, the joy in caged
nightingales that ``melt themselves in music,'' the practice of
printing and, above all else, the staggering immensity of the
population. Its numbers were ``everywhere so great,'' observed a
16th-century Portuguese trader, ``that out of a tree you shall see
many times swarm a number of children, where a man would not have
thought to have found any one at all.''

<P>
   It is this uncanny phenomenon -- all the more astonishing to a
Europe that took centuries to edge its way back from the
demographic devastation of the bubonic plague -- that offers at
least a partial thread through the labyrinth of conflicting
observations. Many Western observers, coming as they did from a
continent riven by religious hatreds, fierce political struggles
and endemic violence, were awe-struck by the vision of such a vast,
unified, well-ordered country. The experience often provoked fits
of self-loathing. ``It is God's special Providence,'' wrote the
Spanish Dominican Domingo Navarrete, who lived and worked in China
from 1659 to 1664, ``that the Chineses don't know what is done in
Christendom, for if they did there would be never a man among them
but would spit in our faces.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it, generation after generation of Westerners asked
themselves, that held this astonishing, diverse and immensely
populous land together? Why didn't it fly into mutually
antagonistic pieces? How could so many people succeed in feeding
themselves and living in reasonable order? What was the secret of a
spectacular reproductive capacity that was cultural as well as
biological? The answers were numerous and contradictory, depending
on the interests, predisposition and experience of the observer: an
equitable system of justice or the exercise of horrible cruelty; a
high moral standard or an almost universal dishonesty; the wise
rule of an enlightened emperor or the craven submission of a
brutalized and deeply demoralized populace; a Confucian orthodoxy
that inculcated disciplined obedience or a decadent penchant for
slothful sensuality. As Spence brilliantly demonstrates, these
competing hypotheses, already in play centuries ago, continue to
find expression in the reflections of contemporary scholars and
statesmen. And in light of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
increasing tensions in the Indian subcontinent, the murderous
conflicts in the Middle East and the continuing violence on the
margins of Europe, there is every reason why the enigma of China
should continue to haunt us.

   That dean, Janina Montero, said: ``The threshold for checking
that information was determined to be fairly high. The director of
public safety meets with me, and together we would arrive on a
decision as to whether to take that step.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Bernemen, a senior in the electrical engineering department
and the chairwoman of the Undergraduate Student Life committee,
said: ``Privacy is something we fought for pretty hard last year.
We think we did an OK job with it. It takes a pretty reasonable or
substantial issue to unseal those records.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with more than two dozen students, in person
and by telephone, many said they were surprised to find out that
the university was recording their movements. Most of the students
said their primary objection was over the inconvenience of the
system; privacy concerns were generally listed second.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernemen said she liked the security system. ``I don't think
that it's that much of an inconvenience,'' she said. ``For the
added safety, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Grech, a senior who is actively involved in the debate,
said, ``It seems as if you're living in a prison.'' Grech said he
lived in a new dormitory room with a key-operated door that locked
automatically. ``There is no way to unlock your door,'' he said.
``Whenever you leave, it locks behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   That complicates sleepy late-night trips to the bathroom down
the hall and forces students to look for ways to circumvent the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some students interviewed also wondered about the system's
effectiveness. In mid-October, a freshman, Alicia Wright, found a
man she didn't know in her room. After he politely excused himself
and left, Ms. Wright became suspicious and telephoned one of the
student advisers assigned to freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser assured Ms. Wright that the man was probably an
authorized fire inspector and told her not to worry. Only later did
her roommates discover that two laptops and some jewelry were
missing from the room, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the burglary, I don't think very much of the security
here,''Ms. Wright said. ``A lot of times, you see people letting
others in the door. I would do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Collins, a freshman who is one of Ms. Wright's
roommates, said, ``If people's parents come, everyone says, `Have
someone prox you in and come up to my room.' There is this trust.''
She said students would often let others enter the dormitories
under the assumption that the people were friends or relatives of
dormitory residents or simply residents who had forgotten their
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students complain that the way the system is run
forces them to be so lenient about allowing others entry. There is
no simple way for students to provide a visitor a spare set of
keys, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The security office will issue visitors prox cards for short
periods, but most of the students interviewed were not aware of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton is trying to add more flexibility by expanding a
system in which visitors can call students on the telephone to ask
to be allowed into a dormitory and the students can open doors
remotely by pushing the ``5'' button on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Many students interviewed said they often used other students'
cards, grabbing the nearest card that worked, like a roommate's
card. Most said they did not mind confounding the system, and a few
said they were happy to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the prox card came without a picture or other
identifying marks and was used only for security. Now one prox card
does it all, acting as identification and as a student charge card
for campus purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems are opposed by Marc Rotenberg, the director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research group in
Washington. He said such a system was ``more appropriate for a
prison or a secure military installation instead of a college
campus, where trust and openness have been part of the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he said, he often suggests electronic disobedience,
in the form of card swapping, for supermarket discount programs. He
said swapping cards destroyed the system's ability to track people
over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, some people say they often swap the
unlimited-ride subway Metrocards to confound a similar tracking
system, according to 2600, a hacker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   No one has challenged the legality of Princeton University's
collection of tracking data on its students. Silverglate, who has
served on various committees of the American Civil Liberties Union
and taught at major law schools, including Harvard, called the
system of data collection ``creepy.'' But he added, ``We shouldn't
confuse that with illegal, unconstitutional or unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitution, he explained, prohibits unreasonable searches
but says little about the gradual aggregation of routinely
collected data.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said few legal precedents govern the vast databases
developing in public and private hands. The Supreme Court has
visited the issue of searches many times but has provided little
guidance on data collection.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hurley said the situation would be different in Europe
because a directive issued by the European Union strictly limited
the collection of personal data by private groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said some students would inevitably buck such security
systems. He added, ``People who think they have a technical
solution to a social problem are invariably disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ascher, the current student body president at Princeton,
said he thought that the university had reached the right decision
on the security system, given the substantial minority of students
who felt so strongly about using the prox cards 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Do you know that scene in `Jurassic Park' where
Jeff Goldblum said, You guys have been so intent on building the
technology without wondering if it's a good idea? I often got the
impression that the university was intent on building the system
because it could, not because it was a good idea.''

 A WOMAN WHOSE WORK IS NEVER DONE 
 By BETH GUTCHEON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture books for young children appear simple and are often
slight. And yet they have to meet standards rarely or never imposed
on other branches of literature. How many books on your shelf could
you bear to read 800 times? How many new books that you love would
be equally appealing to your mother?
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, the burden of social utility the picture book
lugs around. It is a book that a child loves enough to want to hear
over and over again until she has memorized every word (and she
cannot be fooled by any playful substitutions of phrasing her
captive reader may attempt the five- or six-hundredth time
through). Such a book has taught a child what every one of those
loved words looks like on the page. It has taught her what reading
is for, approximately how it is done, and that it is a delight. A
book that uses pictures not only to illustrate but also to comment,
to tell a slightly different story from what the words say, is
doing something very sophisticated indeed, and yet accomplishing it
with grace.
</P>
<P>
   Happy is the child who falls in love with a picture book of real
and lasting charm, and twice as happy the parent.
</P>
<P>
   In my son's childhood, the book of choice was ``Father Fox's
Penny Rhymes,'' by the Vermont sisters Clyde and Wendy Watson (a
gem worth tracking down, if you don't already know it). For many
new-minted book lovers it will be ``Hurry, Hurry, Mary Dear,''
another near-perfect collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   N. M. Bodecker, who died in 1988, was a Danish-American writer
and illustrator. Erik Blegvad explains in his introduction that he
and Bodecker met in Copenhagen in 1941, both married Americans and
immigrated to New England, where for years they shared a studio in
Connecticut, as well as a language and a friendship. Blegvad has
made wonderfully witty and appealing paintings, based on his
friend's own drawings of Mary, to illustrate Bodecker's
posthumously published nonsense rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   Mary is a New England farm wife, being urged to rush about her
autumn chores by her stout husband. In a striped dress and apron,
she picks the apples, dills the pickles and chops down trees for
wooden nickels. Her husband is glimpsed infrequently, rolling out
of bed or tying his tie at the upstairs window as Mary churns the
butter, smokes the hams, cans tomatoes and puts up jams; soon the
sky grows dark, the brown leaves blow past the window, and Mary's
nose grows red with cold.
</P>
<P>
   The blue, gray-green, brown and orange colors of the New England
landscape are wonderfully evocative, frame by frame, and it's fun
to keep track of Mary's cat, which is sometimes lurking far off in
the grass as geese honk by overhead in V formation, and Mary
struggles under a bushel of late tomatoes, or is playing with a
grape on the kitchen floor as the curtains blow, the kettle steams
and Mary makes jelly. Sometimes the pictures are deliberately
silly, like the one of Mary splitting peas, but the humor is mostly
subtle and based on juxtaposition. A child will understand more and
more of the jokes as she grows older, without feeling fooled or
left out of anything should she get none of them. As for the
delicious one at the end, no one will miss it
</P>
<P>
   The winter comes on as Mary's day progresses. The first flakes
of snow begin to fall as she takes in the last of the beans, and
the light has turned a flat, gray-green color that feels like a
storm. There's some black in the clouds in the next scene of Mary
up a ladder, taking down screens and putting up storm windows. (Now
there's a nasty job in any weather.) The cat is not helping; she is
down in the branches of a bare tree, enjoying the wind. But Mary
remains cheerful. By the time she gets indoors, the snow flurries
have become a full-fledged storm, and her husband is looking
forward to his tea.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say just what is the last straw -- maybe the fact
that he thinks doughnuts are baked rather than fried -- but it
doesn't matter. Mary isn't planning to bake him any, anyway, and
absolutely nothing could spoil this charmer of a book.

 WHO IS THE REAL SAVAGE? 
 By KATHRYN HARRISON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1800 a child was captured in the woods of Aveyron, in the
south of France. Naked, filthy, unable to speak, he was both beast
and human: he was, it seemed, a handy, home-grown example of
Rousseau's noble savage. He had no family, no history anyone could
decipher, and, thus unprotected, he was taken to Paris, where he
was ushered into the Age of Reason. At the Institute for Deaf-Mutes
a young and idealistic doctor, Jean-Marc Itard, succeeded in
forcibly civilizing the wild boy, whom he named Victor, to the
point where the child wore clothes, ate with cutlery and could
identify a few written words.
</P>
<P>
   Itard's methods of teaching went on to influence the educator
Maria Montessori, but his goal, to get Victor to speak, was never
realized; the so-called Savage of Aveyron's short life was spent on
the cusp of a society that could neither fully form nor accept him.
</P>
<P>
   From this true story, Mordicai Gerstein has rendered ``The Wild
Boy,'' a picture book, and ``Victor,'' a young-adult novel. For the
younger reader, Gerstein spins a fairy tale of salvation, similar
to that of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan or of John Merrick (the
Elephant Man) and Dr. Frederick Treves. It's a familiar formula, in
which a feral child, a freak -- reviled, feared, exploited -- is
recognized by an enlightened benefactor as inherently worthy. The
doctor/savior/teacher guides the Victor/Helen/John character firmly
toward a fuller expression of his or her true, if hidden, humanity.
The path of discipline is complicated by the faithless, those who
consider the attempt hopeless, the student unredeemable.
</P>
<P>
   Success, after setbacks that provide suspense, is a fulfillment
of religious proportion: emotional, transcendent. Gerstein's
picture book leaves readers with an image of the young doctor and
Victor united in rapturous bedtime coziness, a clean boy bathed in
silver moonlight. His novel, which succeeds as a rare thing, a
novel of ideas for adolescents, is less reductive.
</P>
<P>
   What is civilization, and why should a wild boy who exults in
his wildness, untroubled by forks or alphabets, want any part of
it? The course of Victor's relationship with Itard is not one of
smooth advances but of halting steps toward a limited and costly
taming that ends in disillusion and rupture. It's a sad story that
raises uncomfortable questions.
</P>
<P>
   When the wild boy is captured, it is discovered that his throat
was once cut. Although the wound was not fatal, as his abandoners
perhaps intended, the scar still bears testimony to a wretched
past. Victor's life among other humans will always be marked by
fear and suspicion. As his doctor notes, the boy cares only for
food and freedom. He is fed, but the freedom he wants, a return to
the woods, is not the one that society conceives for him.
</P>
<P>
   He lived up in a tree,
</P>
<P>
   knew nothing of Liberty!
</P>
<P>
   And so we had to capture him,
</P>
<P>
   to tell him he was free,
</P>
<P>
   a Revolutionary citizen,
</P>
<P>
   just like you and me!
</P>
<P>
   goes a popular song, as the Savage of Aveyron's fame spreads. In
the wake of revolution, the Paris intelligentsia embraces science,
education, a forced march of progress for all -- one in which
pride, both nationalist and personal, plays a great part. Itard's
distinguished mentors allow him the opportunity to rehabilitate a
child whose potential they question, and to present the results of
his program before the Society of Observers of Man. Such pressure
is enough to inspire methods of teaching that are still used today,
and to drive Itard occasionally to beat a child he cannot reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I am an explorer in some unknown wilderness: this
boy,'' the doctor remarks to himself, ruefully, of his apparent
destiny. Watching Victor clutch a sack, Itard observes that it is
filled with ``things that may be lost or taken away; ownership is a
fragile state.'' Each comfort of civilization has its price. Even
the greatest gift Itard proposes to give the boy, language,
Gerstein reveals as alienation from all it seeks to identify: ``He
opens his mouth and bites. He has no word for potato. Nothing
separates him from it.'' This is a version very different from the
one we are given by the book we call our first, in which God gives
Adam dominion through the power of naming creation.
</P>
<P>
   BY turns demanding and guilt-ridden, Itard finally fails to save
Victor from his animal nature, rather too much of which Gerstein
sets out in scenes of masturbation. As Victor enters puberty he
falls under the spell of his genitals, touching them when he is in
public or in the company of his doctor. That Itard, who has
sacrificed his own sexuality to his career, can neither allow nor
control what he considers evidence of the boy's bestiality
</P>
<P>
   becomes a catalyst for their violent rupture.
</P>
<P>
   Victor's captors, men of science, of reason -- of Liberte,
Egalite, Fraternite -- judge grief to be a uniquely human emotion.
When they find him, the wild boy knows how to laugh but not to cry.
Perhaps his education is successful insofar as he learns, and
learns well, to weep.

 HE DIDN'T DO IT 
 By BETSY HEARNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a game where you know enough to make the next move
exciting but not enough to know what that move is going to be.
That's ``Holes,'' as deep as its title. You and any reasonable (or
unreasonable) youth of your acquaintance will be drawn into this
one. And it's not a black hole. Spiraling between past and present,
Louis Sachar, whose light fiction for middle-grade readers
(``There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom,'' ``Marvin Redpost: Alone
in His Teacher's House'') has won him popular acclaim, abandons
conventional plot for a more innovative mix of realism and legend,
with elements of mystery that keep the surrealistic events
suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Yelnats arrives at a Texas juvenile correctional
facility called Camp Green Lake. The name is ironic, because there
hasn't been a drop of water in this desert setting for a hundred
years and the blazing sun has long since killed everything green.
Stanley is innocent of anything except being in the wrong place at
the wrong time, a fate that has plagued his family since his
Latvian great-great-grandfather broke a promise to a helpful Gypsy.
Some of this Stanley knows, and some he doesn't. Readers sometimes
find out before he does, or sometimes at the same time, a trick of
pacing and alternating scenarios that Sachar has mastered to
intense effect. Every revelation of the past ups the ante of the
present.
</P>
<P>
   The ominous warden -- she wears nail polish that's
color-enhanced with rattlesnake venom -- also has a past, as do the
inmates, especially one nicknamed Zero, whom even the (deceptively)
kindhearted counselor calls worthless. Most of all, the lake has a
past, and as the boys are ordered to dig holes -- each boy, one
hole, five feet by five feet, every day -- we discover how all of
these pasts intersect for a dangerous climax and a hole that holds
more than dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds grim, doesn't it? Nope, it's funny. Sachar inserts humor
that gives the suspense steep edges; the tone is as full of
surprises as the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's father, for instance, is an inventor working on a way
to recycle old sneakers. In the process he hits the jackpot (though
only after Stanley has broken the Gypsy's curse) with a recipe for
curing foot odor. Stanley's incarceration occurs after the police
arrest him for stealing a pair of the famous baseball player Sweet
Feet Livingston's smelly sneakers (they actually fall on Stanley's
head from out of the sky, but that's another subplot). One of the
warden's ancestors was named Trout Walker. (His real name was
Charles Walker, but everyone called him Trout because his two feet
smelled like a couple of dead fish.) The inmate Stanley replaces is
nicknamed Barf Bag. The onion fields that save Stanley and company
from starvation also make the boys stink to high heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any mention of body odor is guaranteed to send kids into
gales of laughter. Even adults may not be able to restrain a smile
at this goofy motif, cleverly interwoven as it is into an intricate
scheme of predestination.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful aspects of Sachar's writing is his
use of folkloric devices, especially the repetition of themes and
phrases (``Zero said nothing'') that heighten anticipation (Zero
finally says something crucial). Other traditional features include
the rhyming song that has come down through Stanley's family, the
moon's recurrence in both the song and the barren landscape pitted
with craters by years of digging -- for treasure, as it turns out
-- and the treasure hunt itself, not to mention a few animal
helpers in the unlikely guise of some lethal yellow-spotted
lizards.
</P>
<P>
   A lthough nothing is quite what it seems in this wildly
inventive novel, the patterns of language and narrative assure us
that everything will eventually make sense. And it does, in ways
that I will not give away lest readers be denied the satisfaction
of finding out for themselves. Between the tightly fitted plot and
the signifying wordplay, ``Holes'' is a smart jigsaw puzzle of a
novel that middle-grade youngsters will want to solve on their own.
And they won't mind the compact chapters, poetic in a strictly
action-packed way.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: A lot of nearly flawless children's novels
(Natalie Babbitt's ``Tuck Everlasting'' comes to mind) are written
by women and are strongest in their appeal to girls, though boys
certainly enjoy them in a classroom or group situation. This
children's book -- a finalist for the National Book Award to be
announced this week -- is written by a man and projects magnetic
attraction for boys, but make sure the girls don't miss out on it.
Tough, truehearted and ultimately tender, ``Holes'' is also a
member of that endangered species, the family read-aloud. You can
even have a contest: which listener will notice first that Yelnats
is Stanley spelled backward?

JOHN RUSSELL POPE
</HEADLINE>
  Architect of Empire 
 By Steven McLeod Bedford 
 Illustrated. 239 pp. New York: Rizzoli. $60 
 ------ 
 BRINGING B.C. TO D.C. 
 By THOMAS S. HINES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1937, when President Franklin Roosevelt invited Frank Lloyd
Wright to the White House to discuss proposed housing for the
Tennessee Valley Authority, the architect addressed him informally
but directly: ``Frank, you ought to get up out of that chair and
see what they are doing to your city here, miles and miles of Ionic
and Corinthian columns.'' While many architects, for well over a
century, had contributed to the form of neo-classical Washington,
John Russell Pope, in Wright's modernist view, was the most
conspicuous culprit, having recently designed for the Washington
Mall the National Archives, the Jefferson Memorial and the National
Gallery of Art. In a letter to the President in 1937, Wright
characterized the memorial as an ``arrogant insult to the memory of
Thomas Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope was born in New York City in 1873. His parents were
professional portrait and landscape painters. He attended City
College, Columbia and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris before
apprenticing with Bruce Price, best known for his work in the
domestic Shingle Style. By the time Pope opened his own office in
1905, his chief neo-classical model and mentor was Charles Follen
McKim, whose support would be crucial in his career. Of equal
importance was Pope's strategic marriage to Sadie Jones, the
socially prominent step-daughter of Henry Walters, an entrepreneur
who was related to the Delano family, a fact that would assume
great significance for Pope when Franklin Delano Roosevelt became
President. On the basis of his Beaux-Arts training and his acquired
social credentials, Pope established his early reputation as a
designer of period revival houses and commercial office towers for
the business elite, as well as campus plans of historicist
formalism for Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins and Yale. Yet Pope left his
major mark in his design of grand neo-classical public buildings
and monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his social connections and his obeisance to
established norms, it is difficult to understand from reading
``John Russell Pope: Architect of Empire'' how Pope acquired such
power -- since the author, Steven McLeod Bedford, presents him as a
rather cold fish. His ``refusal to meet with clients he did not
like, or who were not prestigious enough, placed a great burden on
his employees, as they had to assume considerable responsibility
while Pope remained in the background.'' Such qualities of
temperament were reflected in his architecture, since he, like
other historicists, ``lacked the confidence to go beyond style,''
Bedford says, and therefore espoused ``a conservative belief in the
power and validity of classical form,'' averring that ``no new and
distinct style should be created.'' Yet he must have provided what
many clients believed they wanted. Like most architects, he was
something of a gun for hire, designing memorials not only to Thomas
Jefferson but to Warren G. Harding. For Harding, Pope composed a
simple, finely scaled Doric rotunda with a handsome dome. He failed
to win the commission, the author believes, because he ``made a
fatal error in designing a domed structure as a memorial for the
man whose Administration was rocked by the Teapot Dome scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the criticism of Pope's architecture, the high
visibility of his major work makes it worthy of study. With
striking new photographs by Jonathan Wallen and a clearly written
text, this monograph is the first to assess Pope's achievement.
Regrettably, it suffers from several problems. It presents Pope's
work in chapters organized around the categories of residential,
commercial, public, university, museum and monumental structures.
This makes it static, depriving it of a sense of historical
progression, for if Pope's work changed slowly, his times did not.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford also seems uncertain about the nature of his audience.
The text contains arcane references familiar only to specialists.
Yet these very professionals will be alienated by an absence of
notes to documentary sources. Those needing footnotes, Bedford
blithely assures us, can check them by retrieving his Columbia
dissertation. Since a deluge of new Pope studies is not likely, the
decision to eliminate documentation was a serious error of
judgment. Finally, the author fails to explicate sufficiently the
cultural issues surrounding Pope's work. While there are occasional
references to modernist critics of the architect's retardataire
designs, there is no real effort to place that battle in its rich
historical context. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the
central ideological conflict between historicizing traditionalists
and avant-garde modernists in architecture entailed competing
claims for the necessity of inventing authentic, original forms
versus the need to retain tradition and continuity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the conflict had a much longer history. Following
L'Enfant's late-18th-century plan for the Washington Mall and
Government center, James Hoban's White House and the multi-authored
Capitol building had established neo-classicism as the governmental
style, a precedent confirmed in Robert Mills's impressive Treasury
Building of the 1830's. In the next decade, James Renwick's
eclectic Smithsonian Institution broke decidedly with that
paradigm, as, later, did the State, War and Navy Building and the
Library of Congress. In 1902, the architects Daniel Burnham and
Charles McKim strongly urged in their Washington plan that major
new structures on or near the Mall return to the neo-classicism of
the Founders. That imperative was heeded in the 1920's in Henry
Bacon's beautifully composed Lincoln Memorial. But it was also
challenged by modernists who wanted governmental buildings to
celebrate a 20th-century architecture. This was the dialectic Pope
encountered in the
</P>
<P>

 &UR; UNDATED: '20s and '30s.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, he became a member of the National Commission of Fine
Arts, a position that bolstered his stature. The first meeting he
attended received a plea from F.D.R., who shared his taste and who
was then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, that the exuberantly
Victorian State, War and Navy Building be radically remodeled in
neo-classical garb, the better to ``fit'' with the neighboring
White House and Treasury Building. The Commission endorsed this
dubious proposal and asked Pope to make sketches. Ultimately,
because of a lack of funding, the transformation did not happen, a
failure the author finds ``regrettable'' but for which most
observers have been thankful. Roosevelt's fantasized neo-classical
facelift of one of the capital's 19th-century treasures would have
been a sad loss to the texture of Washington as well as to the
national heritage.
</P>
<P>
   However left of center Roosevelt may have been on other fronts,
his architectural tastes were grandly conservative, not far removed
from those of his contemporaries, the dictators of Italy and
Germany. This book would have gained both substance and
significance by overt comparisons, formally and culturally, of the
architecture of Pope and the frequently similar work of the German
architect Albert Speer. Furthermore, the author is insufficiently
explicit on the continuing impact Roosevelt's support may have had
on Pope's career. There can be little doubt that it did not hurt
him. Pope garnered his three largest Washington commissions during
Roosevelt's first and second terms.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Bedford agrees with the oft-stated view that the
Jefferson Memorial, however splendidly sited, is rather badly
proportioned. But Jefferson the architect is a tough hero to honor
in an architectural statement. Who could imagine writing a play to
honor Shakespeare? Bedford, who is an architect, is strangely
kinder to Pope's National Archives, which has problems of scale
even greater than the memorial's -- its Corinthian main portico
gratuitously tacked onto its hulking mass.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford supports the critical consensus that the National
Gallery of Art, however conservative, is almost perfectly
conceived, with its great stretches of unpunctured walls deftly
articulated by strong Ionic porticos and a beautifully proportioned
dome. Though arguably the ``wrong thing done well,'' it somehow
transcends its neo-classical packaging with continuing lessons in
the power of geometry. It comfortably embraces I. M. Pei's
successfully modernist East Wing addition of the 70's, while it is
ironically best viewed from the gunnery slot of Gordon Bunshaft's
less successful Hirshhorn Museum across the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   However one may view Pope's neo-classical temples -- as
appropriate or regressive 20th-century statements -- the story
surrounding their conspicuous presence is one that deserves
historical attention. While this book achieves a partial success as
a presentation of Pope's architecture, it fails to probe his work's
complex significance in American cultural and architectural
history.

SECURING THE CAMPUSES

<P>
   Colleges throughout the country are taking different approaches
to campus security. While all of them feel the effects of increased
concern on the part of parents and students, not all of them are
approaching the solution in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of how a few universities and colleges handle
security. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornell University, in a rural location, simply distributes
metal keys to the front doors of dorms. Electronic locks are used
only in some situations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Stanford University uses a diverse system of key locks for the
more than 200 buildings. Rodger Whitney, director of student
housing at Stanford, said the University has had few problems with
the current key system but may adopt an electronic system like
Princeton's as it rolls more and more functions into one plastic
card that now pays for photocopying, laundry and other campus
needs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of Chicago has staff members sitting at the
front desk of each dorm. ``The standard practice in our residence
halls _ by the way, I live in one of them _ is to have a front desk
operation that is staffed 24 hours a day when school is in
service,'' said Ed Turkington, dean of student services at the
university. ``They serve a number of functions including
controlling access. Those who are full-time employees who are on a
regular shift get to know folks. They can begin to more easily
assess who is normally going through these doors and who is not.
That helps a lot to establish that kind of personal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkington said the university is considering adding access
functions to its campuswide ID card but is hesitant about keeping
records of student's movement. ``That's one I would want to think
very hard about,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Yale University, in the urban environment of downtown New
Haven, uses an electronic pass system similar to Princeton's and it
keeps a record.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ At Hood College in Frederick, Md., Timothy Duff, director of
public safety, said there is an electronic entry system at the
dorms that records each student's entry and exit. Still, he said,
the information is rarely used because students often come through
the doors in pairs. The college does not back up the records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Harvard University uses a variety of different card systems
throughout its dorms. All of the undergraduate dormitories, known
as houses, use the same system, but some of the graduate
dormitories use a different system.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bradner, a network security manager, said: ``Harvard in
general has been quite paranoid about private information. The
faculty has been very careful.'' &QL;

FASHIONABLE NONSENSE
</HEADLINE>
  Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science 
 By Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont 
 300 pp. New York: Picador USA. $23 
 ------ 
 IS PARIS KIDDING? 
 By JIM HOLT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In France (where it was published a year ago), this
much-maligned book has been likened to Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress. Both documents arise out of a peculiarly American spasm
of ``rigorist purism'' and ``hatred,'' according to a columnist for
Le Monde. The comparison, it must be said, is not altogether fair.
``Fashionable Nonsense,'' though juicy in its own way, is not quite
so titillating as the Starr report. Moreover, only one of its two
co-authors (Alan Sokal) is American, so our culture can't entirely
be blamed for it. What ``Fashionable Nonsense'' and the Starr
report do have in common, however, is a certain confusion about the
gravity and nature of the sins of their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Sokal, a physicist at New York University, caused an
intellectual row a couple of years ago when he fooled the editors
of a modish academic journal called Social Text into publishing a
sham article he had written. Bearing the title ``Transgressing the
Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum
Gravity,'' the article was meant to be a parody of what is loosely
called post-modernist thought. It was crammed full of meaningless
references to esoteric ideas in mathematics and physics, from which
it leapt, in one breathtaking non sequitur after another, to
radical conclusions about politics and society. As deliberately
parodic as Sokal's pronouncements were, they seemed nowhere near as
silly as the bits he quoted from post-modernist icons like Jacques
Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Luce Irigaray and from their numerous
American interpreters, who showed up in a cataract of footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good joke. It had funny consequences too: academics
wrote indignantly to The New York Times to insist that, despite
what the parody implied, they did so believe in the existence of
the external world. But Sokal was up to more than mischief. The
purpose of his hoax, he declared, was to reveal the fraudulence of
much post-modernist thought, especially as it abused science. There
was also a political angle. Far from being a right-winger picking
on the lit-crit pinkos, Sokal said, he was ``an unabashed Old
Leftist'' (he taught in Nicaragua under the Sandinistas) who
worried that the post-modern assault on objectivity was depriving
the working class of the weapons needed to win the struggle against
oppression -- a view shared with comrades like Noam Chomsky and
Eric Hobsbawm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashionable Nonsense,'' which Sokal wrote with the Belgian
physicist Jean Bricmont, grew out of this hoax. The authors have
two stated aims. First, they wish to present the full dossier of
pseudoscientific nonsense masquerading as profundity that Sokal
discovered when he was composing his parody, and to explain to
nonscientists exactly why it is nonsensical. Second, and more
ambitious, they want to make a philosophical case against what they
call post-modern relativism: the notion that physical reality is
nothing but a social construct and that science, despite its
pretensions to truth, is just another ``narration'' that encodes
the dominant ideology of the culture that produced it.
</P>
<P>
   The dossier part is intermittently amusing, but I'm not sure it
demonstrates what Sokal and Bricmont want it to. The passages cited
all come from French thinkers who cannot resist the urge to
name-drop. The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan drones on about sexual
pleasure as if it were a branch of topology, the mathematical
theory of abstract spaces. The literary theorist Julia Kristeva
tries to ground her poetics in Godel's incompleteness theorem,
which she gets exactly backward. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari,
philosophers of S &AMP; M, among other topics, unbosom themselves of
endless bizarre reflections on Newtonian physics.
</P>
<P>
   Technical terminology from quantum theory and mathematical logic
flows fast and furious, but it's mostly gibberish, as Sokal and
Bricmont painstakingly show. The Parisian thinkers have only the
foggiest understanding of science, and the metaphors they invoke
could scarcely be more arbitrary -- when they signify anything at
all. (The sociologist Jean Baudrillard, for one, has a habit of
simply making up his terms, like ``variable refraction hyperspace''
and ``fractal scissiparity.'') ``If the texts seem
incomprehensible, it is for the excellent reason that they mean
precisely nothing,'' Sokal and Bricmont comment. Indeed, it's hard
to imagine how people could read the texts seriously. Perhaps the
lofty-sounding verbiage has an incantatory force for those innocent
of science. Some of these passages, if intoned in the plummy voice
of, say, Jeremy Irons, could well have the meaningless beauty of a
Mallarme poem.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the crime here? At worst these French theorists are
bluffeurs. They do not hate science; they love it too well and try
to wrap themselves in its mantle. It is a tendency deeply ingrained
in the culture of the Ecole Normale Superieure, the elite Paris
institution where many French philosophers are trained. Its
students are encouraged to extend their erudition as widely, if
superficially, as possible -- to ``possess the world,'' as
Jean-Paul Sartre once put it. The philosophes of the Enlightenment
took a leaf from Newton; is it surprising that their contemporary
counterparts should try to take one from quantum theory and
relativity?
</P>
<P>
   A more distressing abuse of science is to be found right here in
the United States. It arises not from an elitist, hyperrationalist
culture, like that of France, but from a home-grown antielitist,
antirationalist, anti-intellectual one. Traditionally, this science
war, as Sokal and Bricmont refer to it in the epilogue of their
book, has been waged by the religious right, but in recent decades
an element of the academic left has got in on the action -- the
``cultural studies'' crowd. Among its leading figures is Andrew
Ross, one of the editors of the journal that unwittingly
collaborated in Sokal's hoax. Now, Ross is a man with a keen sense
of irony, and when he complains about scientists undemocratically
excluding the New Age beliefs of the masses, he may just be pulling
our leg. But one gets the feeling that many of his allies are dead
earnest when they denounce science as patriarchal and
authoritarian, and call for its subordination to progressive
interests.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-NONSENSE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: progressive interests.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American cultural-studies types and the Parisian theorists
do have something in common -- something, that is, besides a woolly
way of expressing themselves. Both camps are skeptical of the
notion of objective truth, that there is such a thing as a world
independent of our minds that science alone can represent ``as it
really is.'' Sokal and Bricmont regard this attitude as daft, not
to say dangerous. The gravamen of their book is a defense of
scientific realism against its relativist enemies.
</P>
<P>
   This defense is fine as far as it goes, but it does not go very
far. It is the work of a moment to refute someone who claims that
there is no such thing as scientific progress, or that the content
of scientific theories is dictated exclusively by cultural
interests. But there are other, more sophisticated arguments that
the authors do not bother to address. They have been framed by
philosophers of unimpeachable scientific credentials (like Hilary
Putnam and W. V. Quine) and are based on powerful findings in the
area of mathematical logic known as model theory. They make the
authors' ``realist'' explanation for the success of science -- that
its theories uniquely latch on to the way the world is -- seem like
empty metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   THESE arguments are difficult, but their flavor can be conveyed
by a simple example. As a theory whose correspondence to the world
is so evident that ``it has become irrational to doubt it,'' Sokal
and Bricmont cite atomism. But what is an atom? To the greatest
physicist of the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell, an atom was ``a
body which cannot be cut in two.'' This is certainly not true of
what we now call atoms. It may turn out that nothing in the world
fits Maxwell's description -- in which case, when he theorized
about atoms, he was referring to nothing at all. By the same token,
``superstring'' -- the theoretical term today's physicists use to
refer to the basic constituents of reality -- may also turn out to
designate nothing at all a hundred years hence. Physics will
doubtless be more potent then, but not because it more accurately
pictures some supposedly theory-independent ``furniture of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   As physicists, Sokal and Bricmont have done reason a modest
service by exposing a species of intellectual quackery. As
philosophers, they have not pursued reason far enough -- all the
way to its sometimes unreasonable-sounding conclusions.

 Unpaged. New York: Henry Holt &AMP; Company. $16.95. (Ages 6 to 9)

 MISS. LOVES NEV. 
 By SEAN KELLY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose (some do) that America's present moral and intellectual
crisis is the direct result of a century of ``progressive''
education. Ninety-nine years ago, John Dewey published ``The School
and Society,'' and the liberals fell for it. Now, on the brink of
the millennium, Johnny can't read, Johnny can't add, and Heather
has two mommies.
</P>
<P>
   High time, then (some say), to bring back classroom Discipline,
the instillation of Values and instruction in the Core Curriculum.
Our overpaid, coddled grade school teachers must, as they did in
days of yore, compel _ by all means necessary _ their pupils to
memorize multiplication tables, irregular verbs, chemical formulas,
historical dates _ and render them able, by golly, to recite all
Ten Commandments and the United States Presidents in chronological
order!
</P>
<P>
   Still, it goes without saying that learning should be fun.
</P>
<P>
   This is why so many of today's up-to-date pedagogues subscribe
to the Children's Television Workshop Sugar-Coating System (or
C.T.W.S.C.S.). It's easy as store-bought pi. The content of the
lesson _ good old Core Curriculum _ is presented in so way-cool and
hip-hop a form that the little suckers don't twig to the fact that
they're learning something until . . . it's too late!
</P>
<P>
   And the beauty part is that the C.T.W.S.C.S. can be applied to
any school subject, no matter how tedious. Take geography, as
Laurie Keller has in ``The Scrambled States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   This charming book's many full-color illustrations are rendered
in the ersatz primitive cartoon/collage style associated 30 years
ago with ``underground'' comics, but now familiar to all toddlers
with access to the Nickelodeon network. Here's the story they tell:
Kansas is bored, and invites all the other states to a big party.
Once there, they decide to change places on the map. After wacky
complications ensue, they return to their original positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scrambled States of America'' is not for preschoolers, not
a read-aloud and not a geography textbook per se. It is
``supplementary reading,'' a tongue-in-cheek commentary that
depends for its effect on the reader's familiarity with material,
in this case an atlas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Amused by the anthropomorphic personalities of the states
(Nebraska is ``kind,'' Idaho is ``polite,'' North and South Dakota
``bicker''), and their adventures (Mississippi and Nevada fall in
love), the young reader may be expected to absorb, subliminally as
it were, individual configurations, locations on the map or, at the
very least, their names. (Like all the subjects that form the Core
Curriculum, such knowledge has practical applications _ e.g.,
should the reader someday find herself the chairwoman of a
political party convention and the prompting machine malfunction
during the roll-call of the states.)
</P>
<P>
   Keller's ``scrambled'' gimmick is a valuable addition to the
C.T.W.S.C.S., and one can imagine its application to other Core
Curriculum subjects: ``Scrambled Nations'' (Brazil is ``kind,''
Poland is ``polite,'' Iran and Iraq ``bicker''); ``Scrambled
Geometry'' (the square of the hypotenuse falls in love with the
circumference), ad infinitum.
</P>
<P>
   But it is to be hoped that any future such projects will, as
does ``The Scrambled States of America,'' inculcate more than mere
information. A profound lesson is imparted when, at the story's
end, the states happily resume their original positions: Kids, it's
harmless fun to imagine changing things, but when you come right
down to it, everything is perfect just the way it is.

 OF THEE I SING 
 By KATHLEEN KRULL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The song ``This Land Is Your Land'' percolates so ubiquitously
as an unofficial national anthem that many assume it's in the
public domain, instead of a tune and lyrics Woody Guthrie wrote in
the winter of 1940 while hitchhiking around post-Depression
America. Have you ever recited the lyrics without singing them?
It's an engaging experiment in hearing how yeasty with meaning they
remain. It can be tricky to get through them without your eyes
welling up.
</P>
<P>
   This land is your land, this land is my land,
</P>
<P>
   From California to the New York island;
</P>
<P>
   From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters,
</P>
<P>
   This land was made for you and me.
</P>
<P>
   Though they would mightily challenge an artist, you can tell
they could work as a powerful text for a picture book.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 years later, the noted folk artist Kathy Jakobsen has
taken the dare. She has coaxed pictures out of the many directions
suggested by the song, achieving what is almost a visual
deconstruction. In complicated oil paintings, with borders
influenced by the tramp art of the early 1900's, she depicts the
complete lyrics -- yes, even the sometimes censored ``subversive''
verses, including
</P>
<P>
   As I went walking, I saw a sign there,
</P>
<P>
   And on the sign it said ``No Trespassing.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side it didn't say nothing;
</P>
<P>
   That side was made for you and me.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the song's history, a broad selection of quotations
from other Guthrie lyrics and writings, a biography and information
about his music and its enormous influence on others.The book also
includes homages to iconic attractions offered by all 50 states and
musical notation (with guitar chords), as well as a tribute by Pete
Seeger (in which he admits that he didn't think much of the song at
first).
</P>
<P>
   In a work of just 32 pages, you'd think everything would be in
miniature, and most of it is. The book is accurately advertised as
suitable for all ages, but some of us will need our bifocals.
Breaking up the complex pages that carry the text of the chorus and
require some close visual attention are more dramatic spreads with
the verses. The images sweep the landscape, as a tiny Guthrie
travels ``from California to the New York island.''
</P>
<P>
   The horizontal format helps convey the deserts and valleys,
redwood forests, city skylines, majestic mountains, seedy
neighborhoods undergoing transformation and even the wheat fields
threatened by a frightening dust storm. Crammed into a three-page
fold-out panorama at the end, in the same meticulous folk art
style, is just about every kind of singing group America has to
offer -- from children training their dogs to sing, to a civil
rights march led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This is an ambitious tribute to a popular song that will live as
long as the American spirit. Besides reminding children from all
backgrounds that America is indeed their land, it will acquaint
them with a key figure in American popular culture and may help
them start to wonder about topics in geography and history.
Families can decipher the tiny pictures together (hint: the more
you already know about Guthrie, the easier this will be), and
creative teachers will have a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely for a younger audience is another tuneful ode to
American soil displayed in horizontal picture format: ``When I
First Came to This Land.'' A new immigrant, who looks to be from
Ireland, arrives with nothing but muscles. Scrambling to make a
life, he acquires a farm (called Muscle-in-My-Arm), a horse (called
I'm-the-Boss) and so on, until the happy days of getting a wife
(Spice-of-My-Life) and son (So-Much-Fun). Humor and rhythm dominate
here, and Simms Taback, a Caldecott Honor winner this year for his
wild and crazy rendition of ``There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a
Fly,'' propels the cumulative verse into a book children will want
to gather around. Cheerful yellow frames surround bold figures
against apricot backgrounds, punctuated by actual stamps, ticket
stubs, photographs of vegetation and newspaper clippings.
Everything floats in Marc Chagallian disarray, with the utter lack
of white space creating an extra-lively pulse.
</P>
<P>
   This version is in no way a scholarly tome, but musical notation
for the song would have been nice, as well as a more extensive
source note than ``brought to Pennsylvania over a century ago by a
German immigrant.'' (For example, at least three of the sources I
checked list the song as written in 1948 by the Canadian folk
singer Oscar Brand.) Preschoolers won't care -- they'll be shouting
along a la ``Old MacDonald Had a Farm,'' another verse that turns
verbal playfulness into a party.

  Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit 
 By Thomas F. O'Boyle 
 Illustrated. 449 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $29.95 
 ------ 
 A LONG WAY FROM THE LIGHT BULB 
 By ROGER LOWENSTEIN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas F. O'Boyle attempts not merely to condemn Jack Welch,
chairman of General Electric and one of the country's most admired
businessmen, but to banish him into darkest exile. Rather than the
stunningly successful executive we thought we knew, O'Boyle's ``At
Any Cost'' presents a thin-skinned monarch who has destroyed a
company and a culture in the pursuit of short-term profit.
According to O'Boyle, an assistant managing editor of The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and a former reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, Welch has increased profits but sold the company's soul.
</P>
<P>
   At the old G.E., a company that Thomas Edison, among others,
founded, ``progress'' was the ``most important product.'' The
company truly did stand for the good things, or at least the good
products, in American life (the ``all-electric home'' of its
pitchman, Ronald Reagan, circa 1954, was featured in company
advertisements). Workers were treated with care, and money was
lavished on research. At Jack Welch's G.E., the company spends less
money on its research laboratory ($1.5 billion in 1997) than its
NBC subsidiary spent to broadcast pro basketball ($1.75 billion).
Quality has slipped; workers are laid off without a moment's
thought; and traditional, nuts-and-bolts businesses like making
toasters have been jettisoned or now play second fiddle to finance.
Worst of all, the thirst for immediate profit has fostered dubious
accounting practices and a series of business and ethical mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle's muckraking is impressive, and so is the list of G.E.'s
embarrassments, running the gamut from fraud in defense contracts
to a bond-trading scandal to a sometimes careless approach to
nuclear safety. In refrigerators and again in jet engines,
designers were forced to meet unrealistic deadlines, resulting in
costly product failures. One G.E. employee involved in PCB
reclamation was told by his supervisors that the toxic chemicals
were ``no worse than a teaspoon of salt''; then lesions broke out
on his face, forearms, thighs and the bottoms of his feet.
Moreover, according to O'Boyle, whenever a whistle-blower has
surfaced, G.E. has tried to destroy him. This account would be more
convincing, however, if O'Boyle had displayed equal resolve at
getting both sides of the story. Generally, he doesn't. O'Boyle
seems more interested in depicting Welch and G.E. as actors in a
``vast American morality play'' in which the chief villain is the
short-term fixation of American business.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle is nostalgic for a time when G.E. was loyal to its
employees and towns, but it's not just G.E. that has changed -- the
world has. And contrary to the author's suggestion, G.E. is not to
blame for America's trade deficit or for its loss of manufacturing
jobs. It almost feels as if O'Boyle has written the wrong book --
blaming G.E. when his real target is the alienated quality of
modern America. Moreover, the transformation of companies like G.E.
is hardly an unmitigated evil. This is one lesson of the crisis in
Asia, where the profit motive was not wholly embraced. Society
functions better -- not perfectly, but better -- when companies
pursue selfish rewards in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle speaks of ``the price that we have paid'' for the fact
that G.E. now does more business with fewer workers. But he has it
exactly wrong. America has reaped a huge dividend: the added goods
and services that G.E.'s former workers contribute in other lines
of work.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle also complains that Welch distanced himself from ``the
human consequences'' of his cost-cutting policies, and that may be
so. However, we are rarely shown the human side of Welch. We learn
that his deeply religious Roman Catholic mother instilled ambition
and self-confidence in him, and that his quiet father, a train
conductor, had little influence on him. As an adolescent in Salem,
Mass., Welch was acutely conscious of having his nose ``pressed
against the glass,'' and he wrote in his high school literary
magazine that he yearned ``to make a million.'' He was captain of
the high school hockey team, and his brash, confrontational style
would set the tone for later. After earning a Ph.D. in chemical
engineering at the University of Illinois, he joined the plastics
division of G.E. in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Welch was so aggressive that he quit playing weekend softball
because his co-workers resented him. Yet what he lacked in polish
(he stammered and swore ``like a longshoreman'') he made up for in
drive, and in 1981, after campaigning on a plank to trim G.E.'s
bureaucracy, he was elevated to chief executive officer. Rather
than applaud this Horatio Alger story, O'Boyle demeans his subject
as someone who meets what he says is Samuel Johnson's definition of
the well-balanced Irishman -- ``a man with chips on both
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   As the book progresses, Welch, the presumed architect of G.E.'s
profit-hungry spirit, is usually in the background, rarely center
stage. O'Boyle fills in the blanks with hearsay and occasional
slurs. For instance, after devoting a paragraph to Welch's
successful turnaround of NBC, he adds that underlings
``speculated'' that the real reason he had hung on to NBC was that
he liked ``hobnobbing with the stars.'' Who wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after discussing the locker room style of the
``boys'' in the plastics division, O'Boyle quotes a woman who was
hired in plastics long after Welch had left. She says that the men
seemed to feel that ungentlemanly behavior (including making crude
advances) was acceptable ``because of the stories that circulated
-- but were never verified -- about Welch's past exploits when he
had been at plastics.'' If you're going to call a guy a sleaze, at
least prove it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle tells us in an author's note that despite having made a
``serious effort,'' he failed to gain access to Welch, among other
targets. Then, as if to acknowledge that he expects his objectivity
to come under attack, he adds, ``Regardless . . . I have done
everything in my power to write a balanced and fair account.'' But
this is precisely what O'Boyle has not done.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, with regard to G.E.'s financial services business,
O'Boyle retells the story of Joseph Jett, a rogue bond trader who
caused a scandal at G.E.'s former Kidder Peabody unit. His
suggestion that Kidder's (and G.E.'s) obsession with the bottom
line fostered unholy temptations is, I think, fair. But nowhere
does O'Boyle address what Welch might, perchance, have done that
was right in financial services. And these services -- lending,
leasing, insurance and so forth -- happen to be Welch's crowning
success.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-COST-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: crowning success.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did G.E. escape so much of the reckless lending that has led
to huge losses at virtually every other house of credit? How did it
become, in effect, the country's most successful bank -- without
getting burned by Orange County, Russia or Donald Trump? O'Boyle
doesn't provide the answer; what is worse, he doesn't pose the
question. Even the fact that G.E.'s finance business has grown
astronomically -- from 8 percent of total profit to 40 percent --
is presented to bolster the negative point that G.E. has
de-emphasized manufacturing, which O'Boyle feels is a superior
calling.
</P>
<P>
   More improbably, O'Boyle ignores Welch's skill at managing an
empire that stretches from light bulbs to superabrasives. Over and
over, we see Welch creating a ``tyranny of numbers'' that
encourages an overly ambitious corporate culture. But it ought to
matter -- just a teeny bit -- that the culture prospered, and did
so despite the prevailing wisdom that conglomerates were too
unwieldy. Indeed, Welch may be remembered most for managing G.E.
successfully in an era when giants like ITT, Westinghouse and AT&AMP;T
were being dismembered. We get a hint of his style when Welch
declares that broadcasting, far from being unique, ``is exactly the
same as the securities business.'' But what similarities does Welch
see? The point is never developed.
</P>
<P>
   The examples of bad business practices that form the heart of
this book are often disturbing and sometimes shocking, but they do
not add up to a total picture of G.E. or of Welch, who has presided
over a phenomenal and sustained increase in earnings. Therefore,
``At Any Cost'' is fatally out of focus from the very start.
O'Boyle begins his tale with an anecdote about a potential deal in
Japan that fell through because of Welch's impatience and disregard
for Japanese protocol. The story is engrossing, but is it
representative?
</P>
<P>
   Welch elevated G.E. from the 11th most valuable American
corporation to the first, and presided over a stock market gain of
1,155 percent in 16 years. That didn't happen only because Neutron
Jack was blowing deals. Once in a while he must have done something
right.

   NEW YORK _ Small kitchens are often efficient, but rarely airy.
When Victoria Koppel, 36, bought a co-op on Manhattan's Upper West
Side, she was unfazed by the 8-by-10-foot kitchen. It was enormous
by her standards. ``It's twice the size of my last kitchen,'' said
Ms. Koppel, a producer with MacKenzie Cutler, a film-editing
company in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   To renovate the space, she hired Robert Young, a Manhattan
architect. The final budget was $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a vista _ a horizontal kitchen not interrupted by a
refrigerator,'' Young said. To create an uncluttered surface, he
installed a dishwasher and two under-the-counter refrigerators.
(One is also part freezer and ice maker.) The refrigerators cost
$900 and $1,100. He kept the original oven.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 29, made the dark space bright with stainless steel for
appliances and a back splash. He made it light with birch-veneer
shelves, stools and cupboards. He designed every inch of the
kitchen to be functional, as if it were a ship's galley.
</P>
<P>
   Drawers and cabinets were designed without knobs. Instead, holes
were cut into them. ``There's no extra hardware,'' Young said,
which means there is less to bump into.
</P>
<P>
   The stainless steel gleams, but not in a cold, industrial way.
Young varied its textures; a tinsmith on the Lower East Side, for
instance, quilted the stainless back splash with a rectangular grid
pattern, which adds a soft shimmer.
</P>
<P>
   To make a storage area under the counter look glamorous, Young
made a beaded curtain to hide detergents, brushes and sponges. He
bought a 100-yard roll of nickel-plated brass beads at Canal
Surplus and used a wire cutter to snip strands to the right length.
For a curtain track, he used a piece of plastic electrical conduit.
The conduit was cut to fit the curve of the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a can of Ajax been so tenderly concealed. It took
Young an hour and a half to make the beaded curtain. ``The original
budget was $10,000, but every centimeter was custom-made.'' Ms.
Koppel said. ``And although the budget doubled, it's an
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The counter space, too small for a rectangular sink, has two
15-inch round stainless-steel sinks, neither one big enough for a
large pot. She has, however, been able to turn out dinners for
seven in this kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koppel is expecting eight guests for Thanksgiving. How is
she going to wash the roasting pan? ``Zabar's is doing the turkey _
not me,'' she said. What about the platter? She said she planned to
rinse it over one sink, and to pour the water off in the other.
</P>
<P>
   The wall above the counter and beneath the cabinets is painted
four shades of green, from gray-green to olive, turquoise and sea
foam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are close but different,'' Young said. ``So you
wonder, is it the quality of light that makes the color look
different, or is it the color of the pigment itself?''
</P>
<P>
   On the shortest wall of the kitchen, Young recycled shelves from
Ms. Koppel's previous apartment, then added a birch-veneer counter
and two stools, creating a tiny space for coffee for two.
</P>
<P>
   In a final nod to detail, and to match the appliances and back
splash, Young replaced the plastic intercom with one made of
stainless steel.

TRUTH COMES IN BLOWS
</HEADLINE>
  A Memoir 
 By Ted Solotaroff 
 Illustrated. 285 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $23.95 
 ------ 
 THE EMPEROR OF PLATE GLASS 
 By DAVID MARGOLICK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to his son, whenever Ben Solotaroff was enjoying
himself, he'd draw his fingers across his lips. When something made
him sad, he'd rub his glasses on his shirttail. He spoke in a
peculiarly portentous tone when he gave someone the lowdown, in a
temporarily (and unconvincingly) gentle tone when he wanted
something. And he had his pet expressions: ``The best is good
enough for me'' or ``I know how to make an impression'' or, when he
wanted to keep you dangling, ``At the proper time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one has keener powers of observation than a child.
And perhaps no child notices or remembers more than one whose quest
for parental love and respect goes unrequited. All this is made
clear by Ted Solotaroff's elegant memoir of his New Jersey
childhood in the days before World War II. For all its pain and
sadness, ``Truth Comes in Blows'' is as touching as gratitude and
forgiveness, as exhilarating as truth. It reveals both the
components that help make an artist _ the loneliness, lack of
approval, sense of differentness _ and the fruits of that art.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, this is a book about a father and a son. By all accounts
(not just his son's) Ben Solotaroff, emperor of the Standard Plate
Glass Company of Elizabeth, N.J., was an astonishingly selfish and
heartless man, someone who sapped the spirit out of those closest
to him. If truth really does come in blows _ the thought comes from
Saul Bellow's ``Henderson the Rain King'' _ so, too, does
humiliation. Yet long after his death, the elder Solotaroff exerts
a powerful hold. Whenever Ted Solotaroff, an editor and critic,
sits at his desk, a tool from his father's trade _ a glass cutter _
is nestled among the pens and pencils of his own.
</P>
<P>
   During the early years of her marriage, Rose Solotaroff, the
wife and mother of the story, liked to sit at the piano and play
Schumann's haunting ``Traumerei,'' a piece that conjures up an
innocent, irretrievable past. There were few such times in the
Solotaroff household. Ben and Rose were, as one family friend put
it, ``ideally unsuited'' for each other; Rose was undisciplined,
sensitive, artistic; Ben was, as someone once called him, a ``deep
brute.'' They fought constantly, with Ben wasting no opportunity to
belittle or stifle his wife. He reduced her to an allowance of a
dollar a day for household expenses (forcing her to steal money
each week for her daughter's piano lessons), aggravated her
arthritis by forcing her to work in his unheated store, regularly
hurled horrifying imprecations at her. ``You make me feel like
going down into the cellar with some rat poison and never having to
see your stupid face again'' was but one.
</P>
<P>
   His father's cruelty forced Ted Solotaroff, even as a young boy,
to play husband to his mother. ``As soon as I'd hear his car start,
I'd get up from my bowl of Ralston, run to her, and put my hands on
her eyes, which in a minute or two would make her stop crying, and
then stroke her hair,''he writes. ``Smiling, she would pull me to
her, gaze at me, and say 'What would I do without you?' '' And yet,
as he realized whenever he was condescending or impatient with his
mother, Solotaroff was also very much his father's son _ ``Little
Benny,'' they called him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the young Solotaroff was spared. Father viewed son, in
the Yiddish idiom of this book, as a luftmensch, someone with his
head in the clouds, destined to suffer, and properly, for his
softness. Petty infractions provoked beatings and threats to
``break your spirit for good.'' Ben Solotaroff discouraged his son
from playing sports, yanked him out of a school play, refused to
pay for his bar mitzvah. The undernourishment wasn't only
figurative. ``He would take the tender part of the steak, the
breast of the chicken, and then push the platter to Mom,''
Solotaroff writes. '' 'Eat bread, kids,' he'd say. 'Don't fill up
on meat.' '' He threatened to kill his son, his wife and himself if
Ted interfered in the stingy divorce settlement he planned to offer
Rose. Age often confers cuteness, but even as a wizened old man Ben
remained uniquely misanthropic.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the book reads like ``Long Day's Journey Into Night''
without the foghorn. Like James Tyrone, the character O'Neill
modeled after his own father, Ben Solotaroff is a cheapskate; when
young Solotaroff breaks his nose, his father refuses to take him to
a doctor. Small wonder, then, that when, shortly before his death,
his elderly father asks him for a massage _ to knead the once
ferocious arms and shoulders _ his son recoils at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   But massage him he does. Solotaroff struggles, as O'Neill did,
to understand and forgive, delving into his father's loveless,
hardscrabble childhood. ``He wasn't only domineering and oblivious
and not to be trusted, he was also unhappy, and unhappiness went a
long way with me,'' he writes of one childhood revelation. ``It was
what I was most at home with and understood.'' He credits his
father with his drive to succeed, if only to prove his old man
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So powerful a presence is the father that ``Truth Comes in
Blows'' drags a bit when he's offstage. This could be a problem,
because so many of Solotaroff's themes are a memoirist's staples:
the sensitive Jewish boy struggling for self-awareness and
independence; the awkward sexual initiation (her name was Honey
Abrams); the neighborhood Irish toughs and high school Aryan
athletes; the anti-Semitism of both low-lifes and Ivy Leaguers;
love for baseball, especially the Brooklyn Dodgers; and crossing
the river (though he is coming from New Jersey, not the usual
Brooklyn) to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, some other vivid personality keeps up
the pace. This book is a powerful reminder of how people live on
through their deeds. Aunt Fan taught him about urban sophistication
and metaphors. Uncle Adrian _ ne Abe, the gay dentist, raconteur
and Upper West Side boulevardier _ turned him on to Charles Beard
and Karl Marx. A busboy named Herb Brichto at the summer beach
hotel told him about oxymorons and J. Alfred Prufrock. Then there
are those finely turned phrases _ for instance, one about a
delinquent school chum: ``The English he was learning to use
resourcefully was on a cue ball.'' Solotaroff devotes his English
to a higher calling, and we're all the beneficiaries.

 'DON'T EVER LISTEN TO A TALKING BUG' 
 By PATRICIA MARX 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to write a blockbuster for the preschool crowd, your
book should feature a fluffy bunny who comes from a two-parent
family and talks about how nice it is in the neighborhood when
everyone smiles. If your audience is older, say 7 and up, the bunny
should not only talk, he should also work the words ``butt'' and
``doofus'' into the story and make reference to flatulence.
``Squids Will Be Squids'' does all of the above, minus the bunny.
And children love it. I know because I read the book to a bunch of
them, ranging in age from 4 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squids'' is a funny collection of warped fables, with morals
like ``It takes one to know one,'' ``Don't ever listen to a talking
bug'' and ``You should always tell the truth. But if your mom is
out having the hair taken off her lip, you might want to forget a
few of the details.'' (The last raises questions you may want to
leave unraised if you are a squeamish parent of a small child.) The
characters include a grasshopper who doesn't do his homework, a
duck-billed platypus who brags, a frog who can't skateboard, a
manipulative pigeon, an indiscreet little walrus, a cheeky piece of
toast, a stuck-up Beef Snak Stik, a bossy book of matches and, of
course, a squid (who's a bit of a drip).
</P>
<P>
   Like some of Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's other picture books,
it sends up the genre it imitates. In ``The Stinky Cheese Man: And
Other Fairly Stupid Tales'' (1992), for example, the ugly duckling
grows up and turns out to be just a really ugly duck. In ``The Math
Curse'' (1995), the world becomes a nightmarish place where every
situation is a verbal math problem (definitely the book to read to
your children if you are in the mood to reminisce about your math
S.A.T.'s). In my favorite, ``The True Story of the Three Little
Pigs'' (1989), the much-maligned Big Bad Wolf tells his side of the
story so persuasively that you may wish President Clinton had used
him as his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to ``Squids Will Be Squids,'' Aesop is
referred to as a ``funny-shaped'' or ``ugly'' guy who told stories
about people but called them animals so he could be snide. Scieszka
aims to follow in this gossipy tradition, offering ``fables that
Aesop might have told if he were alive today and sitting in the
back of class daydreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   As with all successful parodies, though, the reader does not
need to know the original to appreciate the caricature. In fact, a
few youngsters I talked to had no idea what a fable was -- ``Is it
like a fib?'' -- but enjoyed the book nevertheless. ``This book's
the best. Really cool and hilarious,'' a 6-year-old told me. ``Kids
almost 7 and up will love it.'' I asked him what it was about.
``Not a clue!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why do children like this book so much even when it is not
always within their understanding? Here's why, I think: Without
knowing exactly what ``Squids Will Be Squids'' is making fun of,
they know for sure it is making fun of something. The irreverent
tone and the wise-guy vocabulary signal that it is a subversive
book -- a book that a child thinks his parents might not like,
which is a draw for anyone getting ready for the age of rebellion,
or at least staying up until ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane Smith's illustrations are ugly in a good way -- kooky,
dark, not lush. The art suggests ``My First Book of Surrealism'' or
``Dada for the Goo-Goo Set.'' Molly Leach, who is credited with the
book's design, uses a variety of typefaces and sizes in the text,
changing them throughout the book for no reason I could detect.
However, every child I spoke to found such craziness appealing,
perhaps because it is so similar to computer graphics. They like
``Squids Will Be Squids'' for not talking down to them. That and
the fact that the slug gets flattened by a steamroller.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, an adult (and for the sake of this review, I will
consider myself one) will regard this book as more silly than
seditious. While I was initially put off by what I felt was forced
outrageousness, I came to admire the sustained spirit of impiety.
So many children's books carefully transform the wayward character
into a goody-goody who finally eats his spinach, shares his toys or
smiles in the neighborhood. I am grateful for a book that does not.

THE HIDDEN BOOK IN THE BIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  Restored, translated and introduced by Richard Elliott Friedman 
 402 pp. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco. $25 
 ------ 
 THE GENIUS OF J 
 By ROBERT ALTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Elliott Friedman is that rare biblical scholar who is
both able to address a broad audience and willing to raise large
speculative issues about the Bible. His ``Who Wrote the Bible?''
elicited wide interest. In ``The Hidden Face of God'' he made a
vigorous theological argument that the Bible's representation of
God moved progressively from anthropomorphism to abstraction, and
that this process of transcendent abstraction was then projected
forward in intellectual history all the way to Nietzsche and modern
physics. Now, in his new book, he proposes that we can detect in
the Bible, hidden amid the accretions and superimposed
book-divisions of later editors, the earliest long prose masterwork
in world literature, running from the creation story to the death
of David.
</P>
<P>
   He builds on the ``documentary hypothesis'' accepted by most
biblical scholars since the 19th century, but tilts it in a
surprising direction. According to the documentary hypothesis --
which Friedman lucidly explained in ``Who Wrote the Bible?'' -- the
first five books of the Bible, the Torah or Pentateuch, were woven
out of four distinct literary strands or ``documents,''
conventionally designated J, E, P and D. J and E are generally
considered the oldest strands, and the extraordinary literary power
of J has often been admired. (In an appendix, Friedman makes a
trenchant case against certain recent scholars who have sought to
discard these textual divisions and to locate the composition of
the Torah in the Persian or Hellenistic period rather than in the
early centuries of the Davidic dynasty.) ``The Hidden Book in the
Bible'' proposes that J, far from being limited to Genesis, Exodus
and some brief passages in Numbers, is a long narrative work that
was the original core of the Bible, tracing a grand chronological
arc from creation to the death of Moses, through sections of Joshua
and Judges and most of the Book of Samuel to the beginning of
Kings. He makes this argument in an introductory essay, buttressed
by more technical analytical evidence in an appendix. In between
these two, in the bulk of the book, he presents his own translation
of what he conceives as a continuous J narrative, so that readers
can see its literary integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The English version offered here is not quite a freestanding
translation, for it is framed to make visible the verbal evidence
of literary unity. Even so, Friedman's emphatic literalism serves
the Hebrew original rather better than the efforts of most modern
translators to transform it into an everyday modern English
abounding in explanatory paraphrase. He aims for a simple,
rough-hewn diction -- ``big'' instead of ``great,'' ``bad'' instead
of ``evil'' -- and preserves the parallel syntax of the Hebrew. On
the whole, this strategy works well enough, although, coupled with
the literalism, it does produce some flat-footed effects: ``I'm
setting up bad against you from your house''; ``Israel saw the big
hand that YHWH had used''; ``two peoples will be separated from
your insides.'' As the last of these examples suggests, there are
moments when the translation is neither Hebrew idiom nor English:
``their heart was in a good mood''; ``vindicated the case of my
disgrace''; ``Israel acted beaten before them.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the compelling appeal of the book is the thesis,
not the translation. In my view, Friedman, who teaches Hebrew and
comparative literature at the University of California, San Diego,
has devised a challenging, exhilarating theory that will force
biblical scholars to rethink some basic assumptions, but he has not
made a conclusive case. His argument for a single long book written
by J is based on proposed unities of theme, motif and, above all,
language. Much of what he says about theme is extremely
interesting: the emphasis in these stories on sibling rivalry, from
Cain and Abel to the struggles among David's sons; the special
focus on sexual relationships, and on rape in particular; the
repeated concern with spies. Friedman can be impressively
resourceful in seeing connections, as when he notes that at the
beginning of the narrative, Gihon is named as one of the rivers
issuing from Eden, and at the end Solomon is anointed king near the
Gihon brook. Other connections seem more tenuous, such as the
proposal that covering the shivering old David with clothes echoes
the clothing God provides the naked Adam and Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful evidence Friedman marshals is linguistic. He
has put together a table of 50 terms that he claims are distinctive
to this body of material within the biblical corpus. Some of his
instances are statistically striking and will not be easily
dismissed by skeptics. Over half of his examples, however, are
statistically questionable, because if a term occurs only two or
three times altogether, its absence elsewhere may simply mean it is
rare; and cases where there are five occurrences in these texts and
two elsewhere are not convincing proof that a term is distinctive
of J.
</P>
<P>
   Is there, moreover, a single underlying viewpoint in these
texts? Genesis and Samuel are brilliant narratives with distinct
affinities, but in the former God walks the earth and looks like a
man, whereas in the latter He is almost entirely absent from the
human stage. Friedman invokes his thesis of the progressive
occultation of God from ``The Hidden Face of God'' to explain the
disparity, but it seems a bit implausible that a single author
would have shifted grounds so drastically. Friedman properly
celebrates the genius for characterization that created Jacob,
Joseph and David, but what happened to that genius in the books of
Joshua and Judges? And did the writer scandalized by Simeon and
Levi's massacre of Shechem switch moral sensibility in those
blandly approving reports of the massacre of whole populations in
Joshua? Friedman includes the ark narrative (I Samuel 4-7) in his
``Hidden Book'' because in Numbers J is particularly concerned with
the ark of the covenant. But scholarly consensus has concluded with
good reason that the ark narrative is quite different from the
surrounding story in style, theme and theology (it turns on
miracles, reduces human characters to ciphers, drops Samuel
altogether and does not presuppose monarchy).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BIBLE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: presuppose monarchy).) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weakest point of the single-book thesis is its treatment of
literary allusion. Friedman scarcely allows for the possibility
that the author of the David story or other writers might have
known J's narrative of creation and the patriarchs and made
purposeful use of it. The only allusion envisaged is self-allusion.
Thus, Friedman cites the grisly story in Judges 19 of the concubine
gang-raped to death at Gibeah as evidence of a single author
because it quotes extensively, nearly verbatim, from the Sodom
story in Genesis. There, as in Judges, two strangers are taken in
as guests and the townsmen surround the house intending rape.
Literary precedent suggests that such elaborate recycling and
transformation of an antecedent model is more likely to be the work
of a later writer putting new spin on an old text than of a writer
repeating himself. (Consider the re-use in ``The Waste Land'' of
Shakespeare's evocation of Cleopatra, ``The Chair she sat in, like
a burnished throne. . . .'') The writer's point in Judges 19 is
that in his fallen, politically savage world there are no saving
angels, so this time similar circumstances end in bloody
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   THE rape of Tamar (II Samuel 13) is a related use of allusion to
define thematic reversal. Amnon's words to his sister before the
rape, ``Clear out everyone around me'' (my translation), are the
very words Joseph pronounces before revealing himself to his
brothers. The dialogue between Amnon and Tamar as he pulls her into
his bed quotes the dialogue between Potiphar's wife and Joseph in
her unsuccessful sexual assault on him. Finally, we learn that
Tamar, like Joseph at the beginning of his story, is wearing a coat
of many colors. The Joseph story, then, has been invoked in reverse
chronological order to represent an act of fraternal violation
instead of fraternal reconciliation. Perhaps the same writer wrote
both stories, but it seems more likely that one writer was
purposefully transforming another's material.
</P>
<P>
   There are other unanswered questions. Occasionally, for example,
the David story alludes not to J but to E -- as when Michal's
deception of her father to enable David's escape (I Samuel 19)
explicitly invokes Rachel's deception of her father in hiding the
stolen household gods (Genesis 31). But whatever the unresolved
issues, Friedman has put forth a bold thesis that should give
everyone pause. Some of his arguments are strong enough to make
even a doubter wonder whether, after all, he might not be right.

THE TALE OF THE 1002ND NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  By Joseph Roth 
 Translated by Michael Hofmann 
 261 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $23.95 
 ------ 
 SCHEHERAZADE IN VIENNA 
 By IAIN BAMFORTH 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1914-18 war was called a ``world'' war, Joseph Roth said in
one of his brilliant journalistic forays, ``not because the entire
world had conducted it but because, owing to it, we all lost a
world, our world.'' That world was the Austro-Hungarian Dual
Monarchy, a most unlikely force to hold sway over European
politics. When Joseph Roth was born in 1894 in the Galician town of
Brody, an eastern outpost, it had long been threatening to collapse
if given a push.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian policy, as many contemporaries noted, was a continual
struggle to save face; it created a world of appearances doing its
utmost to ignore reality. Of no institution was this truer than the
Austrian Army, which was full of gloriously outfitted aristocrats
on little pay and with rusty equipment _ until reality finally
obtruded on the Eastern Front in 1914. After the war Austria lost
nearly everything, including its monarchy, and was reduced to a
rump of its original territory. Yet this unwieldy empire that
stretched to the Mediterranean, with its 15 official languages and
deeply conservative Catholicism, with its Jewish and Moslem
subjects, left a mark on the 20th century like no other nation. Out
of Vienna, its vaunted capital, in those golden years before the
war came signal achievements in the arts and philosophy, and the
prose and program of Hitler's ``Mein Kampf.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a soldier in the Austrian Army, probably at a
desk job, Roth became a correspondent for a number of German
newspapers in the 1920's. Initially sympathetic to the Red cause in
the civil war fought around his hometown (the Russian writer Isaac
Babel wrote about Brody in his tense ``Red Cavalry'' stories), Roth
began a 10-year association in 1923 with the Frankfurter Zeitung,
one of Germany's best newspapers, renowned for its exacting
literary standards. Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch were also
associated with the paper, but Roth went out of his way to avoid
them _ he had little time for intellectual writers.
</P>
<P>
   He preferred to hit the road, filing copy to the newspaper from
all over Europe: Albania, the Soviet Union, Poland, France and
Mussolini's Italy. His articles were widely read and brought him
handsome fees; some were collected as ``Wandering Jews'' (1927), an
account of the hard life of the eastern Jews, scapegoats to all,
not least to their assimilated western cousins in Vienna. Roth
developed his mature style early and thereby staked his claim to
literary fame. He eschewed the self-protective ironic distance of
an intellectual like Robert Musil _ whose witty toilet term for the
former empire, ``Kakania,'' did not go down well with Roth _
favoring the emotions of someone participating in history itself.
There are more than 3,000 pages of reportage in the collected
German edition of his works, and his colleague Soma Morgenstern was
later to claim, somewhat disingenuously in view of the seamlessness
of Roth's two activities, that his journalism was in fact his
greater accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   When Hitler came to power in 1933, Roth severed all ties with
Germany. He went to live in Paris on the fame of his novel ``The
Radetzky March,'' wrote for emigre publications and, already a
drinker, drank harder than ever. He wrote much as he always had,
sitting at the Hotel Cafe de la Poste near the Luxembourg Gardens,
glass at hand. By then he had become an active monarchist,
addressing Otto, the exiled son of the last Hapsburg Emperor of
Austria, as ``Your Majesty.'' Roth's patriotism was a source of
amusement, and irritation, to his fellow exiles. It was, however,
no escapism. He continued writing to the end, never losing, like so
many exiles, his sense of vocation. What he called the ``grace of
misery'' kept him imaginatively supple, even in trying
circumstances. He died in May 1939 in a Paris hospital, of
pneumonia and acute alcohol withdrawal, leaving a threadbare suit,
an overcoat and his manuscripts; and was interred in the Cimetiere
Thiais, now a rather desolate place in a run-down region of outer
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tale of the 1002nd Night'' _ originally published by the
Dutch house De Gemeenschap in 1939, when Austria had ceased to
exist at all _ commemorates Vienna, the city recalled from a time
when ``the world was deeply and frivolously at peace.'' It is a
novel redolent of Vienna's streets and smells, its social rankings
and architecture, and the whole contraption of administration that
made Austria possible. Its title hints at a level of artificiality
unusual for Roth: Michael Hofmann, the translator, calls it a
``fairy story that has swallowed a novel.'' Based on a visit by the
Shah of Persia to Europe in 1873, it finds the ``Shah-in-Shah''
sojourning in the city the Ottomans failed to take by storm in the
17th century. Not satisfied with his 365 wives, the Shah wishes to
sleep with a beautiful countess espied at a ball in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   It falls to the Captain of Horse, Baron Taittinger, a character
singularly lacking in insight but with a certain savvy in such
matters, to fix the assignation. He replaces the countess, married
and unobtainable, with his ex-mistress, Mizzi Schinagl, an ordinary
Viennese girl who happens to resemble her. It is, he says, an
``approximation'': Mizzi works as a prostitute in a brothel. The
Shah remains oblivious of the deception practiced on him, and
afterwards sends Mizzi a string of pearls. The pearls must give off
a subtle poison, since the lives of all who come in contact with
them go awry; only the pearls remain unaltered, increasing fourfold
in value in the course of the book.
</P>
<P>
   As the story unfolds, social distinctions lose meaning, and
money becomes a corrupting agent of exchange: having brought a Shah
to a brothel, it brings the establishment's madam, Frau Matzner, to
live in a respectable part of town; Mizzi, who sells the pearls for
a fabulous sum, to prison for selling fake Brussels lace; and a
gutter journalist, Lazik, to write a penny dreadful of Taittinger's
role as pimp. Shamed out of the army, and burdened by Mizzi and
their illegitimate son, Taittinger ends up purchasing for his
mistress, once she gets out of prison, a garish waxworks _ the new
World Bioscope Theater _ on the Prater with money he hardly has.
</P>
<P>
   The supernumerary Arabian Night, the 1002d, returns to haunt the
fairy tale like a scandal: the Shah returns to Vienna, farcically
recapitulating his original visit. By now the novel has swallowed
its own tail. Mizzi, the original double, appears, to Taittinger's
chagrin, as a variety act in his waxwork show, in a tableau of the
story of the pearls. Unable to return to the army (the Shah's visit
has frozen all official business), Taittinger shoots himself, his
life having become as waxy as everything in the panopticon he owns.
And in this piling up of simulacra and doubles, Roth concludes with
a chilling little cameo from the World Bioscope waxworker himself:
``I might be capable of making figures that have heart, conscience,
passion, emotion and decency. But there's no call for that at all
in the world. People are only interested in monsters and freaks, so
I give them their monsters. Monsters are what they want!''
</P>
<P>
   For all its lightheartedness the story ends on a note of dread:
Roth is unsettingly capable of writing in serious and comic modes
at the same time, a register that Michael Hofmann, who is rapidly
becoming an indispensable translator, captures with consummate
skill.
</P>
<P>
   We catch a sense of Roth's sad adoration of his vanished
Austria-Hungary when Taittinger returns to his estate in the
Carpathians: ``The Mayor _ Wenk _ was a German, one of a scattering
of Saxon colonists who lived in the area. The steward was from
Moravia, the peasants were Carpathian Russians, the now-deaf
footman was a Hungarian, who had completely forgotten where he had
come from, and when and why. . . . The forester was a Ruthenian
from Galicia; the Police Sergeant came from Bratislava.'' We don't
have to share the myth to feel that his appeal on behalf of ethnic
groups in the central Europe of the 1920's and 30's has immediate
relevance to the Europe of today. That is an extraliterary
justification for reading Roth, though his wonderful style should
be reason enough _ for the way it plunges us into the swim of time,
so cold it feels warm, and just for a night.

  The United States in Central America, 1977-1992 
 By William M. LeoGrande 
 773 pp. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. $39.95 
 ------ 
 DITHERING IN CENTRAL AMERICA 
 By THOMAS CAROTHERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foremost among the new truisms about United States foreign
policy in the 1990's is that as a nation America lacks the clarity
of purpose of the cold war era. Whereas Americans were supposedly
once united around the task of containing Soviet Communism, they
are now, it is frequently lamented, bereft of any unifying external
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one need look back no farther than to Washington's
involvement in Central America in the 1980's to recall that at
times during the cold war the United States was in fact deeply
divided about its world role. The Reagan Administration's strenuous
efforts to combat leftist rebels in El Salvador and a leftist
Government in Nicaragua provoked sharp splits not just within the
policy elite but among the public as well. The various flash points
of United States intervention in the 1990's _ like Bosnia, Haiti,
Iraq and Somalia _ have all provoked domestic debates about the
appropriate American role, but never of the same intensity and
duration as the old screaming matches over Central America.
</P>
<P>
   William M. LeoGrande, a professor of government at American
University, takes a long, retrospective look at this turbulent
topic in ``Our Own Backyard.'' Although he starts with the Carter
years and ends with the Bush Administration, his focus is very much
the Reagan period. And while his stated subject is Central America,
like the Reagan Administration itself he concentrates almost
exclusively on two countries, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   LeoGrande asserts that the United States debate over Central
American policy was rooted in two contesting foreign policy visions
that emerged out of Vietnam. Liberals were wary of seeing the
Soviet hand in every third world conflict, or of using military
force and supporting repressive anti-Communists in the name of
democracy. Conservatives were steadfastly suspicious of Soviet
intentions, ready to intervene when necessary to ``hold the line''
and willing to live with politically flawed allies.
</P>
<P>
   For the entire decade of the 1980's Washington was consumed in
endless arguments over whether the leftist rebellions in Central
America were local fights or Soviet-Cuban provocations, whether
United States support for the Salvadoran military and the
Nicaraguan contras was morally defensible and whether the stated
goal of democracy was rhetorical or real. Despite these debates,
the post-Vietnam division over cold war policy was never really
healed. It was simply eclipsed by events, buried in the enthusiasm
over the fall of the Berlin wall and the breakup of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   LeoGrande's copious study is generally skillful and accessible.
He takes the reader confidently through a complex, often tortuous
story, starting with the Carter Administration's paralyzing
uncertainty about how to respond to the fall of the Nicaraguan
President, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, through the bitter Washington
battles over human rights in El Salvador and aid to the Nicaraguan
contras, to the Iran-contra affair and ultimately the 1990
Nicaraguan elections that ended Sandinista rule. Throughout, the
analysis is thorough and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the points LeoGrande scores are telling. The Reagan
Administration appears as either blind to or cynically dismissive
of the wrongs committed by the military forces it supported, prone
to ignoring or deceiving the American public and stubbornly opposed
to peace initiatives until the bitter end. The limited but real
achievements of Reagan's policy in the region came at a very high
price to many Central Americans, and to the United States' image in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its strengths, LeoGrande's book is unlikely to change
many minds. It is a comprehensive version of the standard liberal
critique, a critique already well developed in the 1980's. Although
not tendentious, it is also not especially challenging. The author
conveys little in-depth feel for the internal politics of El
Salvador or Nicaragua. His relentless Washington focus ironically
results in his analysis reproducing the same shortcoming for which
he rightly faults the Reagan policy _ projecting internal debates
onto a poorly lighted foreign screen.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, LeoGrande takes little advantage of the passage of
time to find a perspective outside the territory of past debates.
He is still incredulous over Reagan's simplistic world view and
Oliver North's illicit schemes. The book is more a continuation of
the old arguments than a rethinking or reformulation of the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, LeoGrande fails to bolster the perennial weak spot of
the liberal critique _ the question of alternatives. Given that
supporting the Salvadoran military and the Nicaraguan contras put
us in a moral morass, what other possibilities were there? Should
the United States have simply lived with a leftist regime in
Nicaragua and the probable emergence of one in El Salvador? If so,
what would this have meant for those countries, the region and
United States policy elsewhere? His only hint of an answer is the
unconvincing assertion that Carter's policy toward the Sandinistas
was ``both realistic and successful, as far as it went.'' Yet by
mid-1980, United States-Nicaraguan relations were already on a path
toward confrontation over Sandinista support for the Salvadoran
rebels. Even less credible is LeoGrande's suggestion that the
radicalization of the Sandinistas was due to the Reagan hard-line
policy. Not all Central American dictators were United States-made.
</P>
<P>
   If not willing to live with leftist regimes in Central America,
how could the United States have prevented the Salvadoran rebels
from coming to power and the Sandinistas from consolidating
dictatorial rule without aiding dubious military forces? There may
be answers to this question, but they are not in LeoGrande's book.
He suggests in passing that the United States could have brokered a
peace in El Salvador in the early 1980's, but he presents no
evidence that the rebels and the Government were anywhere near
being ready to live with each other at that stage.
</P>
<P>
   By not facing head on the truly difficult predicaments presented
by Central America, LeoGrande leaves the old debate unresolved.
Even as the cold war recedes into history, it seems likely that, as
with Vietnam, the past disagreements about Central America will not
soon be replaced by any common understanding.

 OH DAD, POOR DAD 
 By RANDY COHEN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the duty of every loving parent to lie to his children. If
they are to grow up confident, cheerful and eager for new
experience, the young must believe that the world is a warm and
welcoming place, an idea that is supportable only by tender and
relentless deception. (There is, of course, ample time later for
these strong, happy, self-assured creatures gradually to learn a
darker truth.) And so it would be foolish to demand verisimilitude
in picture books. But are the nonsensical ideas about fatherhood
presented by these two the ideal lies for the formative years?
</P>
<P>
   Written in the 1940's by Margaret Wise Brown, author of the
immortal and soporific ``Goodnight Moon,'' ``The Little Scarecrow
Boy'' is now a picture book, with illustrations by David Diaz, who
won the Caldecott Medal for his dark illustrations for ``Smoky
Night.'' The text presents a durable bit of mendacity: that fathers
pass on to their sons the virile lore of a lifetime. The young hero
yearns for a kind of Robert Bly manhood as a crow-fighting warrior.
But it is only when the Scarecrow Boy learns the skills of his
father that he can be a real man, albeit one stuffed with straw.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is nostalgic, it is rural and it is false, or at best
anachronistic. What paternal knowledge remains for us today -- that
of the corporate lawyer, the assistant professor of cultural
studies, the Wall Street analyst? Even the modern farmer has little
to leave beyond a practical grasp of Agriculture Department
subsidies. How demoralizing for a modern dad to read this treacle
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, these are at least pretty lies. The Diaz illustrations
are rich with summer cornfield colors -- yellows, reds and oranges.
Big, appealing scarecrow grins arc across the page. Younger
children will most likely enjoy mimicking the Scarecrow Boy's six
frightening faces. And older dads may find a small compensation in
noticing that what ultimately drives off the crows may be not the
boy's scary face No. 6 but the more mature glowering of the
scarecrow dad standing behind his boy, explaining how to set the
VCR. Well, O.K., maybe not the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   And the stuffed mother? She's in the kitchen. While it may not
be fair to judge the customs of the past by those of the present,
there is something off-putting about gender roles so blithely
assigned to piles of hay. The parents are referred to as ``a
scarecrow and his scarecrow wife.'' She's not even a straight-ahead
scarecrow in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled to the kitchen, Mrs. S. is at least visibly present; the
mother in ``Jazper'' is long gone. Presumably she walked out on her
loser insect husband, who seems to have no pride, no prospects and
no property. Here's what we know about him: ``Jazper and his dad
lived together in a rented eggshell on the south side of Bugtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The roles of father and son are disturbingly reversed. It is
young Jazper who reads to his dad, not the other way around. And
when his dad is thrown out of work by an industrial mishap that we
must infer stemmed from his own blundering ('' 'There was an
accident at the tomato plant,' moaned his dad. 'I'll be out of work
for weeks. Oh, how will we pay the rent?' ``), it is Jazper who --
school be damned -- must now support this amiable incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, these books are opposites. The scarecrow father is
rural and capable; Jazper's dad is urban and useless. The cornfield
illustrations are big and simple: a rising summer sun takes up half
a two-page spread. The Bugtown scene is dense with comic detail.
Richard Egielski, who won the Caldecott Medal for his illustrations
for the delightful ``Hey, Al,'' draws a busy Bugtown, where insect
commuters ride a dragonfly bus and savvy bug builders make houses
out of soda cups and old cans. His pictures are pleasantly
reminiscent of Dave Fleischer's 1941 animated feature ``Hoppity
Goes to Town,'' the adventures of a grasshopper in Bugville, a
vacant lot only 45 inches from Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   These, then, are our choices -- a scarecrow dad with the phony
omniscience of ``Father Knows Best'' or an insect dad played as the
grinning sit-com boob of a later era. If we read these to our
children, they may indeed grow up bold and buoyant, but we dads
will be too morose to notice.

PROBABILITY 1
</HEADLINE>
  Why There Must Be Intelligent Life in the Universe 
 By Amir D. Aczel 
 230 pp. New York: Harcourt Brace &AMP; Company. $22 
 ------ 
 E.T. 
 By JOHN DURANT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every thoughtful person wonders about the possibility that life
exists elsewhere in the universe. Hollywood has made a lot of money
from movies based on the assumption that alien life-forms exist;
and now Amir D. Aczel sets out to prove they do _ although there
has been no well-authenticated ``contact,'' and despite the fact
that life on earth is the only life we actually know.
</P>
<P>
   Aczel is a mathematician, and his approach to the problem is to
try to calculate the probability that life exists on at least one
other planet. In gambling terms his title, ``Probability 1,''
means: take the bet; it's a certainty. Aczel assures us we can be
confident that alien life-forms are out there just waiting to be
discovered. Now, all my sympathies are with him. I hope very much
there is life elsewhere in the universe _ if there isn't, what a
terribly boring place the rest of the universe will turn out to be!
But so far as proof is concerned, Aczel's argument leaves me
entirely unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   I have no quarrel with the way Aczel tackles the problem. His
starting point is a famous equation invented by the astronomer
Frank Drake in 1961. Drake was a pioneer in the quest for
extraterrestrial intelligence through the search for alien signals
arriving from deep space. He wanted to know how many civilizations
in space are currently capable of communicating with other
civilizations. Drake's equation breaks the question down into a
series of discrete steps: first, estimate how many potentially
suitable extraterrestrial homes there are; then calculate how many
of those are inhabited by extraterrestrial life-forms; and then
establish how many of these life-forms have managed to invent
satellite dishes or their equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, ``Probability 1'' is a review of Drake's equation in
the light of scientific evidence. Aczel argues convincingly that
the number of planets suitable for life is extremely large. There
are about 300 billion stars in our galaxy and possibly 100 billion
galaxies in the universe _ which would yield
30,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in the universe. Some may
quarrel with Aczel's claim that as many as half of these stars can
be presumed to have planets, and that on average one in nine of
these planets is suitable for life; but few, I think, will disagree
with his conclusion that there are a very large number of planets
suitable for life.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble starts when we come to estimate the probability that
life will emerge on any of these planets. The problem is that we
don't have a good theory of the origin of life on earth. Without
one, it is anybody's guess how likely this event actually was. Out
of thin air Aczel conjures the figure of 1 in a trillion for this
likelihood and concludes that the probability of life existing on
at least one other planet is virtually 1.
</P>
<P>
   This is statistical sleight of hand. What if the real value for
this crucial probability is far, far smaller? What if, in fact, the
probability of life appearing in any one suitable home is tiny in
relation to the number of suitable homes available? Now the answer
to our question changes. Instead of the probability approaching 1,
it can just as easily approach 0. By adjusting the value of the
probability of life appearing, we can make the probability of life
existing elsewhere in the universe pretty much anything we like.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are extremely powerful and important, and Aczel is a
very clear and capable exponent of them. But statistics cannot
substitute for empirical knowledge about the way the universe
behaves. We now have no plausible way of arriving at robust
estimates for the probability of life arising spontaneously when
the conditions are right. So, until we either discover
extraterrestrial life or understand far more about how at least one
form of life _ terrestrial life _ first appeared, we can do little
more than guess at the likelihood that life exists elsewhere in the
universe. And as long as we're merely guessing, we should not dress
up our interesting speculations as mathematical certainties.

 IT'S ACADEMIC 
 By DAVID GATES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what they say in those catchpenny fiction-writing
manuals, a novelist can get away with a protagonist who's a bore, a
blowhard, a pill. Roth and Updike do it all the time; we sit still
for their often wrongheaded heroes because now and then their
creators vouchsafe us a wink or a roll of the eyes. In Tim Parks's
ninth novel, ``Europa,'' we keep waiting for some sign that he
doesn't take his narrator, Jerry Marlow, as seriously as Marlow
takes himself. Marlow shares with us at great length on such topics
as political correctness and the blandness of contemporary European
culture; he delivers such brow-smiting apercus as ``The condition
we live in is one of intimacy and distance.'' But as page after
page goes by and Parks still hasn't slapped him down, it becomes
dishearteningly clear that Marlow's fusty heterodoxy is supposed to
make him a significant figure.
</P>
<P>
   Marlow, an expatriate Brit, teaches at a university in Milan;
he's one of those academic sweat hogs novelists love to use as
their literary stunt doubles. His midlife love affair with a
colleague broke up his marriage; now his mistress's infidelity has
broken up the affair, but he's still obsessed. He and the beloved
aren't on speaking terms, and they've both joined a delegation of
faculty members and chummy students on a bus to Strasbourg, where
the teachers will lobby the European Parliament to save their jobs.
Marlow delivers an address and declines an opportunity to bed the
beloved for old times' sake; aside from that, Parks doesn't give
him a lot to do, and devotes much of the book to flashbacks and
inner bloviation.
</P>
<P>
   What energy there is comes from Marlow's doppelganger, Vikram
Griffiths, a borderline-probable Indo-Welshman who steals scenes by
default. True, he's less a character than a mix-and-match
assemblage of eccentricities, but he's easier to swallow than
Marlow's beloved, a Frenchwoman who combines naughty expertise in
the boudoir (but of course!) with high-end pedantry: ``So we read
Chateaubriand and Benjamin Constant and the Duchesse d'Abrantes and
Michelet, which had been her special area of study, and we read
Xenophon and Thucydides and Plato and Aristophanes, which had been
my area of study, and we discussed them together, usually after
making love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marlow, the quixotic defender of boundaries (whether
political, intellectual, interpersonal or sexual), she's a wet
dream. For the reader, though, she's a cipher. We get the sinking
feeling that she's somehow to be identified with the mythic Europa
_ there's no other visible reason for the title _ presumably
because she has a complex of supposedly ``European'' attributes:
sensuality, intellectuality, moral fluidity. Parks withholds her
actual name until the last lines of the book. This device seems
intended to set her apart, but the effect is to render her even
more distant.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Parks doesn't have his head on straight: he hates
trendy blather and values the sovereign individual above the
tyrannical group. (Who doesn't?) It's just that he tends to forget
he's writing a novel. Early on, he shoots for the Woolfian sublime,
in which layers of perception, memory and cognition interpenetrate
in an instant of consciousness: ``How remarkable . . . that while
listening to Vikram Griffiths . . . and while observing Doris Rohr
. . . trying to find the space between one seat and the next to
cross her thick legs . . . how remarkable that while taking all
this in, and at the same time allowing once again the complex
misery triggered, absurdly, by the name Napoleon to explode in your
mind, you are nevertheless still able to marvel at the
extraordinariness of a brain that can do all this at once.''
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Europa'' wears on, Parks settles for punctuating
Marlow's internal filibuster with a periodic ``I thought'' _ or, if
he's especially conscience-stricken about the neglected narrative,
something along the lines of ``. . . I thought, watching the young
man flap his duster across the plastic surface.'' Parks may be an
old pro, but this is amateur stuff. All the fiction-writing manuals
warn against such self-indulgence, but it's still a bad idea.

TURNING JAPANESE
</HEADLINE>
  By David Galef 
 Permanent Press, paper, $16  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his second novel, TURNING JAPANESE (Permanent Press, paper,
$16), David Galef captures the allure and peril of living as an
expatriate. And through the eyes of his young narrator, a
22-year-old aspiring writer named Cricket Collins, we see the
experience not just for Cricket and his fellow Americans but also
for those Britons and Australians who join them as English teachers
in Japan, flocking to the Orient in search of an alternative to the
traditional European adventure. It is the late 1970's, when life in
Japan is particularly enticing to an aimless recent college
graduate, and Cricket and his peers find the elegant beauty of the
tea ceremony, the calming discipline of Aikido and the politeness
of the Japanese people to be both alien and irresistible. But Galef
adds a layer of complexity to this account of Cricket's adventures,
revealing the vulnerability that may result from too rapid an
effort to shed one's own cultural skin. When Cricket hooks up with
a Japanese girlfriend, he hopes their relationship will increase
his sense of well-being, making him feel more firmly established in
her country. Not surprisingly, and much to his chagrin, his
contentment is brief -- and is followed by a breakdown that leaves
him weakened and shamed. In the months that follow, as Cricket must
choose between returning to a homeland where he no longer truly
feels at home and remaining in a place where he may never be truly
accepted, Galef produces a chilling denouement for this nicely
detailed exploration of cultural dislocation. _ PAULA FRIEDMAN

   &UR; JOSANIE'S WAR &QL; 
 &UR; By Karl H. Schlesier &QL; 
 &UR; University of Oklahoma, $22.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late spring of 1885, five bands of Chiricahua Apaches
decided to flee their reservation in Arizona, setting off the last
great Apache war. This novel follows the fortunes of one of these
groups, led by an Indian war captain named Josanie, as it struggles
against the combined military might of the United States and
Mexico. Brief alternating chapters present the action from both
sides, including incendiary news clippings, thus providing the
social context in which the tribe embarks on one last fight for its
land. But the anthropological detail by which Karl H. Schlesier
illustrates the Apaches' resourcefulness, spirituality and humanity
gets in the way of his storytelling. With little character
development, the individuals in his pages wind up being largely
indistinguishable; what's missing is fiction's imaginative leap
into feeling. ``Josanie's War'' is a readable and informative
re-creation of a tragic episode in the history of the American
West. Through its detailed documentation, it takes us into a harsh
world, showing how injustice and prejudice proved despicably,
needlessly destructive. But as a novel, it fails to explore the
internal war that must have gripped these warriors just as
fiercely. _ PETER BRICKLEBANK

   &UR; SAVAGE LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; By James Rogers &QL; 
 &UR; Serpent's Tail, paper, $12.99 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set in London as the grasping '80s give way to the uncertain
'90s, bursting with foul language and fouler deeds, ``Savage Life''
follows the violent misadventures of Gaz Hoskins, an aspiring
burglar from the lower classes, and Colin Nutter, a rudderless life
insurance salesman with a tenuous grip on yuppiedom. What connects
these two sorry souls is the vile personage of Dorian Savage.
Misanthropic, immoral and rich, he's Colin's boss and personal
hero. Somehow, the hapless Gaz becomes convinced that Dorian is his
long-lost father and begins a plaintive quest for recognition that
sets in motion a train wreck of events. Three murders (and one
attempted murder) ensue, and no one comes to a good end by the
close of this aptly titled work. Full of vivid writing, the novel
brings to mind some of Martin Amis's dark comedies. Like Amis,
James Rogers has a talent for measuring the class divide and
bringing odious characters to life. Unfortunately, he skimps when
it comes to the central character of Colin, whose past history is
perfunctorily disgorged late in the novel. The book's weakest link,
Colin seems merely an alcohol-soaked nincompoop -- or is he
something more? If you're curious, ``Savage Life'' will keep you
reading to the bitter -- and I do mean bitter -- end. _ EILS LOTOZO

   &UR; FLORA'S SUITCASE &QL; 
 &UR; By Dalia Rabinovich &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Flamingo, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dalia Rabinovich's first novel tells the story of Flora and Dave
Grossenberg, a young Jewish couple who leave America for Colombia
in the 1930's, intent on starting a business with his extended
family. Told primarily from Flora's point of view, the novel traces
the couple's arduous journey and their trials and tribulations in
Medellin. Unfortunately, this basic plot is marred by bizarre
twists that are introduced with great fanfare only to vanish almost
immediately. Worse yet, Rabinovich plunges headlong into her own
brand of magic realism, in which physical characteristics are
erased by acts of nature and people can sleep for 10 days and
awaken with no memory of their previous lives or language. Despite
the exotic surroundings in which their story unfolds, the
characters in ``Flora's Suitcase'' have interior lives that remain,
for the most part, featureless and colorless, unknown to the
reader. _ BETSY GROBAN

   &UR; NO SAFE PLACE &QL; 
 &UR; By Richard North Patterson &QL; 
 &UR; Knopf, $25.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable coincidence of bad luck for Bill Clinton and good
luck for Richard North Patterson has conferred topicality upon ``No
Safe Place,'' Patterson's torrid, breathlessly plotted novel about
a sexually compromised Presidential candidate and the female
journalist he loves. Kerry Kilcannon has risen from the boxing gyms
of Newark to the United States Senate. Though his older brother,
James, was killed while campaigning for the presidency, Kerry still
wants to pry the Democratic nomination away from the vapid Vice
President, Dick Mason. Unfortunately, Kilcannon harbors a secret --
a passionate affair with a reporter named Lara Costello that may
have resulted in an abortion. Patterson's vastly contrived plot
puts Lara into the press corps on the Kilcannon campaign, while
Sean Burke, a fanatical anti-abortion crusader, decides that
Kilcannon should die for his abortion rights views. Cutting rapidly
between Burke's determined stalking and the machinations of a
loathsome reporter who's out to reveal Kerry and Lara's liaison,
Patterson offers mawkish, rites-of-passage flashbacks, treating the
practice of politics as he does the law in his popular legal
thrillers. There, as lonely, well-intentioned professionals get
their fill of sex, sensationalism and scheming villains, love
conquers what it must and heroes always do the right thing. _ BILL

   &UR; A LIFE FOR A LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; By Ernest Hill &QL; 
 &UR; Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Earl visits a 15-year-old boy named D'Ray in his
prison cell, he whispers ``in a voice laced with a bone-chilling
calmness: 'Everything you took from me, you gonna give it back.'''
Despite this seeming threat, Ernest Hill's second novel, ``A Life
for a Life,'' isn't about revenge. Not much earlier, D'Ray had been
given another ultimatum by a ruthless dope dealer who was holding
D'Ray's 10-year-old brother, Little Man, hostage for $100 the older
boy owed him: ``You ain't back with my money in a hour, you can
tell your mama she got one less mouth to feed.'' Desperate, D'Ray
decided to rob a convenience store and in the process fatally shot
the store's young clerk. The murder confirmed what his mother and
the people around him always expected: ``It's just a matter of time
before he end up like World'' -- his father, a convicted murderer.
But Henry Earl, the dead clerk's father, has an agenda. Earl's son,
Stanley, was an honor student who won a National Merit Scholarship;
somehow, D'Ray will be made to fulfill some of that promise. And
so, through the years of D'Ray's incarceration, Henry Earl
faithfully visits him, hoping to inspire him to move forward. Hill
is a skilled storyteller, and though ``A Life for a Life'' is a
straightforward account of the conflicting forces that shape the
lives of young men like D'Ray, he keeps the reader in suspense.
Despite Henry Earl's iron determination, D'Ray's redemption is far
from a foregone conclusion. _ FRAN HANDMAN

 THE DJINN IN THE NIGHTINGALE'S EYE 
 Five Fairy Stories 
 By A. S. Byatt 
 Vintage International, $12  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These fairy tales may be full of magic and quests, but they're
also spun from contemporary cloth as they explore the lives of
characters who feel imprisoned by their prescribed fate. ``Byatt is
a storyteller who could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for
a thousand and one nights,'' Nancy Willard wrote here in 1997.

   &UR; HUNTING MISTER HEARTBREAK &QL; 
 &UR; A Discovery of America &QL; 
 &UR; By Jonathan Raban &QL; 
 &UR; Vintage Departures, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This English author displays a quirky eye and restless energy in
his account of a two-year odyssey to American locales as varied as
Alabama, Seattle and New York, where he indulges in a full-scale
cultural deconstruction of Macy's department store. ``In an era of
jet tourism, he remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of .
. . Robert Louis Stevenson,'' Justin Kaplan wrote in these pages in
1991. ``He has a gift for vivid observation, description, anecdote
and personal encounter.'' Soft City (Harvill, $12), an earlier book
by Raban that has just been restored to print, is both a sharp
portrait of London and its comfortable middle-class young in the
1970's and a spirited defense of urban life. '' 'Soft City' shows
how, in the midst of physical decay, a city can flourish by
fulfilling an elemental human need, the need to play out fantasies
of self,'' Richard Sennett said here in 1974.

   This translation of Homer's tale of the Trojan War is marked by
free, cadenced lines and simple, direct language that resembles

Taplin wrote here of Fagles in 1990. ``His version is imbued with

   &UR; IMPEACHMENT: A HANDBOOK &QL; 
 &UR; By Charles L. Black Jr. &QL; 
 &UR; Yale University, $6.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a guide written during the Watergate era but reissued in the
shadow of the Clinton impeachment investigation, a constitutional
scholar stresses the need for caution and common sense as he
outlines the process for removing a President from office. In 1974
our reviewer, Mary Ellen Gale, called this an ``elegantly written,
lucid, intelligent and comprehensive handbook.''

   &UR; THE SPRINGS OF AFFECTION &QL; 
 &UR; Stories of Dublin &QL; 
 &UR; By Maeve Brennan &QL; 
 &UR; Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These 21 tales by a former writer for The New Yorker who died in
1993 dwell on the small joys, hurts and unrealized dreams tucked
away in the red-brick houses of a single Dublin neighborhood.
``Brennan's book is full of small miracles presented in elegant but
simple prose,'' Jay Parini wrote in the Book Review last year. The
narrator of ``An Irish Eye,'' by John Hawkes (Penguin, $11.95), is
a 13-year-old orphan whose bizarre adventures include a romance
with an aging World War I veteran and enslavement by the mistress
of a manor house. In 1997 our reviewer, Liam Callanan, called this
novel ``an engaging blend of genres and literary traditions ...
that ultimately becomes a kind of post-modern picaresque.''

   &UR; MY BROTHER &QL; 
 &UR; By Jamaica Kincaid &QL; 
 &UR; Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $10 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing her brother's life and his death from AIDS in
their native Antigua, Kincaid refuses to romanticize her story,
choosing instead to follow the circular flow of her memory to
portray death as it really is, not as we might prefer it to be. The
result is ``a sustained meditation on the grinding wheel of family,
with mother always at the hub; on the countries of our past, both
real and emotional, which we have fled and in which we have felt
like strangers,'' Anna Quindlen wrote here in 1997. In ``Daughter
of the Queen of Sheba,'' by Jacki Lyden (Penguin, $12.95), a
National Public Radio correspondent recalls growing up in the
Midwest as the daughter of a manic-depressive woman whose
delusional behavior was dazzlingly bold and exotic. Last year in
these pages, Caroline Knapp said Lyden succeeds in ``vividly
capturing both the horror of her mother's illness and the
seductive, transporting power of her insanity.''

   The history of extrasolar planetary astronomy is one of

`MASTER GEORGIE': CHANCE AND CHARACTER IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I intend to survive,'' announces Pompey Jones as he goes into
a climactic battle of the Crimean War, near the end of Beryl
Bainbridge's remarkable new novel, ``Master Georgie,'' just beaten
out for this year's Booker Prize.
</P>
<P>
   One of the novel's three narrators, Pompey is a cynical
opportunist. As a child, he used to steal things from people and
then return them for rewards; and as an adult, his skills as an
operator have ripened.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the novel, you believe that if he does
survive the war, it will be precisely because of his disloyalty and
amoral ways. But such is the horror and random violence of Ms.
Bainbridge's ending that you come to believe that survival is
purely a matter of chance. Issues of character come to seem
irrelevant. All sense of order is overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   How has Ms. Bainbridge achieved this effect? Throughout her
first dozen or so novels _ among them, ``The Bottle Factory
Outing,'' ``Young Adolf'' and ``An Awfully Big Adventure'' _ she
was often preoccupied with the role of violent accident. As she
once explained in an interview, since she used her own experience
as material for her fiction, and since ``one's own life, while
being lived, seems to have no obvious plot and is therefore without
tension,'' the introduction of an ``accidental death'' creates ``a
strong narrative line.''
</P>
<P>
   In her more recent novels, having ``used up my childhood,'' as
she put it, she has turned to historical fiction, using Robert
Falcon Scott's disastrous race to the South Pole in her 14th novel,
``The Birthday Boys,'' and the sinking of the Titanic in her 15th,
``Every Man for Himself.'' These broader canvases have served to
heighten the significance of the tension between chance and
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in ``Master Georgie,'' the possibility that anyone can
exert any control over fate is put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the story, it seems that only fate matters, if
fate can be said to depend on character. For Ms. Bainbridge appears
at first to care only about character. In a tour de force of
compressed plotting, she introduces us to her two other narrators,
who along with Pompey relate the six chapters that make up ``Master
Georgie.'' These are Myrtle, a 12-year-old orphan taken in by the
Hardys, a lower-middle-class Liverpool Victorian family because one
of the Hardy daughters wants a pet, and Dr. Potter, a sententious
geologist who eventually marries another of the Hardy children.
</P>
<P>
   Both Myrtle, named after the street where the orphanage she was
destined for stands, and Dr. Potter are in thrall to the Hardys'
son, George, a surgeon tortured by guilt over his homosexual urges.
Despite being referred to as ``Master'' in the novel's title,
George could not possibly be less in control of his fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel's opening section, Myrtle describes how Master
Georgie happened to discover his father dead in a prostitute's bed
and the consequences this has for the Hardy family's future.
</P>
<P>
   The marvelous trick Ms. Bainbridge pulls off is that she tells
her story so elliptically that you have to pay attention to her
every word. No conversation is wasted. Nothing is described merely
to illustrate. For instance, as the story develops, you begin to
suspect that Myrtle is somehow connected to Master Georgie's
children, but you don't know how or why. Then, during a concert
they attend together, he reaches for her hand, and she comments to
the reader, ``He doesn't drink any more, so I was startled.'' You
really don't need to be told anything more.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents thus described are by turns funny and appalling.
But their development is easy to miss, and the need to pay such
close attention creates the illusion that the characters possess
autonomy and that their behavior is relevant to their fates. Yet
when their actions gradually lead them into the Crimean War, what
happens to them is so horrifyingly random and meaningless that
chance seems all that matters. Their helplessness mirrors the
incompetence of the military leaders who created so much
unnecessary suffering during the war, including Lord Raglan,
responsible for the catastrophic charge of the Light Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   As Pompey puts it in the heat of the Battle of Inkerman: ``I
didn't know what cause I was promoting, or why it was imperative to
kill, though I reckon Potter could have told me.'' When ordered to
defend the regimental colors, he concludes: ``In my head I
questioned the necessity of coming to the aid of a tattered square
of silk, but I did as I was bid. I'd turned into a circus animal
and would have jumped through hoops if called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Master Georgie and Pompey Jones are also photographers, and
their art plays an important role in Ms. Bainbridge's novel. Each
of its six chapters is named after a photograph taken in the course
of its action, and each of these photographs comments grimly on the
action's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In the bitterest one of all, a photographer poses a group of
survivors of the Battle of Inkerman ``to show the folks back
home.'' When the composition doesn't seem right, he calls for
another soldier, but all that is available is a corpse, whose
inclusion doesn't prevent the photographer from ordering the group,
``Smile, boys, smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Potter, the intellectual, reflects on photography that
``there is something of black magic'' about it, ``in that it stops
time,'' but while ``it appears to hold reality hostage,'' it
``fails to snap thoughts in the head.'' He concludes: ``A man can
be standing there, face expressive of grief, and inside be full of
either mirth or lust. The lens is powerless to catch the interior
turmoil boiling within the skull.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the camera is like Ms. Bainbridge's vision of
warfare in ``Master Georgie.'' The battle is powerless to catch
whatever is boiling within the human skull, her novel seems to be
saying. More significantly, as ``Master Georgie'' movingly conveys,
the battle really doesn't care.

THE BANANA AS BILLBOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Del., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Look carefully at the bananas you bought yesterday:
we all know the Chiquita lady, but several million Dole bananas are
now selling something else. Little stickers tout the film ``Babe in
the City,'' the sequel to the popular children's movie, which opens
Nov. 20. On other Dole bunches you may find the familiar yellow
dots of ABC television's fall campaign. ``TV. Zero calories,'' one
slogan reads. Even more inevitable perhaps is the banana sticker,
produced with the California Milk Processor Board, that reads,
``Got milk?''
</P>
<P>
   No new inroad by the relentless machine of advertising and
marketing should surprise, I guess, even one into this little
crevice of the culture. But I've been thinking about produce
stickers for a while now, and how cleverly they already advertise
the fruit they label.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, I came across a peach label with pinstripes and
letters right off a baseball uniform that read simply, ``Peach.''
It was a tricky little message: baseball plus peach suggested the
Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb. The implication was that the peach was from
Georgia. In fact, it was a California product; the seal provided a
way to lie to the eye, or at least mislead.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days before, I had heard a designer say that
``everything in the grocery store is designed these days except the
fruit in the produce department.'' But it occurred to me, produce
stickers serve to design the fruit they tag. And to package it, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Another peach label, for a white fruit, bears the eye-catching
image of a shark's open jaws and the phrase ``Great White.''
Wrapping a peach in the image of a shark or totemizing an
Australian orange with a kangaroo is design and packaging together.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may be charmed by a movie pig that talks, but they
fear to buy a pig in a poke. Produce stickers provide minimal but
effective packaging. They civilize the fruit, even as they reassure
us how natural it is. The sticker on the fig is like the fig leaf
on the statue.
</P>
<P>
   The main function of the fruit sticker, of course, is to bear
the numbers assigned to fruit and vegetables by the Produce
Marketing Association, whose offices are in Newark, Del. These make
life easier for the checkout clerk in training. But they also tout
the fruit as fresh, organic, tree-ripened. They advertise the
banana or apple as much as they now advertise the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Like any package, fruit stickers have collectors. And no wonder,
since they pack a lot of design into a small space. Katie Foster is
a vivacious woman from Austin, Texas, who publishes ``Please Stop
Snickering,'' a newsletter for produce-seal collectors. The
Snicker, as she calls the publication, is dedicated to news about
``P-seals.'' She explained to me that stickers go back to the early
days of the century. Ms. Foster kindly sent me a 1917 Butler
Brothers seal for nonirrigated casaba melons.
</P>
<P>
   Serious collectors ``fly speck'' seals: they study minute
differences between them the way stamp or coin collectors do their
specimens. They know that there is a small letter to the lower
right of the Chiquita lady indicating where the banana was grown.
</P>
<P>
   P-seals become more interesting at this time of year, when fruit
begins arriving from distant locations _ mandarins from Morocco,
apples from New Zealand or mandacaru mangos, bearing code number
4051 inside the green-and-yellow diamond flag of Brazil. I think of
this as the time of antipodean fruit _ fruit whose price and
prestige increase as its point of sale approaches a point antipodal
from that of its origin.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, I met an obviously well-heeled woman who
told me she chose her vacation spots by the sounds of their names.
``Casablanca,'' she said. ``Marrakesh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Khartoum,'' I muttered to myself. ``Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   Do people choose their fruit this way? Fruit from halfway around
the world becomes, through its labels, a wondering testimony to the
powers of the container ship and cargo jet, as well as homage to
trade agreements like GATT or NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   I think of these stickers as resembling steamer-trunk hotel
labels, tokens of how far fruit has come. Fruit, like Babe going to
the city, is about the natural confronting civilization. The same
process that turns a distant place into what the travel agents call
``a destination,'' turns a banana into a billboard, a 4011 into a
Chiquita, produce into product.

<P>
   Stairs tend to creak and squeak over time. This happens when the
house settles or the wood ages and shrinks. The noises may seem
like a minor nuisance at first, but they can be an indication that
structural members have moved out of alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Stairways are made up of stringers, treads and risers. The tread
is the horizontal board that you step on. The riser is the vertical
board that supports the tread. It fits into a groove on the
underside of the tread.
</P>
<P>
   The stringers are the side boards that support the treads and
risers. Open stringers are cut in a sawtooth pattern; the treads
and risers mate to the sawtooth surfaces. Closed stringers have
notches mortised in their sides to hold and enclose the treads and
risers. Some staircases may have a closed stringer against the wall
and open stringer with a balustrade on the opposite side. If the
stairs are very wide, they may have additional support boards to
support the treads and risers. Called carriages, these long boards
run parallel to the stringers beneath the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Noises like squeaks occur when two loose boards rub against each
other. Before you can make any repairs, you will have to pinpoint
the source of the noise. First walk on each step as you listen for
the squeak _ sometimes it helps to do this late at night or early
in the morning when the rest of the house is relatively quiet. In
addition to the sound, you may be able to feel the tread flex as
you put weight on it. This is an indication that the board is not
adequately supported by the riser.
</P>
<P>
   Minor repairs can usually be made above the steps. These are not
difficult, but because they are made on exposed surfaces, care must
be taken to keep the repairs from becoming obvious or unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   One way to silence noise is by squeezing powdered graphite into
the space between the rubbing boards. The graphite will lubricate
the surfaces so they slide past each other without friction. This,
however, is only a temporary cure and it does nothing to secure the
loose boards. Eventually, the squeak will reoccur as the graphite
wears off.
</P>
<P>
   For a more permanent solution, you can nail or wedge the boards
together. At the front of the tread where it rests on the riser,
drive 6d finishing nails through the tread into the riser. Drive
the nails at opposing angles so they anchor firmly into the wood,
then countersink the heads and fill the holes with wood filler.
</P>
<P>
   The rear of the tread is usually held securely in a horizontal
groove in the base of the riser. As the steps age and dry out, the
groove is apt to widen, giving the tread room to move. Tighten the
gap by inserting glue-coated wedges into the groove. Allow about 24
hours for the glue to dry, then use a utility knife to trim the
wedges flush with surrounding surfaces. To fasten a loose tread or
riser to an open stringer, drive finishing nails through the steps
directly into the stringer.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the best place to make repairs is under the stairs,
where they will be hidden from view. They will also be stronger
because it is easier to attach braces, or wedges, into gaps where
all the structural elements are exposed. Working under the
staircase is not a problem if the sides are open or if the
underside of the steps is accessible from the floor below.
</P>
<P>
   To gain access to the underside of the steps in a closed
staircase, you will have to open the side sheathing or remove a few
steps. This can be a difficult job and it's best to consult with a
professional carpenter before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the stairs, inspect the areas where the treads and
risers join with the stringers. On a closed stringer, examine the
wedges that hold treads and risers in the mortised slots. They
should be tight with little or no play. If not, remove them, apply
glue and tap them back into place.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the top of the riser where it mates with the underside
of the tread. These boards should be firmly attached to each other
so there is no movement between them. If the joint seems loose,
however, you can secure it by gluing wood blocks or screwing angle
brackets to the surfaces where the tread and riser meet at right
angles.
</P>
<P>
   Examine the groove at base of the riser to make sure that rear
of the tread is firmly in place. If not, you can drive 1 1/2-inch
long wood screws through the back of the riser into the tread, but
be sure to drill pilot holes first.

BATMAN'S FATHER KNEW DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow a big story slipped through our fingers recently.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, died last week. He was 83. I
didn't read about it in the paper, nor did I see anything on
television.
</P>
<P>
   You may be saying, ``So what?'' Some guy invented a comic-book
character a long time ago. That's no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Batman isn't just a kids' comic-book hero. He is far too dark
for that. In an age when Marilyn Manson does nothing more than
raise a few eyebrows, it's hard to think of Kane's Dark Knight as a
truly subversive character, but that's just what he was.
</P>
<P>
   When Kane introduced Batman in ``Detective Comics No. 27'' in
1939, he didn't just make comic-book history _ he carved a niche
for himself in the annals of popular culture. Batman was an
anti-hero, a menacing loner who worked outside the law.
</P>
<P>
   And he was the GOOD guy.
</P>
<P>
   (If you think of Batman as a goofy buffoon, blame the kitschy
'60s TV show, with Adam West and Burt Ward, for the confusion.
You'd think it would be difficult for a live-action show to be more
of a cartoon than a comic book, but that version of Batman's story
stooped to the task.)
</P>
<P>
   With Batman, Kane ``changed the industry and the way superheroes
were done,'' said Mike Banks, general manager of All About Books
and Comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought different elements _ the grim and gritty hero,''
Banks added. &QL; 
WAYNE'S WORLD
</P>
<P>
   That's actually a kind description of the early Caped Crusader.
You know the story: As a boy, Bruce Wayne sees his parents
murdered. He inherits their millions and becomes a seemingly
virtuous paragon and benefactor of Gotham City.
</P>
<P>
   But like in any good story, all is not as it seems. At night,
Wayne dons his dark costume and roams the city, a nearly crazed
vigilante in a cape and cowl bent on avenging his parents' murder.
If he foils a few criminals along the way, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, the guy's a bit of a nut.
</P>
<P>
   When Banks started collecting comics, one of his first finds was
a coverless copy of an early Batman. The illustration still sticks
in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Batman, standing over a corpse with a smoking gun in
his hand,'' Banks said. ``That just blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrates just how dark a hero Batman can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Superman, he's got his code against killing and stuff,''
Banks said. ``Batman took a more realistic take. He knew that line
was there, and he walked it really closely _ and sometimes he
crossed over it if he thought the ends justified the means.'' &QL; 
WALKING A MIDDLE GROUND &QL; 
Other superheroes put villains in prison; readers could be sure of
that by the next issue; a jail break would lead to a rematch, a
story line that would play out again and again, sometimes for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Batman,'' Banks said, ``sometimes he'd put them down for
good.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're a kid, Superman is usually the first superhero you
latch onto. He has all the cool powers: Nothing on Earth hurts him,
he has X-ray vision _ the guy can FLY, for goodness' sake. Good and
evil are spelled out in primary colors. It's a pretty simple world,
really, much like the one you live in as a child.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you grow up a bit and start noticing the gray shades
of life that Batman's appeal begins to draw you in. Good and evil
exist, but there is a big middle ground in between. That's the
space Batman occupies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a fan, what always got me into Batman was I felt I could BE
Batman,'' Banks said. ``You could identify with him. He's got the
gadgets on his belt and the neat car and all that, but underneath
that, he's a normal person. You could just imagine yourself being
in his shoes. Or his tights.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kane's genius wasn't just the story he told but the way
he told it. The bright, happy colors of Superman's Metropolis gave
way to a dark, gothic Gotham City, bringing what Banks called the
``pulp-fiction feel'' to comics. Gritty _ sometimes, yes, ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Just like real life. &QL;

CHINESE TREE PEONIES: BLENDING YIN AND YANG, GLORIOUSLY

 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I stared at the Chinese tree peonies, almost resentfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UPS man brought them yesterday,'' said my mother,
Kathleen, nodding at the big box on the cat porch, which doesn't
have cats anymore, but the name sticks, from the days when 15 barn
cats used to claw at the screen door, yowling for chow. I think
there was a shortage of mice in those days.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing this place doesn't need, it's more plants.
That's what Kathleen and I are always saying to each other. I have
a life in New York, and she's getting older _ 84 _ and finding it
harder to haul water to some newly planted tree, or even to bend
over and weed the adored arugula patch.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was looking at me, a little grin on her face. When had I
ordered a bunch of tree peonies from Cricket Hill Garden, in
Thomaston, Conn.? Then it came back to me, a shimmering spring day
in May two years ago, as I stood, thunderstruck, on a hillside of
luminous colors and silky petals.
</P>
<P>
   Some were wide-open semi-doubles, like Gathering of Rosy Clouds,
which had dark red flares at the base of its pink petals and
stamens laden with golden pollen. Others were thousand-petal types,
like Princess Zhao Marries Beyond the Great Wall. (Princess Zhao
was a concubine who failed to bribe the court painter. He painted
such an ugly likeness of her that the emperor decided to give her
away to some warring barbarian. When he realized his mistake, he
executed the painter, not that that did Princess Zhao much good.)
</P>
<P>
   Still others, like Fire That Makes the Pills of Immortality, a
silver-red bud that opens to flaming red, embodied the
transformations of alchemy and magic. I wandered among all these
flowers, gloriously unsettled, somewhere between worship and lust.
The Chinese, apparently, have had this feeling for 1,500 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flower represents the essence of the female element,''
said David Furman, who owns Cricket Hill with his wife, Kasha, (who
was captivated 20 years ago when he gave her an 8-inch peony called
Purple of the Sung Dynasty). ``The plant itself, mudan, means `male
vermilion,''' he explained. Say no more. Just look at a tree peony
sometime, when the dark red flower stalks are swelling with buds.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``king of the flowers,'' the tree peony has long
been a symbol of erotic love, embodying both the female and male
elements, the yin and the yang. Since the fourth century, when Xie
Lingyun, a poet, described one blooming in the wild, they have
found their way into Chinese poetry, ceramics and paintings.
Emperors grew them in their palace gardens as early as the sixth
century, and they have long been associated with wealth and
nobility.
</P>
<P>
   There is the story of Empress Wu, who ruled during the Tang
dynasty (A.D. 618 to 906). ``One day she commanded all the flowers
to bloom out of season,'' said Furman, who has a master's degree in
Chinese history from New York University. ``They all obeyed, except
for the tree peony.'' The Empress banished the defiant plants to
the city of Luoyang, which is the capital of tree peonies to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Furmans import their plants from Luoyang and from the city
of Heze. They were so exquisite, I'd ordered a few for the
following fall and then put a hold on them when I went off on a
sabbatical. Now, here they were, my love affair come home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   My mother gave me a jolly little smile and went off for a nap.
And I dusted the cobwebs off my old spade and told my back to
behave. Maybe we garden from a landscape of memory. A single white
peony, silky petals surrounding golden stamens, floats in a bowl on
the piano of my childhood. And now I know it wasn't my Clementi
sonatinas that made my father kiss my mother.
</P>
<P>
   It felt good to be digging again, as if something were loosening
up in me, each time I lifted a shovelful of earth or took the
sturdy fork and worked it back and forth in Maryland's dense red
clay.
</P>
<P>
   Now clay is not what a tree peony wants, since it evolved on the
dry, mountainous slopes of northern China. It can thrive on very
little water, but to bloom prolifically it needs plenty of compost
and good drainage. So there I was, defying nature, with a
wheelbarrow full of compost, and a bag of Canadian peat, to lighten
up soil with about as much tilth as the floor of a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon light slanted across emerald-green winter wheat
and soybean fields the color of cinnamon. The corn had been cut,
leaving stubbled rows that followed the curve of Carroll County's
voluptuous hills. Sometimes loving a place four hours from New York
City seems like a conflict, but on that afternoon, I just planted
peonies and let the land back into my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike floppy herbaceous peonies, which can't even stand up
without being staked, tree peonies are elegant woody shrubs with
graceful branches and deeply cut leaves as expressive as hands.
Although they bloom for only two or three weeks in May _ which is
part of the longing they inspire _ their foliage is striking all
summer long.
</P>
<P>
   Blossoms can range from 4 inches across to a foot in diameter,
and some can be 5 inches deep. But you have to be patient. Most
don't flower until their fifth or sixth year, though Cricket Hill
sells only four-year-old plants. One peony called Pea Green takes
so long to bloom that Furman says he won't sell it to anyone older
than 30.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of nurseries send out their tree peonies in the spring,
but Furman frowns on this practice. Tree peonies set new roots as
they go into dormancy in the fall, so in the New York area, if
they're planted in October or early November, they will have a good
six weeks or so to establish themselves before the ground freezes.
Then, in the spring, the plants can concentrate their energies on
growing stems and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike herbaceous peonies, which like full sun, tree peonies do
best in dappled shade. I planted Twin Beauty next to a couple of
double-file viburnums I'd had to have after seeing them blooming at
Winterthur, the du Pont estate in Delaware. Twin Beauty, named
after two women married to opposing generals in a seventh-century
tale, bears red and pink flowers on the same plant, and some
blossoms are both colors.
</P>
<P>
   I put Cinnabar Ramparts (an 11th-century writer said the petals
were the color of ``crimson blood'') near a black pussy willow. The
third, Supreme Pink, one of those thousand-petal types (was I out
of my mind that day?), has taken the place of the Harry Lauder's
walking stick that succumbed to a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   I will never be a designer gardener. I collect plants the way
some people take in stray dogs. And besides, this farm has a mind
of its own. When I suggest to my mother that we cut down those
horrible Norway maples and plant a hedgerow, she looks at me as if
I were an ax murderer. She drags out the pictures of my grandmother
and grandfather standing in the yard with a few sticks by the road.
These are the trees, she says. I can't tell if it's really my
grandparents because they're so young and skinny, but I take her
word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year I will order Pea Green _ and plant for the
generations.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: CHERIMOYAS AND IRESINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DORA GALITZKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing Cherimoyas
</P>
<P>
   Q. A few weeks ago in Chinatown I bought cherimoyas. I first saw
this fruit 25 years ago in Venezuela, and love its flavor, a
mixture of strawberry and pineapple. I scarified and soaked my
seeds, but sprouts never appeared. Is there hope in growing this
wonderful fruit in my own backyard?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can grow cherimoyas if your backyard happens to be in a
subtropical, frost-free region that doesn't get too humid in the
summer. Israel would do or Egypt, Chile, parts of South Africa or
areas of California.
</P>
<P>
   It's too humid in Florida, but Dr. Jonathan Crane, a specialist
in tropical fruit crops at the University of Florida's Tropical
Research and Education Center in Homestead, has experimented with
growing cherimoyas from seed. He found that the seed seems to have
an after-ripening requirement. Seeds that have been well cleaned
(don't want any fungus) should be left to age in a plastic bag at
room temperature for at least three months (six is better). Soaked
for a day and planted half an inch deep in well-drained growing
medium and kept moist, they will germinate in three to four weeks.
This works, however, only if the pot has bottom heat to keep the
medium at 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part, relatively speaking, and it will result in
a large foliage plant that needs full sun. Fruit is another matter.
After three to eight years as a juvenile, your cherimoya may
flower, but the species of beetle that pollinates it will not be
around _ Food and Drug Administration inspections keep them out of
the country. And hand pollinating is tricky because the male and
female flowers bloom at different times. Well, you've got a few
years to figure out how to imitate a beetle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorful Latin Visitor
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've always loved iresine because I don't have enough light
for flowering plants and its magenta leaves were a lovely accent. I
even included it in my window box. When it got leggy I trimmed it
back and started new plants from the cuttings. But last year while
I was away it died. Before I could bring in one from the window
box, frost killed it, too. I have looked everywhere for a
replacement. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A. If I tell you where to get it, will you promise to keep an
extra cutting in a safe place? Iresine herbstii, commonly known as
bloodleaf, beefsteak plant or chicken gizzard, is a subtropical
South American plant (it hates frost), which should stay moist and
loves humidity. To have dried out one and frozen the other is just
adding insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Small and shrubby, iresine has waxy, variegated leaves,
frequently puckered. What makes it a standout is that the leaves
are magenta with pinkish midribs and veins, providing color even
without flowers. If your color sense tends away from Crayola, try
the variety I. herbstii Aureoreticulata, with green leaves, yellow
veins and bright red stalks and stems. Both need the same care _
give them plenty of light with some direct sun to keep the colors
bright and keep the soil moist without being soggy. Pinch the tips
occasionally to keep the plants bushy.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for iresine include Avant Gardens, 710 High Hill Road,

CARBON PAPER STILL MESSY, STILL IN USE

c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the happiest moments of legal secretary Norma Carey's
life was the day she threw away her carbon paper. It was the early
1970s when her employer, a law firm in Washington, D.C., switched
from carbons to copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely delighted,'' said Ms. Carey, 64, a secretary
for Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. No more ink on the hands
from handling slimy black carbons. No more furious erasing. And no
more re-typing 20-page documents. Not once, Ms. Carey says, has she
felt nostalgic about the messy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   With today's laser and ink-jet printers, word processors, and
voice recognition and spellchecking software, carbon paper _
invented by an Englishman named Ralph Wedgewood in the 1820s _ is
but a shadow of the crucial commodity it was.
</P>
<P>
   Using carbon paper today is like using a mortar and pestle
instead of a food processor, or pounding your laundry against a
rock instead of using a washing machine. Yet there remains a small
but steady demand for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's buying it,'' said Jim Gordon, president of
Form-Mate Carbon Products Ltd. of Toronto. Eighty percent of
Gordon's business is in one-time carbon paper _ the thin,
tissuelike carbon paper found in business forms that is used once
and thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of his business is in re-usable carbon paper _
thicker, carbon-coated paper sheets available in office supply or
stationery stores and usually used in typewriters or by hand to
make duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his orders are for export, Gordon said, to countries
that are not as technologically advanced as the United States. ``I
wrote a report back in 1976 that predicted there would be no need
for carbon paper within 10 years,'' Gordon recalled. ``That was 22
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of companies in North America still manufacture carbon
paper. Norman McLeod, a senior consultant with CAP Ventures of
Norwell, Mass., said 24,000 tons of one-time carbon paper was
produced in 1997, down from a peak of 220,000 tons in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a few thousand tons a year of re-usable carbon paper is
produced, down from about 30,000 tons annually 25 years ago. Demand
has dropped by 85 percent in the last 20 years, McLeod said. The
reason: Computers have made manual and electric typewriters all but
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Copying machines, laser printers and carbonless paper _ a
chemical process that creates copies without the need for carbon
paper _ were the final blow. But McLeod said he did not believe
that carbon paper would disappear entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way it used to be,'' said Jeffrey Dadowski,
president of Codo Manufacturing in Leetsdale, Pa., ``but there's
still a lot of use for it.'' Codo has been making carbon paper
since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the business is in one-time carbons for business forms,
but Codo also manufactures special carbon-coated paper that
dentists use to make an impression of the teeth, and carbon paper
used to make patterns for dressmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carbon is still the best inexpensive way to make multiple
copies,'' Dadowski said. ``With the carbonless forms, after the
third or fourth copy you can't read it.''
</P>
<P>
   FryeTech Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., is the nation's leading
manufacturer of carbon paper, with $48 million in sales last year.
The company began as Frye Copy Systems in Des Moines in 1912, and
as demand for carbon paper shrank FryeTech bought up its
competitors. Most of its business is in making one-time carbons for
multipart business forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as computers are not 100 percent foolproof, there will
be a need for carbon,'' said Marc Leder, managing director of
FryeTech.
</P>
<P>
   The ink on carbon paper also works well in cold environments,
unlike carbonless paper. That is why many fuel-oil companies use
carbon forms for receipts, and why airlines that fly in cold
climates have luggage tickets with one-time carbons on hand when
computers fail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Korectype Co. in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn,
three ancient carbon-coating machines sit forlornly in a corner of
a 170,000 square-foot factory presided over by the company's
founder and 72-year-old president, Victor Barouh. When the factory
opened 35 years ago, half its revenue came from carbon paper.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the re-usable carbons it makes represent just 1 percent
or 2 percent of revenue, and most of that is sold overseas. The
company also makes the special carbon paper for dentists, in
addition to ribbons, ink jets, correction fluid and correction tape
for typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   The carbon-coating machines, which are at least 75 years old and
the size of small jeeps, apply a mixture of ink and wax to paper
that is drawn through a series of rollers.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is coated with ink mixed with hot water then drawn
through several chilling rollers that have cold water circulating
through them and solidify the ink mixture on contact.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Barouh said, the three machines are rarely used.
Korectype produces at most 50,000 boxes of re-usable carbon paper a
year, and only about 100 boxes are sold in the United States. An
order filled in mid-October was bound for a South American country,
where, Barouh said, ``the dealer will probably sell it to the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Who in the United States buys carbon paper these days? Many
small businesses like video repair shops, dry cleaners, shoe stores
and delicatessens use business forms with one-time carbons
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, the office supply chain, sells slightly more than 1,000
packages of re-usable carbon paper a week, and sales have declined
every year for the 12 years the chain has been in business.
</P>
<P>
   Some small stationery stores carry carbon paper _ just in case.
Hygrade Typewriter and Stationery Co. in Morristown, N.J., a
65-year-old family-run business, sells just 12 sheets of carbon
paper a month now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quiet item,'' owner John Hunt said. Before ``N.C.R.
paper'' _ no carbon required _ and copying machines, carbon paper
was the only way to make duplicates, Hunt said. Law firms used to
be big customers, Hunt said, and the store would typically sell
between six and 12 boxes of 100 sheets each a month.
</P>
<P>
   Today's typical buyer might occasionally need a sheet or two to
copy a handwritten letter, or transfer a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike antique typewriters, carbon paper has not caught on as a
collectible _ with one exception. ``The packages they came in were
so lovely,'' said Darryl Rehr, author of the book ``Antique
Typewriters and Office Collectibles.'' Rehr occasionally finds them
at flea markets or antique malls.
</P>
<P>
   He also points out that carbon paper played a starring role in
the invention of the typewriter in 1873, when Christopher Lathan
Sholes used it to demonstrate his first typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   But carbon paper's legacy lives on in the modern office in the
abbreviation ``cc'' for carbon copy, which still appears at the end
of many a memo composed on a personal computer and sent via e-mail.
And programs used to compose e-mail have a ``cc'' function to send
a message to more than one person.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Theresa Scheese, 39, a freelance secretary in Yardley,
Pa., had to explain the abbreviation to her two children, ages 13
and 10, who had seen it on America Online. ``I said well, a hundred
years ago when I started typing, `cc' meant carbon copy,'' Ms.
Scheese recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to explain to the children how she used to spend
days typing and retyping lengthy forms that sometimes involved as
many as 10 carbons.
</P>
<P>
   The children's response: ``Why didn't you just use a copier?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>
<P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''

<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the

IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.
</P>

SAVE THE LOONIES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heart of the tourist season is still months away, but
already I miss the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials fear that Canadian tourism may be down this
year due to the falling value of the Canadian dollar, otherwise
known as the ``loonie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Sarasota County had more visitors from
Canada than any other foreign country. The second-most foreign
visitors came from England and the third-most from (shudder)
France.
</P>
<P>
   My fear is that Canadians will find it is more fun to stay home
and nurse their sick loonies back to health than it is to come to
Sarasota and stand in line three hours for a table in a restaurant
that does not accept loonies, healthy or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   An even more alarming possibility is that Canadians will find
someplace else to spend their loonies, worthless as they may be.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kevin Lawler, executive director of the Sarasota
Convention and Visitors Bureau, more than a few Canadians plan on
vacationing in Cuba this winter, a sure sign that Castro's days are
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans can and have endured many hardships, from food shortages
to the defection of their best baseball players. But the prospect
of thousands of sunburned Canadians wearing ``I'm With Stupid''
T-shirts playing shuffleboard on the Plaza de la Revolucion may be
more than even these long-suffering people can take.
</P>
<P>
   While some second-rate local writers, desperate for a column,
have taken some cheap shots at Canadian tourists in the past, the
truth is that we need the Canadians more than they need us.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pumping upwards of $1.65 into the local economy each
year, Canadian tourists help keep our reflexes sharp with their
unique style of driving and also lend an international ``flavor''
(maple syrup) to our community.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian tourists are a hardy bunch and think nothing of jumping
in the Gulf of Mexico on cold January days. Locals, who won't stick
a toe in the Gulf until the water temperature is 85 degrees or
higher, never cease to be astonished by this and often come down
with a cold or the flu just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   (While this isn't necessarily good for us, it is good for the
doctors and pharmacists who, after all, have a stake in this thing,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, with the exception of those from Quebec, also speak
English, more or less, which is not something you can say about
visitors from Scotland or France. The fact that we share a common
language allows Sarasotans and Canadians to engage in any number of
rich and stimulating conversations, such as:
</P>
<P>
   Canadian tourist: It is a fine day for a swim, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: What? I can't hear you. My ears are frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist: This feels like Lake Huron in July, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: A heron, an egret ... what do I look like? Miss Hathaway?
</P>
<P>
   Tourist: This sure beats shoveling snow, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: Would you mind putting on some clothes? The glare off
your stomach is hurting my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist: Do me a favor and hold my loonies while I take a dip,
eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: Hold your own loonies, you pervert. I'm going inside
where it's warm.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist: It's 80 degrees. You must be hot in that snowsuit, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: Is that an iceberg floating out there or is that your
wife?
</P>
<P>
   Tourist: It has been a pleasure talking with you. Sarasota is a
beautiful place and the people who live here are most friendly, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: If I see you on the beach again dressed like that I'll
have you arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist: Have a good day. Come visit us in Ottawa, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Local: Oh, and by the way. That lever on the left of your
steering column? It's called a turn signal. Try using it.

STRONG WOMEN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   On election night Barbara Boxer grew as tall as Janet Reno as
she whooped and bubbled over her win. That red-suited senator was
gloating.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might consider it unladylike to gloat, but too bad
about them. Barbara Boxer deserved to relish in victory.
</P>
<P>
   She deserved to beam and give a power salute. If she had done a
cartwheel into the crowd it would have been absolutely appropriate.
The pollsters had been showing her the door. Conservatives said
people didn't like her personality. She was said to be too
progressive for California.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Boxer talked back to the skeptics, particularly the
ones who declared her ``a fluke in history,'' as if any woman with
her kind of clout was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   But now she's back and that fluke theory turned out to be
nothing more than a desperate wish that the Boxers could be shooed
away and things returned to normal, with the boys leaned back in
their swivel chairs, scratching their bellies and lighting cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but normal is Barbara Boxer and all the other women who
ran and won, who walked precincts and called voters, who wrote
letters to the editor and tried to bust up all-male boards of
supervisors and earn seats on city councils and school boards, who
wrote checks to Emily's List and who knew when to back the right
men. Even the women who ran and lost made their point. Politically
passionate women are no flukes.
</P>
<P>
   There were more words that Barbara Boxer wanted to throw back
after Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They called her ``too feisty,'' even ``too short,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Short is downright silly, and feisty, as it turns out, is fine,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman was called feisty for his famous line
about getting out of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The usually gentle Jimmy Carter was once described as strident
in an uncharacteristic moment.
</P>
<P>
   Strident and Feisty is not a bad club. The words aren't going to
disappear, anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the election, Barbara Boxer was still attached
to the appendages. Election reports referred to her as ``Boxer, a
strident liberal'' and ``Boxer, an outspoken feminist.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a deal. We'll stop fighting the words if they stop
fighting the women.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Gov. Ann Richards delivered another feisty brand of
feminist political power when she stopped over in Santa Rosa on the
eve of the election for a fund-raiser for congressional winner Mike
Thompson. The candidate was male but there was decided female
energy in that room in the form of women candidates, party hosts,
event organizers, campaign managers, community leaders _ all major
players and all looking to Richards as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say this election doesn't matter to women. Oh, my god,''
she said, throwing a look that asked for delivery from pinheads.
Then Richards took on the Republican congress for being do-nothings
and spending all its time trying to boot Bill Clinton out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we took away all the jobs of men who did what Bill Clinton
did, women would not have to worry about affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to blast the hard right for trying to insert their
morality into schools. ``They harp on abortion but that's not all
they're about. They want to stop contraception and sex education.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson called Richards ``one of the stars of public policy,''
and then told her she should run for president and he would support
her.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Richards came to town there was a
get-out-the-vote bash in San Francisco, starring Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who raised hands with Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Nancy
Pelosi, Lynn Woolsey and a few good men.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the audience of 1,100 said afterwards, ``It gave me
energy as a member of the female species to carry on strong for a
very long time.'' The same thing happened after Tuesday. Women knew
they'd done it. They cheered Boxer for skipping out of the woods,
for Woolsey and Patty Murray prevailing and for Loretta Sanchez
packing Bob Dornan home for good.
</P>
<P>
   They celebrated that 150 years ago women organized in Seneca
Falls to get the vote and in 1998 voters preserved women's right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   They congratulated themselves for education, reproductive rights
and gun control, formerly known as women's issues, becoming
deciding concerns for voters in general. And for the Clinton-Monica
mess not becoming a women's issue.
</P>
<P>
   They toasted the inexhaustible, unflinching Hillary for turning
herself into a major political asset, every inch a stateswoman at
podium after podium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the year that women made it happen and now that we know
how to do it we can continue on until it's no big deal. Then
there'll be no need to gloat.

IMPEACHMENT WOULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRACY

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<P>
   After receiving a thumping on election night, the Republican
attempt to impeach President Clinton has begun to flounder badly.
As it should. The American people saw that it was a put-up job. And
a very dangerous one, at that, according to the views expressed by
Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, in law review articles and in his 1992 book, `Grand
Inquests,` Rehnquist has called impeachment power a `wild card`
that, if misused, could destroy the constitutional checks and
balances and the nation's founding principle of separation of
powers.
</P>
<P>
   `Misused` is precisely the term to describe this politically
motivated impeachment inquiry. The GOP is creating a constitutional
crisis of the highest magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority in the U.S. House votes for impeachment,
conservative, Republican appointee Rehnquist will preside over
Clinton's trial in the Senate. And he is fully aware of the gravity
of such action and what it might mean to the future of our nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist will be a stickler for proper legal procedure. And he
will undoubtedly hold that which is submitted as evidence to a high
level of proof. He is not likely to allow partisan shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the wrath of voters in the election, Chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee Henry Hyde, R-Ill., now says that he
wants to speed things up. He plans to call only one witness for the
committee's impeachment inquiry --- special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr. Starr is the man who has made a lucrative career out of
trying to bring down the president. What a deal. All that Starr can
provide is biased hearsay evidence. Starr didn't witness anything.
He only knows what others told him, whether they spoke truth or
not.
</P>
<P>
   And how does one cross-examine a witness who didn't witness
anything?
</P>
<P>
   What prosecutor wouldn't love to be the only witness in a
criminal trial? To be able to pick and chose what to call
`evidence` for a jury to hear? Imagine the prosecution rate if that
were the way trials were run in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of inquiry is Hyde proposing? Laying tracks. To
railroad the president.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the House drafts and passes articles of impeachment
against the president, there aren't the votes in the Senate to make
it stick. It takes a vote by two-thirds of the Senate to find a
president guilty of an article of impeachment. That means 67
senators must vote for impeachment. There are only 55 Republican
senators. It's unlikely that 12 Democrats will vote to impeach
their president _ especially since the charges do not rise to the
level of `Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors`
as required by Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The operative word in `other high Crimes and Misdemeanors` is
`other` meaning that high crimes must reach to seriousness of
treason and bribery. Many constitutional historians think the
phrase means criminally indictable offenses against the government.
</P>
<P>
   While some claim that `high crimes and misdemeanors` are
whatever the U.S. House of Representatives says they are, such a
statement lacks historic perspective and knowledge of how our
government works. If that concept were true, then the controlling
party in Congress could shuck uncooperative presidents like ears of
corn and throw them to the hogs.
</P>
<P>
   In `Grand Inquests,` Rehnquist, reflecting upon the impeachment
trials against U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1805 and
President Andrew Johnson in 1868, writes: `The acquittal of Andrew
Johnson by the Senate was of course a victory for the independence
of the executive branch of government, just as the acquittal of
Samuel Chase sixty-three years earlier had been a victory for the
independence of the judicial branch.`
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 130 years separating the two Democratic presidents,
Johnson and Clinton, there are telling similarities in the attempts
to impeach them. Both Houses of Congress were controlled by the
Republican Party. In both eras, the radical wing of the GOP pushed
for impeachment. In both eras, the Republican leadership felt that
the president was thwarting its agenda. And in both eras, the GOP
felt the president to be personally unsuitable to be in office.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial differences, however, are immense. The charges
against Johnson were certainly more serious to the nation than
sexual escapades between consenting adults and lying about them.
Johnson was charged withunlawfully removing the secretary to the
Department of War, acting contrary to the law when he appointed
someone else to take the secretary's place, inducing a general to
disobey an act of Congress, and making disparaging remarks about
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Republican senators understood the larger ramifications of
voting for the impeachment of Johnson and voted to acquit. Sen.
William Pitt Fessenden, R-Maine, wrote to explain his acquittal
vote: `To depose the constitutional chief magistrate of a great
nation, elected by the people, on grounds so slight, would, in my
judgment, be an abuse of the power conferred upon the Senate, which
could not be justified to the country or the world.`
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 Northwestern University Law Review article, Rehnquist
summed up his feelings about the impeachment trials of Chase and
Johnson: `Had these two trials resulted in conviction rather than
acquittal, the nation would have moved closer to a regime of the
sort of congressional supremacy that was dreaded by men such as
James Madison, the Father of the Constitution.`
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership made a serious mistake by going down
this perilous path. They should just drop the entire idea and begin
grappling with the national problems the people want solved.

DIGITAL PIANOS: PLAY IT AGAIN, RAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They all laughed when I sat down at the digital grand piano, but
when it began to play ...
</P>
<P>
   They kept laughing when I yielded the piano bench to the ghost
of Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose virtual fingers flitted over the keys
in a dazzling performance of his arrangement of Nikolai
Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Flight of the Bumblebee.'' It is impossible not
to laugh, or at least smile, at the sight of a piano seemingly
playing itself so frantically.
</P>
<P>
   And it is nearly impossible to suppress a sense of wonder when
contemplating how recent advances in computer technology have
allowed great pianists, some of them long dead, to perform concerts
on the piano in one's living room.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the 300th anniversary of the invention of the
piano, artists, engineers and computer programmers are finding new
ways to combine the richness and versatility of traditional pianos
with the power of microprocessors. The familiar acoustic grand
piano has not changed much in the past century, but new generations
of pianos, some of them digital and some both acoustic and digital,
are emerging as we enter the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument that caused such wonder and delight in our house
is the new Yamaha Disklavier Grantouch digital grand piano, or
DGT7, which we have been testing in our music room for several
weeks alongside our 1920s-vintage Baldwin grand.
</P>
<P>
   The DGT7 is certainly not for everybody, in no small part
because of its $18,695 price tag, but also because many people
prefer their grand pianos to make music the old-fashioned way, by
causing hammers to strike metal strings of different lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the DGT7 creates its sounds by plucking them from a
large database of digitized sounds and playing them through a set
of speakers hidden where the strings used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Digital pianos are typically used by rock bands and musical
hobbyists or by people who do not have room for a conventional
piano. The most common models are not much more than a keyboard
plugged into an amplifier, and the sounds they make are easily
recognizable as electronic.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha, which has been making pianos for more than a century,
decided to put a digital piano into the same physical form as its
acoustic grands, thereby greatly improving not only its appearance
but also its feel and sound. The result is the DGT7.
</P>
<P>
   Gleaming black, the DGT7 is as beautiful an instrument as any
conventional acoustic grand piano, and Yamaha says it is
constructed with the same care and craftsmanship. The keyboard
action, a complex construction of keys, hammers and some 12,000
additional parts, is the same as that used in concert grands, and
it has the same feel when played.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no strings, there is no need for an iron frame
to support the literally tons of tension put on the strings of an
acoustic grand piano. Instead, the DGT7 has an elaborate set of
solenoids and optical sensors that measure the location, speed and
force of the pianist's actions on the keys, the hammers and the
three foot pedals.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds themselves are drawn from a database with 30
megabytes of digitized sounds _ about 10 times the sound capacity
of earlier digital pianos _ sampled from a 9-foot Yamaha acoustic
concert grand.
</P>
<P>
   When the middle C key is struck, for example, the sensors feed
data to a microprocessor, which selects the most accurate
corresponding middle C sound from the database: legato, staccato,
loud, soft, sustained and so on. Added to those factors is the
``voice'' of the note _ colored for the reverberations of a concert
hall or a cellar, as a single note or as part of a chord, as a
piano or as a harpsichord, etc. The variables are nearly infinite.
</P>
<P>
   Because its sounds are synthesized, the DGT7 never needs tuning,
and because each note is a clone of one produced on the big concert
grand, the notes are as perfect as the speakers can make them. The
result is that this five-foot digital piano has a sound much bigger
than its actual size.
</P>
<P>
   The real magic of the digital piano, however, arises from its
ability to record and play back performances.
</P>
<P>
   The DGT7 has a small computer console under the keyboard that
reads performance instructions _ coded as standard MIDI files _
from the user's Macintosh or Windows PC, from another MIDI
instrument or from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Players can record their own performances onto a disk or play
back any of the thousands of amateur and professional performances,
like the Rachmaninoff performance, that have been captured as MIDI
files. The Internet is becoming a vast repository of such piano
performances. Professionally recorded floppy disks ranging from
classical to contemporary are available at prices ranging up to
$35.
</P>
<P>
   (A reminder about copyright laws is appropriate. Sharing
original compositions and public domain works on the Internet is
fine, but flooding the world with your interpretations of Barry
Manilow's ``Feelings'' is legally, if not morally, wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   To test the DGT7's performance capabilities, Nick, the aspiring
concert pianist in our household, selected a diskette of Alexei
Sultanov playing Chopin's ``Polonaise in A-flat Major,'' a work
that requires that the pianist both caress and pound the full span
of the keyboard. The DGT7 met the test with ease. Hearing the same
performance on an audio CD and hearing it being actually played on
the DGT7 in one's parlor are two very different experiences.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to think of the DGT7 as merely the latest
version of the player pianos that were popular in the 1920s and
1930s. Besides having better sound, the digital pianos have an
impressive repertory of technical tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The volume, both for conventional playing and for playing back
recordings, can be set as loud or soft as desired. By plugging in a
set of headphones, the pianist can practice well into the night
without disturbing anyone in the next room or apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard action can be turned on or off during playback.
When it's on, viewers can marvel at the key action, as if a ghost
were playing the piano. When it's off, the owner can play along and
improvise on the recording.
</P>
<P>
   The tempo can be regulated, allowing the user to slow
Rachmaninoff's ``Bumblebee'' sufficiently to see each key being
depressed. Alas, watching the keys provides no clues to his
fingering. Still, I cannot imagine a finer teaching tool for lucky
piano students and teachers. With a twist of the dial, one can
instruct the piano to play only the left hand or right hand or to
transpose the key.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as the DGT7 is, the sounds it makes are still only
clones of the real thing. So several companies are marrying the
digital recording and playback capabilities of a digital piano with
their best acoustic concert grand pianos.
</P>
<P>
   Two models today, the Boesendorfer 590SE and the Yamaha
Disklavier Grand Pro DS6PRO, are considered state of the art. Only
a few dozen of these high-end models are in use around the world,
perhaps because of their $140,000-plus price tags. Other acoustic
pianos with electronic reproduction capability are available for
$50,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor of the modern acoustic reproducing piano, Wayne
Stahnke, recently harnessed his many skills in engineering,
computer science and music to recreate the original performances of
Rachmaninoff, who died in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Stahnke painstakingly restored Rachmaninoff's original
performances from paper rolls that the Russian composer and pianist
made on a mechanical reproducing piano, converted them into digital
form, replayed them on the Boesendorfer, and recorded the output
digitally to a CD.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``A Window in Time: Rachmaninoff Performs His Solo
Piano Works'' (Terarc CD-80489, about $15), a remarkable new audio
CD that some critics assert recreates a live performance by
Rachmaninoff. It is certainly a showcase for the capabilities of
pianos in the digital age.

LEVERAGE AND CONQUER, THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a very special time for a computer game about
anticompetitive business tactics. While the Department of Justice
scrutinizes Microsoft, we can play Railroad Tycoon II on our
Windows-compatible PCs, build simulated choo-choo empires on the
Internet and wallow in the fantasy of untrammeled monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we all oppose monopolies on principle. But when
you're not playing for real-world stakes and you're the robber
baron, it's easy to enjoy. In the words of Mel Brooks, it's good to
be the king.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, Sid Meier's classic Railroad Tycoon,
Tycoon II takes place in the unregulated heyday of 19th-century
industrial expansion, when magnates like Cornelius Vanderbilt and
Jay Gould could strong-arm rivals, collusively divide the
marketplace, use the stock market as their personal piggy bank and
bribe the government with relative impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Leveraging an essential service to crush your rivals was
standard operating procedure. No one could prosecute you for making
the entire chain of supply an essential part of your operating
system. Running a ham-fisted monopoly did not require an army of
lawyers. Corporate life was simpler then.
</P>
<P>
   Tycoon II evokes that era in sepia tones, literally. On a
tactical level, the game is about laying track, building stations,
buying locomotives and transporting cargo. As with many strategy
games, there is an impressive depth of logistical detail and
clockwork: dozens of engines to choose from, 34 types of cargo, 5
styles of railroad station architecture, construction expenses,
loading logistics and the minutiae of routing.
</P>
<P>
   But on a deeper level, Railroad Tycoon II is about vertical
integration and financial management. You can make a tidy profit
hauling goods and raw materials from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
   But why not buy the mines, refineries, mills, factories and
storefronts while you're at it? It makes everything smoother and
easier and more profitable. And it makes the shareholders happy.
And ultimately, that is the be-all and end-all of this game.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, this is a game about the stock market. If you're
foggy about bond ratings, book value and five-year weighted
returns, prepare to master the basics of corporate accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Because your mission, at the end of the day, is to drive up the
price of your stock by reducing your debt relative to the size of
your assets and by showing a solid profit over a number of years.
(I know it sounds loony, but that's how it worked before Internet
companies started going public.)
</P>
<P>
   If you get bored milking the cash cow, you can resign as
chairman, hold onto all your high-yielding stock and buy control of
another company or start a new one from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   If there are enough players on the map, you don't need to lay a
single rail _ you can just invest in other people's companies and
play Railroad Tycoon II strictly as a stock market game. You can be
the Paul Allen of the railroad industry.
</P>
<P>
   A good chunk of your success, on a macro level, hinges on timing
bond issues, buying out your partners, leveraging your shares and
short-selling your competitors. Rest assured that if you get in
over your head with borrowed money or borrowed stock, your
opponents will seize the opportunity to drive you into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty wide-open simulation of corporate business
warfare as it existed then and as it exists now,'' said Phil
Steinmeyer, Railroad Tycoon II's producer, who worked as a
consultant for the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad before
starting a computer game company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a programmer working primarily on back-office stuff. We
were trying to deal with and computerize waybilling, a settlement
system for railroads that was 150 years old. We reduced the amount
of humans needed to process that by about 80 percent through
computerization, just creating very advanced rules system for
evaluating the way bills came through. The traditional view that
the railroad is a bunch of guys out there with pickaxes and tons of
engineers and firemen is outdated now. It is, to a large extent, an
operational and information management task.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a network. It requires large capital investments. It hauls
traffic. In some ways, the railroad network is not unlike the
telecommunications network, which has also spurred an enormous
economic transformation and has similarly outpaced the government's
ability to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, there are parallels, which is why 19th-century
antitrust laws are being used to scrutinize the software industry.
But there are also substantial differences that create a certain
degree of legal uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   And where there is legal uncertainty (and vast amounts of
money), there are lobbyists. In their era, the robber barons
lobbied ferociously, albeit unsuccessfully, to thwart federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in a void of government regulations about the software
industry,'' Steinmeyer said, ``we're seeing Microsoft throw cash at
the government. We're seeing Microsoft's opponents throw cash at
the government, in terms of high-powered lobbyists and all manner
of ways that corporations influence the government. It's not quite
so direct and crass as it might have been in the 1800s in terms of
flat-out bribes. But it is the modern equivalent thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wouldn't be surprised if as the computer industry ages a
bit, people look back on Bill Gates the way they look back on
Cornelius Vanderbilt. Some will view him as a scoundrel who was a
monopolist and a vicious individual. And others will look at him as
the guy who built the software industry. And both views, to some
extent, will be true.''

TAKING PICTURES INTO PANORAMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even that cool photograph-analysis machine that Harrison Ford
used in the futuristic science-fiction classic ``Blade Runner''
couldn't change the perspective of a photograph so that it could be
viewed 360 degrees by 360 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But a new technology, now being offered to consumers, can do
just that, tilting an image and circling around it as if the viewer
were standing at the center of a panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Pictures Corp. is a leading developer of what its
executives call immersive photographic image technology. ``For 130
years, a picture basically was a flat panel shot,'' said James
Phillips, chairman and chief executive of the company, based in San
Jose, Calif. With these new photographs, called IPIX
(www.ipix.com), ``we literally allow you to step inside of every
picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, taken with specially outfitted conventional
cameras or digital ones, are created with a special software
program. On a personal computer, the software combines two
180-degree photographs, taken with a fish-eye lens, of a scene or
object.
</P>
<P>
   When the two images are melded into one, viewers can use the
mouse to navigate within the photograph and beyond its borders,
left, right, up or down.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the company's site, an IPIX photograph of Frank
Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater can be seen conventionally, as an image
of a house nestled in the woods of Pennsylvania. But viewers can
also change their vantage point, so that it seems as if they are
standing in front of the house, looking into the woods. If they
move the mouse up, the image reveals the sky. If they move it down,
they see the ground. Viewers can also zoom in and out of the
photograph with a click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the unique things you can do,'' Jeff Garrard,
executive editor of Cable News Network, said of IPIX images. For
more than a year, CNN and a number of companies, including hotel
chains, automobile makers and entertainment businesses like MTV and
other news operations like The New York Times on the Web, have been
using IPIX images on their Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   CNN also used the technology to explore the cockpit of the Space
Shuttle during its coverage of the recent mission involving John
Glenn. For millions, it was the first time they had seen IPIX
images.
</P>
<P>
   Now more may view them. Until recently, IPIX technology was sold
mostly to photography enthusiasts and Web developers. But last
week, IPIX kits, including the fish-eye lens, software and a
rotating tripod, were packaged with consumer-friendly digital
cameras from Kodak, Olympus and Nikon. The sets range in price from
$600 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Phillips said, ``will totally reshape photography.''

   Pick up a phone while your computer is connected to the
Internet, and you hear what sounds like the braying of an
electronic donkey. Somewhere inside that set of squawks might be a
picture of your grandmother, an e-mail to your boss or perhaps the
newest version of Doom slowly downloading to your computer. Bits
and bytes have been turned into audio chatter by a technological
workhorse: the modem.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery unravels a bit when you consider a modem's full
name: MOdulator/DEModulator. A modem takes digital information, in
the form of single binary digits (bits), and passes those bits
through a series of steps to repackage, or modulate, them into
analog signals _ sound waves, in this case _ so the bits can be
passed over a regular phone line. The process is reversed as the
modem deciphers, or demodulates, information coming in from the
phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Before modems, computers had to be ``hard wired'' together, even
over long distances, to talk to one another. Modems have made
communication cheaper and easier, eventually leading to the
Internet. Although phone companies' switching equipment turns
analog signals into digital ones for transmission over long
distances, the weak leak is still the analog hookup between a home
or business and the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   A modem translates between the computer's digital world and the
phone line's analog audio world. The computer sends out information
packets as a series of ones and zeros. Since a telephone carries
information in the form of electrical signals representing sound
waves, the quality of transmission can vary widely from place to
place. One house might have clean lines, while clicks and radio
stations might intrude upon the lines of the house next door. The
distance from a switching station can also affect clarity.
</P>
<P>
   A phone line carries only the small range of frequencies in
which most human conversation takes place: about 300 to 3,300
hertz. The modem works within these limits in creating sound waves
to carry data across phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But modem designers have become increasingly clever at squeezing
more bits into that tonal range. Software that runs in the modem
analyzes data for repetitive information, like the space character
repeated 100 times in a row or the word ``the'' occurring over and
over. Before transmission, these patterns are replaced with symbols
or codes. The receiving-end modem takes the codes and reconstructs
the original redundant bits, sending them to the receiving computer
without any loss of information.
</P>
<P>
   Modems use different tones to represent different bits of data.
Each set of tones is called a symbol. Baud measures the number of
symbols, or discrete units of information expressed by phase and
amplitude modulation, per second. The measurement is named for
Jean-Emile Baudot, a Frenchman who developed a binary code in the
19th century. Modems were first widely used in the late 1960s. They
ran at 110 baud, sending one bit per symbol, or 110 bits per second
(bps). The 300-baud modems that showed up in the early 70's were an
enormous improvement, akin to the leap from 9,600 bps to 28.8
kilobits per second (kbps).
</P>
<P>
   But the breakthrough that led to today's fastest modems was the
idea of sending several tones at the same time, creating a
mini-symphony of sounds in each symbol. So starting with the
1,200-baud modems that came into general use in the early 1980s,
each symbol has been carrying many bits at once, not just a single
bit. Phone line quality has also continued to improve, so more
tones can be used over a greater frequency range. A 33.6-kbps
modem, for instance, transmits about 9.8 bits of data per symbol
(data for correcting errors are also sent), at a rate of about
3,429 symbols per second.
</P>
<P>
   The 56K (56 kbps) modems run no faster than 33.6 kbps
``upstream,'' to an Internet service provider, and about 40 to 50
kpbs ``downstream,'' with data coming from the ISP to the user's
computer. The transmission is all digital on the ISPs end, allowing
it to do a better job encoding information for sending, but the
specialized equipment the ISP uses is not available for a user's
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Today's modems have more computing power than the personal
computers that connected to them in the 110-baud days. But their
function is still the same: turning bits into boops. &QL;

AVOIDING THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL CALLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERYBODY needs somebody sometime to help with balky hardware or
software. But there may be ways to avoid calls for technical
support. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REGISTER Sending in your registration cards puts you on the list
for bug alerts, and helps you negotiate for free help.
</P>
<P>
   BACK UP THE ESSENTIALS Keep the product names and the telephone
numbers of the companies that make them. Keep on hand a copy of the
disk that contains your operating system. Make a ``boot disk'' to
start your computer from the floppy drive when Windows will not
start from the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   With a floppy disk in the drive, right-click My Computer on the
desktop, left-click ``Open,'' right-click on the floppy drive, and
left-click ``Format.'' Left-click ``Copy system files only'' and
``Start.'' Keep all your system disks together.
</P>
<P>
   SEARCH FOR VIRUSES An antivirus utility checks for problems when
you start your computer. You should back up your files weekly _
daily for important, current ones _ and scan your disk for errors
once a month.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH FOR UPDATES Make regular visits to sites that report bugs
and how to fix them, especially when you are about to upgrade or
install something new. Programs like Quarterdeck's TuneUp and
RealHelp and Cybermedia's Oil Change will compare your system to a
Web-based archive of fixes, find what is missing, and show you how
to download it. A free Web-based service called Catch-UP is
available at www.catch.com.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK BEFORE YOU LOAD ``If it ain't broke, don't upgrade it,''
advises Joel Diamond, technical director of the Windows User Group
Network. Bug fixes may have bugs of their own. And stick with
responsible sites, like Download.com.

CLASSIC RESPONSES TO THE BIG CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a very promiscuous computer. In the seven months since I
bought my Micron Millenia, I have introduced it to no fewer than
100 new software programs _ including about three dozen shareware
applications _ and nearly a dozen hardware gadgets. Electronic
books, printers, digital cameras: if someone invented a
computerized toothbrush, I'd probably try to hook that up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Or I would have, until the other day, when my computer let me
know that it had had enough. At first, its message was subtle: it
crashed. I rebooted. Crash. I rebooted. That time, everything
seemed fine _ until I clicked on the My Computer icon on the
desktop. Then it crashed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is odd,'' I said to my husband in the same unconcerned
tone I use when the cats have deposited yet another decapitated
mouse on the living-room rug. ``Do you think I should uninstall the
beta version of that new printer driver?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe the computer doesn't like that home-networking card I
put inside it,'' my husband replied in the same reasonable tone he
uses to inform me that he plans to scoop up mouse organs with a
dustpan. ``I'll just take it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, the printer software had been removed, the
home network was history, and I was rebooting my computer. Smugly,
I thought to myself, there, that wasn't so bad. This, of course, is
what armchair psychiatrists like to refer to as a classic response.
</P>
<P>
   When the familiar Windows desktop filled my screen and I clicked
on My Computer, the computer froze.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I looked at each other and tried not to speak. I
was dying to blame him for his home-networking card and he was
dying to blame me for infecting my machine with a buggy,
throw-a-pie-in-Bill-Gates'-face freeware screen saver. Blaming
someone else for your own problems is another classic response.
</P>
<P>
   So my husband said bravely, ``If you watch the baby for the next
few minutes, I'll phone Micron tech support and ask them if they've
ever heard of this problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, he called down the stairs, ``Do you
know where the Windows boot disk is?''
</P>
<P>
   That, I admit, is the first moment that reality hit: we were in
a state of techno-despair. My computer was fried. So much junk had
been added to and removed from it over the months that there was no
telling what caused the problem. It could have been a flawed
driver, a device conflict or a turf war between the computer and
the printer. Micron's tech support staff had recommended a clean
installation of the Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   I also recognized, belatedly, that I had ignored the early
symptoms. First, you notice a problem, like the fact that the My
Computer icon doesn't snap to attention when you address it. Next,
you kid yourself. Oh, this will only take a minute to fix. An hour
later, you're invested. It's similar to the same phenomenon that
overtakes bidders at the antiques auctions that I attend every few
months at the American Legion Hall in Huntington, N.Y., where I
live. If bidders knew they would have to cough up $1,000 for a
rickety table, they would never raise their paddles in the first
place. But they get swept up gradually, their bids growing. Then
they get invested in the process _ and whip out their checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just buy another computer,'' I said, which, as my
husband well knew, was code for ``Could you fix it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Then I took the baby downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, my husband had reinstalled the
operating system, following some complicated instructions from the
Micron tech support staff that he will not be able to remember in
the event that he ever has to do it again. A half-hour after that,
he had found the necessary modem driver on the U.S. Robotics site
in a remote spot he will not be able to find in the event he ever
has to do that again.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, we had located _ after hunting behind the desk
and under the rug and in the crawlspace behind our office _ the
disks necessary to reinstall the Eudora e-mail program, Microsoft
Word and all my online services' software.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, I had tweaked my desktop settings, recreated all
the shortcuts to open my favorite programs and amazingly found my
Winzip shareware program still lurking on my hard drive. After more
than six hours FROM TIME OF FIRST CRASH, my computer was back (more
or less).
</P>
<P>
   The moral seems to be this: if you love only what you can do
with computers, you don't really love computers. To really love
them, you have to love the process of computers. Fortunately, my
husband has learned to love process. An old friend of ours _ a
former teen-age hacker who spent time in federal prison after
messing around with the phone company's equipment _ once confided
that the thing he loved above all else about computers was that no
matter what went wrong, you could always fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other problems can you know for sure you can fix?''
my husband said. He felt justifiably proud. A classic response.

   Often, when you're talking to phone support technicians, they
are getting their answers by tapping into an online database. To
cut out the middleman, many companies put their databases on line _
which reduces their support bills so much that they provide the
service free.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Tarter, executive director of the Association of Support
Professionals, said he believed that this channel of support would
eventually supersede traditional phone-based help.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishing companies also put their how-to articles on
line, and many online communities provide message boards or
technical advice from experts via online conferences or e-mail.
Here are some places to get help. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFTome KNOWLEDGE BASE: www.microsoft.com/support &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This provides a searchable collection of articles highlighting
problems, bugs, downloadable fixes and how-to advice for all
Microsoft products. Some articles merely state that a problem has
no known solution _ but that information alone can save you from
wild goose chases. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ZD HELP: www.zdnet.com/zdhelp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you just don't know how to do something, ZD Help searches
through Ziff-Davis' database of step-by-step tips and answers to
frequently asked questions, drawn from publications like PC
Magazine. The site also has live support forums on Mondays from 7
to 8:30 p.m. EST (requires downloadable chat software). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUG NET: www.bugnet.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bug Net chronicles the faults of scores of popular programs in
its regular bulletins and provides fixes and links to downloadable
updates. Much of Bug Net's value is in its subscription-based
service, but the Web site maintains an archive of significant
articles that you can search and read free. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT HELP: www.supporthelp.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TECHSTATION: www.techstation.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know the Web address of a company's support site,
these two sites provide links to company pages. Support Help also
provides a search engine that looks for company and product names
and it includes phone support numbers and relevant Usenet
newsgroups. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MACFIXIT: www.macfixit.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site regularly publishes troubleshooting tips and solutions
for problems with Macintosh hardware and software. Two substantial
sections deal with Mac OS 8.5 and the iMac. A searchable database
of bulletins covers much ground. &QL;

GETTING THE MOST OUT A CALL FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are ways to get more out of that technical support phone
call _ when you finally have to make it. Here are some
suggestions: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT Before calling, write down the exact
wording of any error messages you encounter. Try to reproduce the
problem, and if you can, start to troubleshoot the process.
</P>
<P>
   If you are running several programs, close one and try to
reproduce the problem. Anything that points to the cause of the
problem will help make the support call more efficient. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DO SOME RESEARCH Before picking up the phone, check online
support sources. You may be able to solve your own problem or
discover that it is part of a known problem or bug. If there is a
bug, most manufacturers will not charge for the service call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BACK UP BEFORE CALLING At the first sign of trouble, you should
back up your crucial data files. (You have been doing this
unfailingly all along, right?) Fixing some technical problems may
require drastic solutions like reinstalling your operating system,
which may put your data at risk. Technical problems are stressful
enough without also gambling with your work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHECK THE CONNECTIONS What looks like a catastrophic hardware
failure may just be a loose cable. If your mouse, keyboard, printer
or monitor stops working, first check the connectors at the back of
your computer to make sure they have not come loose. You could save
yourself 15 minutes on the phone _ and some embarrassment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAVE A PEN AND PAPER HANDY When you are on the phone, it helps
to jot down names of people you talk to and the steps you take to
solve your problem. Since you will probably have to restart your
computer during the process, you cannot take notes on a word
processing document. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW YOUR SYSTEM If you are calling a computer system
manufacturer, have your serial number or invoice number ready. For
all other calls, you will need to know your computer's processor
type, operating system, RAM and model name.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians may also ask what kind of CD-ROM, modem, printer or
other hardware you have. To find these details under Windows 95 or
98, right-click on My Computer on the desktop and select
Properties. Hardware details are under the Device Manager tab. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW YOUR SOFTWARE Jot down the release and serial numbers of
whatever software is involved, including the operating system. Most
of these details can be found under About on the Help menu. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAKE A NUMBER, AND WRITE IT DOWN Get the name and direct
telephone number of any technician you speak with, and write down
your customer ID or case number. If you do not resolve your problem
on the first call, you can quote these in subsequent calls, like an
insurance claim number, to save time.
</P>
<P>
   This may also help you prove things were awry before the
warranty was up. And if you get good service, you will be able to
pass on thanks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GO WITH THE FLOW Let the technician walk you through the
questions. It may be slow going if you have already tried to solve
the problem, but being methodical saves time in the end. And do not
conceal anything that you may have done to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you think you did something stupid, your support
representative needs to know about it if he is going to do his
job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAKE CHARGE IF NECESSARY If you are getting nowhere with a
particular technical representative, it is quite acceptable to ask
_ without being hostile _ to speak with a supervisor or specialist.
Or you can hang up and call back _ another good reason to write
down that customer ID. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DO NOT LEAVE A CALL OPEN-ENDED If a technician needs time to
research your question, do not hang up without knowing when you can
expect a call back. And keep your case number and other notes
handy.
</P>
<P>

pickup trucks by day, empty and serene at night. Many of the women

whom she has been unable to locate since a hurricane devastated
Central America two weeks ago. But Ms. Palacios can fly only in her
imagination because of a nightmarish web of federal laws and
regulations that make traveling abroad an almost impossible dream
for illegal immigrants or those in process of becoming legal
residents. By Mirta Ojito.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; More than 30 authors will be featured in a series
of events in the Valley and Los Angeles from Saturday through Nov.
22 at the second annual People of the Book, Southern California's
biggest Jewish book festival.
</P>
<P>
   Most events _ including lectures, panel discussions, a pajama
party for families, cooking classes, bedtime stories for children

</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are known as the People of the Book,'' said festival
director Seville Porush. ``We teach our children your education is
something nobody can take away from you. But people are unaware of
what is available within the framework of Jewish literature. We
hope to give them a place where they can find what they can't find
at little Jewish bookstores that have closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to speakers and discussions, a mobile bookstore
featuring books that will be discussed, as well as other titles,
will be available at each event. While there's a charge for many
events, there's no admission charge for those who just want to come
to shop for books.
</P>
<P>
   Featured authors will be Thomas Cahill (``The Gifts of the
Jews''), Rich Cohen (``Tough Jews''), Dr. Laura Schlessinger (``The
Ten Commandments: What's in It for Me?''), and Dvorah Telushkin

Singer'').
</P>
<P>
   A reception at 7 p.m. Saturday at West Valley JCC will be
followed at 8 p.m. by a talk by Telushkin; admission is $15.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen will speak at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Valley Cities Jewish
Community Center, 13164 Burbank Blvd., Sherman Oaks; cost is $6.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill will speak at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at West Valley JCC; cost
is $10.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger will appear with Rabbi Stewart Vogel at 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday at Temple Aliyah, 6025 Valley Circle Blvd., Woodland
Hills; cost is $25.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to authors' lectures, other events expected to be
popular with attendees include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Computer hardware, software and Internet demonstrations from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Nov. 15 at West Valley JCC; admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   _ A pajama party with storytelling for the whole family from 5
to 6:30 p.m. Sunday at Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center,
1110 Bates Ave., Los Angeles. Admission is $1 or one new or used
book, to be donated to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jewish cooking classes at 1 p.m. Nov. 16 with Faye Levy at
North Valley Jewish Community Center, 16601 Rinaldi St., Granada
Hills, and at 7:30 p.m. Monday with Joan Nathan at Stephen S. Wise
Temple, 15500 Stephen S. Wise Drive, Los Angeles. The 1 p.m. class
is free; there is a $6 charge for the evening class.
</P>
<P>
   _ A panel discussion on the future of Judaism at 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday at Stephen S. Wise Temple. Participants will be rabbis
Edward Feinstein, Steven Carr Reuben and Elliot Dorff; Gladys
Sturman will moderate. Admission is $6.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program will explore censorship at 7:45 p.m. Thursday at
West Valley JCC. Admission is $1 or one new or used book.
</P>
<P>
   _ Multicultural programs in four different languages at 2 p.m.

BRANDY POURS IT ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You won't confuse the Brandy Norwood of ``Moesha''
and ``Cinderella'' with the part the teen r&AMP;b queen plays in the
slasher sequel ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, which opens Friday and also features Jennifer Love
Hewitt of TV's ``Party of Five,'' Brandy's tough-talking character,
Karla, makes out with co-star Mekhi Phifer in a hot tub, runs
around the Bahamas in a skimpy bathing suit and kickboxes the
movie's murderous fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so bad in this, saying bad words and stuff,'' admits
Brandy, who lives in Woodland Hills and recently scored a No. 1 pop
smash with ``The Boy Is Mine,'' a duet with fellow single-named r&AMP;b
sensation, Monica. ``My mom was at the screening, and I kept
saying, `Mom, it's in the script. I had to say it'.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fright flick, which follows last year's teen horror
smash, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' was shot mostly over a
month's time in various remote locations in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first feature film for 19-year-old Brandy, who
co-starred last year with Whitney Houston and Whoopi Goldberg in a
highly rated TV-film version of Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein's
``Cinderella.'' The singer says she was none too pleased with
Mexico's 90-degree-plus tropical climate _ not to mention the
creepy, crawly things that invaded the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there for a month _ and that was a month too long,''
Brandy said. ``I wanted to go back home in three days. I wasn't
used to these animals _ lemurs and geckos and scorpions and things.
One of the actresses woke up with a crab on her head. But I brought
Raid. I hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set, Brandy hit it off with Hewitt, who also sings, stars
in a hit TV series and again plays Julie James in ``I Still Know
... .'' Brandy's ``Moesha,'' currently in its fourth season, is the
UPN network's highest-rated series.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who has done eight films, said the camaraderie that
developed in Mexico is apparent on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie couldn't be done without every actor pulling their
weight, whether they acted in a film before or not,'' she said.
``It was a tough shoot being in the rain and being in Mexico, but
everyone was so brave and great.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``I Still Know ...,'' Brandy's Karla Wilson character is
Julie's best friend and roommate but knows nothing about Julie's
paranoia and fear of the fisherman, Ben Willis (Muse Watson).
</P>
<P>
   The girls win an all-expense-paid Bahamas vacation for four
during the July 4 weekend. Karla's main squeeze, Tyrell Martin
(Phifer) and Julie's classmate Will Benson (Matthew Settle) are
invited to tag along. Upon their arrival, other guests begin
leaving, a terrible storm moves in, and a series of brutal murders
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karla was the type of person I'd hang out with,'' Brandy said.
``She's someone I'd feel safe with. She could tell people what to
do, and she was hard and a kickboxer. I loved it. I want to do more
challenging roles like that. Moesha is so next-door. The baddest
thing she's ever done is sneak out a window to see a guy, and
that's not so bad. Then you have Cinderella who's so perfect. I
need to do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Danny Cannon said Brandy fell into her Karla role
surprisingly easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a lot more physical and exhausting than she
thought it would be,'' he said. ``I allowed her to put a lot of
herself into the part, to use her own instincts. She learned very
quickly, and she's a great girl. She was a trouper.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brandy will team with Diana Ross as mother and daughter
in the ABC-TV drama ``Double Platinum,'' which begins shooting next
month in New York for May sweeps. The film is being produced by
Brandy's Norwood Ent. Group.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Brandy's singing are apparently willing to accept the
singer as a dramatic actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call her a singer or an actor,'' said Vivian Matthew
Yarde, a 20-year-old freshman at the University of the Virgin
Islands who runs a Web site devoted to all things Brandy. ``I think
of her as a professional entertainer.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Brandy said she believes fans of such
multimillion-selling albums as her current ``Never Say Never''
(Atlantic) realize she must accept different parts to grow as an
actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll be upset (by Karla's behavior),'' Brandy
said. ``I want to be an entertainer, period. I want to do
everything: movies, TV, modeling, commercials. But that's the
downside of fame _ you have to always live up to expectations, to
what people think you are. I am a lot of the way people think I am,
but then again, I'm human.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandy said one of her trickiest scenes in ``I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer'' required her to kiss co-star Phifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mekhi, now, I haven't kissed that many guys, so I
don't know if I'll be any good,' '' Brandy recalled. ``He said,
`Brandy, just do it.' We developed a relationship outside the movie
where we'd always hang out, his cousin, my friends. We had a
wonderful time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Brandy's real-life personality similar to that of the
tough-talking Karla? Or is she more like girl-next-door Moesha?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tough and I'm sweet, but if you mess with me I'll go crazy
on you, and that's the way I am,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether she prefers singing or acting, Brandy chose
acting because ``it's more of a challenge since I have to always
please somebody else. I like that. I like the fact I have to
challenge myself to do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandy hit back at reports that she and duet partner Monica
fought at rehearsals for the recent MTV Video Music Awards at the
Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't kill a fly,'' she said. ``I know it looks like that in
the movies, but I can't hit. I'm not punching other people. If
anything, they're punching me. No, the truth is, I'm cool with her.
It's hard to call someone a friend right off the bat. But I respect
her. I love her music. I love what she's done, her image and
everything. That's why I chose her to be on my song.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her goals, Brandy said she doesn't want to have to work
if she doesn't want to by the time she reaches the ripe old age of
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to retire,'' she explained. ``I just don't want
to have to work. I'll be like Julia Roberts _ I'll just do movies
for the heck of it. Some of these people doing movies are doing it
only because they love the work. That's what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goal involves making a film with comic actor Chris
Tucker of ``Rush Hour'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I want to do a movie where I'm the killer, then I want
to do a romantic comedy with Chris, because he can just make me
laugh and make me a better actress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy says she has two close friends in Woodland Hills who
treat her as a normal person, not a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just love each other to death,'' she said. ``They don't
care who I am, and they don't treat me like a celebrity. My friends
support me, but they tell me the truth.''

   JERUSALEM _ After delays due to political resistance and a

Wednesday won belated approval from his cabinet for the Wye peace
plan. But not without conditions attached that could threaten the
agreement signed just three weeks ago.

<P>
   Palestinians were quick Wednesday night to accuse the Israelis
of trying to alter the deal, which passed narrowly by a vote of
eight to four, with five abstentions, and after seven hours of
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did tonight was a flagrant violation of the Wye
Memorandum,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``We will
not allow any post-agreement negotiations. We will honor the
agreement to the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials had for weeks been warning both sides not to
tinker with the delicate agreement, which was hammered out over
nine days of intense negotiations and signed by Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Oct. 23 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is largely a reaffirmation of the troubled Oslo
peace process. Under Wye, Israeli troops will withdraw from 13
percent more of the West Bank land captured in the 1967 war in
exchange for Palestinian efforts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis insist they cannot begin implementing the plan until
both the cabinet and parliament approve it. The parliament is
expected to pass it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu promised to continue carrying out the Wye agreement
and said Israel would soon release some Palestinian prisoners and
allow the opening next week of the first Palestinian airport, in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But, Wednesday's cabinet resolution specified that the cabinet
will assess Palestinian compliance before giving approval for each
step of the 12-week plan.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the cabinet said that, after this 13 percent, only one
percent more of West Bank land can be handed over in the Oslo
process. That is less than Palestinians expect and Wye had
established a committee to negotiate that withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet also threatened to retake lands already turned over
if the Palestinians carry out vows to declare statehood even
without Israeli approval next year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the cabinet demanded a vote from the PLO to rescind
parts of its charter that call for the destruction of Israel. This
point was debated at Wye, where Israel signed wording that only
required that the PLO meet to ``reaffirm'' an earlier vote on the
charter.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet vote had been delayed at least twice by Netanyahu
since he signed the Wye agreement. The first delays were political,
Netanyahu was seeking reluctant support from right-wing members of
his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was again delayed last Friday after a suicide bombing
by two Palestinian extremists in a Jerusalem market filled with
Israelis. The bombing, apparently a botched attempt, killed only
the two bombers but provided ammunition to Israelis opposed to the
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the delayed cabinet approval, Israeli
officials said there will be a delay of some days in the first
troop withdrawals scheduled under Wye.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions attached to the cabinet approval were sought by
right-wing allies in Netanyahu's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said
the cabinet decision will have to be reviewed by the Clinton
administration before U.S. officials can comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the cabinet vote, Netanyahu had sought and
received several written assurances from U.S. officials about how
the agreement would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   But there were long-standing rifts between the two sides on the
issue of the Palestinian charter even before the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a favorite among those in the Israeli right wing,
most of whom opposed the Oslo peace process in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   They see the charter as proof that Arafat and the Palestinians
still aim to destroy Israel, and that Oslo is just a stepping stone
in their effort.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the issue creates a tough political position
for Arafat. Many influential PLO members, including past and
present guerrilla fighters, live scattered around the world and are
opposed to Oslo and changes in the charter.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The charter, about six pages long, was passed by the PLO in
1968, when it was steeped in a terrorist war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Using revolutionary rhetoric, much of the charter repeatedly
calls for violence against Israel. It rejects any compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians note that the PLO's 700-member governing body
already met in 1996 to rescind parts of the charter that conflicted
with Oslo. The meeting was greeted with approval from American and
Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Just what happened at the meeting is still subject for debate.
It apparently was just a vote to start the amending process, never
completed.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Arafat restated that the charter was amended in a
letter to Clinton. During the Wye talks, it was agreed that Arafat
would ``invite'' the PLO back to affirm his letter.
</P>
<P>
   An American official close to the talks said recently that the
agreement and the Oslo process do not require a formal vote or, as
Israelis have demanded, that a new version of the charter be
rewritten with all the changes.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that any attempts to change the Wye plan could bring
it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are very sensitive about the wording of virtually
every part of the agreement,'' he said.

GINGRICH WAS WISE TO AVOID LAME-DUCK STATUS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich's bombshell decision to forsake
Congress and his speakership brings to mind the fate that befell
the last Republican speaker shorn of his power and influence as the
party's leader in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He was Joseph W. Martin. With the midterm election of 1954, the
speakership switched from Martin to the Democrats' Sam Rayburn. But
Martin held onto his post as GOP leader until he was overthrown
after the 1958 election.
</P>
<P>
   Then he became a pathetic figure in the House, often taking a
seat in the back row and viewing the legislative procedure, over
which he once presided, with sadness in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He received a committee assignment, but his days of glory and
leadership were over. He looked and acted like a fatally-wounded
lion awaiting the final lethal blow, which didn't come until 1966,
when he was defeated for renomination by his home-district
Republicans in North Attleboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A man of medium stature with bushy eyebrows and a new England
accent, Martin owned the small town's newspaper and, like Gingrich,
was a symbol of Republican conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gingrich, he also was a symbol of isolationism in the
years before America's entry into World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In ``FDR: An Intimate History,'' Nathan Miller recalled how
Franklin D. Roosevelt ridiculed _ with great success _ Martin and
two other GOP isolationists, New York Reps. Bruce Barton and
Hamilton Fish, in the 1940 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also headed the Republican National Committee, and Barton
was chairman of Wendell L. Willkie's presidential campaign. Fish
represented Roosevelt's home district in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in New York's Madison Square Garden, Miller wrote,
Roosevelt first chanted the names Martin, Barton and Fish ``in a
sing-song nursery rhyme cadence of Wynken, Blynken and Nod.''
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the moment Roosevelt mentioned Martin's name, his
audiences ``gleefully roared back `Barton and Fish.'''
</P>
<P>
   Willkie, the Republican presidential nominee, later said: ``When
I heard the president hang the isolationist votes of Martin, Barton
and Fish on me, and get away with it, I knew I was licked.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin remained the Republican leader of the House for
nearly two more decades.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the House in 1925 and served as GOP leader from 1940
until 1959 when he was toppled in a coup that made Indiana's
Charles Halleck the GOP chieftain.
</P>
<P>
   Martin occupied the speaker's chair twice: in the 80th Congress,
which was elected in 1946 and became Harry Truman's primary target
in the presidential campaign of 1948, and the 83d, which was
elected when Dwight D. Eisenhower first swept to victory in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's power and prestige were so great within his party that
he was elected permanent chairman of five consecutive GOP national
conventions, from 1940 to 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was in his mid-70s and no longer vigorous, Martin,
like Gingrich, was done in by a midterm election. In 1958 the
Republicans suffered a debacle, losing 48 seats in the House and 13
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gingrich in 1998, Martin was blamed by many Republicans for
their loss. The real culprits, however, were an economic recession,
Eisenhower's initial refusal to take seriously the Soviet Union's
advances in space exploration and the fact that the administration,
with a 68-year-old president at its helm, appeared old and tired.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans believed then, as they believe now, that they
would fare better with the public if they had new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   They got the new leadership in 1959, and in the next election,
1960, they picked up 20 seats in the House and two in the Senate
while John Kennedy was defeating their presidential nominee,
Richard Nixon. Still, they remained a long way from winning control
of the two houses, and Halleck was deposed as House minority leader
by Gerald Ford following the 1964 election.
</P>
<P>
   Under procedures of the House, a person who takes a leadership
position gives up his or her seniority on major committees. Thus,
Gingrich had no place to go in the House if he had been defeated
for another term as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, members of the leadership do retain their senior
positions on committees. When West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd
decided to give up his job as majority leader, he simply slipped
into the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, at 55 a much younger and more dynamic figure than
Martin was in 1959, would not have ended his House tenure in so
forlorn a manner.
</P>
<P>
   To the bachelor Martin, the House was his life. To Gingrich,
with a wife and children and a career as a historian, the House was
but one phase of his life. He now can write, lecture and try, as a
private citizen, to strengthen the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich would have found life difficult once his power was
gone, and the new speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, would
have found it difficult with Gingrich looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he decided to sever all contact with Congress to
spare his party and his country further ``divisiveness and
factionalism.'' But he also benefited himself by avoiding the fate
of becoming another Joe Martin.

POETRY ABOUT SPAM FOR THE MEAT GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the moment, anyway, John Nagamichi Cho's new book has a
category unto itself at the Library of Congress. His
Internet-derived collection of haiku- like verse inspired by Spam,
the popular processed-pork product, is the sole listing under the
subject heading ``Canned meat _ poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   With the deaths last year of the Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and
William S. Burroughs, Cho crowed, ``I'm the first in a generation
of `meat poets.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Spam-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf'' (88 pp.,
HarperCollins, $7.95), Cho sliced 162 prime examples of porcine
poetry out of the Spam Haiku Archive
(pemtropics.mit.edu/jcho/spam/), a Web site he launched as a lark
in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To date, about 1,500 online poets have submitted more than
11,000 entries to the site. All refer in some manner to the
rosy-toned Hormel Foods Corp. product, and most follow the
three-line, 5-7-5 pattern of syllables that schoolchildren learn is
the classic haiku form. The Spam-ku range from earnest, often
ham-fisted efforts at evoking a mood to such swinishly punny
entries as Cho's own Kafkaesque ``Gregor Spamsa woke./ In horror he
sees that he's/ Now a pink pork cube.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cho, 34, a research scientist at MIT, attributes part of
Spam-ku's popularity to the simple fact that it is a short,
silly-sounding word. ``It's hard to compose haiku about Vienna
sausage or Canadian bacon. They take up too many syllables,'' he
explained. He noted that contributors like to play with the tension
between the nostalgia invoked by Spam's rich history _ introduced
in 1937, it was a staple of many wartime diets _ and its
anachronistic status today as prefab pork in a fresh-meat era. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Francis Heaney, 28, has authored about 230 Spam-ku for the
archive. ``They're not all gems,'' he conceded. His favorite
(``Moon rises,/ White as two slices of bread,/ Sunset pink as Spam
within'') did not make it into Cho's paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has since abandoned the form, Heaney, a puzzle
writer and editor in Manhattan, said, ``I do my best writing under
constraints, so the constraint of a haiku, plus the fact that it
has to be about Spam, is very limiting. To do things within that is
fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cho's slim volume represents a burgeoning breed of books that
were sired in cyberspace. Jeremie Ruby-Strauss, who edited
``Spam-ku'' for HarperCollins and who also has published a
compendium of martini recipes that were siphoned from a Web site,
approached Cho after stumbling upon his archive. Realizing he had
already seen Spam-ku swapped with gusto elsewhere on the Internet,
Ruby-Strauss, who now uses an unopened Spam can as a paperweight,
thought, ``Here's a product that's been marketed but there's no
product, so let's make a product.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At his publisher's insistence, Cho sent his selections to Hormel
for approval. He omitted those he feared might raise objections, so
the book's illustrations received the toughest inspection. One that
showed a mouse sniffing at a tin of Spam was rejected by the
Austin, Minn., firm. ``They said, `Please, no rodents associated
with Spam,' '' Cho recalled. ``We just decided to can that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel officials declined to comment, but the company does
maintain a rather tongue-in-cheek Web site for its product
(www.spam.com/). In addition to offering a Spam mouse pad for sale,
the site contains a dissertation that strives to distance the
company from ``spam,'' Internet slang for unsolicited e-mail (the
term was derived from a Monty Python comedy routine in which the
word is repeated ad nauseum).
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, at the bidding of a friend's daughter who
enjoyed the book and wanted to sample its salty, spicy subject, Cho
consumed Spam for the first time in nearly 20 years. Despite his
seven-syllable description of the sensation _ an ``elastic, rubbery
feel'' _ he said the experience had not prompted him to craft a
haiku about the moment. After penning 200 entries for the online
archive, Cho lost his appetite for the verse form in early 1996.
``It was like an addiction,'' he recalled. `When it was over, it
was completely over. I went cold turkey.''

GEPHARDT SAYS HE WANTS TO FORGE LINKS WITH GOP MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just six votes shy of a majority, House Democrats
are poised to build bridges to Republican moderates and seize much
of the legislative agenda from GOP conservatives in the new
Congress, House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will be ``much less unified on what they want to
do'' than Democrats when the 106th Congress is gaveled into session
in January, Gephardt told reporters. ``We have a chance to unify
our party on major issues and reach into the Republican moderates
and attract enough of them ... to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a coalition, he said, could yield wins for Democrats on
such issues as legislation to reduce teen smoking, prop up Social
Security, regulate managed care health plans and raise the minimum
wage. By contrast, he said, Republicans will enter the next
Congress sharply divided between conservatives and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats must face the reality that the GOP majority will
dictate what legislation does or does not move to the House floor,
Gephardt said. Nevertheless, he predicted that the presumed House
Speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., will have a tough time putting
a conservative coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thinks it's far easier on Social Security, education, health
care and the minimum wage for us to put together a coalition with
largely Democrats and a few Republicans who last year were looking
in our direction on these issues,'' Gephardt said. ``We're going to
work very hard on that.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican reacted to Gephardt's vision with a raised
eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime the Democrats want to sit down with Republicans and
search for common ground, there is a distinct possibility of
passing legislation,'' said Clifford May, Republican National
Committee communications director. ``Unfortunately, for the past
year, the Democrats have not done that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon, Gephardt was ebullient over an election that
gave Democrats an unexpected gain of five House seats. The
57-year-old minority leader from St. Louis said he was ``flat-out
surprised'' by the results. The party's pollsters and experts had
predicted a Democratic loss of between two and 10 seats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent exit of House Speaker Newt Gingrich _ a favored
Democratic target _ neither helps nor hinders Democrats, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Newt is their problem,'' he said. ``Their
problem is the far right dominates their party. Their party is far
more disunified than our party. Their agenda ... is not attractive
to the majority of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called GOP handling of the impeachment inquiry against
President Clinton ``defective.''
</P>
<P>
   During House debate last month, Gephardt proposed an inquiry in
which impeachment standards would be set before hearings took
place. Also, the inquiry would have a Dec. 31 deadline and be
limited to Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, approved an inquiry with no limits on time
or subject matter. On Monday, a panel of the House Judiciary
Committee held a day-long hearing with academic experts testifying
on what constitutes an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The panel didn't adopt a formal definition. Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr is scheduled to testify before the full committee
next week as impeachment proceedings get underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of time,'' Gephardt said. Had the committee
started before the election, he added, members could have
formulated standards and weighed Starr's voluminous September
report on the Lewinsky matter against those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt reiterated his characterization of Clinton's conduct as
``reprehensible.'' And he did not adopt the view of some fellow
Democrats that the charges of perjury and obstruction contained in
the Starr report fall short of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Should the committee recommend articles of impeachment to the
full House, ``we will ... try to understand where we are and figure
out what we ought to do,'' Gephardt said. ``I don't know where
we're going to be. I'm troubled about how this whole thing has
transpired.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged a quick resolution to the inquiry but had no advice for
the Republican majority on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put the whole thing back together again,'' he
said. ``It has not been bipartisan in any way. It's been a totally
us-versus-them kind of procedure from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   On his own political future, Gephardt said he is weighing a
presidential bid in 2000 or, if Democrats regain the House majority
that year, ascension to the House speakership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either goal is a very daunting goal,'' he said. ``I always
believed in life you have to set a goal, and then throw yourself
completely within the reach of that goal.'' A decision on whether
to make a presidential run should come sometime around January, he
added.

ENCOURAGING CREATIVITY, WITHOUT THE MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DULCIE LEIMBACH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future of artwork is on the computer. You might not like
what computers produce, you might miss the intoxicating smell of
oils or the tactile quality of a broken-crockery painting _ you
might wonder whether electronic art is even fine art _ but
tomorrow's works are bound to be created digitally.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, children who learn to make art digitally can
become old masters of the genre by the time they hit 10. The four
programs reviewed here range from the simple to the very complex
and sophisticated. All will build a foundation of computer skills
for children as young as 3.
</P>
<P>
   That's good: they will never know computer fear and will become
proficient at the keyboard and with operating systems and printing.
</P>
<P>
   A harder question is whether any of these programs teach
children to draw in the sense of lines across a page. In Crayola's
Make a Masterpiece, for example, only some of the graphics and art
tools bear any relation to real ones (like paintbrushes and colored
pencils).
</P>
<P>
   The notions of how art can be made, modified, enhanced, scrapped
and even finished are its most obvious lessons. Still, the program
relies on graphics that are more goofy than those Michelangelo
might have had in his studio. Does it matter? No.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid Pix and Art Dabbler software programs try very hard to
create a true art environment. Their tools are vast and original,
and both programs offer the basic paintbrushes and colored pencils.
Dabbler may come close to teaching techniques, including how tools
have different effects on others (a crayon drawn on cotton paper,
for example), and even trigger something in the recesses of a
child's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   And Kid Pix teaches how to use computer graphics. The remaining
program, Orly's Draw-a-Story, is an art and writing program with a
very winning lead character named Orly. Does it teach children how
to draw? Not especially, but it may convey the value of an
illustration with a story.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're just the tiniest bit old-fashioned (even
sentimental) and want your children to further their art skills,
none of these programs can replace a real art class in a real
studio taught by a real artist. Messiness has its virtues; it's
part of the process of making art. But these programs do spark
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Before you add any of these software programs to your palette,
you may want to consider a new canvas. There are electronic drawing
pads available, like Pablo from Kidboard, that essentially replace
the mouse as a chief drawing tool with something closer to a pen.
(Kidboard is currently selling Pablo bundled with Art Dabbler and
Kai's Power Goo, both from Metacreations.)
</P>
<P>
   With Pablo, a 6-by-8-inch drawing pad with a pressure-sensitive
stylus, you can still perform all the functions you would with a
mouse, but you can draw as you would on paper, making thicker or
thinner lines and even tracing drawings onto the screen. And the
stylus fits children's small hands better than a mouse. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAKE A MASTERPIECE &QL;

   (IBM and Crayola; $19.95; Windows 95 and 98, Macintosh 7.5 and

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a software program can keep an impatient 4{-year-old in
front of a computer monitor for three squirm-free hours, you know
it's exceptional. This foray into Make a Masterpiece also meant a
bout of independence for this child, who didn't need much help. Who
sent this godsend, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that Scribble, a guide with a French accent,
introduces himself, this art program for children 5 to 12 (and
overeager 4-year-olds) is friendly and approachable. Like a good
friend, he asks, ``How you doing?'' Given this simple introduction,
it's then a surprise to discover that Masterpiece is, in fact,
close to being a real art workshop _ without the mess.
</P>
<P>
   The major components are animated art tools and techniques and a
catalog of famous artworks from the National Gallery in Washington
and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The
graphics look professional but are also vividly appealing to
children.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the sound effects aim to be silly but authentic. (The Magic
Marker tool makes a not-unpleasant screechy sound, replicating the
noise of a marker sliding across a TV screen.)
</P>
<P>
   Like a mille-feuille, Masterpiece has many layers, which is
another reason the child sat still for so long. She started with a
simple project: painting against a mountainous landscape backdrop.
She chose from a rich palette of Crayola colors, then moved into an
array of stroke styles (like squiggles and brushstrokes) and
equipment (pencils, brushes, oil, markers, watercolors and the
like).
</P>
<P>
   She finished her masterpiece by dabbling on an eclectic group of
icons. Egg splats, anyone? They make an excellent
(italics)splat(end italics) noise.
</P>
<P>
   Her multimedia artwork _ a handsome mountain obliterated with
curlicues, slashes and unidentifiable markings _ was overwrought
and inspired but heavy on the popcorn. There was still one step
left, a task prompted by Scribble, who asked, ``Do you want to add
this to your permanent collection?'' Clicking yes, the 4{-year-old
placed her painting in a frame that would have suited a Bonnard and
hung her work in a gallery setting. Voila.
</P>
<P>
   A few flaws in this studio: the stencils tool is hard for even
an adult to figure out, and the library of museum artworks seems
slightly superfluous, especially for younger children.
</P>
<P>
   But Crayola and IBM have thought of almost everything with
Masterpiece. For young children who can't read yet, the audible
prompts _ polite instructions from Scribble _ are an effective lure
and guide.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also neatly integrated: the art tools float on
the screen rather than sitting at the bottom in bars, and a child's
artwork can be stored easily in the ``gallery.'' For children who
can read, the wide selection of tools and techniques turn this
software into a long, satisfying engagement. It's hard to say au
revoir. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORLY'S DRAW-A-STORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $19.99; Windows 3.1 and later, and Macintosh 7.0
and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The narration on Orly's Draw-a-Story quickly pulls children in.
Orly is the narrator, a young Jamaican girl with a set of
dreadlocks and a cheeky manner. Her sidekick, a frog named
Lancelot, is also equipped with a Jamaican accent.
</P>
<P>
   This relatively easy program has an added allure of Caribbean
music, which helped hook both my 10-year-old son and 4{-year-old
daughter. No one can resist Orly, who is fond of saying, ``No
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The program opens with the facade of Orly's house, where
children can choose the Learn or Play options or the Orly's Stories
curtain. (The cursor is an animated blue butterfly.) Behind Learn
are art tools and a tutorial, including instructions on how to use
the ``draw pad'' canvas. (Orly's other friends, New and Undo,
replace the paper when needed.)
</P>
<P>
   Behind Play are the same activities that are behind the curtain:
six pictures that represent Orly's Stories, Make Your Own Storybook
and Doodle Pad, the program's three avenues of fun.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter clicked on Orly's Stories and landed at four
narrated tales with titles like ``The Strange Princess.'' Orly
begins telling a tale, and children are asked to draw pictures at
certain points in the story, like painting an eye. My daughter
arranged a black iris, blue whites and big red veins, prompting
Orly to remark: ``This is kind of creepy. I don't like that staring
at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the picture Orly requests, the draw pad can be
blank or contain a few elements to help a child along. When Orly
asks for a submarine, for example, a periscope and a submarine
window appear in the draw pad, leaving the rest to the child's
imagination (with a supply of colored pencils and paint, which sit
in a bar at the bottom of the screen). In addition, 20 different
sounds are available by clicking the OK box.
</P>
<P>
   The other two features, Make Your Own Storybook and Doodle Pad,
require more skill than Orly's Stories. (A child who isn't reading
yet will need guidance on the first go-rounds for all of the
program's activities.)
</P>
<P>
   In Storybook, a child can write and illustrate a story and view
it in the Junkyard Drive-In Theater. The screen presents a blank
window resembling an open book; on the left is space for pictures.
An array of Jamaican settings (think palm trees) can drop into the
blank space, or you can create your own foreground.
</P>
<P>
   When Orly is done with a story, she asks if you would like to
save the work. Click on Yes, and a window appears, offering titles
and pictures to wrap it all up. As a final touch, a child can ring
a big bell by clicking on it when she is done drawing. It's a
feature taken for granted until you're using a different software
program and your child says, ``There's no bell.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The art tools consist of pencils and paintbrushes, with a hefty
supply of colors and shades, as well as zany textures and patterns.
For colors, a child can hold down the paintbrush and dip it into a
lineup of paint cans. (Most children age 4 and older can probably
handle this.) Dabs or strokes are put to work. An eraser and a
sponge also pop up for starting over. But because Orly's
Draw-a-Story is not only about art but includes writing, the tools
are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Orly is the main attraction here; her presence is just as
irresistible to young girls as to boys (though boys 9 and up might
not want to claim her as their own). She can keep children gliding
from one project to another for most of an afternoon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KID PIX STUDIO DELUXE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $29.95; Windows 3.1 and later, and Macintosh 7.0
and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Orly's Draw-a-Story required some hand-holding, Kid Pix
Studio Deluxe demanded lots of assistance _ at first. Fortunately,
the tools are so clever and extensive that an adult will jump at
the chance to provide technical help. And once you discover that
the program can talk _ type the words in English or Spanish and it
says them back _ you know you're approaching the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kid Pix, introduced in 1991, broke ground in
children's computer-art programs. In the current version, many of
those elements are in place _ digital puppets and a slide show, for
example. The enhanced or new features leapfrog on this fun.
</P>
<P>
   Take the updated stamp collection: kids can now choose from
2,500 stamps, including dynamite and ladybugs, all of which can
bounce, twirl and dance chorus-line style or singly across the
screen. The alphabet stamps are also adventurous, with a different
voice for each letter.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that the letter E would produce a chorus?
The program also offers an extensive collection of other types of
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Kid Pix in the category of children's art
software is the tremendous catalog of art supplies and tools, many
of which can be animated. Simple tasks, like drawing a line, are
rarely straightforward: Do you want to have thick or thin lines or
to make them transparent? How about some spirals to jazz things up?
Better yet, how do you feel about bubbles (and blub-blub noises)?
More serious art styles are just as important. The brush tool, for
example, produces letters as delicate as calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable tools and effects are both ludicrous and
sophisticated and demonstrate the strength of computer art: what
you can't do on a canvas you can do digitally. (Wouldn't Jackson
Pollock be jealous?) Indeed, the effect that sticks in your mind
long after you turn off the computer is the electric mixer, which
runs itself across the screen, churning whatever it passes. One
result is a swirling pattern of marbleized monotones and bright
colors, a living Missoni sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The major drawback of Kid Pix for younger children is that they
will need to read and create files to save their work, which
involves pull-down menus and the like. It's not a big problem, but
if this program had the integrated format of Crayola's
Make-a-Masterpiece, it would be nearly perfect. But you can't have
everything, even in the shadow of the millennium. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ART DABBLER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Metacreations; $49; Windows 95 and 98 and Macintosh 7.5 or
later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dabbler is a well-stocked, serious art studio, with tools and
graphics that simulate those you would find in a genuine studio.
The Dabbler tools, which can create effects and styles ranging from
pointillism to Impressionism, allow children to produce works that
look authentic. For artists, this is challenging and satisfying;
for nonartists, Dabbler is like taking an introductory course at a
good art school.
</P>
<P>
   Children from age 4 to about 7 will probably need constant
assistance; older children should be able to solo after a few tries
with an adult.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated printed guide comes with the package; a longer
tutorial, on the CD-ROM, requires Adobe Acrobat 3.01, which can be
downloaded free on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In Dabbler, the art tools and colors are in virtual drawers at
the top of the screen; there is also a standard Windows menu. A
white drawing pad appears, accompanied by rock music. (You can turn
off the sound.) You can also experiment with background textures
like cotton paper and fabric.
</P>
<P>
   You can then click on the color wheel, where a huge array of
tints is presented. Tools are next: you can choose a pen or chalk
(which ends up resembling pastels on paper) or ink, among many
others. You can also determine how thick you want the tools'
impressions to be. You are the artist, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing with chalk against a dark background (this is the most
useful background for seeing how tools behave) reveals a backdrop's
texture. If you switch to the crayon tool, it makes a denser mark;
if you change the texture, you can achieve a rubbing effect with
the crayon.
</P>
<P>
   A water-drop effect turns the graphics into a watercolor,
resulting in a beautiful, sophisticated artwork. (Not all the tools
react with the paper texture.) Dabbler's canny ability to simulate
a tactile experience and blend one tool with another becomes more
evident the more you experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The ``flipbook'' animation feature allows children to make short
cartoons and is very entertaining. Its tutorial is helpful, and
verbal instructions serve as a patient, clear teacher, so you
really can't feel lost.

caches of some common browsers:
</P>
<P>
   For the Windows version of Netscape Navigator 4.0, go to the
Edit menu and select Preferences. Click the Advanced category and
then select Cache. Click on Clear Memory Cache and Clear Disk
Cache.
</P>
<P>
   For the Macintosh version of Navigator 4.0, go to the Edit menu
and select Preferences. Click on Advanced, and then Cache, and then
Clear Disk Cache.
</P>
<P>
   For the Windows version of Internet Explorer 4.0, go into the
View menu to Internet Options. Click on the Advanced tab, then
Settings, then Empty Folderand OK.
</P>
<P>
   For the Macintosh version of Explorer 4.0, go to the Edit menu
and select Preferences. In the Web Browser section of the box,

   TECH-MUSEUM _ SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Tech Museum, the new $96
million interactive monument to Silicon Valley, doesn't feel like a
museum. The 132,000-square-foot museum in downtown San Jose is less

   Microsoft's New Market: Digital Speakers
</P>
<P>
   First it just made software. Then it made mice, joysticks and
telephones. Now the company that gave the world a little something
called Windows is getting into the speaker market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. plans to sell the Digital Sound System 80, a
pair of PC speakers that it insists will better take advantage of
(surprise) its own Windows 98 operating system. The reason is that
the speakers are designed to be compatible with features in Windows
98 and work with a type of data transmission called Universal
Serial Bus that is built into newer computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contends that the digital speakers, which go for $249,
excluding a $50 rebate, will create better sound than many existing
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   A second Microsoft selling point is that the speakers make it
unnecessary to own a sound card to listen to music and other audio.
But some people may still want a sound card, which can perform
other functions, like connecting video game devices that are not
yet designed to be used with the Universal Serial Bus. These
capabilities may undermine some users' interest in looking to
Microsoft for speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Promises Not Welcome by E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   The staff members of Florida's Democratic Party have been
cleaning up in the aftermath of Election Day, including clearing
some boisterous complaints out of their e-mail in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago the campaign sent out a mass e-mail message in
support of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Buddy MacKay. The
e-mail urged voters to reject the ``negative campaigning'' of
Republican candidate Jeb Bush, who ultimately defeated MacKay. Some
voters decided to reject the e-mail overture instead, accusing the
Democratic Party of spamming voters with unsolicited e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   John Mozena, a national anti-spam crusader and co-founder of the
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, said the campaign
e-mail was not only unsolicited, but also indiscriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one guy in Ithaca, N.Y., who got it,'' Mozena
said. ``The targeting was abysmal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozena said the Florida party was not alone, noting that a
handful of other candidates nationwide employed mass e-mails during
their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Welch, a spokesman for the Democratic Party in Florida,
said that while party officials did not consider the messages to be
``commercial'' and thus Spam, they will reevaluate the strategy.
``The party has heard the message loud and clear,'' Welch said. But
he added: ``Don't forget, people in the party make phone calls to
households and knock on doors. Now they're knocking on computers
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Doesn't Intercept Football Fans
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League reports that its Web site has been
scoring high with sports fans during the first half of the season.
But the league is careful to explain that the viewers aren't being
drawn away from the television, and there's an $18 billion reason
that the league may want to hammer that point home.
</P>
<P>
   First, the facts: the NFL said traffic to its official NFL.com
site, which offers scores of games in progress, text-based
play-by-play descriptions and post-game articles, continues to see
rapid growth. The site had 423,544 individual visitors on Oct. 18,
which the league proudly pointed out is equal to one visit for
every man, woman and child living in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the spin: the league is very happy with this turnout, but
wants to make it clear that Web surfers aren't immigrants from
television who have set down the remote control and picked up the
mouse. ``We don't believe anybody really wants to sit at their
computers and watch a game in text,'' said Dennis Lewin, the NFL's
senior vice president for broadcasting and network television.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable why the league would want to send such a
message. Last January it sold television rights for NFL games for a
whopping $18 billion. The networks, some of which are seeing a drop
in ratings, may be tempted to blame computers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin added that that while the NFL plans to continue to enhance
its site, it will not turn it into an alternative to television.
``We won't enhance our site in any way, shape or form that will
ultimately draw people away from the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Free Web Access Is an Expensive Gamble
</P>
<P>
   The promise of advertiser-supported Internet access has hit a
few more roadblocks. Bigger.net, a San Jose, Calif., company that
offered free, advertising-supported Internet access, declared
bankruptcy in October. The company had more than 18,000 customers
who had been promised ``unlimited lifetime access'' in exchange for
a one-time fee of $60 and their willingness to put up with a
constant stream of advertising on the browser.
</P>
<P>
   For subscribers, the story may yet end well. Tuesday, a Seattle
company, Brigadoon.com, received court approval to purchase
Bigger.net for the fire-sale price of $275,000. A Brigadoon.com
official told the court that the company intends to keep the site
up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brigadoon.com will have its hands full: One reason
Bigger.net was bleeding money was that it simply couldn't attract
enough advertisers to support the high cost of offering Internet
access to thousands of Web users.
</P>
<P>
   It is not alone. As many as 100,000 registered users of a free
Internet service provider called the Tritium Network were told last
month to find another provider. Tritium, based in Cincinnati, has
``temporarily suspended operations'' while it finds additional
investors, said Todd Telford, the company's director of advertising
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Telford said the company asked its subscribers to try another
ISP for awhile, but then to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the struggles of advertising-supported Internet access,
entrepreneurs continue to jump in with new variations on the theme.
A southern California group last month started the
advertising-supported Netzero Inc.; in its first 10 days, the
company signed up 20,000 users, said company president Ronald Burr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know all about the mistakes made in the past,'' Burr said,
noting that his company will invest ``multimillions of dollars''
and contract out its technology. ``These guys took the rinky-dink
approach. We've done it the right way.''
</P>

   A New PC Card Offers Cellular Net Connections
</P>
<P>
   The good news isthat a new generation of modems has emerged that
enables handheld Windows CE devices to make wireless connections to
the Internet over cellular telephone lines. The bad news is that
the transmissions can be as finicky and limited as cellular
telephone transmissions, and the modems are expensive to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is called the Aircard CE, a PC card from Sierra
Wireless of Richmond, British Columbia, that will hit stores in
December. Industry analysts say they are high on the Aircard
because, unlike other PC card modems designed to hook into cellular
networks, it does not have a Tootsie Roll-sized extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nicest piece of engineering I've seen in a long
time,'' said Andrew Seybold, editor-in-chief of The Outlook, a
newsletter in Boulder Creek, Calif., that covers mobile computing.
``They're pushing the state of the art.''
</P>
<P>
   But the modem has a hefty $450 suggested retail price. Type II
cards that give Windows CE devices wireless capability typically
sell for more than $300, said Seybold, who noted that the price is
too high to attract many people, who originally paid $800 for the
CE devices.
</P>
<P>
   Great Sets, Great Acting, Terrific Verb Tenses
</P>
<P>
   Two Colgate University professors have created an innovative
technology to promulgate a simple teaching philosophy: feature
films fun, textbooks boring.
</P>
<P>
   The professors created a computer program to help students learn
another language by immersing them in foreign films. And now the
technology is coming to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The technology splits a computer monitor into four squares: one
square shows a foreign film; a second shows the script of the film;
a third shows commentary on the movie in English; and a fourth
provides a foreign-language dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the work of Alexander (Sasha) Nakhimovsky, a
Colgate computer science professor; his wife, Alice, a professor of
Russian; and Tom Myers, a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   A linguist by training, Nakhimovsky said the idea is that
students will not only pick up language more quickly when they see
it in the context of a film, but they will also be able to discern
the subtleties of a foreign culture. ``The amount of cultural
information you can get in every screen shot is incomparable to
what you can get in a textbook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``a Russian `salat' is totally different from an
American salad,'' Nakhimovsky said. ``When a textbook says a
`salat' equals a salad, it's totally misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at Colgate, in Hamilton, N.Y., have been
experimenting with the system for several years. Thursday,
Nakhimovsky is scheduled to demonstrate an Internet version. He
believes the tool can ultimately gain widespread use over the Net,
as increasing band width makes it possible to transmit video
content more easily.

   Brisk breezes will persist from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast, though winds will not be as strong as Wednesday. A
second surge of chilly autumnal air will advance across the eastern
Lakes Thursday afternoon. Only spotty showers will precede this
cold front, given the lack of moisture in the air. Friday, in the
wake of the front, temperatures from the Middle Atlantic states to
New England will be 5 to 10 degrees lower than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will move toward the Middle Atlantic coast by
Thursday night. Sinking air currents associated with the high will
prompt abundant sunshine from the interior Southeast to southern
New England. Some high clouds will arrive Thursday afternoon from
Virginia northward as a cold front approaches from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A moistening jet stream disturbance will move through the
Southwest Thursday. Ahead of this pocket of cold air near 18,000
feet, surface winds will turn onshore across Texas and Louisiana.
Patches of rain and drizzle will then develop near a stalled front
from eastern New Mexico to the Gulf Coast. Heavier rain with
embedded thunderstorms will expand eastward Thursday night across
eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley. Given the
disturbance's slow movement, areas of heavy rain will linger into
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of mild air from the Pacific Ocean will spread across
the Northwest. A moist, onshore flow will deliver rain to northwest
Washington, with scattered showers elsewhere along the Washington
and Oregon coasts. Periods of snow will fall in the Cascades with
lighter snow expected farther east in the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Record Low Pressure
</P>
<P>
   The storm that raked across Minnesota on Tuesday was the most
intense disturbance on record to move through the region. The
atmospheric pressure fell to 28.43 inches of mercury at Albert Lea
airport in southern Minnesota, marking the lowest pressure on
record in the state. Several other sites in Minnesota also measured
record low barometric pressures. In addition, the storm brought 70
mile an hour wind gusts and heavy snow to western sections of
Minnesota. In comparison, the lowest pressure during the Blizzard
of 1993 on the East Coast was nearly identical at 28.42. inches.

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The holidays will be here before you know it _ and
that means parties galore. If you're contemplating throwing a
holiday bash, it's not too early to make plans.
</P>
<P>
   A great way to entertain friends and family is with a
spectacular hors d'oeuvres buffet in the late afternoon or early
evening. Gather your thoughts, guest list and invitations _ and get
moving, as you'll want to get your party on your friends' holiday
calendars in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For party givers who want to orchestrate and direct the
production themselves at home, we've turned to Nathalie Dupree,
cookbook author, television cooking-show personality (she has been
on PBS stations for nine seasons and has done more than 300 shows
for the TV Food Network) and Georgia hostess. Whether your style is
casual or dressy, you'll find a wealth of information for
successful parties in her recently released ninth cookbook,
``Nathalie Dupree's Comfortable Entertaining: At Home With Ease and
Grace'' (Viking; $29.95) which coincides with her new 29-episode
PBS series, ``Comfortable Entertaining,'' now airing. The book is
designed to show what Dupree does best _ create spontaneous
hospitality and wonderful food. ``The key ingredient in
entertaining is the desire to be hospitable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertaining is a mind-set, an attitude as well as a practice
_ not quite an art form but more than a craft. Like most artistic
endeavors, it is a marriage of personal expression and technique
learned through observation and experience,'' noted Dupree during a
recent stopover in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Her entertaining philosophy boils down to: ``The guest is the
most important _ that's why you're having him or her over. Make
your guests comfortable in your home and truly welcome them.
Everything else _ menus, decorations, table settings _ come after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the food, Dupree suggests serving something you
know and make well. Don't try to compete with restaurants, as
restaurant food is quite different from home food. However, she
advises looking at what restaurants serve in terms of what can be
done ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Planning is crucial, she emphasized repeatedly, noting that
you'll need both a master plan defining your vision for the
gathering as well as a tactical plan outlining what has to be done
and when. The master plan should include the guest list, place,
date and time of the event, a budget of how much you can afford in
both time and money, and what you decide to serve. Be realistic
about what you can and can't do. The budget should include food,
beverages, decorations (including candles and flowers), dishes,
rentals, laundry expenses and any serving and cleanup help.
</P>
<P>
   Figure out how much time you can give the event _ in bits or
pieces spaced out over weeks _ or one big chunk of time on a
weekend _ to prep, cook and freeze. ``Consider the value of your
time to you, weighing preparation time against the cost of
ingredients,'' pointed out Dupree. A casserole may be cheap, but
might take longer to prepare than a pricey salmon or tenderloin,
which requires less time and energy from market to table. ``Balance
is key to a comfortable, workable menu _ not just the balance of
foods (consider combinations of flavors and textures for overall
appeal) but the balance of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, decide how you will serve _ for instance, do you plan to
pass hors d'oeuvres or simply set them out on a table or buffet _
or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   The book features more than 250 creations _ what Dupree refers
to as life-is-not-perfect recipes _ for occasions ranging from a
``Buffet for Twelve to Fifty, in Four Hours or Less,'' to an
``All-Desserts Buffet'' to ``Three Simple Suppers,'' ``Two Hors
d'Oeuvres Parties'' and more. By life-is-not-perfect, Dupree means
that ``you can never expect to have everything you need _ such as
the right pan, etc. _ or the perfect situation (your mother may be
ill) when you entertain.'' Her recipes are flexible and will work
even if you have a child pulling on your apron strings, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be perfect. You can make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has not been perfect for me,'' continued Dupree, who
taught cooking classes at Rich's Department store in Atlanta for a
decade during the 1970s and '80s. However, Dupree has managed to
entertain through the years in tiny apartments and on tight
budgets, planned galas for hundreds and put on parties on a
moment's notice. And it all started when she was 10 years old,
hosting a party with home-baked cookies and cheese straws.
</P>
<P>
   But her entertaining has not been without a few faux pas along
the way. Like the time in New York when she roasted an 18-pound pig
over a small wood fire (the pig fell in the flames a few times) for
Thanksgiving. The pig was not done in time for dinner _ and guests
(including her boss and his family) ended up eating veggies and
go-alongs. The pig didn't get done until everyone had gone home.
``It was a disaster,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Or the time when Dupree was just learning to cook in London when
she ended up with puff pastry on the ceiling and brown sauce on the
floor just before a dinner party. ``It was a mess!''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, she was expecting company for dinner, but had
taken a nap and fallen sound asleep, only to be awakened by guests
ringing the doorbell. She had the food on the buffet table within
15 minutes and guests were amazed. Planning does pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some cooks who abhor the thought of freezing party foods,
Dupree takes the opposite approach. ``I love freezing stuff,'' she
emphasized, ``and the book's recipes include make-ahead and
freezing instructions. For a busy person, making and freezing ahead
is the only answer when entertaining. You can cook when you're not
pressured.'' However, she also advocates buying good ready-made
substitutes when you don't have time to make everything from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But she is not into low-fat. ``When you entertain, it's not the
time to sacrifice flavor for calories,'' noted Dupree, who
entertains a group of five or six for dinner several times a month
and has larger parties a half dozen times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the book, which she did before she filmed the companion
television shows, was not difficult, noted Dupree. She said she
relied on some of her core menus and recipes, which she changed and
dressed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should have core recipes that they do over and over
again.'' Among Dupree's standbys are beef tenderloin, roast
chicken, roast turkey and sliced ham, which are easily adapted
party foods. Mango Salsa is the current accessory to her old
grilled salmon. And grilled or roasted tenderloin is dressed up
with red peppers in balsamic vinegar or in a marinade of mustard
and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that you can't serve alcohol at a party without
offering a substantial protein dish, emphasized Dupree, adding that
her favorite is a beef tenderloin _ which can serve 40 at an hors
d'oeuvres party or 10 for dinner. For cocktail party fare, marinate
the tenderloin in mustard, roast, cut in half lengthwise, and then
slice into rounds and serve with rolls or baguette slices.
</P>
<P>
   For an hors d'oeuvres party, Dupree recommends serving red and
white wine, soft drinks and plenty of bottled water. ``Never serve
just champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the book includes a two-hour cocktail party that would
take two people two hours or one person four hours to prepare,
Dupree pulled together a stand-up-plates-only buffet with some of
her show-stopper recipes _ Spinach Tart, Elegant Cheese Platter
Garnished With Sugared Grapes, Buffet Tenderloin Mini-Rounds,
Grilled Sides of Salmon, Hot Mango Salsa, Stuffed Cherry Tomatoes,
Caponata With Cucumber Rounds, Chicken Sate, Drop Brownies and
Pecan Crescents _ for a holiday get-together. She designed it so
the food can be easily eaten without forks while standing.
</P>
<P>
   While several of the recipes in the book are lengthy _ not the
quick and easy variety many cooks prefer these days _ Dupree is
quick to point out that she believes recipes with more ingredients
are more interesting and flavorful than those with less. ``With
fewer ingredients, you have to do more work to get more flavor,''
she added. Some cooks may disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am most interested in saving people time _ not throwing
something on the table at the last minute. I don't like tension or
last-minute cooking,'' she added. Dupree prefers serving food at
room temperature or reheating food that has been prepared in
advance of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only learn to host successfully by doing it,'' said
Dupree, so you may want to get started this holiday season. Start
small with what you know and go from there. Be yourself and enjoy.
Remember, it's your party, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some inspirations from Dupree's new cookbook,
``Comfortable Entertaining.'' Practice them first _ at a dinner
party _ before you tackle them for a large holiday cocktail party. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPINACH OR BROCCOLI TART
</P>
<P>
   With the cream cheese and blue cheese as deliciously rich
thickeners, this cheese tart is particularly suited for an hors
d'oeuvre or appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   A tart pan with a removable bottom is a good addition to the
kitchen because it makes for a much prettier presentation than a
pie pan or plate. If you are using a pan without a removable
bottom, slice and serve the tart in thin wedges.
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons snipped fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained OR 1/2 cup
broccoli florets, lightly steamed and well drained
</P>
<P>
   1 (9-inch) prebaked pastry shell in a round tart pan with a
removable bottom
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl of a food processor or electric mixer, blend blue
cheese, cream cheese, butter and cream. Add eggs, salt and cayenne
to taste and process or mix. Sprinkle chives over mixture and pulse
machine twice or stir in well.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape custard into prebaked pastry shell and sprinkle spinach
or broccoli evenly over pie.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven about 25 minutes or until tart
is puffed and pastry is golden brown. Cover edge of pie with foil,
if it gets too dark. Let cool on a wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   For hors d'oeuvres, remove from pan and cut a circle 3 inches in
diameter in center using a biscuit cutter. Cut outer ``doughnut''
and inner circle into bite-sized pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Tart can be kept, refrigerated, 1 to 2 days or frozen 3 months,
tightly wrapped and in a sturdy food container. Makes 6 to 8
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ELEGANT CHEESE PLATTER GARNISHED WITH SUGARED GRAPES

   Brie makes a particularly elegant presentation, but certainly
other kinds of cheese could be used _ or several different types _
but keep in mind that their flavors must be compatible and that
working with one cheese is easier than working with several. You
may buy rounds of Brie up to a kilo, in which case you would need
to double or triple the grapes and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   If serving Brie on silver, take care as the cheese knife may
scar the silver. Marble, wood and other natural materials enhance
the appearance of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Gingersnaps vary widely in quality. I use Moravian cookies when
I'm feeling flush or the best kind of gingersnaps I can find.
</P>
<P>
   1 wheel (8 ounces) Brie cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 large bunch seedless green grapes
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick spray OR vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   Thin gingersnaps OR crackers
</P>
<P>
   Place cheese on a large round serving platter. Cut a small wedge
out of cheese and turn small wedge on its side on top of round.
</P>
<P>
   Leave rinsed grapes attached to stems. Put on a rack in a
jellyroll pan. Spray grapes lightly with nonstick spray. Put sugar
in a fine sieve and shake over grapes until lightly covered. Drape
grapes on top of cheese allowing them to cascade off edge. Surround
cheese with gingersnaps. This dish can stand at room temperature up
to, but not more than 4 hours, depending on ripeness of cheese.
Makes 8 to 10 servings as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Brie should be fully ripe but should not have ammonia-like
smell that indicates ripeness. At room temperature, it should feel
soft to touch, especially in middle. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
STUFFED CHERRY TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   2 pints small, firm, ripe cherry tomatoes (one-bite size)
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches parsley
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, finely shredded OR finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped cooked ham OR chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped pimiento
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   With a very sharp knife, slice off top quarter of each tomato
and set aside. Remove insides and seeds with a small spoon,
grapefruit spoon or melon baller and discard. Invert shells on a
wire mesh rack or paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a day ahead, finely chop 1 1/2 bunches parsley, reserving
remainder. Mix together chopped parsley, Jack cheese, ham,
pimiento, onion, mayonnaise, thyme and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon mixture into tomato shells or use a piping bag with a
large tip. Top can be set back on, a little askew, if not broken.
Keep refrigerated until needed, preferably stored in a sturdy
airtight food container.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with remaining parsley sprigs. Makes 10 to 16 servings
as an appetizer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAPONATA WITH CUCUMBER ROUNDS
</P>
<P>
   This tasty dish makes a handy appetizer dip. I keep it in the
freezer in small containers. It goes well with bagel chips, toasted
pita triangles, Melba toast or on cucumber or zucchini rounds. It
can also serve as sauce for hot cooked pasta and can be spread on
bread for a sandwich with cheese or turkey slices.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large red onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 stalks celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium regular OR 3 long Italian eggplant, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 can (28 1/2 ounces) Italian plum tomatoes, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped green olives
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped roasted red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup capers, drained
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano OR marjoram
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Thin cucumber rounds
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and
celery and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and eggplant
and cook until soft, about 5 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Add tomatoes, olives, red peppers, capers, parsley, oregano,
vinegar, tomato paste, sugar, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer
about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Caponata may be kept refrigerated 3 days or frozen. Turn
caponata into a serving bowl, place on a tray and surround with
cucumber rounds. Makes 10 cups caponata. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHICKEN SATE
</P>
<P>
   Skewered chicken tenders make great finger food. Consider
combining the sate with another appetizer or two for a tapas-style
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   6-inch bamboo skewers
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds chicken tenders OR 4 boneless, skinless breasts
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 green onions, white and pale-green parts only
</P>
<P>
   Spicy Peanut Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Soak skewers in water while you work.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat broiler or heat a grill. If broiling, grease a large
baking sheet with nonstick spray or cover with foil.
</P>
<P>
   If tenders are not available, slice chicken breasts across grain
into 1/2-inch-wide strips.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, mix garlic, sesame oil, vinegar, salt and
pepper. Add chicken and green onions and toss to cover. Marinate 30
minutes to 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Thread meat onto bamboo skewers. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Remove green onions from marinade and place on baking sheet with
skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Broil or grill 4 to 5 inches from heat source 5 to 8 minutes,
turning once.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with Spicy Peanut Sauce. Makes 16 to 20 small skewers or
toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   SPICY PEANUT SAUCE: In a blender or food processor, combine 2
tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger, 2 garlic cloves, chopped,
1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter, 2 teaspoons
hot red pepper flakes and 1/3 cup soy sauce. Process until well
blended. Chill. Sauce can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in
advance. Makes 6 to 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUFFET TENDERLOIN MINI-ROUNDS
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup crumbled fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 (about 5-pound) trimmed beef tenderloins
</P>
<P>
   100 (2- to 3-inch) store-bought sandwich rolls, halved
</P>
<P>
   Mix mustard, rosemary, ginger, garlic, Worcestershire, oil, salt
and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off excess fat and membrane from meat. To make cylinders,
slice each tenderloin lengthwise from end to end to form 2 pieces
of meat from each tenderloin. Turn about 2 inches of thinner end
under to make a uniform cylinder. Tie each cylinder at about 2-inch
intervals with kitchen twine, forming a cylinder shape of same
diameters as bread rolls. Repeat with remaining 3 pieces of beef.
Spread mustard mixture all over 4 pieces of meat and set aside. (At
this point, you can wrap meat and refrigerate up to a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Reserving mustard mixture, put tenderloins in a heavy baking
pan, leaving space between them. There must be plenty of room to
let heat circulate and meat brown rather than steam.
</P>
<P>
   Roast on top shelf in preheated 425-degree oven in batches, if
necessary, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in middle of
tenderloin registers 135 degrees F, about 15 to 20 minutes longer
if straight from refrigerator. Remove roasts from oven and let
stand at least 15 minutes. Remove strings and carve meat into thin
slices. (They can be made ahead up to 2 days and refrigerated and
carved a day or two later. It's easier to carve a cold roast.)
</P>
<P>
   While meat is standing, add any leftover mustard mixture to
roasting pan and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits on
bottom and sides of pan. Boil until juices have reduced by about
half. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Put cold or room-temperature meat on a serving tray and pour any
reduced mustard mixture over meat. Put tray on buffet and place
sandwich rolls nearby. If you are making up sandwiches, put 2 or 3
thin slices of meat on a roll. (It is easier to eat 2 thin pieces
than 1 thick one.) Otherwise, let everyone help themselves. Sliced
tenderloin may be kept, frozen, up to 3 months. Makes 100 rolls.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The purpose of tying meat is to form cylinders about the
diameter of rolls so filled rolls may be eaten easily at a stand-up
meal without need for forks. Mustard-covered surface means forgoing
extra mustard and sauces, which speeds up ease of service for
guests. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GRILLED SIDES OF SALMON
</P>
<P>
   2 (2 1/2- to 3-pound) sides of salmon, bone removed, skin on
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil OR basil-flavored olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Hot Mango Salsa; curly lettuce; sprigs of herbs, such as basil,
dill OR fennel; tomato rose or edible flowers; lemon slices OR
wedges and cucumber slices for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Prepare grill.
</P>
<P>
   Place salmon sides in a glass or plastic food container that is
long enough to accommodate them unfolded and with high enough sides
to keep marinade from spilling when you move salmon to grill.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, mix olive oil, lemon juice, basil, salt and
pepper. Pour marinade over salmon, cover with plastic wrap and
leave at room temperature while grill is heating, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place salmon sides on grill so that nonskin side is down so that
hot grill will mark presentation side. If salmon sides are 1-inch
thick, cook 5 minutes, then turn using a wide spatula to loosen
fish underneath carefully before turning. Cook 5 minutes on second
side. (It is better to undercook salmon slightly, since it will
continue to cook on platter from residual heat.)
</P>
<P>
   Using 2 wide spatulas, remove salmon sides from grill to serving
platters. Don't panic if salmon splits into pieces when you lift it
from grill. If you are careful, you can rearrange it on serving
platter so that the break will not be evident to guests.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon can be served hot, or it can be refrigerated, covered
with plastic wrap and served cold.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with Hot Mango Salsa, curly lettuce, herb sprigs, tomato
rose, lemon slices, cucumber slices, as desired. Makes 20 to 30
appetizer servings.
</P>
<P>
   HOT MANGO SALSA: Mix together 1 (14-ounce) mango, peeled, seeded
and chopped (about 2 cups), 1/4 cup chopped green onions, 1/4 cup
chopped yellow OR red bell pepper, 1 teaspoon chopped cilantro OR
basil, 1 to 2 teaspoons chopped jalapeno chiles, preferably fresh
and 2 tablespoons fresh lime OR lemon juice. The salsa can be kept
refrigerated up to 1 week. Makes 2 1/2 to 3 cups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DROP BROWNIES
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces semisweet chocolate bits
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups coarsely chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   Grease or spray 2 cookie sheets with nonstick spray.
</P>
<P>
   Remove 3/4 cup chocolate bits and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place remaining chocolate bits and butter in a heavy 2-quart
saucepan and melt over low heat (or melt in microwave), stirring
until smooth. Let cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on a piece of wax paper, sift together flour, baking
powder and salt.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar and
vanilla until well combined. With mixer on slow speed, add cooled
chocolate mixture, then dry ingredients. Blend well. Stir in
reserved chocolate bits and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Drop by heaping teaspoons, 1-inch apart, onto prepared cookie
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 8 to 10 minutes. Or for 2-inch
cookies, drop by heaping tablespoons 2 inches apart and bake 10 to
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies puff but won't firm up until cool, so don't overbake.
Place pan on a rack to cool a few minutes and then remove cookies
to rack to cool completely. Serve at room temperature. Cookies can
be stored, tightly covered, up to 3 months. Makes 50 to 60
cookies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PECAN CRESCENTS
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups finely ground pecan pieces
</P>
<P>
   Powdered sugar for rolling
</P>
<P>
   Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or foil.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixer bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar, vanilla and salt
together until well blended. Beat in flour and then nuts, scraping
down sides of bowl to incorporate. Chill dough if too sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Roll about 1 teaspoon of dough between floured palms into a
2-inch rope. Place on prepared baking sheet and curve to form a
crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Let crescents cool on baking sheets. Be sure they are completely
cool before you try to pick them up. Sift powdered sugar onto a
sheet of wax paper and roll crescents in it.
</P>
<P>
   Store crescents in a sturdy airtight food container between
layers of wax paper. Cookies may be frozen 3 months. Makes 60
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: When you make cookies ahead and freeze them, let them thaw
in a closed food tin. Then give them a quick sifting of powdered
sugar and serve.

REPORT CRITICIZES PROBE OF TEXAS BORDER SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional report to be made public Thursday
is critical of the Justice Department investigation into the
shooting death of a Texas man by U.S. Marines on an anti-drug
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply did not do their job,'' Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
said Wednesday. ``The next step is for the Department of Justice to
take some additional actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, which Smith
heads, launched its own review of the May 20, 1997, death of
Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, of Redford. The subcommittee is
scheduled to release its report Thursday, culminating more than a
year of hearings and inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said no further hearings are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Neither federal nor state grand juries indicted the four Marines
who were on patrol when Hernandez was shot while herding his
family's goats near the Rio Grande. He died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines said Hernandez fired on the patrol, which was
heavily camouflaged and hiding on a ridge on the outskirts of
Redford, an agricultural town in the sparsely populated Big Bend
region of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez carried a .22-caliber rifle, and a Marine
investigation into the shooting concluded Cpl. Clemente Banuelos
fired to protect the life of a member of his patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine report also cited a lack of training for troops
involved in domestic operations and was critical of the poor radio
communication between Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials and the military patrol they were supervising.
</P>
<P>
   Banuelos has been honorably discharged from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy Department, which oversees the Marines, agreed to a
$1.9 million out-of-court settlement with the Hernandez family,
which had filed a wrongful death claim against the government after
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragic, tragic event,'' said Navy Secretary John
Dalton, ``My heart goes out to the family of that young man who was
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department investigation cleared the Marine patrol of
criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith launched the subcommittee probe into the incident when
federal agencies failed to turn over documents in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers charged that military and federal officials
hampered their investigation by moving the Marines to out-of-state
locations within days of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the subcommittee investigation focused on INS and
Justice Department handling of the shooting, and not whether
Marines were criminally negligent in the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to second-guess the grand jury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his subcommittee report would show that the Justice
Department failed to investigate the shooting thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this incident, a number of actions were taken to prevent
justice from being carried out,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine investigation led to reprimands of supervisory
personnel. But the Justice Department probe produced no punishment
for INS or Border Patrol officials, who oversaw the Joint Task
Force 6 military missions along the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the Justice Department investigation contained
``glaring omissions'' and failed to address policy questions
involving training and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's death has drawn the attention of human rights groups
opposed to militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border to staunch drug
smuggling and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has documented incidents of abuse by U.S.
officials against Mexican and American citizens in a recent report,
``Human Rights Concerns in the Border Region with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Rizza, an Amnesty International spokesman in California,
said reports of escalating human rights abuses on the border
violate standards established by the international community and
endorsed by the United States and the United Nations.

 &HT;    When good TV goes bad
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall down, fall back, fall off, fall flat. All those falls and
more describe this fall's TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are down (for five of the six broadcast networks and
many old favorites) and grousing is up.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, blame the new shows. That's easy, and everybody does
it. But every new autumnal batch of TV series has more cheese than
a Wisconsin roadside stand. And this one was no worse than usual,
with several series _ ``Cupid,'' ``Felicity,'' ``Sports Night,''
``Trinity'' _ showing signs of real quality.
</P>
<P>
   Look instead to the returning series, and particularly the
A-list series, the ones with the big Nielsen numbers or the buzz or
both, the ``appointment TV'' the networks so desperately want to
create.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stragglers and strugglers:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``ER'' needs some paddles to the chest. The emphasis on new
character Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin) has skewed the No. 1 show on
TV, although it's bounced back a little. Ratings are down 7 percent
this season.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Frasier'' is more mopey than funny, with the travails of the
unemployed shrink sucking up time from the excellent supporting
cast. NBC knew ``Frasier'' wouldn't get ``Seinfeld'' ratings, but
is disappointed in the tune-in so far.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ally McBeal,'' last season's buzz baby, has come up with
more dipsy-doodle stuff (the much-abused frog, the inscrutable
Ling), but most of the fan chatter has been about star Calista
Flockhart's weight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stalwarts ``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Homicide: Life on the
Street'' have yet to connect on a memorable episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just see they're not compelling,'' says Dorothy
Swanson, founder of Viewers for Quality Television, who says her
membership polls this season reflect widespread dissatisfaction
with many series. ```Party of Five' viewers are complaining that
the warmth is gone,'' she says. ```Mad About You' has completely
dropped off our list of endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all returning series are struggling. ``NYPD Blue'' has been
at its most riveting as it gently pushes Bobby Simone into that
good night, ``Friends'' seems brighter than usual, ``Everybody
Loves Raymond'' is finding the audience it deserved all along and
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is kicking keister. Ratings for all
four are up over last season.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Swanson, ``everybody in the country agrees about
'Frasier.' Where has the quality gone? Where has the writing
gone?''
</P>
<P>
   Why the problems?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Too many shows and not enough writing talent. Ten years ago
there were 66 prime-time entertainment shows at the beginning of
the 1988-'89 season. This fall's schedule had 96 entertainment
series, due to the expansion of Fox and the addition of WB and UPN.
Has the pool of talented writers increased by more than 30 percent
as well? Not hardly. More writers are being hired out of college.
More producers are getting deals with less experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real drain on talent, there's no question about
that,'' says Warren Littlefield, outgoing president of NBC
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Joel Shukovsky, who's seen hits (``Murphy Brown'') and
misses (``Living in Captivity''), uses more pungent language to
describe the mess:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bunch of lemmings trying to crawl over each other
for the same talent at the same time for, in many cases and ways,
many of the same shows.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The networks have become more interested in whether they own
the show than whether the show is any good. That's perhaps an
overstatement, but closer to the truth than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the ``ER'' deal last season, the networks were
moving toward airing shows they own themselves rather than ones
they buy from studios, because they realized how much more money
they could make that way. But when Warner Bros. held up NBC for $13
million per episode for ``ER,'' that clinched it. Network
executives are now forced to focus on business issues more than
quality issues much more than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Successful creators are pressured to create more shows, which
diverts attention away from their continuing shows. John Wells,
executive producer of ``ER,'' launched ``Trinity'' this fall, just
as fan complaints about ``ER'' kicked in. Steven Bochco has
attempted four additional series since ``NYPD Blue'' debuted. One
prevalent theory as to why ``Frasier'' isn't as good is that the
creators went off to launch ``Encore! Encore!'' which bombed!
bombed!
</P>
<P>
   David Milch, Bochco's partner, notes that last season, they
produced 57 hours of TV, with ``NYPD'' and the failed series
``Brooklyn South'' and ``Total Security.'' ``There's no question
that if you're doing 22 (a typical season), you'll probably do
those 22 better,'' says Milch. With Milch and Bochco concentrating
on ``NYPD'' this season, that's obviously the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the late '70s, when cable TV, VCRs and remote
controls started becoming prevalent, the broadcast networks have
been declining. But the 1998 season may see the biggest
single-season drop-off yet. Overall ratings are down 9 percent for
the networks, with only WB showing an increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Thursday night lineup has suffered without ``Seinfeld,''
which is no surprise; what is shocking is how the audience for
``ER'' started the season strong at 32 million, then dropped
steadily over the next four weeks by a total of 4 million. That's
not a ``Seinfeld'' problem _ that's a rejection problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cable, meanwhile, is up 15 percent. Again, that's a continuation
of a trend, but it's a sizable jump in the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks are in a very difficult situation,'' says Bill
Cella, executive vice president of media buyer McCann-Erickson.
``It's hard and it's only going to get harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most viewers don't care about cable vs. broadcast
trends. They want their favorite shows to be better.
</P>
<P>
   So get a job, Frasier. Get dancin', Ally. Get a grip, ``ER.''
Get back to giving us what we expect, networks.
</P>
<P>
   And for ``NYPD's'' Bobby Simone, whose fading heartbeat has been
this season's most compulsive hand-wringer: Get well.

BROADWAY THEATER AWAITS WINDFALL BUILT ON THIN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (budgeted earlier as NY-INITIATIVE)   (bl)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly five years after a crucial deal lured Walt
Disney Co. to 42nd Street and jump-started the revival of Times
Square, a coalition of Broadway interests is struggling to carry
the economic gains to the heart of the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Broadway Initiative, seeks to mobilize commercial
and nonprofit theaters, producers, unions and the city behind
efforts to stimulate the Broadway theater with adventuresome new
productions from off-Broadway and elsewhere and other
audience-building measures.
</P>
<P>
   But one vital feature of the program, the generation of revenue
through the transfer of development rights, has yet to materialize,
forcing the Initiative to scale back its goals and raising doubts
over its ultimate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You plan a wedding, and the bride gets sick,'' said Stephen
Sondheim, president of the Initiative, attributing the
uncertainties to delays in approval of the transfer of rights.
While discussions about financing the Initiative are at a delicate
stage, he said, ``I'm more than optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of the development rights, also called air rights,
was part of a disputed rezoning plan approved by the City Council
in August. Air rights represent unused development potential, the
difference between the size of a building and the maximum allowed
on its site. Since theaters are mostly small buildings, they tend
to have ample air rights.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, owners of 25 of the 37 Broadway theaters (not
including those on 42nd Street and some others) can sell and
transfer 2.4 million square feet above their buildings so that
developers within a 45-block swath of midtown could build taller
structures than otherwise allowed. The measure supersedes the
city's zoning code, which ordinarily permits transfers only between
sites that are adjacent, across the street or cater-cornered, or
those linked by common ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded sales of rights could generate as much as $100
million for the theater owners, by some estimates. In return, $10 a
square foot from the sales, or perhaps as much as $20 million,
would go to the city and the Broadway Initiative for a fund to help
incubate new plays and small musicals that would not then have to
be smash hits to survive on Broadway. The fund would also be used
to help build new audiences and to monitor compliance with the
accord. Theater owners who sold air rights would forgo conversion
of their theaters to other uses.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the stir about the potential of air rights sales,
particularly in a strong real estate market, no deals have yet
emerged, although one may be pending. This has left the Initiative
scrambling for revenue to replace a one-time $250,000 grant, out of
a payment in lieu of taxes from the development of the Marriott
Marquis hotel, due to run out by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get another grant someplace,'' said Arthur Laurents, the
playwright and director. He acknowledged that members of the
Initiative were cautious. ``They all want to know how much someone
else put in,'' he said. But he added, ``It's moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Initiative has yet to announce specific plans to help bring
any innovative fare to Broadway, its most prominent goal, although
supporters say they are making progress.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty has also led critics of the air rights transfer
to argue, as they have in the past, that the plan was never likely
to generate much money for the theater and was rather a real-estate
scheme to undermine zoning protections in the Clinton neighborhood
west of the theater district. Supporters say the rights transfers
were never held out as a panacea for the theater and were to be one
piece of a plan that needed contributions from all members of the
Broadway industry.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Initiative's interim goals have been scaled
back, and it is not clear how the group can cover a once-envisioned
annual budget of $10 million, or even the $4 million or less
suggested in current estimates.
</P>
<P>
   When the City Council passed the rezoning plan, it was warmly
greeted within the theater but generated a storm of opposition from
community boards throughout the city. Organizations like the
Municipal Art Society and the local chapter of the American
Institute of Architects also opposed the plan, saying it would
undermine zoning protections. Other critics produced figures
suggesting that far from ailing, Broadway was enjoying some of its
best times in years.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise, the west side of Eighth Avenue between 45th and
56th Streets was removed as a site for air rights development.
</P>
<P>
   While some theatrical unions seem ready to pitch in with cash
contributions to keep the Initiative solvent, two, representing
musicians and press agents, have rebuffed approaches for money,
contending that the air rights transfer had always been held out as
the mainstay of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   One Broadway executive privy to the discussions recently
described the state of the Initiative's finances as ``a mess.'' But
Joey Parnes, the group's coordinator, disputed the
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proceeding in a deliberate fashion,'' said Parnes, a
former executive producer of the Public Theater. ``We're working on
a formula or a plan or a series of components of a financing plan,
which we're not ready to share.'' While ``we're not there yet,'' he
said, he expects that ``we will be there in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization,
Broadway's largest theater owner, said this week that while no air
rights transfers were at hand, Bertelsmann, the music and
publishing giant, had made an inquiry about a possible purchase of
air rights to build above the Criterion Center on Broadway at 45th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Nederlander, president of his family-owned theater chain,
said he, too, had received some air rights inquiries but nothing
firm enough to discuss. The absence of air rights revenues ``is a
problem, no question about it,'' he said. The Nederlander
Organization would be willing to pitch in with money for the
Initiative, he said, ``but I have to see what others would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Goldstein, the Initiative's first coordinator and a top
organizer of the group with Actors Equity Association, acknowledged
that the Initiative was going through a challenging period. ``It's
a totally new thing being tried,'' he said. ``It's tough. If
there's no transfer of air rights, we'll have to look at other
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein, now executive director of the Theater Development
Fund, the theater-service organization that, among other things,
operates the TKTS discount ticket booths, said, ``I'm confident
there will be a source of money to carry the development process
forward, and that it will come out of the industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The issue's tangled beginnings go back to January 1994, when the
city and state offered low-interest loans of almost $30 million to
Walt Disney Co. to renovate and take over the decrepit New
Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street. Schoenfeld and Rocco Landesman of
the Jujamcym chain complained that no similar incentives were
provided to existing theater owners.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gov. Mario Cuomo pledged to create a state loan
fund to repair and maintain existing Broadway theaters. Cuomo left
office before a fund was set up, but the state commitment grew into
the Broadway Initiatives Working Group under the chief auspices of
Actors Equity, and support for the theater was tied to the air
rights measure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rezoning initiative announced by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani last December, the 25 theaters _ 12 owned by Shubert, 5 by
the Nederlander Organization, 3 by Jujamcyn and 5 by others _ could
sell the unused rights to build over their landmark theaters to
developers anywhere within an area bounded by 40th and 57th
Streets, Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue, about 45 blocks
in all.
</P>
<P>
   The developers could use the extra 2.4 million square feet to
increase the allowable size of their buildings. Starting with the
optimistic assumption that every eligible square foot would sell at
$50 a square foot, the plan's supporters calculated that the
transfers could generate $120 million. In return, theater owners
would pay $10 a square foot from any sale into a theater fund,
which could then total $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   If all the money were to come in at once _ which is clearly
unlikely _ and invested as an endowment, it might yield $1 million
a year in interest income, far below the $10 million sum the
Initiative once sought as a goal, although funds are also to be
raised from contributions, including those from people who work in
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Initiative could operate on less, Parnes said, if its
assistance to theater projects was cut back. He said the group was
now aiming for a $4 million budget to be divided among five
``micro-loans'' of up to $500,000 each to help finance five plays
and musicals in small or mid-size Broadway houses; grants to
theater groups and individuals to help attract new audiences,
especially young people, members of minorities and people from
outside Manhattan, and a kitty to monitor the preservation of the
theaters and cover overhead for the Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But he said those figures could shrink substantially, depending
on the resources available.
</P>
<P>
   The Initiative's efforts in recent months to seek unspecified
contributions from theatrical unions met with varied responses. The
1,200-member Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers said it
was willing to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The most negative reply was from the Association of Theatrical
Press Agents and Managers, with 680 members across the United
States and Canada. ``Union members are workers, not investors,''
Gordon Forbes, secretary-treasurer of the union, wrote to Parnes in
August. ``Their investment in this industry is love of theater,
hard work and a commitment to be available to employers as part of
a stable and trained work force. They should not also be required
to pay per-capita taxes to employers or make speculative financial
investments as a precondition of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, after what he portrayed as a summer cooling-off
period, Parnes wrote back to say that the Initiative had no plans
``to require union dues contributions.'' He said contributions
would be ``completely voluntary and self-imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   A second union, Local 802 of the American Federation of
Musicians, with 10,000 members, has also raised objections to the
Initiative's requests for contributions. ``In the beginning all we
talked about was air rights,'' said Bill Moriarty, the local's
president. ``My recollection is that the air rights were the
financial cornerstone of this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said that there was always an understanding that all
parties, including unions, would contribute to the Initiative.
Concern over who might get stuck with the bills when there were no
air rights sales was a major concern at City Planning Commission
hearings last May.
</P>
<P>
   Still some opponents of the air rights plan maintain that the
uncertainties were played down. ``They sold this and continued to
sell this as the way to save the industry,'' said John Fisher, a
member of Community Board 4 in Manhattan and spokesman for the
Clinton Special District Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most potent of the theatrical unions, Local 1 of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, with 2,200
members, has not raised objections to union contributions, although
it still expects air rights to provide a major source of financial
support, said the union's president, Edward McConway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a philosophical agreement that we'd all chip in to
keep it going,'' he said. ``But exactly what we agreed to, I don't
know.''

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ If you've had it up to here with the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Laurel Glen Vineyard is offering a
decorously comical way to protest.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will soon grace
the corks of Laurel Glens Reds, a modestly priced, non-vintage red
wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr corks will also bear the slogan, ``Investigate Reds, A
Better Use Of Your Tax Dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine, according to Patrick Campbell, owner of the Sonoma
County winery, will allow consumers to use a corkscrew to retaliate
against some of Washingtons largesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say he was chosen unanimously among our panel
of experts,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is the fifth well-known figure to be featured on the Reds
corks. Lenin, Marx, J. Edgar Hoover and Mao have previously been
immortalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine industry is a serious affair and this gives us an
opportunity to have some fun,'' Campbell said.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference between Denver (no. 1) and the Jets (2), and almost no
difference between the Jets (2) and Minnesota (3).

   NEW YORK _ Fireplace tools have gone minimal this fall. Reduced
to their bare essentials, they're leaving the big show to the fire.
There's a fireplace screen from France _ a simple wisp of
wave-shaped stainless-steel mesh that holds one basic brass tool _
and a set of tools from Denmark so minimalist that it looks like a
line drawing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   1. A four-piece iron tool set includes a hollow rod that
functions as a bellows when air is blown through it. The set,
called Mace-Line, was designed by Ann Maes, an American, and made
in the Netherlands. It is $395 at Moss, 146 Greene St. (Houston
Street).
</P>
<P>
   2. A wrought-iron fireplace log-and-tool holder is $149 from the
Pottery Barn catalog; (800) 922-5507.
</P>
<P>
   3. A hand-forged iron poker and shovel hang on a shapely stand.
The set is by Alchemy Metalworks of San Francisco. It is $195 at
Modern Stone Age, 111 Greene St. (Prince Street).
</P>
<P>
   4. This four-piece set of brushed-stainless-steel tools with
wood handles was made in Portugal. It is $340 at Troy, 138 Greene
St. (Houston Street).
</P>
<P>
   5. A canvas-trimmed jute carry-bag holds 16-inch logs and folds
for storage. It is $42.50 at Ad Hoc Softwares, 410 West Broadway
(Spring Street).
</P>
<P>
   6. This curved fire screen of stainless-steel mesh was made in
France and has a hand-forged brass poker. It is $285 at Modern
Stone Age. The Swiss-made brushed-aluminum log holder is $240 at
Troy.
</P>
<P>
   7. The most minimal tool set hangs on the wall. It includes
tongs and a poker that can be used as a bellows. The set, made of
steel, was designed by Nils Ollgaard in Denmark. It is $79 at the
MOMA Design Store, 44 W. 53rd St.

AN UNFINISHED REPUTATION: REASSESSING LILLIAN HELLMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days when nobody's memory is sacred, the likes of J.D.
Salinger and Philip Roth have been skewered by former lovers, and
Paul Theroux has described every odd element in the character of
V.S. Naipaul, nobody has suffered more from critical reappraisal
than that onetime legend of raw, courageous integrity, Lillian
Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hellman, the playwright and memoirist who died in 1984,
has by now been attacked by so many for so many different reasons
that her reputation, both when it was good and when it was
challenged, seems an emblem of the vagaries of opinion, the
transience of fame, the elusiveness of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Not all that long ago, her autobiographical books _ ``An
Unfinished Woman,'' ``Pentimento'' and ``Scoundrel Time'' _ were
icons of an era, moral beacons for the generation coming of age,
telling of an effort to remain truthful to one's convictions in the
face of the forces of dishonesty and repression.
</P>
<P>
   The Hellman of ``Scoundrel Time'' was a heroic martyr of the
McCarthy witch hunts when so many who were less courageous named
names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman's book ``Pentimento,'' about her supposed experience
smuggling money to the anti-Hitler resistance in Europe before
World War II, was made into a movie, ``Julia,'' with Jane Fonda and
Vanessa Redgrave. After the movie came out in 1977, millions
watched on television as Hellman got a standing ovation at the
Academy Awards celebration. During that time she appeared in an
advertisement, posing dramatically, proud and dark-haired, as a
living legend.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any polling, it is difficult to say how many
of her former admirers retain their full-blooded esteem for
Hellman, the author of ``The Little Foxes,'' who famously wrote, in
a letter to the House committee, ``I cannot and will not cut my
conscience to fit this year's fashions.'' Certainly, many of
Hellman's works, which include the anti-fascist play ``Watch on the
Rhine,'' ``The Children's Hour'' and the lyrics for Leonard
Bernstein's musical ``Candide,'' have their place in American
cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also no question that Hellman's critics, many of
whom have been gunning for her for decades, have had their day, and
her reputation for integrity has suffered accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The decline tells something about the nature of legend, its
susceptibility to wear and tear. In Hellman's case, the posthumous
re-examination has to do with the playing out of old battles
between American liberals and conservatives, or to put this another
way, between anti-communists and those who felt that American
anti-communism was more dangerous than communism itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union's collapse and revelations in Soviet
archives indicating the U.S. Communist Party's near-total
subservience to Moscow, Cold War conservatives have gained strength
in a number of old arguments, including the one that has long
swirled around Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that is the simple, slow accretion of new biographical
information about her. And legends, based on a degree of myth,
often fail to survive new information.
</P>
<P>
   The latest stab at the Hellman reputation comes from writer
Rosemary Mahoney, who spent the summer of 1978 at Hellman's house
on Martha's Vineyard and has now written a book about the
experience, ``A Likely Story: One Summer With Lillian Hellman''
(Doubleday). Ms. Mahoney writes that she went to Hellman's home to
be a part-time housekeeper, but Hellman turned her into a full-time
servant. Ms. Mahoney here gets some revenge for that insult,
drawing a stinging portrait of her boss (and of some of her boss'
friends) as petty, frightened, vain and imperiously cranky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahoney deals primarily with the personal side of the
Hellman issue, but most of the attacks on her have been more
political than personal. Or they have to do with the old stories
she told in her memoirs. Indeed, some scenes in Ms. Mahoney's
summertime portrait show Hellman worrying about early attacks on
her veracity, striving to figure out a way to respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest and probably the still most famous
anti-Hellman salvo was delivered by novelist Mary McCarthy, who
said of Hellman on television in the late 1970s, ``Every word she
writes is a lie including `and' and `the.''' In 1981, Martha
Gellhorn, the former wife of Ernest Hemingway, questioned the
veracity of some portions of ``An Unfinished Woman,'' in which
Hemingway and Gellhorn play a prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, a far heavier blow to Hellman's record
for veracity came when psychoanalyst Muriel Gardiner published a
memoir, ``Code Name: Mary,'' in which she identified herself as the
historical Julia, the main figure, aside from Hellman herself, in
``Pentimento.'' It did seem, especially after a devastating article
on Hellman and ``Pentimento'' that appeared in Commentary a year or
so later, that Hellman had falsely made herself the heroine of
somebody else's story.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complex and sustained criticisms of Hellman is
contained in a recent book, ``The Stolen Legacy of Anne Frank,'' by
Ralph Melnick (Yale University Press). The ``stolen legacy'' is
Anne's, in Melnick's view, specifically the way in which Hellman
and a group of others in theatrical and movie circles, all of them
close to the Communist Party, conspired to remove the specifically
Jewish character of Anne's tragedy, turning her instead into a
universal symbol of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Melnick argues that Hellman was an anti-Semitic Jew and a
pro-Stalinist at a time when Stalin was waging a campaign against
what Soviet propaganda called ``bourgeois Jewish nationalism.''
Melnick tells a complicated story with a large cast of characters,
but in essence he makes the case that Hellman's role in suppressing
Anne's Jewishness was a counterpart to Stalin's murderous
persecution of ``Jewish nationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The point about Hellman is that she was at the vortex of
ideological and political struggles of yesteryear and that these
combats are being cast in a different light today.
</P>
<P>
   Recent articles have reported on a scholarly reassessment of the
McCarthy period. It does not exonerate Sen. Joseph McCarthy for his
dishonesty or brutality, but it does support the position that
Moscow-controlled communists were more powerful and more
threatening than many had believed.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman, whether she was a communist or not (and the latest
evidence is that she was, at least for a few years), was probably
too stubbornly individualistic to submit much to party discipline.
But she was loath to criticize Stalinist excess and very quick to
condemn others who did criticize Stalin's cruelties.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Mary McCarthy put it (with some exaggeration), Hellman
does seem to have falsified much in her own record.
</P>
<P>
   The tide has shifted. Stalinist apologetics are out of fashion.
That fact, and the slow accumulation of anti-myth information about
Hellman, have combined to tarnish her once radiant reputation.

RIDING A MOUSE ON THE QUEST FOR ANTIQUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, N.Y., Conn., Maine, Calif., Mass., Mich., N.M.,
Md.)  (mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynne Strauss has purchased at least $10,000 worth of antiques
in the last three months. There was an 1870s Royal Doulton pitcher
and wash basin from Southampton, N.Y., a marble bust from New
Jersey and an art-glass lamp from Florida. Her pride and joy, a
$3,300 carpenter's sample of a child's dresser, came from Chester,
Conn. ``It's absolutely wonderful,'' said Ms. Strauss, who lives in
Juneau, Alaska, and bought everything based on photographs she
found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strauss is among thousands of antiques hunters who prefer
the thrill of the mouse to the thrill of the chase. She spends four
hours a day in front of her computer, and does not for one minute
miss the pleasure of stroking and circling a piece before she buys
it. ``The chase has changed now,'' she said. ``Feeling and touching
is fine, but it's hard to find good stuff anymore. There's more to
pick and choose from on the Net, so I can be more selective.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, the Internet is revolutionizing the
tradition-bound antiques business. What began three years ago as a
trickle of sites hawking Pez dispensers and Mom's old Fiestaware
has quietly grown into a steady flow of $3,000 Zuni water jugs,
$9,000 folk art and $25,000 French candelabra _ all in ``perfect
condition,'' if you are to believe everything the sellers tell you,
though that may not be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   With wares ranging from computers and cars to Art Deco consoles
and Barbie dolls, Ebay, a virtual auction house with headquarters
in San Jose, Calif., lays claim to being ``the great online souk,''
said James Griffith, a customer support superviser there. The
company said it received 340,000 bids a day before it went public
in August. Add on the tens of thousands of people across the world
who are clicking on other auctions, as well as sites where retail
shops are grouped, and it's easy to see why dealers from flea
markets to Madison Avenue say the impact of the Web cannot be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of dealers in the East, where most antiques in this
country are sold, report that attendance at some shows, like those
held in Brimfield, Mass., is down, that group shops have empty
booths and that some dealers and buyers are considering letting
their fingers do the traveling on the Internet rather than hauling
their gilded mirrors, cloisonne vases, Battersea boxes and Eames
chairs from show to show.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Stella, founder of Stella Show Management Co., which runs
the Triple Pier Expo in New York, said she did not notice much
effect on attendance at last weekend's show. But she added: ``It
scared me a little when I heard one dealer tell another: `I'm doing
$3,000 a week online. If I get it up to $5,000 a week, I won't have
to do shows anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Marsh, general manager of the Heritage Antiques Center in
Southbury, Conn., said he had seen ``at least a dozen dealers leave
because they can sell as much, if not more, on the Net.'' On the
Internet, they can reach amateurs and collectors from around the
world, rather than just from neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Even the venerable bible of the antiques business, The Maine
Antiques Digest, is mixing church and state: It recently bought 10
percent of the Ehammer auction site, which gets 10,000 bids a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a dealer, I would be shaking a little,'' said Dr.
Richard Winters, a plastic surgeon in New Bern, N.C. ``If I were an
auction house, I would be shaking a lot.'' Winters bought a rare
19th-century lion signed by Noah Weiss, a master carver, for $9,000
on the Internet, even though he doesn't even know how to turn a
computer on. An auctioneer friend in New York told him the work was
coming up on Ehammer. Winters stayed on the phone while his friend
bid for him.
</P>
<P>
   Many people express shock that anyone is willing to send a check
for hundreds of dollars, much less thousands, to someone they have
never met, for merchandise they have never examined. Online
auctions seem to combine the ``see it, got to have it'' mentality
that has made a success of QVC, the home-shopping network, with the
instincts required to play arcade video games.  &UR;  &LR;  ``Sometimes
people are too trusting,'' Griffith of Ebay admitted. A bidder can
send in a check and never receive the merchandise _ or get a shock
when the box is opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Christmas,'' said Ms. Strauss, the Juneau
collector. ``Except you are afraid it won't meet your expectations.
But most of it does.'' She generally buys expensive pieces from
online shops with names and addresses that can be confirmed. She
turns to the auctions for less expensive things.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Luehr, an assistant director of marketing practices in the
Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission,
said: ``Complaints about person-to-person online auctions is one of
the largest categories of Internet complaints we receive.''
Complaints include goods not received and the sale of copies as the
real thing. Many auction sites bar people who have a history of
complaints, but it's difficult to check out a seller.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques and auction sites are available to anyone with a
computer and Web access. Some sites emulate shops rather than
auction houses; they sell items for a set price and are frequently
grouped under an easy-to-find address like Antique Alley
(www.antiquealley.com). Other sites, like Ebay (www.ebay.com),
eHammer (www.ehammer.com), Auction Universe
(www.auctionuniverse.com) and the Interactive Collector
(www.icollector.com), solicit bids on items while a clock counts
the time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The sites usually offer photos and a list of bidders; the
sellers provide information about the provenance of the pieces, but
unlike actual auction houses, there is no decorative arts expert
around to verify the information. (The Auction Universe site was
acquired Wednesday by Classified Ventures, whose owners include New
York Times Co., Washington Post Co. and Times Mirror Co.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Watching the bidding can be as addictive as the bidding itself.
``I was on sabbatical all last year, and that's when I developed my
bad online habits,'' said Richard Abrams, an English professor at
the University of Southern Maine, who is currently bidding at the
Ehammer site on a 19th-century wax bust of Shakespeare based
closely, he said, on a limestone bust at Trinity Church in
Stratford-on-Avon, England. The bidding, which ends Thursday
morning, was focused in the low three figures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Web's larger pool of buyers and merchandise, no
pricing pattern has yet emerged. In some instances, serious
collectors and people far from the East Coast seem willing to pay
more than an item's estimated worth. At the Triple Pier Expo on
Pier 88 in Manhattan last Sunday, Robert Rozycki, 38, a dealer from
Royal Oak, Mich., whose shop, Vertu, specializes in postwar design,
said ``people in Oklahoma City or Maine may be buying items that
are hard to find in their regions, but it floors me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised my prices as a result of prices on Ebay,'' Rozycki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another dealer, Thomas Perry, who owns One of a Kind Antiques in
Chester, Conn., said that online auctions are leveling the playing
field. ``Prices will go up and prices will go down,'' he said.
``People will find out that what they think is rare isn't. And what
they think isn't rare is.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any souk, the rule is buyer beware. ``The Web is a superb
place to sell bad stuff,'' said Robert Nichols, owner of the Robert
Nichols Gallery in Santa Fe, N.M., which specializes in
contemporary Indian pottery. ``Auctions are a way to get rid of
things you can't sell any other way _ something that has damage or
has been repaired, or is a fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet draws many lower-priced offerings _ the
average bid on Ehammer is around $175 _ it is now competing with
the flea markets. Dealers are concerned that this reliable source
of small, inexpensive items is drying up. ``There was very little
to buy this fall at the flea market here in Portland,'' said Burt
Warren, who owns Lisbon School-house Antiques in Lisbon, Maine.
``The people have eliminated the middleman, and they are selling
their items on Ebay.''
</P>
<P>
   So are ``pickers,'' who roam the countryside, knocking on doors
in search of items they can sell to dealers, who in turn sell them
at retail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pickers who used to sell to me now save the stuff and put
it on Ebay and get more money,'' said Robert Prozzo, a dealer and
auctioneer in Rutland, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Like many smart dealers, Emanuel Jenkins is adjusting. The owner
of E. Jenkins Collectibles on Long Island, he has attended the
Atlantic City antiques and collectibles show each fall for three
years. This year his sales of art glass were down 50 percent, which
he attributed to Internet competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst show I've ever had,'' he said. ``The people
coming to shows are not coming to buy, but to find out what prices
are so they can sell their things on the Internet.'' Jenkins, who
normally travels to 20 shows nationwide, is planning to cut down to
``about nine'' next year _ and devote more time to selling online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Web sites are starting to sell big-ticket items. A little
over a month ago, Bruce Newman, president and owner of the upscale
Newel Art Galleries in New York City, put his entire inventory
online _ 20,000 photographs of what he says is the largest
collection of antiques in the world. Through it he has already sold
merchandise worth ``in the middle six figures'' to two people from
the West who came to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell furniture perfectly satisfactorily from catalogs, so
we can do it on the Internet,'' said David Redden, an executive
vice president of Sotheby's. Especially if the customer already has
a relationship with the company selling the piece and knows it can
be returned. Sotheby's has just announced that the Barry Halper
collection of baseball memorabilia _ 100,000 pieces, with an
estimated worth of more than $10 million _ will be sold in a live
auction and in online bidding that is expected to last six months,
starting next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, C.G. Sloan's, an auction house in Rockville, Md., sold
what was described as an ``obscure'' 20th-century landscape
painting for $145,000 to an Austrian collector. The painting had an
estimated value of $50,000 to $70,000. Without the Web, no one in
Austria would ever have seen it. ``Internet calls have now
surpassed calls from print ads,'' said Reimund Kocinskas, Sloan's
Internet coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Those who predict the disappearance of shops and auctions should
remember that radio did not disappear when television arrived, nor
did movie theaters when VCRs became popular. Antiquing luddites can
take heart from Griffith of Ebay, a former owner of an antiques
shop himself, whose partner is about to open another shop in
Rutland, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   At the pier show on Sunday, Rozycki, who has not yet bought
anything on the Web, watched a browser reach for a hand-decorated
Rookwood pottery blue vase, circa 1910, examine the signature and
check for repairs. Another woman touched a Georg Jensen silver cake
server. Shows and shops will always be strong draws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people who savor the tactile experience,
seeing the objects' true color, to see them up close, and want to
hear about them and their history,'' Rozycki said. ``The
free-flowing way people converse, you can't do that on an e-mail
message, when you have to pause and type.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``we're all always looking for an excuse to
get out of the house.''

HERE'S A SWITCH: COMPANY MINES FOR GUIDES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet Ratzloff of Wheat Ridge, Colo., is known to be passionate
about rodeo and the Internet _ and it's paying off.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years _ which, in World Wide Web years,
amounts to about 150 years _ she has maintained a quality homemade
site about rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   But like the rodeo competitors she loves to follow, Ratzloff
wanted to take her efforts up a notch and increase rodeo's
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Upon advice from an acquaintance, she found the opportunity at
the Mining Co. (www.miningco.com), a New York-based company that
provides Web space for online users who specialize in a certain
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzloff is the rodeo guide for a company whose motto is: ``We
mine the `Net so you don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Co.'s guide concept makes it stand apart from other
online efforts. The company certifies its guides, who must develop
and maintain their areas with appropriate content, links and
interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, guides are paid from advertising proceeds while the
Mining Co. markets their sites. At first, the rates were flat, but
now they're based on user traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guides are doing well financially,'' said Andrew Eisele,
the Mining Co.'s sports editor. ``Some we have on
getting-started-monthly stipends.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an elite group; only 25 percent of applicants are accepted.
The Mining Co. scrutinizes their sites during a screening process.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Co. has guides in 13 categories, including sports.
The sports section alone has about 50 guides, including Ratzloff,
who brought with her a rodeo community she had cultivated since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within each hub, there are a couple of star sites that you
wouldn't anticipate would be that popular,'' Eisele said. ``But
because the guide had their own Internet community set up
elsewhere, they were able to bring it to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet is an example of one of those who bought into the
philosophy and was able to hit the ground running. With some of the
other guides, it's taken a bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a hub for a particular subject is a refreshing approach.
It puts all facets of a subject in an easy-to-access site (each
guide must follow an official Mining Co. page template to ensure
consistency). The hub concept also reduces the amount of time users
deal with search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Eisele said the Mining Co. is looking for reliable guides. As of
yesterday, the sports section needed guides for bowling, boxing,
college ice hockey, rugby, skateboarding and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzloff, who enjoys the creative freedom of writing a weekly
column on her site, said the Mining Co. makes Web surfing
practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our links categorized and you won't find that anywhere
else,'' she said. ``I like that because it makes it easier for
people.''

   SUSAN-SMITH _ UNION, S.C._ Linda Russell cannot reach into her
daughter's sick mind to understand her horrible crime. So she looks
for answers along the desolate highway where Susan Smith drove the
night she drowned her two little boys in a lake. For the first
time, Russell is talking publicly about the ghastly small-town
tragedy that sent chills down America's spine. Divorced now and
selling the brick ranch house where the saga unfolded four years
ago, the 54-year-old mother portrayed as cold, uncaring and
hard-edged is telling her story. ``I don't know that anybody
realizes how my family has grieved over all of this,'' said
Russell, sipping coffee and smoking Salem Lights on her back-porch
swing. It's the same place she sat, stunned and silent, on the
night of Nov. 3, 1994, after learning that two of her
grandchildren, Michael and Alex, were dead and their mother had
been charged with murder. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

</P>
<P>
   EDs: This story is the result of more than two years of efforts

not agree to a photo, but Burritt took shots at John D. Long Lake
and at the memorial to the dead boys. File art of Russell should be

   AUS-UT-REGENTS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ UT regents are expected to
approve the creation of a Regional Academic Health Center in the
Rio Grande Valley that is expected to cost an additional $20
million _ money likely to come from the Permanent University Fund
which funds ``excellence'' programs at UT-Austin and other schools.
The Legislature already has appropriated $30 million to build the
health center, which cities in the Valley have been competing for
heavily. This additional money will enable the board to create
medical research and training facilities to placate Valley cities
that lost out on the center. (Roser, Austin American-Statesman)

   EVERGLADES-RESIDENTS _ EAST EVERGLADES, Fla. _ For decades,
they've lived in an odd limbo, halfway between one of American's
toughest urban centers and one of its most primitive natural
settings. Now the 1,600 or so property owners in the 8.5 square
mile East Everglades are being told their soggy ranches stand in
the way of saving the threatened Everglades. State officials are
expected to decide Thursday (Nov. 12) whether they will buy out the
landowners and return the land to its natural state. If not,
residents hope to get federal money to further drain their land and
end flooding problems. Some residents have already sold out, but
others don't want to be forced off the land, which they've grown to
love. (MWilliam, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 7 p.m.

biologist McLean and NASA scientists, could affect future flights

Newt Gingrich's all-but-endorsement take the pro-choice hex out of

a shooting. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency, GEMA, the
folks known for coordinating civil responses to natural disasters,
are now training school officials and school security officers to
handle, and help prevent, bloodshed in the schoolhouse. Since June,
GEMA has brought such training to 2,500 people in Georgia schools.
Conferences, like one on Tuesday, have been held at the Georgia
Public Safety Training Center, said Karen Franklin, hired this year

   ISRAEL-WYE _ JERUSALEM _ On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to finally have his cabinet ratify
the Wye Memorandum. But, ratification, according to a statement
released Tuesday, will be dependent on the Palestinians voting to
revoke the parts of the PLO charter the calls for armed resistance
to Israel. Why is this so important to Israel? Didn't the
Palestinians already do this? Why are Israel and the United States
fighting over it? (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   HAITI-AMWAY _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ Haitians earn an average
of $250 a year. The economy is in shambles. The future is unclear
due to a political vacuum. But that hasn't stopped Amway from
taking Haiti by storm. About 2,200 Haitians now sell Amway products
in this dirt-poor nation. Amway toothpaste sells for nearly $5.
Amway's 20-piece set of cookware sells for $941. The products have
become a kind of status symbol here the same way Tupperware has in

ART MUSEUM IN TEXAS GETS TROVE OF 700 WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the largest and most important collections of Old Master
paintings and drawings in private hands will soon have a new home
at the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at
Austin, leaving two New York institutions somewhat the poorer.
</P>
<P>
   The trove, estimated to be worth more than $30 million, was
assembled over two generations by William Suida and Robert and
Bertina Suida-Manning, all influential art historians. It comprises
700 works by Poussin, Veronese, Rubens, Tiepolo, Boucher, Correggio
and other Italian, French and German artists of the 14th to the
18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of them have been on long-term loan to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York City, including ``The Conversion of St.
Paul,'' painted by Daniele Crespi about 1623, which is considered
to be the artist's finest painting in the United States, and
Guercino's ``Landscape With Tobias and Angel,'' circa 1616-17, an
important landscape. Twelve other works are on view at the Frances
Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The works, known as the Suida-Manning Collection, are a partial
gift to the Blanton Museum by Kurt and Alessandra Manning Dolnier
of Watertown, Conn. Three anonymous donors have contributed $4.75
million toward the acquisition, and the university has pledged to
raise $15 million to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong collection in Latin American art and in
prints, and we have a good collection in 20th-century American art,
but, except for prints, we really lack the core of Western art
history,'' said Jessie Otto Hite, the museum's director. ``This
collection gives us that core.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dolnier's father, Robert Lee Manning, wanted the collection
to go to an institution in his native Texas and wanted it to be
kept together.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dolnier said that several museums had courted her, but that
``we felt it would have a more dynamic home in a university.'' She
added, ``If it went to a museum like the Met, only the greatest
hits would be on display, and the rest would be in storage
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Met art director Philippe de Montebello said the museum knew it
would have to give up the paintings. ``Had I ever thought that it
might be a gain, I would consider this a loss,'' he said, ``but we
always knew he wanted to sell the collection, and we were not
interested in acquiring it.''
</P>
<P>
   (In any case, the Met was recently on the receiving end of a
more valuable transfer. It acquired two van Gogh drawings valued at
$40 million under the terms of a bequest by philanthropist Abby
Aldrich Rockefeller stipulating that the drawings would after 50
years pass from the Museum of Modern Art in New York City to the
Met.)
</P>
<P>
   George Wachter, the expert in Old Masters at Sotheby's who
valued the works for the Manning estate, said: ``It's a tremendous
collection. For years, people have been giving me offers for many
of these works. I've had very high offers for them.'' Still, some
of the collection's pieces are ``student-level, best for study,''
Wachter added.
</P>
<P>
   Masterworks in the collection include ``The Annunciation,'' an
altarpiece by Veronese from the 1580s; Sebastiano del Piombo's
``Portrait of a Man,'' from about 1516, a rare example of a High
Renaissance portrait; Sebastiano Ricci's mythological ``Flora,''
circa 1712-16, which evokes Titian and Veronese; Claude Lorrain's
``Pastoral Landscape,'' from 1628-30, a very early work, and
Tiepolo's ``Storyteller,'' from 1765, part of a famous series
depicting 18th-century Venice.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, which contains about 250 paintings, 400 drawings
and 50 sculptures, has dozens of examples of regional schools of
Italian painting.
</P>
<P>
   William Suida, an Austrian-born art historian who died in 1959,
started buying art in the early 1900s and became an authority on
Italian art, particularly Genoese painting. In 1939, he moved to
New York and worked as the principal adviser to Samuel H. Kress.
</P>
<P>
   Suida's daughter, Bertina, and her husband shared her father's
passion, and they added extensively to the family holdings and
promoted Baroque art in the United States. She became curator of
the Chrysler Collection; Manning was curator at the Kress
Foundation and later director of the Finch College Museum of Art in

   At their house in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, paintings
hung on virtually every wall, including in the kitchen and the
cloakroom, and many more were stacked in cupboards and under the
beds. Bertina Manning died in 1992 and Robert Manning in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   About a year before his death, Manning paid a visit to the
Blanton and called Ms. Hite from the galleries. ``He said, `Hello,
I'm Robert Manning, have you ever heard of me?' I said no,'' she
recalled in a telephone interview. But she invited him to coffee
and called in Jonathan Bober, the museum's curator of prints and
drawings, who had seen many of the Suida-Manning acquisitions as a
student.
</P>
<P>
   Manning later invited Ms. Hite and Bober to his home. ``He took
us around to all the pictures _ he was testing Jonathan,'' Ms. Hite
said. ``It went on all day, and then they started on the
drawings.'' Bober apparently passed muster, and Manning began
planning to leave the collection to the Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   The Blanton, which owns 12,000 works of Western art dating from
antiquity to the present, is Austin's only encyclopedic museum. It
recently announced plans to construct a $40 million,
100,000-square-foot building that will bring together all its
holdings, and an architect is expected to be announced soon.
Selections from the Suida-Manning Collection will go on view in the
existing museum early next year.

   SUCCESS STORY
</P>
<P>
   Flabbergasted when its letter to Queen Elizabeth II led to an
invitation, a previously unknown teen-age British rock band will
perform Friday at a 50th-birthday celebration for Prince Charles.
The Daily Mail reported Wednesday that the four members of Al!ve,
who are 16 and 17, wrote: ``Dear Your Majesty. We are four good
lads who don't do drugs, aren't scruffy and don't use foul language
(maybe that's where we've been going wrong!). Anyway if you can
give us a break it would really be cool. With our love to you and
the royal family.''

   What are they studying at Dartmouth? Friday through Sunday,
scholars will gather on the campus in Hanover, N.H., to discuss the
Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1948). The conference
``Eisenstein at 100: A Reconsideration'' asks to what extent a
world that has witnessed the decay of the Soviet Union can still
value Eisenstein, who worked under official auspices and produced
films like ``Alexander Nevsky'' that ostensibly upheld Soviet
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   REPARATION
</P>
<P>
   To return to their rightful owners more than 171 paintings
looted by the Nazis, the French foreign ministry is distributing an
illustrated catalog of the missing works to museums and art
galleries worldwide. Most of the works are by Flemish and Dutch
masters and were seized during World War II from Adolphe Schloss, a
Jew.

LOTS OF ANTIQUES ONLINE, BUT NOT MANY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With INTERNET-ANTIQUES) 
(mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading for antiques on the Web offers the opportunity to view,
if not touch, an inexhaustible supply of items in a short time. But
when it comes to buying, Mike Putzel, president of Trysail, a
consulting concern that seeks to make technology easier for
nontechnical people, warns that ``www'' stands not only for World
Wide Web but also for Wild Wild West. ``There is ample opportunity
in this Wild Wild West to rip people off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Let the buyer beware. In 1997, the Internet fraud unit of the
National Consumers League in Washington received 100 complaints a
month. This year, the rate has risen to 300 a month. ``Online
auctions are by far No. 1'' in complaints, said Cleo Manuel, vice
president for public affairs. ``From January through October, fraud
reports of online auctions accounted for 65 percent of our
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of disputes concern antiques and collectibles
like Barbie dolls, Beanie Babies and sports collectibles. Most
complaints pit individuals against individuals, rather than against
shops. For buyers, there is less risk dealing with established
shops that have Web sites, because such shops normally have an
address and a telephone number where they can be tracked down in
case of a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some guidelines for buying at auction on the Web:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't take the word of the seller about the condition,
pedigree or value of an item. If you are at all suspicious, send
the seller your questions by e-mail; if the seller cannot answer
them, shop elsewhere. If the photo of the item for sale is not
clear, send an e-mail request to see other shots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the seller's Web site for feedback from other bidders _
comments that are positive, neutral or negative. And hope they are
authentic. As Ms. Manuel put it, ``We have seen reports of planted
information.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Print out descriptions of items from the site. ``If there is a
problem,'' Ms. Manuel said, ``they have a written statement _
documentation of their side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch for shilling, the practice of colluding with someone
else or creating a false online identity to drive up bidding prices
on behalf of the seller. Most auction sites have teams to weed out
shill bidders, but no site can totally avoid the problem. If the
bidder and seller have the same e-mail address, beware. Shilling
can also be a problem at real auctions, but at least the bidders
can usually figure out who in the audience is the shill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deal only with people who offer money-back guarantee. Pay by
credit card if possible, so there is some recourse if the item does
not arrive or if it is not as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make payments only into an escrow account, where your money is
held until you are satisfied, Ms. Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   _ When registering with an online auction company, carefully
read the user agreement. You will see that the company takes
absolutely no responsibility for transactions between bidders and
sellers; it is not a guarantor of transactions. The agreement
specifies many actions that are illegal, but that does not mean
people won't do illegal things anyway.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are stung _ if the object does not fit its description
or fails to arrive _ provide negative feedback to the auction site
and the National Consumers League, whose Web site is at
www.natlconsumersleague.org. ``By reporting fraud, they can help
stop it,'' Ms. Manuel said.

A FUNNY WOMAN IS A DANGEROUS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A guy I know is in a men's group: `Single
Heterosexual Men Who Harbor No Hostility Toward Women.' What is
there, one member?''
</P>
<P>
   So go the jokes in Susie Essman's stand-up comedy routine. It
isn't that Ms. Essman has anything against men in general, but jabs
at the male gender are a staple of her act, perhaps because she
remembers a time not so very long ago when men treated women and
comedy as a contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of male comedians would say, `Women just aren't funny,''
Ms. Essman said. ``It was a tremendous proving we had to do, and
did.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Essman, who would not tell her age, said the
comedy circuit is more welcoming to women but that it is still not
easy. ``It's hard to be a comic of any gender _ it's hard to go out
there and make strangers laugh _ but you have to be that much
better as a woman,'' she said. ``It's easier for a mediocre man
than a mediocre woman.''
</P>
<P>
   It is less to redress this disadvantage than to celebrate funny
women that Marshalls, the discount clothing chain, is presenting a
``Women in Comedy'' festival, which opened Wednesday night and runs
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will feature more than 50 female comedians,
including established names like Rita Rudner, Joy Behar and Kathy
Griffin and several less well known like Dani Leon, Tracy Esposito
and Carie Karavas.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which opened with a gala at Carnegie Hall with Mary
Tyler Moore as host, will take place at venues throughout New York
and will benefit two nonprofit organizations that deal with
domestic violence, Victim Services and the Center for Children and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Essman, who will be performing on Saturday at the comedy
club Stand-Up New York, has been one of the more fortunate female
comics. She has become a regular fixture at clubs across the United
States, has appeared on several television comedy specials and is
the host of a daily local cable talk show, ``MSG Metro.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Essman said she was still the exception to the rule.
Many people still believe that women are not meant to make people
laugh for a living and that being funny is not feminine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation was that women could not control a crowd, that
they couldn't hold a crowd, they didn't have the power,'' she said.
``Tomboy funny is OK, fat funny's OK, bimbo funny's OK. Sexy funny
_ that's a combination that's really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Essman said, some women hinder their own
progress as comedians because they lack the sense of entitlement
needed to take a stage. ``Stand-up is a very aggressive art form,
and a lot of women don't feel comfortable expressing that kind of
aggression _ they're taught not to,'' she said. ``If women could
get beyond that discomfort they feel with power, I think they could
be such great comics. Because part of stand-up is taking care of
the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Essman said that when she was growing up, there was a dearth
of female role models in comedy and the few that existed tended to
make jokes at their own expense. ``The only comics I remember were
Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers, both of whom did self-deprecating
material _ I think because they had to at that time or the public
would not have accepted them,'' Ms. Essman said. ``And I didn't
want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Essman, who grew up in Westchester County and now lives in
Manhattan, said she has no trouble being the center of attention or
putting herself on the line in public. That was her style even as a
child, she said, adding that her parents have supported her career.
``It's not that different for them from what I always did,'' she
said. ``When I was 9 years old, I was standing up on the kitchen
table and making fun of my grandmother and the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just praying I don't talk about them,'' she continued.
``And I think they're happy to see me on TV; my mother hasn't left
the house for the last few months.''

COMMENTARY: SADDAM'S STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Forget the fascination with our semiannual
military buildup in the Persian Gulf to persuade Saddam Hussein
``this time we're really, really serious.'' That point's been made
with the U.N.'s evacuation of employees it does not want to be
chained to suspected anthrax storage sites.
</P>
<P>
   Focus instead on the strategy of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton strategy up to now has been to go along with U.N.
appeasement of Saddam to such an extent that even the French got
sick of sustained humiliation. Our doormat approach _ though it has
enabled Iraq secretly to steal a march on building terror weapons _
is now being presented as having brilliantly ``unified our
allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been dared by Saddam to launch air strikes, President
Clinton has four strategic options:
</P>
<P>
   One is to do nothing, become the world laughingstock, and watch
the United Nations go the way of the impotent League of Nations.
Another is to remove Saddam's threat by a second invasion, this
time setting up a democratic government in Iraq as we did in 1945
in Germany and Japan. Neither of these options is being considered
by this White House.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have strategic choice No. 3: ``300 pinpricks'' to
exhibit our extreme irritation. Cruise missiles launched from sea
for a couple of weeks, accompanied by film showing the uncanny
smartness of our munitions, would be followed by our unilateral
declaration of ``mission accomplished'' and a promise to annoy Iraq
again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth choice is the ``degrade his capabilities'' option,
which seems to be in favor: Use cruise missiles at first to disrupt
communications and depress air defenses, then strike with carrier
aircraft and heavy bombers from land bases. This would target
suspected weapons manufacturing sites, tank parking lots and army
barracks, similar to our softening-up air campaign of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton joint chiefs would claim we successfully
``degraded'' his threat. That military jargon means ``temporarily
lessened'' but by no means ``ended.'' We would again wait for an
internal revolt to topple him (as we have been for Fidel Castro for
40 years). If it doesn't work out, that's the next U.S. president's
problem, though Saddam may then be in a position to reach for his
ultimate strategic goal.
</P>
<P>
   What is that goal? And could the incipient aerial punishment
help Saddam achieve it?
</P>
<P>
   First, it is to endure and survive. Because the U.S. mission is
limited to punishing but not ending his regime, Saddam is convinced
he can absorb the heaviest air attacks with personal impunity. Nor
is the United States. likely to knock out all his hidden germ, gas
and nuclear weapons potential.
</P>
<P>
   Second, counterattack with his people's suffering. He will
invite television crews to cover collateral damage to civilians. If
necessary, he can set off bombs in children's hospitals and
orphanages himself. Filmed atrocity will not only afflict the
Americans with self-disgust but bring about an alliance with Iran,
which will soon be able to swap its long-range missiles for his
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make a deal with the U.N. for limited access by
non-American inspectors. Clinton _ branded ``baby killer'' by Iraqi
propagandists _ is unlikely to resist, especially if our bombers or
helicopters crash or terrorists take allied lives. This will enable
Saddam's weapons development to go forward in secrecy while
sanctions are lifted. Within two years, Iraqi oil production will
finance purchase of fissionable material and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saddam miscalculated wildly a decade ago, his current
strategy takes full advantage of Clinton's expected decision to
wage limited air war with its modest compliance aim. So long as our
purpose is only to ``degrade'' facilities rather than to replace an
aggressive regime, the strategic advantage is his.
</P>
<P>
   His ultimate purpose is to be able to credibly bluff the West
into letting him dominate his part of the world. In 2002, he moves
on Saudi Arabia; we threaten to invade Iraq; Saddam announces he is
ready to risk national suicide by firing a nuclear missile at us.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no missile defense. Does a prudent
president let him grab those oilfields, or will Clinton's successor
be forced to gamble a U.S. city on the hope that a homicidal maniac
is only bluffing?

<P>
   Everyone needed an identification card. You couldn't go into a
military zone without it. Even if you were on your honeymoon. As
Marilyn Monroe was.
</P>
<P>
   She had come to Tokyo with Joe DiMaggio shortly after their
marriage but upon arrival she and Joe agreed to an appeal from the
general staff for her to entertain the troops in Korea, while Joe
stayed in Japan. And so on a laminated U.S. Department of Defense
I.D., issued 8 Feb. 1954, was, naturally, her unmistakably dazzling
mug shot _ looking nothing, to be sure, like a noncom _ with her
name printed below the photo, and her looping signature.
</P>
<P>
   And what, for, say, $6,000, was the name she chose to be known
by?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``Norma Jeane (cq) DiMaggio,'' as she signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently Barry Halper owned one of the most
remarkable, and valuable, baseball memorabilia collections this
side of the moon. It was announced Tuesday that he had sold to the
baseball commissioner's office for $7.5 million what he estimates
to be about 20 percent of his collection that is comprised of
everything from the 75 baseball uniforms in mint condition that go
back to one worn by Pud Galvin of the 1871 Buffalo Nationals to the
contract to the National Casket Co. of Long Island City for Babe
Ruth's coffin (``six foot, six inch pine box _ kind of eerie, but
special,'' said Halper) to, well, Norma Jean DiMaggio's USO
identification. Much of the rest of his collection will be sold
over the year by Sotheby's, including the Monroe card.
</P>
<P>
   Halper, diligent to the point of obsessed, obtained his
collection of over 100,000 pieces that fills up almost every nook
and cranny of the extensive basement in his house in Livingston,
N.J., in many ways: by people giving him things free that they
wanted to clear out of their basements, or by going to various
significant individuals and getting them to autograph bats, balls,
programs, as well as on occasion visiting an auction. It was at an
auction about 20 years ago that he paid $1,400 for the I.D. The
people at Sotheby's believe it might sell for at least $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Halper, a friend for many years of DiMaggio's, said he never
showed the I.D. (``Ht: 5-5 1/2, Wt. 118, Religion: None'') to
DiMaggio. ``He's very sensitive about anything regarding her,''
said Halper. ``But one day in my home I showed him an original copy
of the first Playboy Magazine, in which she posed nude for the
cover. Joe said _ he didn't look too thrilled _ `What do you want
me to do with this, sign ``Best wishes?'' ''
</P>
<P>
   Halper is nothing if not undaunted. ``I said, `No, but I'd love
to have you sign it.' He said, `OK, but I don't want anyone to see
it in my lifetime.' I promised I wouldn't, and I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper, now 58 and a limited partner with the Yankees of
something over 1 percent, began collecting baseball cards as a boy
in the 1940s, soon it was on to other memorabilia. At the 1983
All-Star Game in Chicago, on the 50th anniversary of the first
big-league All-Star Game, he wanted to get a bat signed by Earl
Averill, who played in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in the hotel lobby after the game and he was looking
very sickly,'' recalled Halper. ``He said he'd sign it tomorrow. I
thought that if he made it to tomorrow it would be a miracle. I
just about begged him to do it now, and we went to his hotel room
where he signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning I come down to the lobby and there's a big
commotion. Averill was leaving the hotel in an ambulance, and died
shortly after. I don't want to be callous, but I did get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper once approached Richard Nixon, whom he knew, with a
request. Halper told him he had been collecting baseballs of famous
people who signed their full names and nicknames. From his
briefcase, Halper showed Nixon balls signed ``Joseph Paul DiMaggio,
`Yankee Clipper,' and ``Theodore Samuel Williams, `The Thumper.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, would you sign a baseball like that?'' asked
Halper. ``Sure,'' said Nixon. He signed, ``Richard Milhous Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't write your nickname,'' said Halper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a nickname,'' said Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, well, yes you do, Mr. President,'' Halper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trickster.'' Nixon threw up his arms. ``Oh, no, I'm not
signing that!''
</P>
<P>
   Halper politely held his ground. ``Well,'' he said, ``how about
`Tricky Dick?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that either!'' said Nixon, even half-smiling. It was one
of Halper's few defeats.
</P>
<P>
   As the moving men now remove the collection, Halper's wife,
Sharon, is not unhappy. ``She's not much of a baseball fan,'' he
said. ``Besides, I think all the mildew in the house was getting to
her.''

ISRAEL'S CABINET RATIFIES MIDDLE EAST PEACE ACCORD ... WITH
STIPULATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After a two-week delay, Israel's Cabinet Wednesday
ratified the U.S.-brokered Middle East peace accord, but attached
conditions for its implementation that likely will set the stage
for renewed conflict with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of eight to four with five abstentions sets in motion a
three-month timetable during which Israel will transfer 13 percent
of West Bank territory to the Palestinians, release 750 Palestinian
prisoners, open an airport in Gaza and a safe passage connecting
the Gaza Strip to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Knesset, Israel's Parliament, will debate and vote on the
agreement during two days next week. It is expected to pass easily.
</P>
<P>
   The first land transfer of 2 percent should then happen, a few
days after the Nov. 16 deadline set out in the accords.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven hours of debate, the cabinet said Israel
would put the agreement into action only if Palestinians nullified
clauses of the Palestine Charter offensive to Israel and refrained
from declaring independence next May.
</P>
<P>
   It also limited to 1 percent any further West Bank land transfer
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we intend to continue implementing the entire
agreement,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said shortly
after the Cabinet vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) we require the Palestinian side to comply with its
commitments in fighting terror and to re-convene the Palestinian
National Council to vote and delete the anti-Israel clauses in the
Palestinian Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu added that the cabinet would convene to verify
Palestinians had complied with their commitments as each step of
the agreement was implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions, which require Palestinians to go beyond what
they agreed to during nine days of marathon talks at the Wye River
conference center in the United States last month, underscore the
difficulty Netanyahu had in selling the agreement to his hard-line
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had set out to convince a cabinet of religious
rightists and security hawks that the Wye accord ``plugged holes''
that he said were left in earlier interim peace accords, including
a Palestinian obligation to change parts of its national charter
that Israel interprets as a call for its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the cabinet demanded more stringent guarantees than were set
out in the Wye agreement. That agreement calls on Palestinians only
to ``reaffirm'' a decision taken two years ago to delete certain
clauses in the charter.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also stipulates that a joint committee will
negotiate the size of an additional West Bank land transfer to the
Palestinians, known as the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
   The add-ons seem poised to trip up efforts to pull peace
negotiations out of a 20-month deep freeze just as they seemed
ready to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians lambasted the cabinet additions and warned that
they would ignore any demands not laid out explicitly in signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to implementing the Wye accords to the
letter,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``But any
addition or anything outside the framework of the agreement will
not be considered by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the cabinet demands, it is likely the ceiling of 1
percent placed on the third redeployment most likely to rankle
Palestinians. The issue, a major stumbling block during the Wye
negotiations, was solved at the last minute by empowering a
committee to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it a flagrant violation of the accord,'' Erekat
said. ``The agreement says that a joint committee will decide.
Israel is not negotiating by itself and Israel cannot decide by
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Palestinians say clauses in the charter offensive to
Israel were excised in April 1996, when most of the then-500-member
Palestine National Council convened in Gaza and voted by an
overwhelming majority to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   They say the 170-member executive council of the PNC will
convene in Gaza in December to listen to an address by President
Bill Clinton and to ``reaffirm'' the earlier decision _ but the PNC
will not reconvene and the smaller Palestinian ruling body will not
take another vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position on that is very clear: The job that was demanded
of us was done a long time ago,'' said Marwan Kanafani, one of
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's advisers. ``The matter to us
is mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also left open the option of declaring statehood in
the West Bank and Gaza once interim peace deals expire in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The threat, which has clouded negotiations since Arafat first
broached the possibility months ago, has prompted Israel to counter
with threats to annex those parts of the West Bank still under its
control.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, both Netanyahu and Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon repeated the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Palestinians take unilateral decisions _ and we
recommend they don't _ Israel will consider itself free to adopt
unilateral measures, and one of them is to apply Israeli laws to
the areas of Jewish settlement and military areas (in the West
Bank),'' Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government took that decision today,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be efforts to convince right-wing skeptics,
Sharon, Israel's reigning security hawk, described cabinet members
as doing all they could to safeguard Israel's vital interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made every possible effort not to damage the areas around
Jerusalem, to protect water resources, to safeguard the places holy
to Jerusalem, the defense areas and the access routes,'' he said
after the cabinet vote.
</P>
<P>
   His words and the extra cabinet conditions failed to sway tens
of thousands of Israelis who gathered in Tel Aviv to protest
ratification of the accord under the banner ``We remain faithful to
the land of Israel'' &QL;

ARGENTINA JOINS EFFORT TO CURB GASES LINKED TO GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what was described in several quarters as an important
breakthrough, Argentina signaled Wednesday that it would
voluntarily become the first developing country to adopt binding
targets and timetables for controlling emissions of heat-trapping
industrial waste gases believed to cause global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, developing countries have presented an uncrackable
united front in resisting specific limits on their emissions of
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which are produced by the
burning of coal, oil, wood and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Rich countries agreed in Kyoto, Japan, last December to make
emissions reductions averaging about 5 percent below 1990 levels in
the period 2008 to 2012, but the poorer nations have refused to
follow suit until the industrialized countries are actually showing
results.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at a follow-up conference to the Kyoto meeting in
Buenos Aires, Argentine President Carlos Menem said his country
would establish ``goals'' for carbon-dioxide emissions and in about
a year would announce its commitment to those goals for the period
2008 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emerging countries also share the responsibility to assume
their own initiatives to face and solve every challenge of the 21st
century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Julia Alsogaray, an Argentinian who is also presiding over
the Buenos Aires meeting, later described the goals not as
emissions reductions but as limitations on emissions growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Menem's speech was somewhat general, Stuart Eizenstat, the
head of the U.S. delegation, said he had been told by the Argentine
president that Argentina would spend the next year analyzing its
emissions profile with the objective of producing a specific,
binding emissions target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major, major move,'' Eizenstat said. ``We think it's
truly historic.''
</P>
<P>
   There were indications that other developing countries might
eventually follow now that Argentina has led the way, some
participants in the Buenos Aires talks said. ``No one wants to be
the first one out of the box,'' said Connie Holmes, the chairwoman
of the Global Climate Coalition, which represents fossil-fuel
producers and users. She called Argentina's action ``great,'' if it
can find a way to follow through. ``If they want to do it, more
power to them,'' said Ms. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   But, she pointed out, it may be difficult for Argentina to be
brought into the international process under the Kyoto Protocol to
the 1992 global climate treaty, since no developing countries are
covered by it. How that might happen remains to be worked out over
months or even years. Argentina wants to pursue its
emissions-control program by taking advantage of some of the
protocol's cost-cutting mechanisms like trading of emissions
rights, Eizenstat said he was told. This, Menem said, implies the
creation of a ``new way,'' under the 1992 treaty, to involve his
country and others like it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Ms. Holmes, Argentina's shift will not in itself
satisfy the U.S. Senate, which has made participation by key
developing countries a condition for ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists hailed the development. ``It is a major
breakthrough,'' said Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental
Defense Fund. ``I don't think there's any doubt about it.'' He
called the Argentine move ``a significant first step'' in
satisfying the Senate's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The move also represented ``a clear break'' from the developing
countries' past insistence that binding limitations would put a cap
on their economic growth, said Alden Meyer, a spokesman for the
Climate Action Network, a global environmental coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Menem said Argentina's economy had grown by 6 percent a year in
the last decade while greenhouse gases per capita had grown by only
1 percent, and he said his country's purpose was to erase ``the
false option between economic growth and environmental
protection.''

TEXAN FROST COULD BE ELEVATED TO CHAIRMAN OF DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Republicans are still fighting over a new
House leadership team, Democrats will hold their own elections on
Monday that could elevate Rep. Martin Frost of Texas to the No. 3
spot in the minority as chairman of the Democratic caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Frost currently holds down the No. 4 job as head of the
congressional campaign committee, where he has spent the last four
years raising money, recruiting candidates and helping the party
recover many of the seats it lost when the Republicans took control
of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Frost is in a tight race against the more liberal Rep. Rosa
DeLauro of Connecticut to replace retiring caucus Chairman Vic
Fazio of California. If he pulls it off, the moderate Texan would
be in position to help shape the Democratic legislative agenda for
the next two years and communicate the party's message as it heads
toward the presidential and congressional elections of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I couldn't tell you whether Martin or Rosa has it
locked up,'' said one Democratic aide. ``I think the conference is
pretty much split because they both have a lot to offer and have
done well in the jobs they hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for DeLauro is the fact that she a liberal in a
Democratic conference that has traditionally elected more liberal
members to high-profile leadership positions. The fact that she is
a woman is also appealing to many members, who would like to see a
female in one of the conference's top three posts for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus for DeLauro is that she was in charge of getting
the party's ``daily message out'' during the legislative battles of
the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Frost on the other hand, has spent the last four years as head
of the DCCC building a power base of money and IOUs from old and
new members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At 56, Frost was just re-elected to an 11th term. He is seen as
someone who can bring together the various factions of the
Democratic caucus. In addition to having the support of his Texas
Democratic House colleagues, he has also managed to gain backing
from influential conservative and liberal members of the 211-member
conference, as well as a sizable chunk of the 23 freshmen Democrats
who will be sworn in next January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to present a more moderate image and Martin, I think,
will do that for us,'' said Rep. Gene Green of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Frost appears to have edge at the moment over
DeLauro. ``Before the election (which gave the Democrats five more
seats in the House ) I was concerned about it. But I feel better
about it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's voting in the caucus is not expected to change the
faces at the very top of the Democratic leadership. House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, for example, will remain as the
No. 1 Democratic leader in the House, while Rep. David Bonior of
Michigan will be returned to his No. 2 job as minority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Texans Chet Edwards and Green are also expected to remain in
their appointed positions as deputy whips.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of members will be running against one another for
the job Frost is leaving as head of the DCCC. They include Reps.
Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, Frank Pallone of California and
Nancy Pelosi of California.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, were still embroiled Wednesday in
their own leadership shootouts. Although Rep. Bob Livingston of
Louisiana has the biggest job of all _ speaker of the House _ all
locked up, House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas is still in a
fight for his survival.
</P>
<P>
   Although his aides insist that he will have the 112 votes needed
to be re-elected when the 223-member GOP conference meets next
Wednesday, his opponents Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer
Dunn of Washington dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   There is also talk of others jumping into the race against
Armey, as more and more members indicate they would like to see the
Texan replaced. &QL;

FRANCE HAS ITS OWN SEX-AND-POLITICS SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France dismissed the Monica Lewinsky affair as
puritanical persecution of President Clinton, but it is in the
middle of a sex-and-politics scandal of its own, the seamiest in
years.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the center of it, Roland Dumas, the country's
fifth-highest official as head of the independent Constitutional
Council, said on Tuesday that he had no intention of resigning
despite a call for his removal by former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing.
</P>
<P>
   Dumas, 76, was foreign minister in 1991 when his close friend
and fellow Socialist Francois Mitterrand, the president at the
time, allowed a $2.7 billion sale of six French-built warships to
Taiwan to go ahead after Dumas dropped his longstanding opposition
to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators placed Dumas under investigation, considered one
step short of indictment, in April and are trying to find out
whether a lobbyist friend of his named Christine Deviers-Joncour
got him to change his mind, possibly in exchange for money,
clothing and other favors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Deviers-Joncour has told investigators that she was paid
$11.3 million and given a lavish Paris apartment by the big French
oil company Elf Aquitaine SA, then state-owned, just for using
longstanding personal connections with Dumas. Elf Aquitaine is
alleged by prosecutors to have offered her services to the
contractor that built the frigates, Thomson-CSF, also
state-controlled at the time. Elf Aquitaine has not commented on
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   All this had been bubbling quietly until last week, when Mrs.
Deviers-Joncour came out with a book titled ``The Whore of the
Republic,'' published by Calmann-Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the book and photos in France's leading gossip
magazine, the weekly Paris Match, showed the silver-maned Dumas
nuzzling up to the lobbyist, both in bathing suits on the sands of
Aquitaine in southwest France, and lunching romantically with her
in New York at the River Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Elf Aquitaine sent her to New York in 1991, she wrote, on a
crash mission to sweet-talk the foreign minister into getting
Mitterrand to stop during a Middle East swing in a country where
the oil company was hoping to make a major deal. She did and Elf
Aquitaine got it, and thought she had earned her pay on that alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To live such an intense relationship with a man on an
emotional basis while at the same time knowing this relationship
served economic interests was not easy for me to do,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She made no charge that Dumas had been paid off. But some of his
conservative critics began to wonder how, with all this unseemly
publicity, he could go on impartially hearing and deciding major
issues in the Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
   A few conservatives, like Giscard, began making noises
encouraging their fellow conservative, President Jacques Chirac, to
dismiss him or force him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac remained silent, and until Tuesday, so did Dumas, who as
a practicing lawyer had a long list of prominent clients in the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do with Elf executives when I was foreign
minister, outside of my official functions,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not receive before, during or after the period when I
was the head of French diplomacy any money for any reason from the
officials of this company, or from its agents, among whom I include
Christine Deviers-Joncour, who was among the persons on its
payroll,'' he said. ``Having a clear conscience, I will continue in
all serenity and in all objectivity to preside over the
Constitutional Council, whose functioning is not affected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you here for me or for Elf Aquitaine?'' Mrs.
Deviers-Joncour wrote that Dumas once asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you doubt that I will always be here for you?'' she said
she replied.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After a warning from the United States that a
military strike on Baghdad may be imminent, the United Nations
abruptly evacuated more than 230 foreign staff members from Iraq on
Wednesday, including all weapons inspectors. Another 41 people from
various agencies will depart on Thursday, leaving only essential
officials behind.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, angry that there had been no consultation with all
Security Council members before a decision was made to withdraw the
arms inspectors, called a meeting of the council to demand an
explanation from the chief inspector, Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan _ who went to Baghdad in February
and persuaded Iraq to back down in the face of an earlier American
threat _ said in Morocco Wednesday that he was cutting short a
North African trip to return to New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan has no plans to go to Baghdad or meet Iraqi officials
here, his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said. In Marrakesh, the
secretary-general said that he was ``saddened and burdened by
Iraq's decisions not to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said that for now Annan's role would be ``to monitor the
Security Council's deliberations, to confer with members of the
council and basically to stay on top of what is developing as a
crisis situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan discussed the Iraqi crisis with a high-level Clinton
administration official within the last 24 hours, his spokesman
said. But the secretary-general has not been in direct contact with
President Saddam Hussein, who agreed after meeting with Annan in
February to give full access to inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, is staying in
Baghdad. He was told again Wednesday by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz that the Iraqis would cooperate only when the Security Council
acts to lift sanctions. The council is now unified in responding
that this cannot happen until unfettered inspections resume.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who is leaving behind a skeletal Iraqi staff, said he
was confident that the equipment and documents that the inspectors
left behind were safe. The monitoring center, on the edge of
Baghdad, is lightly guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency were also
withdrawn, leaving the Baghdad monitoring center ``dead,'' an
official said here Wednesday. The arms inspectors _ 92 from Unscom
and 11 from the IAEA _ flew to Bahrain Wednesday morning on a
U.N.-chartered C-130 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq had tried to drive a wedge between the IAEA, which follows
nuclear developments, and Unscom, which looks for biological,
chemical and prohibited missile activity. Wednesday, the United
Nations also withdrew from Iraq 130 staff members from agencies
like Unicef, the World Health Organization, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Food Program, as well as the staff of the
``oil for food'' office.
</P>
<P>
   Benon Sevan, the New York-based director of the Iraq oil for
food program, said in a statement that in the Kurdish areas of
northern Iraq, the 231 foreign staff, which actually distributes
goods, will remain in place, Sevan said.

ALLEGED LEADER OF FATAL ATTACK AGAINST BLACK MAN PROCLAIMS HIS
INNOCENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rambling, convoluted letter written from his Livingston,
Texas, prison cell and sent to a newspaper, the alleged leader of a
fatal attack against a black man in Jasper, Texas, has proclaimed
his innocence and blamed one of his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   John William ``Bill'' King, one of three white men charged with
capital murder in the June dragging and decapitation death of James
Byrd Jr., claimed in a seven-page letter to the Dallas Morning News
that the crime grew out of a dispute over the sale of steroids. He
said it was not racially motivated, as authorities allege.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, contended in the letter that he was an uninvolved
witness to the killing by his co-defendant Shawn Berry, 23, whom he
described as an abuser of steroids with an ``irate temper.'' Byrd,
King wrote, was Berry's source for the body-building drugs, the use
of which can lead to erratic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities dismissed King's letter as a transparent attempt to
point the finger at someone other than himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is common. It's not unusual at all,'' said Jasper County
District Attorney Guy James Gray. ``We have already looked into the
things set out in that letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Paul Brister said
authorities found no evidence that steroid sale or use was
connected to the killing.
</P>
<P>
   King's attorney, C. Haden Cribbs of Beaumont, said his client's
letter to the newspaper was written against his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's a prolific writer,'' Cribbs said Wednesday. ``I
haven't seen this letter ... but I have a standing policy of
telling clients not to make comments that can come back on them.''
</P>
<P>
   King's father, Ronald King of Jasper, typed the statement for
his son and released it to the newspaper at his son's request. It
is the defendant's first public comment since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, which quoted Mark Twain and Garrison Keillor,
Bill King conceded that he and the third suspect, Russell Brewer,
had accompanied Berry on a nightlong cruise through the Jasper
area.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, King said, had used a chain to pull down roadside
mailboxes. As Berry became increasingly intoxicated and
belligerent, King said, he and Brewer asked to be taken home.
</P>
<P>
   Berry then stopped to offer a ride to Byrd, 49, because he
wanted to discuss ``business'' with the Jasper man, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities later found Byrd's battered and decapitated body at
the end of a three-mile-long trail of blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make anything of it (King's letter),'' said Berry's
attorney, Lum Hawthorn of Beaumont, Texas. ``Our position is, as it
always has been, that Mr. Byrd was beaten and dragged by King and
Mr. Brewer. My client was present when that occurred and tried to
stop it. He did not participate in it to any degree. That's the
only comment we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie Marcontell, Berry's girlfriend of four years, dismissed
King's letter as ``a bunch of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   And James Byrd Sr., father of the slain man, denied that his son
had any connection with steroids or other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Dallas newspaper, King also suggested that
the apparent Nazi- and Ku Klux Klan-related tattoos on his body
were misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   King denied that he and Brewer were members of any ``confirmed
hate group,'' but ended his letter, which was titled ``Logical
Reasoning,'' by noting, ``I, John W. King, remain White and
Proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Byrd's killing, relatives of Berry reported that
King previously had written vitriolic, racist letters while in
prison for violation of parole on a burglary charge. (King and
Berry served time for the same burglary.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just unbelievable _ all about being racist, about
hating black people,'' said a woman, who asked for anonymity. ``
`Hail to the Brotherhood,' and all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the letters, written to a teen-age girl, were so
frightening that the teen's parents asked prison authorities to
intercede to stop the letters, the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were crazy letters,'' the woman said. ``It really scared
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman said King long was known for making racial jokes,
though he never, to her knowledge, acted on his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has always done the racial thing,'' she said, ``but we
didn't believe he felt it in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers confirmed Wednesday that the defendants will
be tried separately. King's trial will be held in February,
Brewer's in March and Berry's late next year. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What exactly is Scottish comedian Billy Connolly doing
in biblical robes and beard in a commercial with floating goldfish
that fill the television screen?
</P>
<P>
   Improbably, the answer lies in a remarkable U.S. invasion of the
credit card industry in Britain that has left big British credit
card issuers smarting.
</P>
<P>
   For the goldfish represent the Goldfish card, which has gained
800,000 customers since it was first issued in 1996 by a British
subsidiary of Household International Inc. of Prospect Heights,
Ill., in conjunction with a British gas utility.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, Household and other U.S. companies _
including American Express; MBNA of Wilmington, Del.; People's Bank
of Bridgeport, Conn.; and Capital One Financial of Falls Church,
Va. _ have captured 10.2 percent of the cards issued in a $136.7
billion market that was once controlled exclusively by four big
British banks led by Barclays PLC with its Barclaycard.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have shaken up the industry with innovative
marketing and by offering interest rates that are lower than the
average rates of 22 and 23 percent charged by British issuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a battleground,'' acknowledged John Eaton, the managing
director of Barclaycard. The company is still the dominant issuer
of cards in Britain, but its share of the market there has fallen
to 31 percent last year from 37.1 percent in 1995, and the number
of different cards available in Britain has grown to 1,200, from 40
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough, competitive market,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. companies see further gains ahead. The credit card
business in Britain is similar to the way the U.S. market was in
the 1980s, said Patrick Nelson, corporate communications manager
for Capital One.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the U.S. market in 1986, and look at it
now, you will find only three or four of the big players in '86 are
still there,'' he said. ``And there is that same potential here in
the United Kingdom. U.K. High Street banks have been charging far
too much for far too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. beachhead in Britain could serve as a springboard into
a much bigger and largely untapped market: Continental Europe. The
Continent has outstanding Visa and Mastercard debt estimated at $49
billion _ much less than the $397 billion in Visa and Mastercard
debt in the United States. Credit cards have failed to win mass
acceptance in much of Europe, where big banks dominate with debit
cards and personal checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for any new competitors in Europe, then, is
essentially to create a bigger market, bankers say. And that has
happened in large part in Britain, where a boom in the overall use
of credit cards has cushioned big banks from the effects of their
eroding market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit card cake has been growing all the time,'' said
David Joy, an economist with the Credit Card Research Group, an
industry organization. ``So while people like Barclaycard have been
losing market share, they have not been losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   The total amount of debt outstanding on credit cards in Britain,
mostly Visa and Mastercard, now stands at 21.8 billion pounds, or
$36.2 billion, up 23 percent from 17.7 billion pounds ($29.4
billion) a year ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Eaton of Barclaycard says figures showing simple market
share are misleading. Over the last 18 months, he said, 4 million
new credit cards have flooded onto the British market, but many of
them have been issued to people who already held a card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, about 20 percent of card holders had more
than one card,'' he said. ``Now it's 40 percent.'' Moreover,
although credit card use has nearly doubled as a proportion of
British retail sales to 20 percent _ of which Barclaycard claims 50
percent _ from 12 percent in 1990, the numbers show that many
people still rely on cash, debit cards or checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is now very much about share of wallet: how do
you sustain your share of wallet?'' Eaton said. ``The most powerful
indicator is the share of turnover in the total market. How much of
customers' spending am I getting on a monthly, weekly basis?''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, some U.S. financial companies
reached for the British wallet by taking aim where they thought
British issuers were most vulnerable: interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single largest comment is: give me a low rate and no
annual fee,'' said Carlos Mello, managing director of People's
Bank, which introduced its card in Britain in 1996. The bank, with
a modest British operation of 55 full-time workers, has so far
issued 120,000 cards, with an introductory rate of 6.9 percent that
later rises to 17.9 percent, according to the Nilson Report, a
credit card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies are also introducing unfamiliar marketing
strategies to Britain. Capital One, for exampled, offered an
introductory 6.9 percent interest rate on a Mastercard coupled with
an offer for tickets to last summer's World Cup soccer tournament.
Other special themes include a card offering discounts at specific
London stores and a personalized Mastercard sporting the card
holder's photograph.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers a set interest rate of 12.9 percent for customers
who are confused by the idea of cards that offer an introductory
rate that later rises. Capital One issued 630,000 cards by the end
of 1997, a year after its introduction, according to the Nilson
Report.
</P>
<P>
   A Household International subsidiary, HFC Bank PLC, which has
been in Britain since 1973, introduced a credit card linked to
reduced prices on General Motors' Vauxhall cars. The program was a
British version of the GM Card in the United States. Then Household
hit on the idea of using a goldfish as its emblem, and charging
19.8 percent interest but offering a 1 percent reduction on a gas
utility's bills. ``Everyone has a gas bill to pay,'' said Mark
Rutland, director of corporate communications for HFC Bank.

 LONDON: HFC Bank.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a growing share of the market, U.S. companies are
expanding. Capital One, for example, is planning to invest $50
million in a new processing plant in Nottingham, in the Midlands.
</P>
<P>
   Plans like this show just how much the U.S. presence has
mushroomed. Starting from scratch in 1994, Household, through its
British subsidiaries, last year ranked as the biggest U.S. credit
card issuer _ and the fifth over all _ in Britain, with 2.1 million
cards issued. That represents just 4.2 percent of the market but is
nearly a threefold increase from 1995, according to the Nilson
Report. A close second, MBNA had 1.9 million cards issued in 1997 _
more than double the number in 1995. Counted by cards issued, U.S.
issuers over all hold 10.2 percent of the British market.
</P>
<P>
   Barclaycard has responded swiftly to the U.S. challenge to its
dominance. The company, which has some 6.5 million customers
holding 15.3 million cards, announced last summer that it would
shed 1,100 jobs _ a quarter of its work force _ over the next three
years. It also plans to invest around $50 million in new systems
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   And it has sought to counter the low-interest-rate invaders,
Eaton said, by offering to cut its own rate to 18.9 percent from
22.9 percent for people charging more than $825 a month _
considerably higher than the British average. It has also
instituted loyalty programs offering discounts on Ford cars and
Cellnet mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. insurgents are not the only challenge.
Supermarket chains like Tesco and J. Sainsbury have also issued
their own credit cards, along with the many building societies _
the British equivalent of savings and loans _ that have converted
into banks. There also is an array of affinity cards linking credit
to particular interests and brands.
</P>
<P>
   The contest may be about to get even sharper. An anticipated
slowdown in the British economy next year has already doubled the
number of credit card accounts in arrears compared with last year,
according to figures from the Equifax financial information group,
suggesting that both the newcomers and the veterans of the credit
card industry will be scrambling to maintain growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a tougher assignment next year,'' Rutland of HFC Bank
said. His concerns reflect broader worries in Britain about a
possible consumer credit crunch if the economy slows _ or even
slides into recession as it did in the early 1990s, exacerbated by
a sharp increase in consumer debt. ``It will be interesting to see
if other U.S. competitors are here for the long haul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Barclaycard is being challenged at home, it is among the
pioneers in Continental Europe. Along with Citigroup's Citibank
unit, which has an estimated 1.34 million cards in European
countries, Barclaycard has sought to penetrate the new European
markets, with 600,000 cards, for instance, issued in Germany alone.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, competition is beginning. Though some U.S. banks
active in Britain say they have no immediate plan to test the
broader European market, American Express has introduced in Italy
and Germany, as well as in Britain, a new blue card that, like its
better-known green, gold and platinum cards, charges an annual fee,
but unlike the others also offers revolving credit.
</P>
<P>
   The blue card, said Peter Godfrey, American Express regional
president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, is aiming at
customers in their early 20s to mid-30s in nine countries from
Australia to Canada, but not in the United States. The card has
plunged into the market with a lower introductory rate, 1 percent
standard discounts on purchases and _ for November _ a 5 percent,
cash-back discount.
</P>
<P>
   While Godfrey declined to give figures, he said the number of
initial customers was ``substantially above our internal
forecast.''
</P>
<P>
   With 11 European countries set to introduce a common currency,
the euro, in January 1999, the European market clearly offers new
opportunities for credit card holders. Initially, the euro will be
limited to electronic trading of all kinds from intergovernment
transfers to stock markets. Cash and notes will become mandatory
only in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But exchange rates between member countries will be fixed from
the beginning of 1999, meaning that credit cards could offer
travelers a way of eliminating currency exchange costs if they,
say, pay a hotel bill in Milan in euro-linked lire, and pay their
credit card bill in euro-linked marks. The problem is that
relatively few Continental Europeans use credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are dealing with a debit card, overdraft mentality in
Continental Europe, and it's difficult to break these markets,''
Godfrey said. ``The key thing for us is to create that market. It
is worth the effort to create a credit card environment in
Europe.''

   BOMBAY, India, _ The man this city's top crime fighters call a
mafia chieftain and a cold-blooded killer was decorously receiving
supplicants at his tenement headquarters here one recent afternoon.
Each of them reverently touched his feet before addressing him.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Gawali, self-consciously costumed in the homespun cotton
that was the trademark of India's great pacifist, Mohandas K.
Gandhi, admitted in an interview to a criminal past he says he now
deplores, but denied any part in the audacious blazes of gunfire
that have rat-a-tat-tatted a message of fear across this city of
more than 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This part of my life I have dedicated to God,'' he said
solemnly, ``and to my guru, Brahama Devi Prajapita.''
</P>
<P>
   But police say this sinner's declared reformation is a hoax.
Though he has been often accused, but never been convicted of a
crime, they say Gawali is one of the gangsters responsible for a
recent spate of violence and a mounting furor over what is widely
seen as a breakdown of law and order in India's financial capital,
a place where lots of people are making piles of money that
criminal gangs covet.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a dozen bloody shootouts here in just the past
five weeks, 81 so far this year, leaving 88 people dead. One of the
most sensational took place directly across the street from police
headquarters in broad daylight. Days after that attack, young men
roared up to a cafe on motorcycles and shot the owners dead at the
cash counter in front of terrified customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, gunmen sprayed bullets at a real-estate agent reading
his newspaper on a crowded train platform and hit two bystanders as
well. The next day, the pool of blood remained, an object of horror
and curiosity to commuters.
</P>
<P>
   The victims have included businessmen who refused to submit to
extortion, as well as some who were involved with the mafia, police
say.
</P>
<P>
   The impunity with which big-time gangsters seem to operate in
Bombay has fed corrosive public suspicions, common across India,
that politicians protect criminals in exchange for a steady flow of
illegal money to pay for their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For months, moviegoers have packed the cavernous Eros Theater
downtown to watch the film, ``Satya,'' a gritty saga of crime,
political corruption and betrayal in Bombay. One recent night, the
audience howled at the vulgar jokes of the gangsters, but left the
theater grim-faced after the police commissioner, the crooked
politician and all the main gangsters were murdered.
</P>
<P>
   To many in the audience, it seemed that real life was right up
there on the movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of the city's businessmen is palpable. In one of
Bombay's poshest financial districts, a rich builder and hotelier
described the work of the extortionists. His sister had applied for
a bank loan, he said, and soon got a call from a thug who told her
that if her balance sheet was so good she had better give him
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone at the bank had leaked her financial statement,'' her
brother said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``I've also
received threats. I don't want to get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the city's wealthiest magnates who are
targets. Increasingly, its run-of-the-mill merchants are getting
squeezed, too. Police and business leaders speculate that an
economic recession in Bombay and plummeting real estate values here
have reduced the money available from the biggest businessmen,
forcing gangsters to turn to smaller prey.
</P>
<P>
   A jeweler in the city's teeming wholesale bazaar in South Bombay
said his brother-in-law, also a jewelry shop owner, said he got a
telephone call recently. ``Give us 11 lakh rupees'' _ $26,442 _
``or we will kill you,'' the caller demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so terrified that he shut down his shop and he's gone
into hiding,'' the jeweler said, adding that he was too frightened
to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading threats and the killings of several prominent
businessmen have galvanized the city's business community to lobby
for action. The man gunned down last month across from the police
station, after all, was the son of Raichand Shah, a department
store owner and president of the Federation of Retail Trade
Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said he believes his eldest son, Bharat, 39, was killed
because he had encouraged other businessmen to seek police
protection rather than pay extortion. The father said he has been
threatened since his son's murder, adding that a caller had told
him, ``Don't talk about us or your fate will be like your son's and
your other children will be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Shah case, Mohan Gurnani, president of the Federation
of Associations of Maharashtra, an umbrella group of business
organizations, said he has informed state and city officials that
if crime is not under control by December, his members will stop
paying their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't protect our lives and property, why should we pay
you taxes?'' he told the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The city's top elected officials are promising a tough
crackdown. And the police are feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   D. Sivanandhan, the joint commissioner of police for crime, is
working nights and weekends to battle the gangsters. Last week, the
jaunty, mustachioed officer strode down the palm-shaded veranda of
the colonial-era police headquarters and into his office, where he
sketched out the Sisyphean task his officers face _ one he is
convinced will require that victims summon up the courage to resist
the demands of extortionists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More than half the city's residents live in slums, creating an
ever ready army of alienated, unemployed young men for the
gangsters' ends. Most of his frontline officers themselves earn a
pittance of $65 a month, a situation that he acknowledged makes
them tempting targets for bribes.
</P>
<P>
   His officers are also demoralized by a judicial inquiry report
released in September that accused the police of claiming self
defense in cases in which it appeared they had summarily executed
gangsters. ``We've arrested hundreds of gangsters,'' the police
commissioner said. ``We haven't killed all of them. The human
rights people should look at such cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when his officers do arrest the goondas _ as gangsters
here are often called _ it is very difficult to convict them, he
said. ``The mafia can scare the wits out of witnesses,'' he said.
``We have no witness protection program like the United States.
It's unaffordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sivanandhan regards Gawali, the purportedly reformed criminal
who now presents himself as a man of peace, as one of the criminals
who has gotten away with murder. Gawali was recently released from
jail after being held for a year under a state law that allows the
detention of suspected criminals for that period of time, police
officials say. He had earlier been held for six years in jail on
various charges including murder and extortion, police officials
say, but has so far always been acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cold-blooded killer,'' the police commissioner said.
``But he's donning a new role. Overnight, he wants to become a
political leader and a philanthropist. But his money is
extortionist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no proof,'' retorted Gawali from his headquarters in a
millworkers' tenement.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the lowly vegetable sellers' caste and son of a
milkman, Gawali, 48, says he is a changed man. It was the
politicians who made him a criminal, he said. ``I used to provide
them with muscle power.'' But he said he has since fallen out with
his former political patrons and is now active in a new political
party. A thin, intense man in wire-rimmed spectacles, Gawali looks
more like an intellectual than a gangster.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke proudly of his offer to give any widow of a slain
policeman 100,000 rupees, about $2,400 _ an offer that has outraged
the police brass who see it as a brazen attempt by the wolf to pose
as a lamb.
</P>
<P>
   But Gawali insists he is just trying to be a good citizen. Three
women have accepted so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began shaking hands with a long line of waiting
visitors who know him by the pet name, ``Daddy,'' Gawali described
himself as man in the process of becoming a political leader. A
portrait of Gandhi chatting with Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first
prime minister, hung just over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rebel,'' Gawli said. ``And if you are a rebel, one way
leads to politics and the other to jail. In jail, they call you a
goonda. In politics, they call you a minister.''

NISSAN SEEKING LOAN FROM DEVELOPMENT BANK TO WRITE OFF
HIGH-INTEREST DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's ailing No. 2 automaker, is
negotiating with the Japan Development Bank for a loan to help it
write off some of its high-interest debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyodo news service reported that the government-backed bank
would lend Nissan _ which has had difficulty raising money from
private lenders in the midst of a severe credit squeeze here _ 100
billion yen, or $823 million, one of the largest loans ever to a
single company.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan confirmed Wednesday that the bank would lend it money but
said the amount, terms and timing of the loan had not yet been
determined. Analysts said the loan's importance would depend on the
specifics, particularly its size.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts disagreed over what the loan meant in terms of
Nissan's financial health, which has been shaky for the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Some regarded the company's turn to the development bank as a
sign of dire financial straits. ``It's an undeniable fact that the
company is short of cash and wants to do anything to accumulate
it,'' said Koji Endo of Schroders Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is shouldering debt of 4.3 trillion yen, or about $35
billion, and is trying to reorganize amid the worst economic
downturn since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Car sales in Japan fell 14 percent last year and a further 8
percent in the first half of this year, and Nissan announced
Tuesday that it expected to post yet another loss for the full
fiscal year, which ends on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   It has also suffered from bloated inventories in the United
States, some of that caused by supplies of used vehicles turned
onto the market as leases ended. Nissan had provided heavy
incentives for Americans to lease, leading to this year's glut.
</P>
<P>
   It has lost money in six of the last seven years, and Endo
thinks that company debt ratings will fall to junk-bond status by
the end of the year because of the expected loss. ``If that
happens, there will be almost no way they can raise cash,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Usher, an analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities,
cautioned against interpreting the negotiations as a sign of
desperation. ``The situation Nissan is facing at this point would
not necessarily imply a cash squeeze,'' he said. ``There is a
deterioration in its profitability, but virtually all companies
here are having that deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the bulk of the losses announced on Tuesday _ $266
million for the six-month period ending on Sept. 30 _ were related
to securities Nissan holds and were thus largely paper losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a position at this point, given their cash flow, to
meet their requirements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were also puzzled over how the company would get around
laws stipulating that at least 50 percent of loans from the Japan
Development Bank be devoted to specific development projects.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been discussing ways to use the development
bank to ease the credit squeeze, which has resulted in a record
high bankruptcy rate and high borrowing costs for even the biggest
borrowers. But no official plans have been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyodo report said that the government and the ruling party
were considering ways to make the development bank's money
available to companies for financing their operations and redeeming
their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Endo said Nissan's borrowing costs had sharply risen since
August, when Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit ratings,
which now hover one notch above junk-bond status.
</P>
<P>
   Its usual lenders, the Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank,
have problems of their own and can ill afford to extend further
loans to the company _ although they can afford its demise even
less.
</P>
<P>
   The company does have access to a credit line of 500 billion yen
it obtained last month from 10 banks to protect it, should it have
difficulties raising money.
</P>
<P>
   But Nissan's parts suppliers and affiliates are also
experiencing credit constraints and need its help. Usher said the
company had increased its borrowing last year and in the first half
of this year to support its group companies rather than finance its
own operations.

DELAY MAY BE LAST TEXAN STANDING IN THE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Maria Recio 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's just as conservative as departing House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, and he can be just as tough on his
Democratic foes as House Majority Leader Richard Armey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Gingrich is on his way out and Armey is fending off
challengers, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay is the only member of
the House hierarchy headed for unopposed re-election when
Republicans vote for leadership positions Nov. 18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The secret of DeLay's success lies in the very culture of the
House of Representatives. The Republican-controlled House is, in
many ways, like a small town _ albeit one where everyone has a
large ego _ in which residents have day-to-day needs and demands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in the House, as in a town, there is a Man to See: Tom
DeLay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His ability to take care of members has given him such a
formidable power base that many Republicans look to him as a
kingmaker who can tip a race, especially for the majority leader
position held by Armey, a Texan like DeLay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several members credit his quick endorsement of Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., as decisive in locking up the post after
Gingrich announced his resignation. Livingston's only rival, Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., soon quit the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the hotly contested three-way majority leader race,
members want to know: What will DeLay do? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom DeLay is the guy that every leadership candidate wants in
their camp,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., an Armey supporter.
DeLay commands a loyal 66-member whip team, so is the one leader
who could conceivably swing an election. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, 51, is holding back so far on picking a favorite in the
Armey race, and aides say he will stay out of the contest. But just
the fact that he hasn't endorsed his fellow Texan, with whom he has
an uneasy relationship, has blown open the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armey is the front-runner, but he faces challenges from the GOP
right wing _ Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma _ and moderate wing _
Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington state. And at a time when the GOP
has a tenuous majority, some members are agitating for a more
diverse leadership profile as well as a house-cleaning. None of the
three has the 112 votes needed for a majority win on the first
ballot, GOP insiders say, although Armey press secretary Michele
Davis says Armey has ``over 100'' votes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most fascinating is the emergence of Tom DeLay as
perhaps the most powerful person on Capitol Hill,'' said Marshall
Wittman, director of congressional relations at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank. ``He has emerged as
kingmaker.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically, DeLay speaks on behalf of the cultural issues
that some Republicans say dilute the party's emphasis on fiscal
conservatism and tax cuts. And he has been a relentless critic of
President Clinton, calling for his resignation and pressing for
impeachment even as his GOP colleagues worried that attacks on
Clinton turned off voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of House Republicans, DeLay, a 14-year House
veteran, is an exceptional asset. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the chief vote-counter, DeLay is also the chief vote-getter
for tough pieces of legislation, and he has developed an
extraordinary information network to determine what it takes to get
a member's vote, from a project to legislation. As the GOP's hold
on the House has narrowed, he has managed to deliver enough votes
to pass legislation, sometimes by a vote or two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows everyone's quirks and what punches their buttons,''
said Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San Antonio. ``He's extremely
detail-oriented. He knows what everyone's needs are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 66 members of DeLay's intelligence network is
assigned a small group of lawmakers to lobby on key votes. As a
result, his reach extends to every Republican member. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's deputy chief of staff, Tony Rudy, said DeLay fields bids
for everything from pork-barrel projects to a committee assignment
to a game of golf. ``No request is too small and no request is too
big,'' Rudy said. His office even provides meals in the cloakroom
when sessions run late; barbecue is a big favorite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeLay comes by his nickname, ``The Hammer,'' honestly; if
members don't vote with the leadership, they will hear from him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., knows firsthand. When the House voted
Oct. 8 to open an impeachment investigation of President Clinton,
Dickey was the only Republican to vote for the Democratic
alternative. Democrats wanted a limited inquiry that would conclude
by year's end, but Republicans prevailed in an open-ended
investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeLay did not want a single Republican to endorse the White
House-backed plan, and he confronted Dickey on the floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was genuinely upset at first,'' Dickey said. ``He was angry
and said, `You don't know what you're doing.' He was very adamant
that it was a poor political decision.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all his arm-twisting, DeLay remains popular because of his
reputation as a straight shooter. Member after member cites his
candor after an aborted coup attempt against Gingrich in the summer
of 1997. A group of conservatives unhappy with the speaker's
compromises wanted to unseat him and sought the support of the rest
of the leadership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the plot came unglued, DeLay acknowledged his complicity in
a public meeting of all Republicans, but members felt Armey was
less than truthful about his role in the plot. The episode also
eroded the longtime friendship between Armey and DeLay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When the coup occurred, DeLay told the truth. He didn't
varnish it,'' Dickey said. ``It's fared him quite well.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeLay also became better known nationally after last summer's
Capitol Hill shooting, which left two police officers dead,
including one in the whip's suite. The Texan's eulogy and show of
support for the families enhanced his standing, congressional aides
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As restive House members challenge the leadership Nov. 18,
DeLay's skills at the inside game could mean that he will be the
last Texan standing. &QL;

WE CAN LIVE WITH HIGHER SPEED LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The nanny state and its advocates were dealt a big
setback recently, but many Americans may have missed this
development because of lack of media interest.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because it was one of those good-news stories that
deserved a lot more attention than it received. In case you haven't
heard, the death rate on America's roadways fell to a record low
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rate was 1.6 deaths per 100 million miles, which was the
lowest since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
began keeping records 30 years ago. The National Safety Council
also has reported that last year's 16.1 traffic fatalities per
100,000 people was the third straight annual decline and tied a
record set in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all this particularly remarkable is how the
improvement followed dire predictions three years ago that
eliminating federally mandated speed limits would be a national
disaster. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration went
so far as to predict 6,400 additional road deaths a year if a 65
mph speed limit became the national norm.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress repealed the national speed-limit law in '95,
however, the roads have become safer rather than more dangerous
despite a trend toward higher speed limits. Last year's actual
death toll of 41,967 was slightly lower than the previous year's
and slightly higher than 1995's.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth noting that the declining roadway death rate
occurred when the economy was growing, which usually boosts highway
deaths because good times equate with increased driving.
</P>
<P>
   All of which would seem sweet vindication for those who not only
have contended all along that the speed-kills theory was flawed,
but also offered strong support for their case. The opposition
never got much respect, though, because of the superior persuasive
powers of the nanny-state lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Even, for instance, as federal safety officials were predicting
more carnage from higher speed limits, there were reputable studies
indicating otherwise. Moreover, practical anecdotal evidence from
driving experience on Germany's autobahn showed it to be
statistically safer than U.S. roads even though it has no posted
speed limits and denser traffic than America's highways.
</P>
<P>
   Artificially low speed limits, however, were symbolic of the
nanny-state mind-set. The feds first imposed 55 mph limits in the
early '70s as a gasoline conservation measure. When the petroleum
problem was revealed to be a creature of ill-advised government
regulation, those loath to see government lose control over drivers
shifted the focus from conservation to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The economic burden it created in lost time and money for the
surface transportation industry is incalculable. The reciprocal,
the cynics noticed, was that this government intrusion into the
nation's driving life created some interesting economic
beneficiaries who got on the speed-kills bandwagon. Insurance
companies and local governments, for example, were said to favor
low speed limits because speeding tickets boosted both auto
insurance premium income and municipal revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst result was a growing contempt for the law as
most drivers ignored posted speed limits and drove at what they
considered prudent speeds, which is what students of driving
behavior said was always the case anyway.

AFTER 80 YEARS, FRANCE PAYING TRIBUTE TO WORLD WAR I VETERAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PENN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ McKinley Wooden, at age 103, was to be
decorated for military service.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the 80th anniversary of Armistice Day, he was to
receive the Legion of Honor, France's highest medal. French
officials were to be in Kansas City to present the award to Wooden
during Veterans Day ceremonies at Liberty Memorial, the monument
dedicated to soldiers who fought in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the only recognition the Lee's Summit, Mo., resident is
getting this week. Sunday night, the former chief mechanic of
Battery D _ the World War I artillery unit commanded by Harry S.
Truman _ was featured in a History Channel documentary exploring
the struggles of American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac instituted the campaign to honor
surviving members of the U.S. armed forces who fought on French
soil during World War I. An estimated 3,200 American veterans of
World War I are still alive; half are believed to have served in
France.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden was to accept the honor on behalf of his entire unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be the only one around here to have it,'' Wooden said
recently. ``It's going to be a big deal. There were 210 of us
altogether. But they're all gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden's memories of the war are as crystal clear as they were
80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it all,'' Wooden said. ``Nobody here's got anything on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden joined the service in 1917, becoming a member of D
Battery of the 129th Field Artillery under Truman.
</P>
<P>
   He can recall the day Truman took over the company _ July 18,
1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a pretty tough outfit,'' Wooden said. ``We had gotten
rid of three captains.''
</P>
<P>
   He still vividly recalls the first time Truman addressed his
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truman says, `I didn't come over here to get along with you
fellas. You're going to get along with me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days after that, Wooden said, Truman made him his
chief mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Thank you sir, I'll do my best,' '' Wooden recalled.
``I was the only soldier in the company he addressed by my first
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden's job: Care for the battery's four French 75mm 1897-model
field guns.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden's outfit saw plenty of action. It participated in the
battles of St.-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne. His recollection of
those battles is pristine.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, that was the biggest artillery battle the world
had ever seen,'' Wooden said of the battle at Meuse-Argonne. ``It
just seemed like the sky was afire. The next morning we started
forward. We didn't run into any opposition. We had shot everything
all to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden remembers Nov. 11, 1918, when the war was declared over.
He also remembers the day he returned to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got off the boat Easter Sunday in New York in 1919,'' Wooden
said. ``They mayor had a welcoming committee, a boat, band, colors
and lots of pretty girls. But what impressed me was the Statue of
Liberty. I had read so much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden will be decorated by the deputy consul general of France,
Jean-Pierre Tutun.
</P>
<P>
   Two other World War I Army veterans _ Urban Schick, 102, and
Elmer Rash, 100, both from Kansas City _ will also be at the event.
Because their paperwork hasn't gone through, they will not be
presented with the Legion of Honor at this time.
</P>
<P>
   For Wooden, receiving the honor is just one more highlight in a
life full of memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen four presidents,'' Wooden said. ``I've shaken hands
with two of them. I've sat at the dinner table with Margaret
Thatcher,'' all due to his status as a World War I veteran. ``Yes,
I guess you could say, I've seen it all.''

LATE DOSES OF AZT SHOWN TO BLOCK AIDS IN INFANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antiviral drugs can sharply reduce mother-to-infant transmission
of the AIDS virus even when treatment is delayed until childbirth
or shortly afterward, scientists say in a report that is good news
for developing countries hard hit by the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, it was shown that treatment with the antiviral drug
AZT during the last weeks of pregnancy could sharply lessen the
chances that an HIV-positive woman would transmit the virus to her
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   This is because over half of newborns who carry the HIV virus
are infected only very late _ around the time of childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   However, infected women often don't come for prenatal care, so
they're not diagnosed and treatment isn't begun until they are in
labor. And, in developing countries, the high cost of AZT and
similar drugs makes it impossible to treat women for as long as
previous studies had indicated would be effective. In one study,
women received AZT for 14 weeks; in a more recent study in
Thailand, when mothers took the drug for an average of 25 days
through delivery, it worked almost as well.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't known, however, was whether treatment of the mother
or the infant would be effective if the drug was started after the
infant had become exposed to HIV during labor or delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In the current New England Journal of Medicine, scientists from
New York state report on the outcomes of treatment in infected
women who got no prenatal care or came to the clinic late in their
pregnancy. Data were compiled on 939 infants exposed to HIV in
1995, 1996, and early 1997 at hospitals in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   When treatment was begun during pregnancy, only 6.1 percent of
newborns contracted the virus, report Dr. Nancy A. Wade and
colleagues from the New York State Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   That infection rate rose to 10 percent when treatment did not
begin, because the mother had not sought medical care or had not
been tested for HIV, until she was in labor, said the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, when the at-risk babies didn't get treatment until
after they were born _ but treatment started within 48 hours of
birth _ the rate was still only 9.3 percent. (Treatment begun on
the third day of life or later was much less successful, resulting
in a more than 18 percent infection rate.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The new, although not entirely unexpected, finding was that
even when treatment began during labor, transmission of HIV was
often prevented,'' wrote Dr. Kenneth McIntosh, head of infectious
diseases at Children's Hospital in Boston, in an editorial
accompanying today's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was more surprising, however, was that the infection rate
was significantly lower when the mothers received no prophylaxis at
all and postexposure zidovudine (AZT) was administered only to the
infants, beginning within 48 hours after birth.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh added in the editorial that the findings should prompt
more questions ``about inexpensive preventive regimens that may be
suitable for use in many parts of the world where the prevalence of
HIV infection is high and resources are severely limited.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, births of HIV-positive infants have
dropped sharply over the past several years in the wake of
recommendations for counseling and testing pregnant women for HIV
and treating them and their infants with AZT. By late 1997, the
number of infants infected with HIV had dropped to about 500 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deborah Cotton, assistant provost for clinical research at
Boston University Hospital and a national expert on HIV in women,
commented: ``This study adds to our growing awareness that we could
end this epidemic (of HIV-positive infants) virtually overnight
with the use of routine HIV testing and antiviral therapy.''

MEDIATION BOARD SETS DEC. 1 DATE FOR TWA, MACHINISTS TO RESUME
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Trans World Airlines and the Machinists union
will resume negotiations with a federal mediator Dec. 1 in an
effort to reach a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board has scheduled intensive bargaining
sessions for the first 11 days of December, TWA and union officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If little or no progress is made, union officers said, the
federal agency will consider allowing a 30-day ``cooling off''
period to begin, after which the union would be free to strike or
take other job actions.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has 22,000 employees systemwide, about 16,200 of whom are
represented by the Machinists union, according to TWA spokesman Jim
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has about 2,200 union employees in Kansas City at its
overhaul base.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's Machinists _ a group that includes mechanics, passenger
service employees and flight attendants _ have been working under
their old contract, which was to have expired Aug. 31, 1997. Talks
have produced little progress on such issues as wages, outsourcing
and the future of certain facilities, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the company, we're thrilled that the IAM says
they're ready to negotiate,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also were pleased with the National Mediation
Board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sign that we're coming to the conclusion of all of
this,'' said Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650 in
Kansas City. ``It's a step that needed to come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that, excluding union concessions made during TWA's
two bankruptcy reorganizations, he could recall only one instance
in which the Machinists reached a new contract with TWA without
resorting to the 30-day countdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be wonderful if we could reach an agreement during the
so-called `supermediation' period,'' he said. ``But the company has
yet to offer an acceptable economic package.'' He also said the
company had refused to sign a protective covenant for its
facilities to ensure continuing operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous contract, TWA agreed to keep the huge overhaul
base in Kansas City as long as the airline continued to operate. In
recent years, TWA's work force at the base has shrunk as the
carrier modernized its fleet and basically quit doing work for
other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has said its maintenance operations are too big for the
airline's size. No decisions have been made, however, regarding the
future of any of TWA's maintenance facilities, the airline has
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wages also remain a sticking point. TWA employees have been paid
less than the industry average for years during the airline's
financial difficulties. The Machinists union is seeking a wage
package that would bring its employees back to industry standard.

ESKRIDGE NEW CEO AT STRIDE RITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending a six-month search, Stride Rite Corp. Wednesday announced
it has chosen James A. Eskridge, formerly of Mattel Inc. and
Fisher-Price, as its new chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. shoe company markets active footwear for
children and adults and owns several brand names, including Keds,
Sperry Top-Sider, and Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge, 55, held various positions at Mattel, including
president and CEO of its Fisher-Price division, and was also
Mattel's executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Before Mattel, he was an executive with General Mills Inc., and
General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Bob Siegel, 62, Stride Rite's retiring chairman and
CEO, who is relocating to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership style and his ability to leverage this company
in some growth activities is very positive because he has a lot of
experience,'' Siegel said. ``He is a very strong leader to bring
in.''
</P>
<P>
   In recruiting Eskridge, Stride Rite bypassed a leading in-house
candidate: Diane Sullivan, who runs the company's licensed brands
division.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge will be assuming the helm of Stride Rite as the company
continues to attempt a rebound after sales slipped in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals here is to have consistent and predictable
sales and earnings growth,'' Eskridge said. ``A good third leg to
that stool will be an acquisition, but it will have to be a good
strong acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a difficult year at Stride Rite.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial comeback of one the company's premier products _
Keds _ pushed third quarter sales up 17 percent from the previous
year to $168.5 million but was not enough to keep Stride Rite's
stock from losing much of its value on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Stride Rite stock closed at $10 a share, down 1/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the company announced it would stop marketing a
footwear line made under a licensing agreement with Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., and take a fourth-quarter charge of $3.2 million after the
footwear line did not meet initial sales expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company earned $19.8 million on sales of $515.7
million; now analysts say Eskridge needs to shift Stride Rite's
focus to leveraging its balance sheet, a strategy likely to include
new acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Ritcher, an analyst for Tucker Anthony who has followed
Stride Rite closely, said Eskridge's hiring should help the
company's transition into a period of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a strong addition to the management team,''
Ritcher said. ``He brings in a big corporate background along with
the financial perspective.''

PAYLESS CASHWAYS STOCK PRICE, TRADING VOLUME SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Payless Cashways Inc.'s stock went wild
Tuesday, closing at almost double its Monday price while trading at
more than four times its average volume of the last 10 trading
days.
</P>
<P>
   Payless Cashways stock closed at 1 9//16, compared with its
close Monday of 13//16. That, coupled with its frenzied trading
volume, made for an interesting day for those who follow the
troubled home-improvement retailer, including investment adviser
Jerry Duggan.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wondered whether the stock wasn't being driven by
buyout rumors.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of fairly low volatility in the market as a whole, he
said, Payless Cashways' volume of 736,100 shares _ 19 times
Monday's volume _ was remarkable. Its volume Tuesday was far higher
than that of Sprint Corp., for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume drives price...and clearly, the buyer or handful of
buyers who drove this thing to close to (almost) a buck and
three-quarters thought they knew something, and that something they
think they knew had to do with an acquisition,'' Duggan said.
``These things don't happen by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, acquisition rumors have long swirled about Payless
Cashways, which is based in Kansas City. The speculation started
before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1997. It
continued through the reorganization and persists today, almost a
year after Payless Cashways emerged from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Management declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't control the stock price and we don't comment on it,
and we don't comment on rumors and speculation, and that's where we
are,'' said company spokeswoman Linda Ward.
</P>
<P>
   But one company that has popped up continually is Leonard Green
&AMP; Partners, a Los Angeles investment firm that last year put
together two troubled home-improvement retailers, Hechinger and
Builders Square.
</P>
<P>
   After buying those two companies, Green's firm put Mark
Schwartz, a former retailing executive from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
in charge of turning around the company. Millard Barron, the chief
executive officer of Payless Cashways, is also a former retailing
executive with Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hechinger is privately owned, there's no word yet on how
Schwartz is doing. But in a recent interview with The Washington
Post, he said the word was great.
</P>
<P>
   Calls on Tuesday to Green and Schwartz weren't returned.
</P>
<P>
   The lone equity analyst who follows Payless Cashways said
Tuesday that he hadn't heard anything about the Leonard Green
rumors other than from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it looks like someone has figured out there is some
value there,'' said Deepac Raja of Wiley Bros.-Aintree Capital in
Nashville, Tenn. ``We're happy to see same-store sales turning
around, and we see some optimism about next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Payless Cashways still is reporting negative same-store
sales _ sales at stores open at least one year _ the numbers are
narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Raja said that he had a target price for the company but that
his firm was keeping the price private.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he expected the company to make more moves to
improve its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect them to close a couple more stores, tighten the
belt, work on margins and continue to focus on the professional
contractor,'' Raja said. ``It looks as if they're heading in the
right direction, and I think people are seeing that finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought a Payless Cashways//Hechinger
combination made sense, Raja clammed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't talk about it,'' Raja said. ``I'm sorry. I don't
know anything.''

FOR BLAIR'S CABINET, THESE OUTINGS ARE NOT PICNICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Agriculture Minister Nick Brown has always tried to
keep his private life to himself. But when he heard that The News
of the World, a Sunday newspaper specializing in sleazy sex
stories, was about to publish a salacious interview with one of his
former lovers, he took a deep breath and made a dramatic public
confession. Yes, he said on Sunday, I am gay.
</P>
<P>
   Following the recent resignation of a Cabinet minister after an
incident in a well-known gay meeting place, and the ``outing'' of
yet another on television, Brown's admission has become part of one
of the stranger periods of Prime Minister Tony Blair's 18-month-old
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, it has drawn the country into a frenzied
discussion about gays, public life and the role of the
ever-intrusive news media.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals still live fairly uneasily in Britain, where sex
between men became legal only in 1967. The number of openly gay men
and women has increased here strikingly in recent years, but the
country still has no laws specifically banning discrimination
against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government is the first that has been forced to deal
with the issue in this way. In the past, homosexual sex became an
issue in the high reaches of the government mostly in times of
scandal: usually when a married Cabinet member was found to be
leading a double life.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the prime minister already knew that Brown was
gay, and immediately announced that the minister had done nothing
to embarrass anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Brown met with a group of Devon farmers, who walked with him in
a muddy field and said they didn't care whether he was gay or not,
as long as he solved the country's farming crisis. But The Sun,
which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, as is The News of the World, sent
the story soaring out into another dimension altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Us the Truth Tony,'' it wrote across its front page,
raising the McCarthy-esque specter of cadres of secret, high-placed
homosexuals nefariously foisting their own agendas on the country.
``Is Britain being run by a gay Mafia of politicians, lawyers,
palace courtiers and TV bigwigs?''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, which is Britain's most popular daily newspaper and
prides itself on being uniquely in tune with the common man, was
not a lone voice in the wilderness. The Daily Telegraph printed a
letter comparing the ``nauseating lifestyle'' of homosexuals to
``that portrayed in the recent BBC1 program `Wildlife on One,'
showing the activities of the pygmy chimps.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lord Tebbit, a former Tory Cabinet member, told The Times of
London (also owned by Murdoch) that gays should be barred from
certain top-level government jobs so that they would not be ``in a
position to do each other favors.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this stems from a deeply enduring strain of homophobia
in British society, both encouraged by and reflected in its
right-wing newspapers. But those old views seem to be coming up
against a more permissive attitude that has left many Britons
unsure of how to approach the issue of gays in public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crossroads where people are not sure what they
should be doing with the lesbian and gay issue,'' said Mark Watson,
the communications director at Stonewall, an interest group for
gays and lesbians. ``The News of the World and The Sun are
indulging in old-style gay bashing. But society has actually moved
on, and everyone is trying to find out where they should position
themselves on gay rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a poll commissioned by the liberal Guardian found
that 52 percent of those surveyed believed that being gay was
compatible with being in the Cabinet, while 33 percent said it was
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britons have today declared their own verdict which, like the
Americans who voted last week, shows their distaste for those who
would poke and pry into the lives of others,'' wrote the paper in
an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sun's effort yesterday is in the worst tradition of
conspiracy theories through the ages, mixing prejudice with fear to
brand an entire community as outsiders plotting against the rest of
us,'' The Guardian continued. ``Such a tactic has no place in our
national dialogue. The senior staff at the Sun should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the government, Blair has always taken the view that it
doesn't matter if you're gay, as long as you do your job. That is
why he allowed Brown to stay on, but accepted the resignation of
Ron Davies, the married Welsh secretary, who came to him with a
compromising story of being robbed at knifepoint by a group of
people he had met on Clapham Common, one of south London's
better-known gay hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why he isn't bothered by the sexuality of Chris
Smith, his arts secretary, who is openly gay, or of Peter
Mandelson, his trade secretary, who has never publicly discussed
his sexuality but who was identified as being gay on television
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the tabloids' treatment of Brown, who said he found
the whole incident ``enormously embarrassing,'' in part because his
seriously ill elderly mother had not known he was gay, the
government seemed unsure of what to do. John Prescott, the deputy
prime minister, went on television to condemn the way the
newspapers had acted as ``judge, jury and executioner'' in the
Brown case.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair himself, probably not wanting to offend any of the
Murdoch-owned newspapers, whose support he depended on in the last
general election and which collectively command more than half the
newspaper readership in the country, made it clear that the
government would not formally complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Backs the Sun Over Gays!'' proclaimed The Sun cheerily,
printing several photographs of Brown meeting a huge pig and
wearing a regulation blue hairnet while touring a dairy farm (``Gay
minister Nick Brown does his best to keep a straight face
yesterday,'' the caption said).
</P>
<P>
   All this has put the prime minister in a curious position. After
a year and a half in office, he is still seen as personally
unassailable. Without being able to criticize him directly, news
organizations have found a variety of stand-ins from his Cabinet.
That is why it has so delighted in tormenting Mandelson, one of
Blair's most trusted advisers, who is seen by his critics as an
American-style spin doctor, a ``prince of darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a gay columnist for The Times of London announced on
television that Mandelson was gay, too, it was the moment some
papers had been waiting for. The Sun _ which has been particularly
nice to Mandelson lately, because Murdoch is trying to buy one of
Britain's top soccer teams and might need his support _ piously
urged him to reveal all to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like the characters in ``Seinfeld,'' whose protestations that
they are not gay are invariably followed by their assertions that
there is nothing wrong with being gay, The Sun seemed to be trying
to have it both ways, needling Mandelson while proclaiming that he
was a great guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being gay is not wrong, or a source of shame,'' the paper
wrote. ``Indeed, politics has always attracted gays, much as the
theater does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun set up a phone number, urging gay members of Parliament
to call in and confess to being ``part of the gay Mafia.'' But no
one phoned. ``We didn't really think anyone would, did we?'' said a
Sun editor, who would not give her name.

IOWA'S INCOMING GOVERNOR COURTED BY DEMOCRATS EYING 2000 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first person to tell Tom Vilsack that he had
been elected governor of Iowa _ the first Democrat to hold that
office in three decades _ was not his campaign manager, not the
state party chairman, not even his wife, Christie.
</P>
<P>
   It was the vice president of the United States, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the jockeying for the White House has begun in earnest,
Vilsack finds himself sought after by every would-be presidential
contender. He is presiding over the state that traditionally holds
the first presidential caucuses. The last Democrat elected governor
of Iowa was Harold Hughes, who served until January 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the inordinate attention from Gore and a host of others
who want to succeed President Clinton. Wednesday night, Vilsack was
Gore's guest at the vice president's residence for a one-on-one
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Vilsack, a state senator who triumphed over
Jim Ross Lightfoot in an upset, offered a play-by-play account of
how Gore and his potential rivals paid homage election night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore actually told me that I was elected,''
Vilsack told reporters gathered at Democratic Party headquarters.
``I was not watching the results. I was by myself. I was watching
`All the President's Men.' It's a great movie. And I was watching
it and the phone rang. And I picked it up. And they said, `One
minute for the vice president.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president got on and he said, `Congratulations.' And
I said, `for what?' And he said, `You won!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack said the vice president told him that CNN was calling
the election based on exit polls. ``It was sort of shocking because
it was only 10 after nine,'' Vilsack said. ``We had expected to be
there for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who is mulling a run for
president, waited until around midnight for his congratulatory
call, according to Vilsack. He said former Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., called the next morning. He also said he received a call
from Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and has been trading messages
with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., both of whom are also contemplating
presidential runs.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack wasted no time in picking up the mantle from outgoing
Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, in aggressively defending Iowa's
early spot in the political calendar. ``Let me suggest to you that
it is important for the nation,'' he said. ``Iowa is a good
barometer of political candidates: They have to come into our
living rooms. They have to go into the cafes. They have to go into
coffee shops. They have to stand the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gephardt was not as swift as Gore in telephoning Vilsack
last Tuesday night, the House Democratic leader said Wednesday that
he was still seriously weighing whether to run for president. He
sought to dampen speculation that after the Democrats'
better-than-expected gain of five House seats that he would
concentrate on trying to win back the House _ and becoming speaker
_ in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actively looking at the presidential race,'' Gephardt told
reporters at a lunch in perhaps his most explicit remarks thus far
about his intentions. ``I obviously have been through this a number
of times and have made this decision before. So I know the
mechanics of it and what it all entails.'' He said he would have no
trouble raising the millions of dollars necessary to mount a
competitive race.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt insisted that he was not particularly worried about
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is often mentioned as a potent
contender for the Republican nomination. ``Folks like George Bush
give all the Happy Talk,'' he said. ``I don't know how he's going
to deal with the hard right.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he could try to lead House Democrats to victory
and still run for president, Gephardt said he would do one or the
other. ``It's important to make the decision early,'' he said,
explaining that he would decide by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that either goal is a very daunting goal,'' he
said. ``I've always believed in life that you have to set a goal
and then throw yourself completely into winning that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Gephardt is serious about the White House, he has some
catching up to do with Gore in trying to make Vilsack his new best
friend. While the vice president had dinner with the incoming
governor, Gephardt met him Wednesday as well, but only for coffee,
in his Capitol Hill office.

U.N. PANEL TO VISIT CAMBODIA TO STUDY KHMER ROUGE ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three legal experts appointed by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan are scheduled to go to Cambodia to
study documents on Khmer Rouge atrocities and recommend how and
where a tribunal should judge those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' chief human right monitor on Cambodia,
Thomas Hammarberg of Sweden, said at a news conference last week
that the United Nations estimated that about 1.7 million people
died under Khmer Rouge rule between April 1975 and early January
1979. Many were executed by the radical communist movement for
``crimes'' as trivial as wearing eyeglasses; many others died in
forced labor or from dislocation, disease and starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't even been an apology, even by those who have
defected to the government side,'' said Hammarberg, who has served
as the secretary- general's special representative for human rights
in Cambodia since 1996. He added that no contrition had been
expressed by Ieng Sary, one of the highest-ranking Khmer Rouge
leaders still alive, who was given amnesty by the Cambodian
government two years ago and moves freely around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The legal panel, which is going to Cambodia on Saturday,
consists of Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor general of
Australia; Steven Ratner, an American expert on international law
and war crimes from the University of Texas and the Foundation on
Interethnic Relations at The Hague, and Rajsoomer Lallah, a former
chief justice of Mauritius. They are expected to report to Annan by
the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of documentation on what actually happened,''
Hammarberg said. ``Like the Nazis, the Khmer Rouge did take
notes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The panel will consider what international charges might be
applied to the Khmer Rouge. Some scholars question whether genocide
is the correct charge, or whether the broader charge of crimes
against humanity would be more appropriate. The panel will also
recommend whether any tribunal that may be set up should be based
in Cambodia or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hammarberg, all Cambodian political leaders have
said they favor the establishment of a tribunal, including Acting
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was a Khmer Rouge official when the
movement came to power. He was later installed as head of
government when the Vietnamese occupied the country.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Congress, led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif., have passed an unopposed resolution asking that Hun Sen
be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hammarberg said King Sihanouk, who was first a figurehead for
the Khmer Rouge and then their prisoner, was eager for a tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia is now without an elected government. Hun Sen seized
total power in 1997 in a coup that ousted his coalition partner,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Since a disputed July election left him
short of a parliamentary majority, Hun Sen has been unable to
persuade the prince and other opposition leaders to join in forming
a government.
</P>
<P>
   Hammarberg reported to the General Assembly on Friday on human
rights in Cambodia over the last tumultuous year. Despite some
steps by the government to deal with institutional abuses, the
picture was bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem as I see it is the continuous problem of
impunity,'' Hammarberg said. ``Serious crime, often with a
political connotation, including killings, takes place without
anyone being arrested or prosecuted.''

HOUSTON CROWDS CELEBRATE VETERANS DAY APPLAUDING FIGHTING FORCES,
GLENN AND ASTRONAUT CORP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RAD SALLEE 
and STEFANIE ASIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An appreciative crowd lined downtown streets Wednesday
to watch the first Veterans Day parade here in years, applaud
America's fighting forces and astronauts and wave at John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-feet-10 _ one inch under the maximum allowed height for an
original Mercury astronaut _ the 77-year-old Glenn was barely
visible in the plush back seat of an open 1927 Rolls-Royce touring
car he shared with wife Annie and Mayor Lee Brown, who towers by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get a picture at all,'' said Rick Hurt, who had
come mainly to see Glenn. ``We had to stay behind the rope line,
and because of all the reporters and the cops on horseback, I
couldn't see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the parade was great. They ought to do this kind of thing
more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Police stuck closely to Glenn after a young woman approached the
car and tried to kiss him.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn car followed six vintage Thunderbird convertibles
carrying the other shuttle Discovery crew members who lifted off
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Oct. 29 and returned Saturday: Curtis
L. Brown, Steven W. Lindsey, Stephen K. Robinson, Scott E.
Parazynski, Pedro Duque and Chiaki Mukai.
</P>
<P>
   All wore their sky-blue astronaut jumpsuits, as did about 50
other members of the astronaut corps riding on three fire engines.
Some weren't even born in 1962 when Glenn became the first American
to orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The clear sky and perfect weather brought many downtown workers
outside, along with some who made special efforts to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Calvo, 19, born without limbs, and Andre Gaines, 61, left a
quadriplegic after an accident, had a good view from their
motorized wheelchairs on the sidewalk in front of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very historic event, a once-in-a-lifetime thing,''
Calvo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally follow the missions,'' said Gaines. ``I'm
interested in the whole crew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John,'' a 52-year-old Vietnam veteran, was in Florida on
business and drove to view Discovery's launch last month. While he
wanted to see Glenn and the rest of the crew, he came Wednesday
mainly ``because it was a Veterans Day parade and the older I get,
the better I feel about being a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Stone, who brought her three young children from Clear
Lake City, Texas, said Glenn's recent journey into space could
benefit NASA in much the way Mark McGwire's home run record this
season sparked renewed interest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the liftoff _ and we love parades,'' said Stone's
friend Adele James.
</P>
<P>
   Law clerk Katherine Miller, 49, said ``everyone over 40'' should
have turned out. ``He (Glenn) is close to our last American hero,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the astronauts passed by, Miller took about 30 pictures.
``I'm a flag waver,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Howard, 12, wondered aloud how someone Glenn's age could
go into ``outer space.'' But she was just as interested in the
veterans who passed by in fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have to pay taxes,'' she said. ``If they have
to go through a bloody battle, why should they have to pay money?''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Dantche was there to see astronaut Robinson, her high
school classmate, and held a sign with the name of their hometown,
Moraga, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys have to get acknowledged, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The parade had another meaning for Dantche. Her father, who died
recently, was a World War II veteran. ``I'm thinking of him
today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the vendors hawking balloons and T-shirts, Jennifer Weiner
of the Houston Downtown Management District had one of the odder
jobs _ handing out cornstarch ``peanuts.'' The biodegradable white
blobs, resembling foam packing material, were tossed from the
sidewalks like confetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Houston to look like New York City (in a ticker-tape
parade),'' Weiner explained. But few buildings here have windows
that open, she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Symra Lanclos, 32, brought son Jetaime, 4. ``I came mainly for
the veterans,'' she said, naming three family members who served in
Desert Storm and one in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the retiring Democratic senator from Ohio, is a retired
Marine Corps colonel and a decorated pilot with 122 missions in
World War II and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Before the parade, he and the other honorees lunched at Wortham
Center with Mayor Brown and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Glenn) is truly a modern-day hero, an inspiration to all
of us,'' Brown said. The mayor joked that he is personally thrilled
by Glenn's role in research to reverse the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle commander Curtis Brown asked the audience to use the
excitement generated by the mission to support the international
space station project.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wants to be sure space exploration is funded in
Washington. ``Ponce de Leon,'' he quipped, ``went looking for the
fountain of youth and found Florida; John Glenn went to Florida and
found the fountain of youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Being among the younger crew, Glenn said, he felt like ``costume
jewelry at Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   Rephrasing a famous line from the Apollo 13 moon-landing
mission, he told the crowd: ``Houston, today we have no problem,
and we want to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has staged at least two previous downtown parades in
honor of astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 8's Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders, the
first humans to circle the moon, were honored Jan. 13, 1969, after
being feted in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger celebration erupted here Aug. 16, 1969, for the
Apollo 11 crew of Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, the
first to walk on the moon, and Michael Collins, who remained in
orbit during their landing.
</P>
<P>
   Those festivities were capped by an Astrodome program, emceed by
Frank Sinatra, for all who took part in the Apollo and Gemini
programs. &QL;

ISRAEL'S CABINET APPROVES PEACE PLAN, BUT BINDS IT WITH
STIPULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Cabinet, after a two-week delay,
conditionally approved the land-for-security peace accord Wednesday
night, attaching a series of stipulations and threats that the
Palestinians interpreted as overtures to conflict, not resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The approval by the 17-member Cabinet was a shaky victory for
Benjamin Netanyahu, the beleaguered Prime Minister of Israel who
faces stiff opposition from the right. Eight ministers, including
Netanyahu, voted in favor of the agreement. Four voted against it
and five abstained, after three days of raucous deliberation,
interrupted by a terrorist attack last Friday and resumed Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement may have been reaffirmed technically, but the
ministers have no confidence in the government,'' said Yitzhak
Levy, the Minister of Education and leader of the National
Religious Party, who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement goes to the Israeli Parliament on Thursday, where
a majority is expected to approve it, although the vote could be
complicated if a motion of no-confidence _ or of confidence _ in
the government is appended.
</P>
<P>
   The feeble majority in the Cabinet underscores the weakness of
Netanyahu's coalition, which has become increasingly dysfunctional
as a governing body.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised news conference announcing the ratification,
Netanyahu, flanked by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, issued what
amounted to a threat to annex chunks of the West Bank if the
Palestinians moved next spring to unilaterally declare an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right to apply Israeli law to the security
areas, to the Jerusalem area and the area of the settlements and to
other things that are accepted as vital interests of Israel,''
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet shackled its support for the agreement to conditions
that are likely to prove future points of friction. It said that
the entire Palestinian National Council, which has 670 members,
must meet and vote by a majority to strike clauses calling for
Israel's destruction from the Palestinian covenant. That goes
beyond the text of the accord, which makes no mention of a vote or
a majority decision. And some Palestinian leaders have proclaimed
that no vote will be taken because they believe a vote taken in
April 1996 should suffice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet also declared that in the third redeployment, which
the peace accord says will be deliberated by a committee, Israeli
troops will withdraw from no more than an additional 1 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And the ministers said they will reconvene to reconsider the
accord's approval after each brief phase of the 12-week
implementation period, weighing whether the Palestinians have lived
up to their promises before recommitting to the next troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, tried through his chief
spokesmen to emphasize his relief that the accord had been
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that they approved the agreement,''
said Nabil Aburdaineh, a senior spokesman. He added, using
Netanyahu's nickname: ``Now Bibi has no excuse for delaying
further. The implementation will create an atmosphere of trust
among the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Palestinian leaders chafed at what they saw as the
Israelis' audacity in attaching conditions to an international
agreement that was not meant to be amended by one side.
</P>
<P>
   The implementation was structured in phases so that the Israelis
and the Palestinians could progress toward a relationship of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian leadership does not accept any of these
conditions,'' said Hassan Asfour, a top aide to Arafat. ``This sets
a dangerous precedent for the relationship. We are not agents of
the Israelis. We do not do as they command. We will abide by the
terms of the international agreement, and only by those terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu announced that he was ready to take two concrete steps
in the next week _ to allow the opening of the Palestinian airport
in Gaza and to return ``a batch'' of political prisoners to the
Palestinians, ``not ones with blood on their hands or members of
Hamas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention the first Israeli troop withdrawal, which is
supposed to take place no later than next Monday. It has inevitably
been delayed by the postponement of the Israeli Cabinet's
ratification of the accord. The Israelis agreed to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 15,000 Jewish settlers, who arrived in hundreds of buses
from the West Bank, rallied against the agreement in Rabin Square
in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, playing to the jeering crowd a tape
of a speech by Netanyahu in which he said it was wrong to turn over
any territory to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jerusalem sits a clumsy, useless and confused government
which doesn't care that our Jewish brothers in Hebron, at Katif,
and in Judea will be hung out to dry,'' said Rehavan Zeevi, head of
the far-right Moledet Party. ``And maybe, God forbid, murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear where such rhetoric will lead, as the right
wing does not want to topple Netanyahu only to find itself
responsible for installing a Labor government. Also, there may be a
sizable gulf between the settlers and their leaders. A survey by a
polling firm, working for the leftist Peace Now group, found that
only 40 percent of Jewish settlers were emphatic in their
opposition to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference, Sharon, who was brought into the
government partly to placate the right, presented the Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank as an inevitability because of the
interim peace agreement signed by the previous government in Oslo.
But the current government, he said, toughened it with reciprocal
demands for security.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were able to achieve, and I don't think anyone could
achieve more, was the minimum evil,'' Sharon said. ``It's not an
easy retreat. It's difficult and painful. But we made every
possible effort not to harm our security.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on a late-night interview show, Netanyahu said his
chief concern was not Palestinian autonomy but Palestinian arms.
``I know there is a majority of Israelis who believe a Palestinian
state will exist, but I am confident if we are sane that we don't
mean an armed state next to us,'' he said. ``When you have an
autonomous state, it's very hard to restrict sovereign decisions
such as an alliance with Saddam Hussein. My insistence is to
sterilize elements which will stop the Palestinians not from
running their lives but from threatening us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political insiders expected the Cabinet to attach one more
condition: the start of construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa, in the vacant hills of southeast Jerusalem. That did
not happen, although Netanyahu implied Wednesday night that his
government would move forward on the project. ``Watch the papers,''
he said, referring to the legal advertisements that must be placed
to solicit construction bids.
</P>
<P>
   Construction at Har Homa would expand the city's borders before
its fate is decided in the delicate final phase of peace
negotiations. It is a very sensitive issue. An Israeli decision to
build at Har Homa provoked the 19-month freeze in the peace talks
that ended with the signing of the peace memorandum at the White
House on Oct. 23.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 COMMENTARY: AFTER MOYNIHAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Giuliani? It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Clinton? (Hillary, that is.) An exciting thought. Probably
won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Cuomo? (Andrew, not Mario.) Quite possible.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who let it be known
last week that he would not seek a fifth term in 2000, is under
way. Carl McCall says he's interested. People wonder if Mark Green
is interested. There is talk about an Al D'Amato comeback, and
frantic speculation that has even included such names as Colin
Powell and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is a spectacular one. There hasn't been an open U.S.
Senate seat in New York since 1958, when the Republican, Kenneth
Keating, defeated the Democrat, Frank Hogan. Keating himself was
defeated six years later by Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The name surfacing most frequently among the Democrats is Andrew
Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. He'd love to
run but he's got a tough decision to make. He's close to Vice
President Al Gore and would have a big role in Gore's presidential
campaign. Does he give that up for what undoubtedly will be a
brutal fight for the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   The Republican with the best shot is none other than Rudolph
Giuliani, the Bill Parcells of New York politics. Try to imagine
Parcells in the Senate. It's not exactly a perfect fit, but
Giuliani could very well win. Republican candidates in statewide
races usually do well upstate while getting demolished in the city.
Giuliani would not get demolished in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Said a prominent Democratic strategist: ``I think he would win
if he got the nomination. I think it is very difficult for a
Democrat to beat a Republican if the Republican gets more than 40
percent of the city vote. Rudy would get 40 to 45 percent, maybe
more. And he does well in the suburbs. He would be very hard to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Running for the Senate is hardly Giuliani's first choice. He
would hate being just one of 100 senators, and it's almost
impossible to picture him happily immersed in the perennial
compromising of the legislative process. But his options are
limited. He can't run for re-election as mayor in 2001 because of
term limits. He would love to be on the Republican national ticket
in 2000 but that's not going to happen. And George Pataki, who is
not subject to term limits, will be free to run for a third term as
governor in 2002 if he doesn't land on a national ticket himself.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's ultimate goal is to be president. If the choice en
route is between running for the Senate and running toward
oblivion, he would most likely choose the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   I have found nothing to substantiate the rumors that Hillary
Rodham Clinton is interested in running for Moynihan's seat. But
the idea of a Senate race between Mrs. Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani
is such a splendid one that it must be kept alive at all costs. The
journalists who would get to cover that story are of one mind: Run,
Hillary, run.
</P>
<P>
   Carl McCall would be an attractive candidate, but even his
friends wonder if he has the capacity to raise the necessary
funding, and if he has the stamina and the will that this Senate
campaign will require. (There are reasons why ruthless, obsessive
politicians like Bill Clinton, Al D'Amato and Rudolph Giuliani so
frequently end up the winners.) Also, it is by no means certain
that the state's voters would be willing to send an
African-American to the Senate in the near future. It's pathetic
but true that McCall's race will be a handicap, even as we move
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green has already had two unsuccessful runs for the Senate.
It is believed that his eye is on the mayoralty. If Giuliani were
to win the Moynihan seat, Green, the city's public advocate, would
automatically succeed him and finish out the term. That would give
him a boost in the mayoral race in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   How brutal is politics? Green's opponents, including the
Giuliani forces, are trying to figure out a way to quickly change
the law so that Green would not automatically succeed Giuliani. One
proposal is to have a special election if the mayor were to leave
office early.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday I referred to a textbook by Dr. Warren Hern, calling
it ``Abortion Services.'' The correct title is ``Abortion
Practice.''

CLINTON ORDERS TROOPS AND BOMBERS TO PERSIAN GULF 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday ordered substantial
new forces to the Persian Gulf, including B-1 and B-52 bombers, and
warned President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he was prepared to
strike without further warning.
</P>
<P>
   He also dispatched 4,000 ground troops to defend Kuwait in case
of an Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a Veterans Day speech that the United States
would be compelled to act unless Iraq immediately permits the
resumption of United Nations inspections of its weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A failure to respond could embolden Saddam to act recklessly,
signaling to him that he can with impunity develop these weapons of
mass destruction or threaten his neighbors,'' Clinton told several
hundred military officers and veterans at Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The President said that inaction in the face of continuing
provocation from Saddam would permanently damage the credibility of
the United Nations, which on Wednesday withdrew virtually all of
its inspection officers from Iraq in anticipation of a major
American attack.
</P>
<P>
   The President delivered his most extensive remarks on the
current impasse with Baghdad as part of a concerted Administration
effort to portray the United States as resolute and prepared to act
at any time to punish Saddam. William Cohen, the secretary of
Defense, announced a major buildup of air and ground forces in the
region, including the ground troops being sent to defend Kuwait.
The secretary of state and the chairman of the joint chiefs both
delivered public warnings that military action was imminent if
Saddam did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that if Iraq were permitted to resume work on
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, it could quickly restore
its capacity to imperil its citizens and its neighbors with weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites or
monitor compliance at known production facilities, they may as well
be in Baltimore, not Baghdad,'' Clinton said. ``That would open a
window of opportunity for Iraq to rebuild its arsenal of weapons
and delivery system in months _ and I say again _ in months, not
years.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, more than 230 U.N. inspection agents left
Baghdad for their personal safety; an additional 41 officials from
other agencies were scheduled to leave on Thursday. The State
Department withdrew non-essential personnel from Israel and Kuwait
to protect them from possible Iraqi retaliation for an American
military strike.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright delayed for a day, until
Friday, her scheduled departure for an Asian-Pacific economic
summit in Malaysia. She also switched from her usual airplane to a
special Department of Defense flying command center known as the
Doomsday Plane, capable of secure communications with U.S. forces
anywhere on the globe. She used the same airplane in August when
she traveled to Africa at the time the Administration was in the
final stages of planning missile strikes in retaliation for embassy
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton earlier this week pushed back his departure for the
economic conference, giving him more time to participate in
deliberations on the Iraq crisis. White House officials said that
the President could cancel his trip if he decides to use force
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that even as additional forces flow into the
region, the United States is ready to act at any time. In addition
to the attack planes and ground forces ordered to the gulf
Wednesday, the aircraft carrier Enterprise and its battle group are
en route to the region, and are expected to arrive Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no need for further warnings,'' Ms. Albright said in an
interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that although he is willing to mount a punishing
military attack against Iraq, he still would prefer a peaceful
solution to the current crisis. He said that intrusive inspection
of Iraqi weapons sites is more effective than bombing in corralling
Saddam's military ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to hope _ indeed, pray _ that Saddam will
comply,'' Clinton said. ``But we must be prepared to act if he does
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, said Wednesday that Saddam has been sufficiently warned of
the consequences of continuing to defy the United States and the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that all options remain on the table today,''
Shelton said on NBC's ``Today'' program, ``that we have tried over
the years to get him to comply with U.N. resolutions and to honor
these commitments; that he does, in fact, pose a threat to an area
that is a vital national interest to the United States, and that he
poses a threat not only to his neighbors but to the 20,000 men and
women of the United States that serve in that region.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that the aim of any military strike
would be to destroy Iraq's weapons plants and depots, weaken its
offensive capability and persuade Saddam to submit to international
inspections once more.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said that Saddam would not be specifically
targeted for death because assassination of foreign leaders is
prohibited by presidential order. But Albright said pointedly on
Wednesday, as she has in the past, that the United States ``would
look forward to working with a successor regime'' in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the threats and the growing American military strike
force in the region, there is no assurance that military action
will accomplish the administration's goals. The Persian Gulf war of
1991 did not curtail Saddam's weapons programs, even though more
than 500,000 American troops and 2,000 aircraft were employed in a
campaign that inflicted serious damage on Iraq and its army.
</P>
<P>
   Two small-scale American military strikes, in 1993 and 1996,
likewise did not significantly degrade Saddam's military
capability. In fact, American intelligence analysts said that they
believed that American attacks had strengthened Saddam's political
position within Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that the attacks being contemplated this time would
be more effective than past efforts because the United States today
has better weapons, better technology and better intelligence than
it had even eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton also defended the conduct of the gulf war, even though
it left Saddam in power and in a position to resume work on his
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would also say that the objectives of the Gulf war were
met,'' he said. ``We did, in fact, reduce the threat that Saddam
Hussein posed. We stopped that war only after he agreed to the
commitments that he now is failing to honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that they felt a sense of urgency
about acting against Iraq for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies do not want to let Saddam go
unpunished for long for halting weapons inspections on Oct. 31, a
senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. The United Nations, including such normally balky allies
as France and Russia, refuses to defend Saddam in this latest
crisis or negotiate some way out for him.
</P>
<P>
   But many countries are increasingly sensitive to the human
suffering caused by the harsh sanctions regime imposed on Iraq
after the Gulf war and are seeking some honorable way to lift the
limitations on trade with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday repeated the longstanding administration
policy _ that the United States will support the end of sanctions
when Iraq is certified to be free of weapons of mass killing and
the missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if Saddam Hussein is really serious about wanting
sanctions lifted, there is an easy way to demonstrate that. Let
UNSCOM do its job without interference; fully comply,'' Clinton
said at Arlington, referring to the U.N. special commission
responsible for the weapons inspections. ``The international
community is united that Saddam must not have it both ways by
keeping his weapons of mass destruction capability and still
getting rid of sanctions.''

DIGITAL PIANOS: PLAY IT AGAIN, RAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Repeating with CIR in slug.)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They all laughed when I sat down at the digital grand piano, but
when it began to play ...
</P>
<P>
   They kept laughing when I yielded the piano bench to the ghost
of Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose virtual fingers flitted over the keys
in a dazzling performance of his arrangement of Nikolai
Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Flight of the Bumblebee.'' It is impossible not
to laugh, or at least smile, at the sight of a piano seemingly
playing itself so frantically.
</P>
<P>
   And it is nearly impossible to suppress a sense of wonder when
contemplating how recent advances in computer technology have
allowed great pianists, some of them long dead, to perform concerts
on the piano in one's living room.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the 300th anniversary of the invention of the
piano, artists, engineers and computer programmers are finding new
ways to combine the richness and versatility of traditional pianos
with the power of microprocessors. The familiar acoustic grand
piano has not changed much in the past century, but new generations
of pianos, some of them digital and some both acoustic and digital,
are emerging as we enter the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument that caused such wonder and delight in our house
is the new Yamaha Disklavier Grantouch digital grand piano, or
DGT7, which we have been testing in our music room for several
weeks alongside our 1920s-vintage Baldwin grand.
</P>
<P>
   The DGT7 is certainly not for everybody, in no small part
because of its $18,695 price tag, but also because many people
prefer their grand pianos to make music the old-fashioned way, by
causing hammers to strike metal strings of different lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the DGT7 creates its sounds by plucking them from a
large database of digitized sounds and playing them through a set
of speakers hidden where the strings used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Digital pianos are typically used by rock bands and musical
hobbyists or by people who do not have room for a conventional
piano. The most common models are not much more than a keyboard
plugged into an amplifier, and the sounds they make are easily
recognizable as electronic.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha, which has been making pianos for more than a century,
decided to put a digital piano into the same physical form as its
acoustic grands, thereby greatly improving not only its appearance
but also its feel and sound. The result is the DGT7.
</P>
<P>
   Gleaming black, the DGT7 is as beautiful an instrument as any
conventional acoustic grand piano, and Yamaha says it is
constructed with the same care and craftsmanship. The keyboard
action, a complex construction of keys, hammers and some 12,000
additional parts, is the same as that used in concert grands, and
it has the same feel when played.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no strings, there is no need for an iron frame
to support the literally tons of tension put on the strings of an
acoustic grand piano. Instead, the DGT7 has an elaborate set of
solenoids and optical sensors that measure the location, speed and
force of the pianist's actions on the keys, the hammers and the
three foot pedals.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds themselves are drawn from a database with 30
megabytes of digitized sounds _ about 10 times the sound capacity
of earlier digital pianos _ sampled from a 9-foot Yamaha acoustic
concert grand.
</P>
<P>
   When the middle C key is struck, for example, the sensors feed
data to a microprocessor, which selects the most accurate
corresponding middle C sound from the database: legato, staccato,
loud, soft, sustained and so on. Added to those factors is the
``voice'' of the note _ colored for the reverberations of a concert
hall or a cellar, as a single note or as part of a chord, as a
piano or as a harpsichord, etc. The variables are nearly infinite.
</P>
<P>
   Because its sounds are synthesized, the DGT7 never needs tuning,
and because each note is a clone of one produced on the big concert
grand, the notes are as perfect as the speakers can make them. The
result is that this five-foot digital piano has a sound much bigger
than its actual size.
</P>
<P>
   The real magic of the digital piano, however, arises from its
ability to record and play back performances.
</P>
<P>
   The DGT7 has a small computer console under the keyboard that
reads performance instructions _ coded as standard MIDI files _
from the user's Macintosh or Windows PC, from another MIDI
instrument or from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Players can record their own performances onto a disk or play
back any of the thousands of amateur and professional performances,
like the Rachmaninoff performance, that have been captured as MIDI
files. The Internet is becoming a vast repository of such piano
performances. Professionally recorded floppy disks ranging from
classical to contemporary are available at prices ranging up to
$35.
</P>
<P>
   (A reminder about copyright laws is appropriate. Sharing
original compositions and public domain works on the Internet is
fine, but flooding the world with your interpretations of Barry
Manilow's ``Feelings'' is legally, if not morally, wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   To test the DGT7's performance capabilities, Nick, the aspiring
concert pianist in our household, selected a diskette of Alexei
Sultanov playing Chopin's ``Polonaise in A-flat Major,'' a work
that requires that the pianist both caress and pound the full span
of the keyboard. The DGT7 met the test with ease. Hearing the same
performance on an audio CD and hearing it being actually played on
the DGT7 in one's parlor are two very different experiences.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to think of the DGT7 as merely the latest
version of the player pianos that were popular in the 1920s and
1930s. Besides having better sound, the digital pianos have an
impressive repertory of technical tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The volume, both for conventional playing and for playing back
recordings, can be set as loud or soft as desired. By plugging in a
set of headphones, the pianist can practice well into the night
without disturbing anyone in the next room or apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard action can be turned on or off during playback.
When it's on, viewers can marvel at the key action, as if a ghost
were playing the piano. When it's off, the owner can play along and
improvise on the recording.
</P>
<P>
   The tempo can be regulated, allowing the user to slow
Rachmaninoff's ``Bumblebee'' sufficiently to see each key being
depressed. Alas, watching the keys provides no clues to his
fingering. Still, I cannot imagine a finer teaching tool for lucky
piano students and teachers. With a twist of the dial, one can
instruct the piano to play only the left hand or right hand or to
transpose the key.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as the DGT7 is, the sounds it makes are still only
clones of the real thing. So several companies are marrying the
digital recording and playback capabilities of a digital piano with
their best acoustic concert grand pianos.
</P>
<P>
   Two models today, the Boesendorfer 590SE and the Yamaha
Disklavier Grand Pro DS6PRO, are considered state of the art. Only
a few dozen of these high-end models are in use around the world,
perhaps because of their $140,000-plus price tags. Other acoustic
pianos with electronic reproduction capability are available for
$50,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor of the modern acoustic reproducing piano, Wayne
Stahnke, recently harnessed his many skills in engineering,
computer science and music to recreate the original performances of
Rachmaninoff, who died in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Stahnke painstakingly restored Rachmaninoff's original
performances from paper rolls that the Russian composer and pianist
made on a mechanical reproducing piano, converted them into digital
form, replayed them on the Boesendorfer, and recorded the output
digitally to a CD.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``A Window in Time: Rachmaninoff Performs His Solo
Piano Works'' (Terarc CD-80489, about $15), a remarkable new audio
CD that some critics assert recreates a live performance by
Rachmaninoff. It is certainly a showcase for the capabilities of
pianos in the digital age.

CHINA TELLS ROWDY SOCCER FANS IN BEIJING: KEEP IT CLEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ British soccer louts they are not, but Beijing's
boisterous fans have provoked a public campaign against their
increasingly flagrant use of obscenities to berate opposing teams,
referees and poorly performing members of their hometown
professional team.
</P>
<P>
   One phrase in particular is screamed by Beijing fans with
startling abandon, with hundreds of people sometimes chanting it in
unison. Long used as an insulting epithet in the streets, it
includes a crude reference to female anatomy. For purposes of
public discussion and earnest condemnation, the press here has
called it the ``Beijing curse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently the `Beijing curse' has filled the Workers' Stadium,
and increasing numbers of Beijingers feel ashamed about this,''
said the first of many articles in the widely read newspaper
Beijing Youth Daily, published by the local Communist Youth League.
``Every fan must assume personal responsibility for driving the
`Beijing curse' out of the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Another article said the head coach of the Beijing team, the
National Guardians, was so upset by the curse that he had proposed
resigning. Players, fans, teachers and parents, who said they
feared bringing their children to matches, have chimed in to plead
with the offending fans to clean up their language.
</P>
<P>
   But if a match Nov. 4 was any indication, the once-great power
of official exhortation in China has diminished to nothing. The
Guardians played a South Korean team in the Asian Champions Cup
series, a contest for also-rans in the Asian Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the teams took the field, the shouts of the
Beijing curse began, along with the blowing of fiendishly
well-engineered plastic horns that create a deafening din. The
Beijing team performed poorly, losing 2-0, and most curses were
scornfully aimed at its players.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional cheer for sports teams in China _ equivalent to
``Go, team!'' _ translates literally as ``Step on the gas!'' In the
stadium, curses easily outnumbered that phrase by 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans are disdainful of the media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do it to let off steam,'' said Liu Bin, 30, who said
he was a government worker. ``It's not really directed at anybody.
People who go to see sports want to hang loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The curse has been shouted for years, said his friend, who gave
only his family name, Wu. ``Now that they've started making such a
big deal out of it, there are people who will deliberately say it
more, and it will start getting organized,'' Wu predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, one writer in the Beijing Youth Daily proposed
that the only answer was to come up with some non-obscene phrase
that would pack equal punch with the fans. ``Everyone says that the
Beijing vocabulary is very rich,'' he wrote, ``but up to now I
still haven't been able to think of a fresh word.''
</P>
<P>
   Ning Jing, 20, a hotel clerk and enthusiastic perpetrator of the
curse, said it would be all but impossible to eradicate. ``It's
part of our soccer culture,'' he said. ``It's not really swearing.
It just kind of blurts out.''

COMPAQ EXPANDS INTO DIRECT SALES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Compaq Computer Corp.'s expanded operation of selling
PCs directly to small and medium businesses completes a process
that began more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement that Compaq has created a line of
computers under the brand name Prosignia is the Houston-based
PC-maker's latest attempt to stifle the growth of arch-rival Dell
Computer and other direct vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been struggling to find a way to appeal to customers
who want to buy directly from the manufacturer, while at the same
time not alienating its network of 11,000 dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But even those dealers have seen the writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simple,'' said Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and
chief executive. ``You cannot ignore what is happening around you.
You had better embrace change, and judge whether to act upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq unveiled its new strategy during a New York City news
conference, but the products being introduced already were for sale
on the company's World Wide Web site at www.directplus.compaq.com
when dawn broke.
</P>
<P>
   The company will sell both desktop, notebook and file-server
computers under the brand Prosignia, which previously was used only
for Compaq's low-end servers. The machines will be available via
phone, over the Web or through dealers which choose to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is calling the overall program Customer
Choice, &UR;  &LR; emphasizing that customers can choose to buy the machines
directly, or through traditional resellers.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, dealers also can act as agents for customers,
placing orders via phone or over the Web on their behalf. In that
case, Compaq will pay the dealers a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, customers who wanted to buy one of Compaq's business
computers had to go through a reseller, who ordered the machine and
delivered it to the customer. The dealer system adds a layer of
cost to the product.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, direct vendors such as Dell, Gateway or Micron
Electronics do not a use a middleman. Customers call them directly
via phone, or place orders over the Internet, and the computers are
shipped right to customers' doors.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has had a direct operation aimed at businesses _ Compaq
DirectPlus _ for some time, but it was deliberately limited to
avoid competing with resellers. The previous incarnation of
DirectPlus never charged less than dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Baker, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif.-based
market research firm, said Compaq's move into the direct arena was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not Compaq making this decision; it is the market making
the decision for Compaq,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, addressing journalists and analysts at the New York
event, said that direct sales account for about 35 percent of the
PC market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have simply decided that we are not going to miss out on
that one-third of the total market,'' Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors liked the move. Compaq's stock closed Wednesday at 34
7/16, up 1 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been trying to get into the direct business for some
time, either by acquiring another computer maker or by modifying
its own systems.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Compaq tried to buy both Micron and Gateway. The
Micron talks didn't get far, but Compaq came closer to acquiring
Gateway in April 1997. In fact, sources say the companies even had
press releases announcing the buyout ready to go, but Gateway
executives backed down at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Compaq announced at another New York news
conference that it would create a hybrid system it called the
Optimized Distribution Model. Under this setup, dealers would pass
orders on to Compaq, which would built customized PCs and ship them
directly to customers. In some cases, dealers themselves would do
the final build-out of customized systems.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Compaq has had problems making this work.
Although the Optimized Distribution model was designed to keep
inventories down, Compaq found itself with a glut of computers in
the first quarter of 1998. The company had to slash prices and shut
down its factories in Houston for two weeks. Its first-quarter
earnings report was a disappointment to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said Wednesday that Compaq's inventories are now at the
lowest levels he's seen since assuming the top post in 1991. Compaq
now turns over its inventory once every three weeks, he said, or
about 17 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Winkler, Compaq's senior vice president for PC products,
said the Prosignia products are priced below those of the top
competing direct vendors. A check of the offerings at both Dell's
and Compaq's Web sites bore that out.
</P>
<P>
   A Prosignia Desktop 330 computer with a 450-megahertz Pentium II
processor, 128 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive, a
DVD-ROM drive, a 17-inch monitor, a 56K fax modem, 16-bit stereo
sound card with speakers and a network interface card cost $2,150.
A comparably equipped Dell Dimension XPS system cost $2,289.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dell warranty, at three years for both parts and
labor, was slightly better than the Compaq warranty, at three years
for parts and one year for labor.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also is selling its higher-end Deskpro line of PCs,
Armada notebooks, professional workstations and Proliant servers
via phone and its Web site. It also sells some of its consumer
Presario products online. Its Compaq Works factory outlet also has
an online site at www.compaqworks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The new Prosignia line of products is coupled with new service
initiatives. Compaq will use the army of technicians it acquired in
its $9 billion purchase of Digital Equipment Corp. to service the
new systems. Customers also will be able to take advantage of some
Internet-based services _ such as online backup, buying postage via
the Web and storing documents on an Internet server so they can be
retrieved from any connected computer.
</P>
<P>
   With Customer Choice, Compaq is targeting small and medium
businesses, the fastest growing segment of the computer market.
Access Media International, a New York-based research firm,
estimated that the segment is growing at about 20 percent a year,
compared to the large corporate segment, which is growing at 13
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Bose, president of Access Media, said Compaq's biggest
challenge is going to be in not alienating its dealers, which
account for the vast majority of its sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the distribution channel is going through shifts, and
these trends are difficult if not impossible to stop,'' Bose said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer agreed, and used an analogy from another century to
make his point.
</P>
<P>
   ```You know, you can hang on long enough to the old railroads
until there are no more trains,'' Pfeiffer said. ``You have to
decide _ are you in the railroad business or are you in the
transportation business?'' &QL;

and little girls wear long skirts, even for riding bicycles. Crime
is so rare that police statistics include ``cat bite.'' But in
1995, the town of 2,000 quickly became stereotyped as a hotbed of
heartland discontent. By Jo Thomas. (With a map.)

ANALYSIS: TO REAP REAL CHANGE IN IRAQ, MILITARY FORCE MAY NOT
SUFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton ponders a military strategy
against Iraq, and the Pentagon once more picks its targets and
programs its cruise missiles for an attack, the debate at the White
House is whether to simply punish President Saddam Hussein, or to
try to change his political course by force, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States prepared Wednesday to send enough military
firepower to the Persian Gulf to batter Iraq for weeks. No battle
plans have been selected yet, but nothing short of a sustained
assault involving hundreds, perhaps thousands of bombs and missiles
can break the Iraqi leader's will and stop Baghdad's defiance of
the United Nations and the rebuilding of its arsenals, the
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be required is very substantial bombing, lasting
for weeks,'' said Zalmay Khalizad, a former senior Pentagon and
State Department official. ``But you cannot be certain that even
that will do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have to go get Saddam Hussein to force him to change
his mind,'' he said. ``It will either require a lot of bombing or a
lot more than bombing to coerce him. Without that, we may simply
acquiesce to his possession of these weapons and to his presence
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wants to punish Saddam for defying U.N. weapons
inspectors, that is easy: He can bomb Iraq for days, pounding the
leader's palaces and weapons depots into dust.
</P>
<P>
   But this may not end the threat posed by a ruler who knows how
to build biological and chemical weapons, and has hidden away the
wherewithal to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Iraq is a very difficult one and it will not be
solved magically by an air campaign,'' said John Deutch, the former
director of Central Intelligence. Bombs alone, he said, cannot
``destroy all the stock of biological or chemical agents or
missiles that Saddam Hussein has,'' or alter the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Washington believes that friendly persuasion will
force Iraq to resume cooperating with the United Nations weapons
inspectors, who for nearly seven years have sought to discover and
destroy Iraq's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen says the United States may try
``degrading his capability of manufacturing the weapons of mass
destruction'' with cruise missiles and smart bombs. But without
intensive inspections, these capabilities can be rebuilt over time.
And the inspections regime has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, U.S. commanders publicly identified likely
targets of a new attack in response to Iraq's rejection of
inspections. They include the Special Republican Guard, a
26,000-strong military unit that protects the Iraqi leader and his
weaponry, and the suspected weapons sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Forewarned, Iraq has taken measures to safeguard those targets.
So it now appears that nothing short of an attack greater than any
the United States has launched since the Persian Gulf war in 1991
could permanently damage the institutions that shore up Saddam and
shield his secret arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says the crisis will end only if the United Nations ends
the harsh economic sanctions imposed after the gulf war. Those
sanctions contribute to the deaths of up to 7,000 children a month
and are embittering the Iraqi people, according to Denis Halliday,
the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq for 13 months until he
resigned in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing will strengthen the hand of Saddam Hussein by obliging
the Iraqi people, despite the deep reservations they have about
him, to rally around him,'' Halliday said. ``By bombing Iraq again,
the U.S. loses its reputation as a benign superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous U.S. attacks have done little to change Saddam's
behavior or alter the government.
</P>
<P>
   Twice since the gulf war, the United States has launched cruise
missiles at Iraq. These were ``flaccid responses,'' said Clinton's
first director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, which did
not strike at the heart or the head of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Saddam has doubtless concluded that, almost no
matter what he does, he will only have to endure air strikes for a
limited period of time,'' Woolsey told Congress recently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the United States hit Iraqi intelligence headquarters
with cruise missiles after accusing Baghdad plotting to kill former
President George Bush. Some missiles went astray, killing eight
civilians, including a baby and an internationally known artist.
The damage to the Iraqi intelligence complex had little permanent
effect on repression that keeps Saddam in power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the United States again hit Iraq with cruise missiles,
attacking targets in the south to punish the Iraqi military for
invading opposition strongholds in the north. The missiles achieved
little of lasting military or political consequence. In fact, in
the judgment of U.S. intelligence officials, the Iraqi leader
emerged stronger politically.
</P>
<P>
   But without a likely successor who might lead Iraq, a U.S.
effort to undermine Saddam could could reap a whirlwind. Gen.
Anthony Zinni of the Marines, commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf, warned Congress last month, ``A weakened, fragmented,
chaotic Iraq _ which could happen if this isn't done carefully _ is
more dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam is now.''

McCOWN IS BEST CHOICE FOR AGGIES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two quarterbacks. One football.
</P>
<P>
   One wrong decision and an outside shot at a national
championship disappears.
</P>
<P>
   That is the predicament facing Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, who
must decide if his sixth-ranked Aggies (9-1, 6-0) are better off
facing No. 13 Missouri (7-2, 5-1) with a healthy backup quarterback
or a semi-healthy starter at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what I do, some people will think I should have gone
in the other direction,'' Slocum said. ``So, I can't let that
bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he will wait until pregame warmups to decide between
Branndon Stewart, the backup who threw for 234 yards in last week's
29-0 victory against Oklahoma, or Randy McCown, the starter who
continues to take daily treatments for a separated shoulder
suffered Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M players, including Stewart, agree the job should revert to
McCown once he is recovered. But that time will be difficult to
pinpoint because of the nature of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, who has yet to throw during practice this week, said
trainers told him it would take four to six weeks for a full
recovery. They also told him that, as of Monday, he was in no
danger of suffering additional damage from being tackled and could
play if he could stand the pain.
</P>
<P>
   During light throwing sessions on the side, McCown said the only
pain he has felt is a minor ``tweak'' on his follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, I plan on playing,'' McCown said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, of course, reserves the right to change that plan. He
remains unclear how effective McCown could be under game
conditions. That brings him to Stewart, who stunned teammates last
week against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a fire in his eyes and we drew from that. To tell you
the truth, I hadn't seen that look from him this year,'' wide
receiver Chris Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more vocal than I'd ever seen him,'' tight end Dan
Campbell said. ``When people made plays, he would compliment them.
Things like that go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart downplayed the change but acknowledged Slocum and
quarterbacks coach Ray Dorr had encouraged him to be more
demonstrative toward teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the quarterback to be more assertive, but I can't
change who I am,'' said Stewart, a Stephenville native. ``I'm not a
rah-rah guy. You're not going to see me run across the field and
jump on someone's shoulders after a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that is precisely the sort of thing teammates like best
about the effusive McCown. It is the intangible that, in Campbell's
estimation, makes this McCown's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still our man,'' Campbell said. ``If he's healthy, we
expect him to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's not 100 percent, McCown remains the quarterback
most likely to elevate the performances of peers in a big game that
could be a nail-biter. Trainers say he can't make the injury worse
by playing.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm Slocum, I let McCown start and ride him until his
shoulder shows he can't be effective.
</P>
<P>
   But this is your call, R.C. All that's riding on it is a
potential shot at a national championship.
QUICK HITS Making his own name
</P>
<P>
   During last year's Texas-Texas Tech game, the Runnin' Rickys
combined to carry 46 times for 211 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   If both players reach their season averages Saturday night in
Lubbock, Texas tailback Ricky Williams and Texas Tech tailback
Ricky Williams will carry 60 times for 338 yards and four
touchdowns. Regardless of what happens, Texas coach Mack Brown
said, one thing is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their Ricky Williams has outgrown being called `Little
Ricky,''' Brown said of the handle given the Tech tailback because
he is 3 inches shorter and 35 pounds lighter than his Texas
counterpart. ``He's his own person and has made his own name for
himself. But it's unique to have two great players named Ricky
Williams in the same game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Tech's tailback outrushed his Texas counterpart,
131-80, in last year's 24-10 victory by the Red Raiders. But it is
the Longhorns' version of Ricky Williams who leads the nation in
rushing (191.6-yard average) this season, with his Tech counterpart
(146.1) at No. 5.
Heading home
</P>
<P>
   Texas defensive end Aaron Humphrey, a Lubbock native, has spent
much of this week trying to line up tickets for friends and family
members wanting to attend Saturday's game against Tech. By
yesterday, he had found 12 but needed more.
</P>
<P>
   None of them, he said, has expressed regrets that he jilted the
hometown Red Raiders to play for the rival Longhorns. In fact, he
made his rooting section sound like a bunch of Mac Davis wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of them cared if I went to Tech or not,'' Humphrey
said. ``If they had chances to leave Lubbock, they'd have left,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is famous for the song ``Happiness is Lubbock, Texas in
the Rearview Mirror''.
Blake digs in
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteed of a third consecutive losing record, Oklahoma coach
John Blake said he is not concerned about being fired after the
Sooners (3-6, 1-5) complete their season on Nov. 21. If OU falls in
Saturday's game against Baylor (2-7, 1-5), the Sooners will finish
last in the South Division.
</P>
<P>
   During his weekly news conference, Blake said he needs two more
recruiting classes to turn the tide, then added: ``The wins will
come. I know they will. The good things have outweighed the
negatives by a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Blake, Oklahoma is 10-22. Even with victories in their
final two games, the Sooners would finish with the worst three-year
mark in school history. Athletic director Joe Castiglione said he
would review Blake's performance and make a recommendation on his
status to the school's board of regents ``as soon as possible''
after the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Bet the house on a new coach being in place before the Big 12
championship game is played on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Several names have been floated as potential successors,
including Georgia's Jim Donnan, Oregon's Mike Bellotti and Tulane's
Tommy Bowden. Another name to consider is Lou Holtz, the former
Notre Dame coach who retired after the 1996 season because his
wife, Beth, was in declining health.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, 61, has a relationship with Oklahoma regent Robin
Zeigfried. His wife is much-improved physically and, in private
discussions, friends say he has expressed a desire to return to the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, Castiglione would prefer to hire a younger
coach. But he answers to school president David Boren, a former
politician who might be swayed by a groundswell of public opinion
for Holtz.
EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an indication of how things have changed at Oklahoma
since Barry Switzer ran the show? In 1988, Switzer's last season,
the Sooners' roster included 44 players from Texas. A decade later,
OU has 27 . . . Saturday will mark the fifth time for Texas Tech
coach Spike Dykes to face Texas with the Red Raiders coming off an
open date. Tech is 3-1 in those games. When Dykes has not had the
extra week to prepare, his teams are 2-5 against the Longhorns. ...
A&AMP;M linebacker Warrick Holdman has 22 tackles on third down this
season. The next closest teammate, Lombardi Award finalist Dat
Nguyen, has 10. ... Two clarifications for record watchers as we
head down the stretch: Under NCAA rules, A&AMP;M's forfeit against
Louisiana Tech does not affect the team's 9-1 record or impact its
position in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. If Texas
advances to the Big 12 title game, tailback Ricky Williams' rushing
totals in that contest will count as part of his career statistics.
That gives Williams the possibility of a third game in which to
rack up the 204 yards he needs to surpass Tony Dorsett (6,082) on
the NCAA career list. ... Texas officials, by the way, have invited
Dorsett to attend the Nov. 27 A&AMP;M-Texas game, which will be
Williams' final home appearance. ... Despite the game's potential
championship ramifications, ABC will not budge from its 10 a.m.
kickoff time for the A&AMP;M-Texas contest. The schools are
contractually bound to that time slot as part of a Big 12 agreement
with the network that expires after this season. A date and kickoff
time for the teams' 1999 contest has not been determined.

STUDIES VARY WIDELY ON PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE SUFFERING HEART VALVE
DISORDERS AFTER TAKING DIET DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Different studies indicate that estimates vary widely
on what percentage of people suffer heart valve disorders after
taking the diet pills popularly known as Fen/Phen and Redux,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great discordance,'' Dr. Robert Bonow, chief of the
division of cardiology at Northwestern University of Medicine in
Chicago, said at the 71st scientific sessions of the American Heart
Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bonow headed a heart association committee that drafted
treatment guidelines for all form of heart valve disease and
devoted two pages to the new disorder arising from use of the diet
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed that the likelihood of developing a problem with a
heart valve depended on the length of time people took the drugs
and on how much they took.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' Bronow advised. ``We don't know the true
prevalence and we still don't know what the public health impact
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   All researchers at the conference agreed that the decision to
withdraw the drugs fenfluramine (Pondimine) and dexfenfluramine
(Redux) from the market was a wise one given the potentially deadly
nature of the problems associated with them, but Bonow said it
should not discourage further research into diet pills.
</P>
<P>
   The data from the studies presented at the conference showed
that up to 29 percent of the people who used the diet drugs
suffered heart valve disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce A. Samuels, attending cardiologist at the Heart Center
of Los Angeles, studied 89 patients who had taken either Redux or
the Fen/Phen combination and found that 26, or 29.2 percent, had
``significant valvular leakage,'' an indication that the valve is
not closed properly.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of the patients with leakage had it to a
severe or moderate amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Dr. Charles A. Herzog of the Hennepin County Medical
Center in Minneapolis, confirmed the association between use of the
drugs and valve disease with about 20 percent of patients suffering
the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that patients who had taken the diet drug had a
two times greater risk of having high pulmonary artery pressure,
indicating a risk of developing a potentially deadly ailment called
pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 388 people, Dr. Ravin Davidoff, director of
clinical cardiology at Boston University School of Medicine, found
that 12 percent of patients had evidence of disease in the aortic
valve of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Bruce Shively, associate professor of medicine at
Oregon Health Sciences University, studied 220 people who had taken
Redux and 192 who had not at 26 sites in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   None of the patients had severe valve disease. However, he said,
7.3 percent of the treated patients had disorders of the aortic or
mitral valve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is there is an increase prevalence of valve
disease (compared to the normal population),'' he said. ``The good
news is that the prevalence is low and that there were no severe
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart association guidelines recommend:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who took the Fen/Phen combination or Redux should be
examined by their doctors using a stethoscope after ceasing the
drugs and then six to eight months later if no problems are found.
</P>
<P>
   If a patient has had a murmur or symptoms of heart valve
problems, he or she should be examined by an ultrasound test of the
heart called echocardiography. In some cases, a heart murmur is
hard to detect on physical exam. Those patients should undergo
echocardiography before undergoing dental procedures because of the
risk of an infection of the lining of the heart muscle. In severe
cases, patients should undergo surgery to correct the defect. &QL;

FRONTRUNNER EMERGES FOR GINGRICH'S HOUSE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEVIN SACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ The campaign to succeed Rep. Newt Gingrich as
the congressman from Georgia's 6th Congressional District began
taking shape Wednesday as Johnny Isakson, the chairman of the state
school board and a fixture in state Republican politics, announced
his candidacy and instantly became the presumptive front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Among other political assets, Isakson, 53, has the blessing of
the outgoing House speaker, who issued a statement Tuesday
encouraging him to run. ``He is a very close personal friend,''
Gingrich said, ``and I believe he would do a great job of
representing Georgia's 6th District.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced last Friday that he would step down from the
speakership and resign his House seat because of Republican losses
in last week's elections. The party lost five seats in the House,
and, counting Gingrich, now holds 223 seats to the Democrats' 211
and one independent. The Republican majority is six.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson's announcement is likely to keep some prospective
Republican candidates out of the race. State Republican chairman
Russell Paul said Wednesday that he would no longer consider
running and joined other party leaders in the district in
handicapping Isakson as a heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th District, which spans an arc of affluent suburbs north
of Atlanta, is considered one of the most Republican congressional
districts in the nation. Its politics are driven primarily by
economic conservatism, but social issues also play a role and that
could cause problems for Isakson. He is a social moderate who took
the unusual step of highlighting his support for abortion rights
during a Republican primary campaign for the U.S. Senate two years
ago, alienating many religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said Isakson had already started to repair that damage by
contacting Christian conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't make them all happy,'' Paul said, ``but he's working
to shore up his right flank.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his announcement in the Marietta town square, Isakson
emphasized his Republican credentials, saying he and Gingrich
``were Republicans when Republican wasn't very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   A real estate executive, Isakson has served in the state General
Assembly and run two unsuccessful statewide races, for governor in
1990 and for the U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson focused his remarks Wednesday on economic issues; he but
did not mention social ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the principles of economic conservatism,'' he
said. ``I believe in the principles of local control. And I believe
in a manageable government that takes less out of the pockets of
the taxpayers and enlightens the life of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   One social conservative, state Rep. Mitchell Adam Kaye, a
Republican who gained national attention this year for proposing
that teachers be allowed to carry guns in schools, has said he will
run against Isakson. Several others are still considering their
options.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Michael Coles, an entrepreneur and
former state party chairman who lost a campaign for the U.S. Senate
last week, is considering entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gingrich has yet to formally notify Gov. Zell Miller of
his resignation, no date has been set for a special election to
fill his seat. It also remains unclear whether the election would
be nonpartisan, with Democrats and Republicans running together, or
whether a general election would be preceded by party primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic officials said Wednesday that they would like to
see partisan primaries because Isakson might be challenged from the
right. Although the district is considered strong Republican turf,
the Democrats believe they have a chance to win in a race against
an extreme social conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district can be won with the right combination of
Republican candidates,'' said state Democratic chairman David
Worley. ``There's a real possibility that the Republicans will
choose as their leading candidate a radical nut, for lack of a
better term.''

TODAY'S SPECIAL: AN ORDER OF GROUSE AND A SIDE OF CARP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it just me, or are some of my favorite shows slipping?
Consider, for example:
</P>
<P>
   _Ally McBeal. The genius who decided that ``Ally McBeal'' is a
comedy should take a moment. A moment to reflect on the distressing
fallout of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so ago, while watching the pilot episode, I was one of
many who were captivated immediately and oh-so-willingly by Calista
Flockhart's expressive face, by David E. Kelley's tart script, by
the very differentness of the show. But was I the only one under
the impression that we'd become hooked on a lighthearted drama?
</P>
<P>
   Come to find out, at least as far as the Golden Globes and the
Emmys are concerned, we were hooked on a dramatic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise. Imagine my disappointment. As the show has
stretched to fulfill those high comedic expectations, it seems
``Ally'' has evolved from light drama to heavy-handed silliness.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely surprising, given Kelley's penchant for pursuing
the bizarre (such as the ``orange woman'' story line in this week's
episode). Not entirely fulfilling, either. John Cage's frog fetish
was tired _ and not very funny _ three episodes ago. Same goes for
Ally's tendency to fall. (Stay tuned: Next week, she falls into the
toilet. How much do you want to bet Cage asks if it was a fresh
bowl?)
</P>
<P>
   When ``Ally McBeal'' burst onto the scene, it introduced us to
interesting _ OK, odd _ people with a history. It became a breakout
series, with America tuning in every Monday to know more about this
young Boston attorney who was wise in matters of the law but a
little at sea in her personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Since receiving the ``comedy'' imprimatur, though, Kelley has
given up on serious characterization in favor of lame jokes and
physical comedy. So much so that no one affiliated with the show
seemed to notice that in this season's premiere episode, Ally said
she'd been a big Red Sox fan since childhood. This from the same
character who last season had no idea who the Chicago Cubs were.
</P>
<P>
   If Kelley needs a story editor, I might be available part time.
But I'd be happier if he'd just pay more attention to the quirky
folks he created and less attention to getting a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   _ER. Some career advice for Lucy Knight: Forget medicine,
concentrate on a field where your annoying tendencies won't be so
noticeable. Like driving a subway train. Or tarring roofs.
</P>
<P>
   After this season's premiere, a good friend declared that she
absolutely hated Knight, a naive medical student played by Kellie
Martin. I suggested she wait a few weeks before rendering judgment.
Almost two months into the season, I don't think we need to wait
any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' is always introducing new people, some of whom have
stayed (Gloria Reuben, Alex Kingtson), some of whom have not
(Glenne Headly, Maria Bello). Each of their characters had a
certain accessibility, even though they may not have been the
nicest people. Heck, Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle) is a social
moron, but there's something in his character that makes the bad
personality barely tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   In Lucy Knight's case, it could be the writing, or it could be
Martin's acting. I'm not sure. But I wouldn't mind at this point if
Lucy died from an outbreak of beriberi during a November sweeps
programming stunt.
</P>
<P>
   _Dawson's Creek. Not sure if I can stay with this one much
longer. It's getting more depressing than a Sunday night movie.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kelley has abandoned all seriousness with ``Ally McBeal,''
Kevin Williamson seems to have embraced it with the
single-mindedness of Henrik Ibsen on downers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Williamson gave us four overly precocious teenagers,
all articulate beyond their years but still capable of smiling and
laughing and acting like high school kids.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the cynicism of adulthood has invaded Capeside and
left Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen bereft of any sense of fun. Even
the addition of new characters has done little to lift the pall
that's fallen over the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the high school years can be tough. But Williamson might
want to sneak a peek at ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Buffy Summers
has to slay demons and deal with being an outsider and she still
seems to have more fun than the morose Capeside quartet.
</P>
<P>
   _Frasier. Not much to say here. It's simply not as clever as it
used to be. Fortunately, we have reruns of the old ones to remind
us of the days when Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) still had a job
at KACL.
</P>
<P>
   The show started losing its sparkle last season with a pregnant
Roz (Peri Gilpin). Now that she and Frasier are unemployed, the
show is rudderless and, sometimes, not so different from all those
other not-too-clever sitcoms.

 &HT;    Barry: Most Irish just long for a 'normal life'
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sebastian Barry was telling yet another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, when I came over here 15 years ago, people would come
up to me and say, `A-h-h-h, I sympathize with your struggle,''' the
Irish playwright and novelist said, his eyes crinkling with the
irony. ``And I would think, `What does he mean: Paying the rent?'''
</P>
<P>
   Barry laughed. But, as with all his stories and the plays and
novels that have brought him renown, there was a serious intent.
</P>
<P>
   The people who had whispered in his ear were Irish-Americans, in
love with stories of their own about a romantic Ireland that would
someday be united, north and south.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry, who grew up in suburban Dublin and now lives in
County Wicklow, had witnessed a less romantic reality. He recalled
a day in 1974 when the troubles of Northern Ireland moved across
the border to Dublin, where he was studying at Trinity College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three car bombs,'' he said softly, ``and I was in
Trinity that day and came out when I heard this noise, as the whole
city did. And in the distance were what looked like packages,
burned packages lying on the ground, and these were the remnants of
shoppers and some of these packages were still alive entreating
people to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he has never forgotten that image, Barry today
was conjuring up a different notion of what unity might mean in
Ireland: a society in which all people, including the long divided
people of Northern Ireland, have the right to engage in a different
sort of struggle, living a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal life _ the most difficult thing of all,'' he mused,
between engagements at Emory University in Atlanta, where he has
taken part in a series of events in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal life is probably the hardest thing on God's earth to
deal with ... the thing we struggle with, like bringing the kids to
school, paying the mortgage and all this, the terrifying things
that you have to struggle with yourself in a healthy way. That is a
large requirement to put against people who have lived in a war
situation, which is in some ways a kind of bizarre distraction from
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   In highly successful plays like ``The Steward of Christendom''
and ``Our Lady of Sligo'' and his recent novel, ``The Whereabouts
of Eneas McNulty'' _ which was a best-seller in England and Ireland
_ Barry has mined rich veins of Irish history, its losses and its
enmities, with lyric force. He also wrote for The New York Times
about the peace process in Northern Ireland that resulted in this
year's Good Friday agreement. Today, he is hopeful that normalcy is
descending on the North. But he also knows that peace is not yet a
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland, long seething with sectarian violence, is a
bit like an alcoholic family, he said. The alcoholic has stopped
drinking _ again _ but people aren't yet certain he has stopped
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year something around the figure of 250 houses have been
burned in efforts to move Catholics into another district or
Protestants into another district, sort of tit for tat,'' Barry
said. ``The punishment shootings and beatings of both Loyalists and
Republicans have continued _ slightly less than last year, they
say, but there may be something like 150 punishment beatings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sectarian hatred has even increased in some areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that if you talked to somebody maybe on the
Garvaghy Road now and said, `Isn't it wonderful that you have this
prospect of peace,' they might well say to you, `What peace are you
talking about?'''
</P>
<P>
   But no one can deny the positive signs as well. Barry cited the
Nobel Peace Prize won by Catholic leader John Hume, whom he deeply
admires, and the Protestant David Trimble. He cited what appears to
be a new statesmanship on Trimble's part. And he found cause for
cheer in the new neighborliness the peace agreement has brought
between Ireland and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been remarkable scenes, where unimaginable things
have occurred,'' he said. ``A lot of people have shown themselves
to be of greater mettle than they appeared at first.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and former Sen. George Mitchell, the
negotiator for the peace talks, played helpful roles in bringing
about this transformation. But Barry also credited the masses of
Irish-Americans who are no longer as apt to whisper their
sympathies _ or to lend support to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change was to understand it wasn't a question of get the
Brits out, it wasn't a question of Irish unity. The question was,
and it was very simple, to stop the process by which shoppers _
Catholic, Protestant, girls going out with boyfriends _ were being
killed in the streets of Ireland by impulses that had become
perverted over time. If there ever were right reasons to do that,
those right reasons were long in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, there has been a laying aside of the old stories
that stirred hatred throughout much of the Irish world. That shift
has meant the future for Northern Ireland is no longer predictably
melancholy, even if it remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most hopeful thing about the future is that no one
really knows what it is anymore,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic who is married to a Protestant, Barry knows he could
not live and be left alone in some districts of Northern Ireland.
But that didn't stop him from offering up some hopes for that still
cloudy future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like ... the whole island to be grappling with the
tricky devils and angels of normal life,'' he said. ``I would like
to be able to go up to the North of Ireland and feel that no one
was in clear and present danger there, that you could go to any
district and talk at ease with anyone ... to be at ease in your own
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly be my aspiration for Ireland. Not for
Irish unity _ you should dispense with those blind alleys in a way.
Not for a dancing at crossroads. But for a sort of imaginary dance,
a place where things can be said without fear of becoming a seed
for a murder up the line.

 &HT;    Everglades residents fight for their homes
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Madeleine Fortin isn't a revolutionary. She's no
survivalist who fled society for the wilds, retreating in
self-imposed exile, hoarding guns and food and spouting conspiracy
theories, suspicious of everything government does.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fortin is a plain-spoken, unassuming 48-year-old nurse
and college anthropology student who four years ago moved to a
rural neighborhood about 25 miles west of Miami, on the edge of
Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears the government and most of America's top
environmental groups want her off her land, which they say is
essential for saving the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Fortin considers herself a nature-lover, even an
environmentalist. She loves the Everglades. She climbs the winding
spiral staircase to her roof most nights to watch the sunset,
gazing in awe at the vast expanse of sawgrass that surrounds her
otherwise nondescript three-bedroom, two-bath ranch-style house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see fireflies and a million stars,'' she said. ``I
would never want to leave here. Sometimes flocks of birds fly
overhead. It's just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fortin and several hundred other residents of an
8.5-square-mile area called the East Everglades may have to move.
Today, officials of the South Florida Water Management District
meet to discuss several plans on what to do about the neighborhood
_ and one of the options is to buy everybody out.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility _ after years of what residents say has been
government flip-flops, double-talk and evasion _ has Fortin and her
neighbors fuming.
</P>
<P>
   While some residents have already sold and are reportedly happy
with their prices, many who remain have become disillusioned.What
hurts the most to Fortin is that she doesn't believe flooding her
land would help restore the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area was never underwater,'' she says, spreading out a
thick U.S. Geological Survey hydrology report on her dining room
table. ``We're not part of the flow-way through the Everglades. You
can see how all of this land is labeled: `rarely subjected to
wet-season inundation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from all levels of government have said they are only
trying to treat the homeowners fairly as they grapple with a very
complex problem.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for top environmental groups backing Everglades
restoration are sympathetic and say the residents should get fair
compensation. But they also believe the homes must go or the
Everglades plan may not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these people to be punished,'' said Mark Krause
of the National Audubon Society, which has been involved in the
Everglades effort. ``It's the circumstances. We've got to think of
the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   But something bothers Fortin. She goes back to her Geological
Survey hydrology map. It shows the historical flow of water to the
Everglades passed through a part of Broward County that is now
covered by housing developments like Weston, the posh suburb where
rich people like Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino lives.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is asking those people to move, Fortin says.
</P>
<P>
   She knows many people might simply blame her for her problems:
She shouldn't have bought property in the middle of a swamp,
especially as late as 1994, when talk of a massive Everglades
restoration was already brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked with everybody,'' Fortin says. ``I called the
National Park, the water management district and the county, asking
if they had plans to acquire this land. They all said, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case now.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the Everglades has become a huge national issue. A
month ago, Vice President Al Gore came to Miami to announce the
Corps of Engineers had finally finished a $7.8 billion plan to fix
the troubled wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody agrees the problems in the Everglades are man-made.
Decades of ditching, diking and road-building have interrupted the
broad, shallow flow of water that once coursed naturally over the
area and created its unique ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife populations have plummeted; fish, alligators, deer and
birds are struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan is mammoth and complex. It would take out
dikes, install culverts under roads, fill up canals, divert water,
pull farmland out of production and filter runoff water in natural
marshes to try to clean it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortin is already resigning herself to the most likely outcome:
that she'll be forced to sell at whatever price the water managers
offer. But having lived on the front lines and spent years
painstakingly educating herself about the issues, she worries about
the fate of the Everglades. She no longer trusts the crusaders who
claim they're out to save it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't believe it,'' she says. ``I'm going up against
the people trying to restore the Everglades, and what I truly
believe is that they are full of it. It's really arrogant of me,
but I believe they're really screwing up.

 &HT;    Isakson announces race to fill 6th District seat
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Johnny Isakson announced he will run for Newt
Gingrich's congressional seat on Wednesday, then waited to see who
would join him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Chuck Clay and Clint Day, both of whom ran for
lieutenant governor in the Republican primary this summer, are
contemplating campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, a state senator from Marietta, said he may announce his
decision today. Day, who lost the primary runoff to Mitch
Skandalakis, said he would make his decision early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Tony Center became the only announced Democrat
in the race. Center got 42 percent of the vote when he ran against
Gingrich in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson made his entry surrounded by supporters in the Marietta
Square, before an audience that included several state legislators
and Cobb County GOP Chairman Don Hill.
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier, House Speaker Gingrich issued a public
statement encouraging Isakson to run _ a move many interpreted as
an effort to discourage opposition in the coming special election.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, now chairman of the state Board of Education, said he
and Gingrich had much in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were Republicans when Republican wasn't very cool,'' said
Isakson, whose political career dates back to the 1970s. Isakson
said his campaign will focus on tax reform and reducing the size of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the principals of economic conservatism, I
believe in the principals of local control and I believe in a
manageable government that takes less out of the pockets of the
taxpayers,'' said the east Cobb County resident.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's tacit endorsement of Isakson hasn't discouraged other
Republicans from considering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Clay said polling done on his behalf shows it is a wide-open
race. ``The numbers show that it is winnable,'' Clay said. His
decision to run hinges on family concerns, said Clay, who has a
10-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Day said he also feels well-positioned to win the seat,
benefiting from months of campaigning for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clay and Day said they consider themselves more
conservative than Isakson, who supports abortion rights, and that
might be an advantage in a special election.
</P>
<P>
   Day is a staunch opponent of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Clay doesn't support a ban on abortion, but obtained a perfect
score on his legislative positions this year from the Christian
Coalition. Clay said his own polling shows that social issues such
as abortion are far less of a concern than economic issues such as
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Gingrich's support, Isakson has several advantages.
Political consultant Jim Lovejoy noted that when Isakson ran
against Guy Millner for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in 1996,
Isakson carried the 6th Congressional District. Isakson also can
quickly raise a large amount of money to conduct a campaign,
Lovejoy said.

 &HT;    Schools studying bloodshed
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORSYTH, Ga. _ It's the latest education trend coming to your
neighborhood school: A disaster plan in case there's a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Emergency Management Agency, the folks known for
coordinating civil responses to natural disasters, are now training
school officials and school security officers to handle, and help
prevent, bloodshed in the schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, GEMA has taken such training to 2,500 people in
Georgia schools. Conferences, like one on Tuesday, also have been
held at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center, said Karen
Franklin, hired this year as GEMA's first victims' awareness
coordinator. GEMA's message is that every school should have a
disaster plan not only for acts of God, but for shootings, should
know its county emergency coordinator and should be ready for what
happened in the past two years at schools in Pearl, Miss.; Paducah,
Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; and Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools have plans for natural disasters,'' said Bill Slade,
police chief of Pearl, Ga., where a 16-year-old student killed two
and injured six at his school on Oct. 1, 1997. But schools don't
have plans for mass shootings. ``We didn't have one,'' said Slade,
who addressed the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the shootings from Pearl to Springfield, Ga., have
been tempered by the reality check of statistics. Experts have
pointed out that schools in general are far safer places than the
streets and homes that surround them, and that even the rare
incidents of school shootings have become less frequent, not more,
during the past decade. In Georgia, several panels looking at
school violence and student discipline have spent far more time
looking at less sensational issues such as character education, the
fairness of discipline procedures and peer mediation.
</P>
<P>
   But even if schools are relatively safe, no level of violence is
acceptable, and the fear of violence alone disrupts learning and
drives good teachers out of the profession, said Michael Dorn,
chief of police for the Bibb County school system.
</P>
<P>
   The federally recognized Bibb model of school safety features
the oldest school police force in Georgia _ 27 officers and six
civilians that started in the early '70s to stop white flight by
making white families feel safe in newly integrated schools. It
didn't stop white flight, Dorn said, but today it works well at
curbing violence. Weapon confiscations have been reduced 90 percent
this decade, and the only two school shootings in the decade have
been at local private schools, Dorn said.
</P>
<P>
   A key element is prevention, he said. Students know they are
subject to random, surprise searches, which Dorn said is a far more
effective tool than doorway metal detectors. Fights, one of the
``triggering'' events for later use of weapons, are taken very
seriously. Both students in a typical fight are always punished.
Dorn said to be easier on the student who didn't start the fight is
to become ``co-dependent'' with one of the fighters.

AMERICANS WARNED AS US BUILDUP INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as UN-Iraq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Fed up with a year-long diplomatic effort to
contain Iraq, the Clinton administration Wednesday showed every
indication that it is poised to launch a military strike against
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department urged US citizens to get out of Israel and
Kuwait as hundreds of UN weapons inspectors and relief workers left
Baghdad in response to American warnings that their lives will be
in jeopardy if they remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon shifted its military build-up in the Persian Gulf
into high gear Wednesday, ordering 3,000 US combat troops, 129
warplanes, and two new Scud-busting Patriot missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton delivered a stern warning to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to reverse his decision to block UN inspections into
the country's illegal weapons program or face military action.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public effort to make a case for military force in
Iraq, Clinton warned that Baghdad has the capacity to rebuild its
weapons arsenal in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to hope, indeed pray, that Saddam will comply, but
we must be prepared to act if he does not,'' Clinton said during a
Veteran's Day speech at Arlington Cemetery. ``A failure to respond
could embolden Saddam to act recklessly, signaling to him that he
can with impunity develop these weapons of mass destruction or
threaten his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The American moves sent diplomats at the United Nations into
crisis mode.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan raced back early from a tour of
North Africa, while Russia called the UN Security Council together
for an emergency meeting in an attempt to keep the diplomatic track
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous standoffs, Annan appeared unwilling to
heed appeals from European, Arab and African nations to intervene
diplomatically to avert an American attack.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he chided Baghdad for missing a ``genuine opportunity''
to obtain relief from nearly eight years of crippling economic
sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. And he appealed
to the Iraqi leadership to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Secretary General I always try to seek peaceful
settlements,'' Annan said. ``But of course the American decision
(to attack) is in the hands of President Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of international support, or opposition, to American
military action in the Gulf remained unclear Wednesday. Amid signs
that France and other European countries were growing increasingly
sympathetic to America's tough stand, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday that London is prepared to join Washington in
a military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia continued to press publicly for a diplomatic
solution. ``We believe that the possibilities for a political
solution are not exhausted,'' Russia's foreign minister Ivan Ivanov
said Wednesday. ``Any use of force would not only render the
situation in the Gulf more difficult, but there would be
far-reaching consequences across the whole of the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders also continued to urge the Americans to seek a
diplomatic settlement. ``As far as I know, there is no one single
Arab country that supports the use of force against Iraq,''
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted as saying in the
government daily Al-Ahram Al-Masaei.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Saddam Hussein, held meeting with cabinet members,
air force commanders and anti-aircraft defense specialists. Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, meanwhile, said that the UN inspectors'
decision to leave the country, following a recommendation from the
US, ``fully proves that UNSCOM (the UN Special Commission) acts in
accordance with the orders of the government of the United States.
The allegation that UNSCOM is a subsidiary organ of the Security
Council...is a mere false cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 1991 cease-fire agreement ending the Gulf
war, Iraq is obligated to destroy all of its long range missiles
and obliterate its chemical, biological and nuclear arms programs.
Baghdad is also required to grant unfettered access to UN
inspectors seeking to ensure that Iraq has lived up to it
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, in the first major crisis with the UN, Iraq
expelled all Americans on the inspection team, a move that brought
Baghdad to the brink of war with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A February agreement between Annan and Hussein that ended the
standoff has since unraveled. On Aug. 5, Iraq reneged on the
accord, announcing that it was barring all surprise inspections
until the council moved to ease economic sanctions. On Oct. 31
Baghdad went further, halting virtually all cooperation with the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say they are growing weary of endorsing short-term
diplomatic solutions to the recurring standoffs. And they have made
it clear to their allies that they would not welcome another
diplomatic initiative to end the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any need for further warning,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday. ``The clarity of the
situation in terms of what he needs to do does not lend itself to
diplomatic negotiations, it lends itself to Saddam Hussein
reversing course.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to underscore the message, Defense Secretary
William Cohen signed an order Wednesday sending the additional
forces to Kuwait to join 1,500 American soldiers already stationed
there, as well as 18 B-52 and B-1 bombers along with 12
radar-avoiding F-117A ``stealth'' jets. Also sent will be Patriot
missile capable of shooting down Iraqi Scud missiles if they are
fired against moderate Arab states in the Gulf, Pentagon spokesman
Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Chief UN arms inspector Richard Butler made the decision to
shutter the UN's headquarters in Baghdad and send more than 100
arms inspectors to Bahrain after receiving a ``strong
recommendation'' to pull out from US ambassador Peter Burleigh, the
acting chief of the US mission to the United Nations on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that the UN inspection teams, which are now in
Bahrain, would be ready to return to work within 24 hours if Saddam
reverses his position.
</P>
<P>
   Butler bridled at suggestions that UNSCOM would never be able to
continue its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept the logic of those who say that a strike would
blow away UNSCOM. And I hear that said a lot,'' Butler said. ``If
such action were to be taken, I believe it would be taken to
enforce'' Baghdad's obligations to destroy its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reinforced the sentiment. ``If the inspectors are not
permitted to visit suspect sites or monitor compliance at known
production facilities, they may as well be in Baltimore, not
Baghdad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The UN's humanitarian aid coordinator for Iraq, Benon Sevan,
said Wednesday that the UN oil-for food program _ which permits
Baghdad to sell up to $5.25 billion in oil every six months to buy
food and medicines, would continue at a limited level. He said
would withdraw 170 officials from Baghdad, leaving behind about 40
senior officials, including Annan's chief envoy Prakash Shah.
Another 231 UN relief workers will remain in the northern Kurdish
provinces.

ISRAEL RATIFIES WYE PACT, BUT WITH STRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A wary Israeli cabinet narrowly ratified the new
land-for-security deal Wednesday, but linked it to a tough set of
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of delays and a spate of attacks by extremists
intent on destroying the peace process, the 17-member body voted
8-4 with five abstentions for a provisional approval of the interim
agreement with the Palestinians signed at the White House last
month.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference after the vote, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu called the disputed land ``precious and important,'' and
threatened to annex parts of the West Bank if Palestinians follow
through on their vow to declare an independent state in May.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiators immediately lashed out at the Israeli
conditions, calling them violations of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said, ``We have worked
very hard to improve the trust level between us. By adding these
conditions, Mr. Netanyahu has done a great deal to destroy what all
of us _ the US, the Israelis, and the Palestinians _ had tried to
do. He has violated the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrow vote in Netanyahu's fractious coalition, analysts
say, revealed the fragility of his hold on power. The conditions
that came with the vote illustrate his need to placate the far
right, which vehemently opposes the agreement and has threatened to
topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also shows that despite the dogged diplomacy of
President Clinton that helped produce this agreement, the US still
has a daunting challenge ahead to press Israel to honor the bargain
and ensure implementation of the agreement by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was struck after a nine-day summit at the Wye
River Plantation in Maryland, calls for a further 13.1 percent
Israeli troop withdrawl from the West Bank in exchange for a
greater effort by Palestinians, with the assistance of the US
Central Intelligence Agency, to crack down on Islamic terrorist
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was captured by Israel
in the 1967 Six Day War. The 13 percent phased troop withdrawal
called for in the agreement would leave the Palestinians with full
or partial control of 40 percent of the West Bank. Israel was
scheduled to begin the first of a three-stage pullback next Monday,
but has already said it will be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's cabinet ratified the agreement with the following
conditions:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Parts of the West Bank would be annexed by Israel if the
Palestinians follow through on their vow to unilaterally declare an
independent state in May.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The next, or third, phase of further Israeli troop
withdrawals from the West Bank will be no more than one percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Palestinian National Council will vote to annul
passages in the Palestinian Liberation Organization's charter that
call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Israeli cabinet will assess the Palestinians'
performance in living up to their obligations under the agreement
and will stop the process if they fail to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiators charged that the Netanyahu government
had badly damaged what little trust had been reestablished between
the two sides in Wye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been different,'' said Erekat. ``We have urged
Mr. Netanyahu to refrain form the language of threats and
conditionality. We will not accept any post-agreement negotiations.
This is why it is essential that the Americans will join us in
ensuring implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Erekat added, ``Netanyahu is giving one condition to (Foreign
Minister Ariel) Sharon, and another to the Jewish settlers, and
another to the religious parties. All of this makes for an
impossible balance between making peace and satisfying the
extremists in Israel. Why should the peace process suffer for
domestic Israeli politics?''
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest issue in the near future will be a meeting next
month in Gaza, which Clinton has said he will attend, of the
Palestine National Council and other bodies to delete passages of
the PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In this ratification, Israel made a demand not part of the Wye
agreement that the full council must vote on these changes. The Wye
agreement does call for the council to be invited to the
mid-Demember meeting, but does not require them to vote on the
formal changes to the charter. Palestinians insist that the council
already voted to annul those passages in 1996, a vote that was
recognized at the time by the United States and by Netanyahu's more
liberal predecessor Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the (council) members will be invited, as the agreement
said, and the ratification has to be done by vote. There is no
other way,'' Netanyahu said at a press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has written to Israel that the
gathering will ``reaffirm'' the 1996 Palestinian National Council
vote canceling anti-Israeli provisions in the document.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with Netanyahu Tuesday night about the agreement
and the US confrontation with Iraq over weapons inspections.
According to Israeli press reports Wednesday, Clinton told
Netanyahu the tough US policy toward Iran was facing opposition in
the Arab world because Israel had not moved forward on the
implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The US-led coalition against Iraq in 1991 is widely credited for
setting the stage for the current Mideast peace process. And today,
as tensions mount again between the United States and Iraq, the two
remain inextricably linked.

 &HT;    CHINESE LEADERS OUTRAGED AT CLINTON OVER TIBET, TAIWAN
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese leaders are outraged at President Bill
Clinton, who no longer looks the wise and benevolent partner they
thought he was this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing some of its fiercest verbiage, China lodged an
official protest Wednesday over President Clinton's decision to
dispatch U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson this week to Taiwan.
And on the resurgent issue of Tibet, the Chinese sound just as hurt
and angry.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry statement, published Thursday, said the
Chinese government ``demands'' that the United States ``strictly
abide'' by three joint communiques over the last 25 years between
American and Chinese leaders recognizing Beijing as the sole
government of China. China called on the United States to
``immediately correct its mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The harshness of the words conveyed a message that Richardson's
Taiwan trip has evoked anger at very high levels here, perhaps
accompanied by internal debate.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Chinese statements ``express serious concern'' over
foreign issues. More infrequently, China says it is ``deeply
worried.'' But in recent times, Chinese official spokesmen seldom
``demand'' compliance with its wishes. One of the few exceptions
came this summer, when China said it ``strongly demands'' that its
weaker neighbor Vietnam vacate a disputed reef in the South China
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, Clinton's former U.N. ambassador and diplomatic
troubleshooter, addressed a business meeting in Taiwan and then met
with Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui. Using Richardson's presence
to make his case that Taiwan is an established fact, the Taiwanese
leader said Taiwan's government ``not only exists, but also
strenuously upholds democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton may get a chance to hear some of the Chinese
criticism first-hand. He plans to meet for an hour with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, in a mini-summit during a break in the
meetings of 21 world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tibet, the Chinese are voicing frustration that Clinton met
the Dalai Lama at the White House for 30 minutes Tuesday,
disregarding China's loud objections that Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader is ``playing tricks'' to win Tibetan independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama has for a long time engaged in activities to
split the motherland and preached independence for Tibet,'' foreign
ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a news briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, he has not repented,'' Zhu said before the
Clinton meeting took place. ``We ask U.S. leaders not to meet the
Dalai Lama to avoid harming China-U.S. relations.''
</P>
<P>
   China's recent words reflect a remarkable change in tone,
compared to the warm glow that suffused most Beijing rhetoric about
the United States for the first three months after Clinton's June
25-July 3 state visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise and practical move,'' said the Chinese foreign ministry
in July, after Clinton signed a trade measure. And in September,
when Clinton faced possible impeachment, China declared that the
president's ``difficulties'' would not affect American-Chinese
ties, which had reached ``a new stage of development'' thanks in
part to Clinton's ``active contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six weeks, China's tone has perceptively
cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Trade Criticism Unfair,'' headlined an editorial in the
official China Daily on Sept. 30, after U.S. officials warned about
China's estimated $60 billion-a-year trade surplus with America.
Two weeks later, China accused the U.S. House of Representatives of
``a rude infringement of China's sovereignty'' for supporting
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization.

   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ E-mail messages in which Microsoft Corp.
Chairman Bill Gates says he sought a ``win-win'' solution to a
dispute with Apple Computer is part of the evidence Microsoft will
present in its defense against government antitrust charges, Gates
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The notes would counter evidence offered by prosecutors last
week that Microsoft illegally pressured Apple to divide the market
for certain multimedia software, in part by threatening to stop
making products that Apple considered ``critical'' to the future of
its Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Four witnesses have testified for the government so far in the
trial, which began last month in federal court in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting,
said he is ``personally looking forward'' to the defense phase,
when Microsoft gets to present its own witnesses and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wasn't expected to dwell on the antitrust action, he
devoted a major portion of his speech to it and fielded questions
about it from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Restating the key theme of the company's defense, he said the
key principle at stake is its freedom to design its products as it
sees fit _ a freedom he called the ``engine of innovation'' in
business.
</P>
<P>
   With software prices low, the high-tech industry thriving and
venture capital flowing to startups at a record pace, he asked
rhetorically if the lawsuit was brought on behalf of consumers, or
at their expense, on behalf of a ``handful of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't specifically address the government's claim that
Microsoft has shown a pattern of anticompetitive behavior. But he
vowed that by the time the trial is over, Microsoft will show that
the facts in the case ``simply don't support the government's
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   He would be hard-pressed to find a more supportive audience than
his shareholders, who have watched Microsoft's stock soar in value
70 percent in the past year alone. They gave three standing
ovations to Gates and three other top executives in the first five
minutes of the hour-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the antitrust trial was clearly on the minds of
many. One questioner asked for the executives' thoughts on a
possible breakup of the company, a topic about which chief
operating officer Bob Herbold politely but firmly said the company
would not speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the company's relationship with Apple, in light of
critical testimony last week, Gates said Microsoft was the only
company to ``bet our future'' on Apple and have products ready when
the Macintosh was introduced in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft remained Apple's ``greatest supporter'' through
lengthy litigation over the point-and-click interface that Apple
claimed Microsoft had stolen and a later dispute over $1 billion in
patent claims, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied claims that Microsoft had sabotaged Apple's QuickTime
multimedia software and said independent lab tests had shown that
the problems an Apple executive discussed in his trial testimony
were the result of Apple's own bugs, not anything that Microsoft
did.
</P>
<P>
   When introduced at the trial, Gates said, his e-mail messages
will demonstrate that his dealings were ``based on there being a
clear win-win'' for the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of future earnings, Herbold warned shareholders that
Microsoft's revenues aren't likely to grow as quickly as they have
in the past, that it has squeezed almost all the fat out of
expenses and it plans to keep throwing money at research and
development in order to maintain its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, he said, the company is poised to release a
major upgrade of its SQL database program at next week's Comdex
show in Las Vegas, and new versions of its Office productivity
suite and Windows NT, newly renamed Windows 2000, are due out later
in the year.

MARKET FOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS IS HEATING UP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heart of Wall Street is starting to beat again.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate stock and bond sales were arrested by the turmoil in
financial markets in August and September. But a handful of initial
public offerings, or IPOs, especially by high-technology companies,
have shown particular vigor in recent days as institutional
investors return to small-company stocks in a stabilized market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EarthWeb Inc., riding the craze for Internet stocks, tripled
Wednesday in its first day of trading, gaining 3411/16 to close at
4811/16. Investors Wednesday snapped up stock issued by News Corp.,
which spun off a 20 percent stake in its Fox Entertainment Group
division. The Fox stock, which was priced Tuesday at $22.50 a share
and raised $2.8 billion for the company, gained $2 a share
Wednesday in trading and closed at 24 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd asked me three weeks ago if we'd see any IPOs by
year-end I'd have said, `Absolutely not.' The market's changing
very quickly,'' said Kathryn Kirk, a managing director in the
Boston office of investment bank Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. She predicted:
``We'll definitely see more activity by year-end.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy continues to send mixed signals about the future,
and companies nationwide are paring their payrolls. But despite the
summer bear market, investors have pushed the Dow Jones industrials
index up 11.6 percent this year. The S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes
have gained 15.5 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market is also seeing more action. Corporations are
tapping debt investors who have become more receptive to something
other than the extremely safe securities sold by the US government.
Saks Inc., MBIA Inc., and AT&AMP;T Capital Corp. are among the
companies that have waded into the bond market this month.
</P>
<P>
   An interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made money
extraordinarily cheap for companies such as Sprint Corp., which
this week sold $5 billion in the corporate bond market in the
second-largest bond deal in history. These deals have dispelled
concerns, for now, of a liquidity crunch, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in early November eagerly snapped up Raytheon Co.'s
short- and medium-term bonds, which carried yields of 5.7 percent
to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We went to the market with the intention of doing $750
million but the demand was so healthy we ended up placing $1.4
billion,'' said spokeswoman Toni Simonetti. Proceeds of the bond
issue were used to repay higher-yielding debt issued to finance the
acquisitions of the defense units of Hughes Electronics Co. and
Texas Instruments Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, markets were so unstable last summer that bond
investors fled to US Treasuries, pushing yields on the government
bonds to new lows. As markets have calmed, corporate treasurers
``are saying rates are down a lot and I want to take advantage of
it,'' said Robert MacIntosh, a vice president at Eaton Vance
Management in Boston. ``It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disarray last summer was even greater in stocks after a mad rush
to the market early in 1998 as the Dow climbed to its July 17 high.
IPO sales in the third quarter plunged to $6.38 billion, compared
with $11.31 billion in the same quarter last year when the market
was more robust, according to BT Alex. Brown, a Baltimore
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Existing public companies also shied away from raising money in
the stock market: Secondary offerings plunged to $8.85 billion,
compared with $20.25 billion in the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While some uncertainty lingers, financial markets ``seem to be
more tempered than panicky and people have a much more balanced
perspective on it,'' said William Burgess, co-head of corporate
finance in the Boston office of BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of this, while not overwhelming, is notable: A
total of four IPOs came to market in all of September and October,
while the first 11 days of November have seen three, said Jennifer
McBrien, an analyst for Renaissance Capital Corp., a Greenwich,
Conn., money manager and IPO research company.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors are eager to acquire big-name companies.
And McBrien was not surprised to see investors' strong reception to
Fox's deal, because the company has ``such a well-known brand among
investors that it's bound to be popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, whose properties include the Los Angeles Dodgers and the
hit movie ``Titanic,'' originally planned to sell 85 million shares
but ultimately sold 125 million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to EarthWeb and Fox, November has yielded stock
sales by MONY Group Inc., the parent company of one of the nation's
biggest insurers, Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York. MONY's
stock garnered strong enough demand that underwriter Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co. raised the price range on the 11.25 million-share deal to the
$21.50-to-$23.50 a share range, from $18.50-to-$21.50.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Internet stocks are pushing them to irrational
levels. The stock of eBay, for example, sold at $18 a share on
Sept. 24, raising $63 million for the Internet auctioneer. EBay
closed Wednesday at 115 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online-City Search Inc., Infinity Media, and E TEK
Dynamics are expected to test the new issues market in coming
months.

REPUBLICANS SEARCH FOR AN IMAGE TO BURNISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they battle for slots in the House Republican
leadership, the candidates talk passionately about their party's
need for new faces. Or a new generation of leaders. Or better
communication.
</P>
<P>
   But what is it they want to communicate?
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to find a single answer. The majority that Newt
Gingrich built is so deeply splintered that it seemed at times
during the last congressional session to devolve into its 228
component parts, each Republican member of the House with a
different idea of what the party should be.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Eisenhower-era road building party that Rep. Bud
Shuster of Pennsylvania might have envisioned when he pushed
through the he largest public works bill ever before Congress? Or
is it the party of frugality and small government that Rep. Joe
Scarborough of Florida calls for when he criticizes that bill as a
pork-laden abomination?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Teddy Roosevelt-style reformist party that Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut fights for when he calls on
Republicans to overhaul campaign finance law? Or is it a party so
in step with its corporate donors that Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
House majority whip, feels free to pressure trade associations to
hire Republicans as their lobbyists?
</P>
<P>
   How can New York Rep. Sherwood Boehlert's idea of conservation
ever square with Rep. Helen Chenoweth's support of the Idaho timber
industry?
</P>
<P>
   For all his flaws, Gingrich was widely acknowledged as his
party's most skilled conceptualizer and theoretician.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year, with a majority five seats larger than
the one the Republicans will have in the 106th Congress, Gingrich
could make no coherent synthesis out of this swirl of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R.-La., who will take over the speaker's
post, has already made clear that he does not intend to be a
theoretician. Rather he will use his management skills to make sure
legislation is moving through the House. He has also said that
because of the narrow, six-seat Republican majority, he will be
looking to strike compromises with conservatives and moderate
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But watchful Democrats, who now think they could win back the
House in 2000, suspect that such management skills will not be
enough to provide the Republicans with a compelling new message for
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the history of the Republican revolution is written, Bob
Livingston will play Brezhnev to Newt Gingrich's Lenin,'' said Mark
Mellman, a pollster for the House Democratic leadership,
contrasting the latter-day bureaucrat with the Communist
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of Congress care deeply how the bows in the
legislative packages are tied,'' he said. ``The public doesn't care
a whit about that. They care about agenda and message.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Republicans' dilemma is that the political ground
has shifted with their own policy successes.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Ronald Reagan, Republicans have thought that their
philosophy of tax cutting, a strong defense and a scaled-back
federal government would triumph. In fact, until Bill Clinton came
on the scene, both parties had come to believe that the Republicans
had a natural advantage in the race for the presidency that some
called an ``electoral lock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 left the
self-proclaimed Republican revolutionaries with an even greater
sense of omnipotence. Even last week on the election day that led
to his party's loss of seats and his own resignation, Gingrich
called Clinton's presidency ``an ongoing, slow-motion collapse of
the Democratic majority that Franklin Roosevelt created.''
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans, while holding their majority,
have been floundering since Clinton flummoxed them by agreeing to a
balanced budget with tax cuts, signed into law their welfare
overhaul and proclaimed that the ``era of big government'' had
ended.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democrats came out of last Tuesday's election believing that
they now have the edge on policies that the public supports _ on
education, and regulation of health maintenance organizations, the
economy and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in my life that the Democrats are in the
mainstream of the country on issues that people care about,'' said
Douglas Sosnik, 42, a senior adviser to Clinton. The White House is
working to unveil new proposals in these areas and to make another
run at proposals that died this year.
</P>
<P>
   As they wonder where to go, Republicans are uncertain whether to
fight back on this Democratic ground or put renewed emphasis on
traditional Republican issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shays says that the Christian right has to stop having a
disproportionate influence on his party. ``As soon as my leaders
started to jump when the Christian Coalition and Gary Bauer and
others said jump, we lost a lot of voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. David McIntosh of Indiana says moving toward the center
would be a ``recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message in this election was that Reagan Democrats
in particular and Perot independents felt there was not a big
difference between congressional Republicans and President Clinton
so they went back to their traditional habits of voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans believe their best course is to show the
``compassionate conservatism'' of the party's successful governors,
making their party more diverse to reflect the nation's changing
demographics and focusing on the issues that unite all of their
factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the party has the best cohesion when it talks about
fiscal issues,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ``The public needs to
know the Republican Party, as it lowers taxes and lives within its
means, is also watching out for those less fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, who is vying for majority
leader, and Rep. J.C. Watts, the one black Republican in Congress,
who is competing for conference chairman, may be picking up some
currency as leaders who can appeal to women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But even on fiscal policy, Republicans these days have had their
troubles finding unity. All year long, members of Congress battled
over whether to have a tax reduction focused on married couples, or
a tax cut focused on capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   At one point some House Republicans sought a $700 billion tax
reduction over five years. That idea was quickly squelched by
Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Tax reform has brought no greater consensus, with House members
splintering over whether they want a flat tax or to replace the
income tax entirely with a national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best the House Republicans can do is create a few
waves and let the party's presidential candidates move to center
stage to fight out in primaries the issues that have divided
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sosnik, who remembers the Democrats' own plight when Reagan
and Bush held the presidency: ``I do believe at the end of the day
God invented presidential primaries so that parties out of power
can have a leader and have a message.''

FIDELITY TARGETS INHERITANCE, ESTATE PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She turned the public charity arm of the nation's
largest mutual fund firm into the biggest grant maker of its kind,
tapping into the philanthropic ambitions of newly rich investors.
Now Jamie B. Jaffee, who stepped down Wednesday as head of Fidelity
Investments' Charitable Gift Fund, is gearing up to tackle how
investors give money to heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffee will head up a new Fidelity initiative to woo customers
grappling with inheritance and estate planning. The project, still
under wraps, reflects Fidelity's new efforts to tap into the
private side of wealth transfer as well as retain customers at
every stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of customers who face the issue of inheritance
every day,'' said Fidelity marketing head Stephen A. Cone, under
whom Jaffee will work. ``Jamie is in the right position to have the
right product offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffee, 42, was succeeded at the gift fund by Cynthia L. Egan,
43, a nine-year Fidelity executive who most recently worked in
trustee services at Fidelity's trust company.
</P>
<P>
   In its seven-year life under Jaffee, the $1.7 billion Charitable
Gift Fund, the nation's number-one grant maker among public
charities last year, distributed $750 million to 50,000 charities.
In her new role, Jaffee will seek to do for private inheritors what
she did for public charities.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Kobren, publisher of the independent Fidelity Insight
newsletter, said the initiative reflected efforts by privately held
Fidelity to keep investors' dollars from cradle to grave and
beyond. ``Fidelity starts with small investors and then sometimes
loses them when they become big investors'' with pension plans that
must be ``rolled over'' to other investment products upon
retirement, Kobren said.
</P>
<P>
   The Charitable Gift Fund recently attracted criticism for
improperly allowing some donors to direct contributions to private
foundations to buy event tickets and fund college scholarships.
Fidelity put an end to the practice, which was not widespread, last
summer, and was reaffirmed as a public charity by the Internal
Revenue Service in August.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffee's new title is executive vice president of retail
marketing at Fidelity's Personal Investments &AMP; Brokerage Group, the
fund giant's main sales, distribution, and marketing unit. Cone
said Jaffee would coordinate four areas, including the gift fund,
college investment trust unit, regular trust section, and personal
investments review group.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has really looked at these four areas holistically at
Fidelity,'' Cone said. Jaffee's brief, which Fidelity termed `a
major wealth transfer initiative', would not lead investors to give
less to charities and more to heirs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Community foundations, which do not have corporate Fidelity's
advertizing budgets, have complained that Fidelity's gift fund has
an unfair advantage in attracting charitable donors. Fidelity,
which had total assets under management of $645.4 billion as of
Sept. 30, counters that it has made philanthropy more accessible to
ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   For as little as $10,000, the gift fund lets investors direct
money to charities or set up foundations. It invests in some
Fidelity mutual funds but does not pay donors any money.

 UNDATED: their status.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers and advocates for immigrants agree. They too
are advising their clients to avoid traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the whole thing is a mess and there is
no easy way for them to go,'' said Ann Pilsbury, the director of
Central American Legal Assistance, a center in Brooklyn that helps
Central Americans with immigration issues. ``The fact of the matter
is that nobody can guarantee people that it won't have a fatal
effect on their case.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advice of lawyers, consular officials fear that some
people are leaving the country anyway, either because they do not
understand the laws of the United States or because they are so
desperate that they no longer care about returning.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Villalobo, vice consul of El Salvador in New York,
said that about 28 Salvadorans came to his office last week seeking
a special passport to travel home. He expected the number to grow
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been told that their families are lost, and they
want to look for them,'' Villalobo said. ``They must have a strong
motivation to make a decision to leave like that, without a
guaranteed return.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos Mateo Hernandez, a Honduran who is applying for political
asylum, may just be reaching the point of desperation Villalobo
worries about. After almost two weeks without news from his wife
and five children, he was able to speak to his family Sunday. He
learned his family lost the crops they depend on and, therefore,
have nothing to eat. His daughters, 6 and 8, are ill with stomach
problems. Because there are unreachable in a town called Lloro, he
can not send them medicine or money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is I can't be with them when they need me the
most,'' said Hernandez, 35, who lives in Queens, New York City.
``And that is killing me inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Central Americans who are now unable to travel to
their countries applied for political asylum years ago and have
been living in the United States for a dozen years or more. They
have learned English, found jobs, opened bank accounts, paid taxes
and started families, while still not having a legal status in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1997 population updates, prepared by the Census,
there are about 1.3 million Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans
in the United States. That number may include people who are here
legally as well as illegally, because the census does not
categorize individuals by immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of a million of the Salvadorans and Guatemalans,
though, are protected from deportation because the law allows them
to remain in the country while a determination in their political
asylum claims is made. There is a huge backlog of asylum
applications, and the majority of cases have not been heard.
</P>
<P>
   A new law in December halted the asylum process.
</P>
<P>
   The new law granted Nicaraguans permanent residency, but it
offered Salvadorans and Guatemalans the possibility to apply to
avoid their deportation only. It did not address Hondurans who are
here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another story of the injustice visited upon these
people,'' said Philippe Weisz, a lawyer who works with Central
American immigrants in New Jersey. ``Had the Salvadorans and
Guatemalans had the opportunity to have their asylum cases heard
when they fled to the United States, many would be lawful permanent
residents, if not citizens of this country.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: WHY RATES SHOULD BE CUT, AND WHY NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial turmoil makes every meeting of the Federal Reserve an
occasion for frenzied speculation about interest rate cuts. Wall
Street turns out daily tomes of advice, mostly calling on the Fed
to knock rates down a few pegs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stop treatment until the patient is cured,'' Robert
Barbera and Jose Rasco of Hoenig &AMP; Co., for example, recently
warned the Fed. ``We see additional ease as absolutely necessary to
prevent deflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words. But the simple fact is that nothing the Fed
decides at its next meeting, on Tuesday, will matter very much.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Fed isn't very important in setting the monetary
climate for the economy. But if it moves at all, it will surely
move very little. No one need lose sleep worrying about whether the
Fed will stand pat or drop short-term interest rates another
quarter percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's basic problem is that economists never know whether a
recession is around the corner. Nor can they pinpoint the impact of
cuts in short-term interest rates _ the only ones the Fed controls
_ even on long-term rates, much less on spending, prices and
employment. That puts Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues in the position of guessing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Greenspan's testimony invariably retreats into
amorphous conversation about balancing of risks. In an
unpredictable world, the Fed deliberates which course of action _
in next week's case, a small easing or standing pat _ poses the
graver economic risk.
</P>
<P>
   The case for cutting rates starts with the fact that the economy
is slowing and could use a nudge. Exports of tractors and other
manufactured goods are plummeting. Employment in manufacturing fell
by 50,000 jobs last quarter, and has shrunk by more than 200,000
since January. Service jobs are picking up the slack, but growth is
expected to fall to around 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, productivity rose at a gaudy annualized rate of 2.3
percent last quarter, meaning that companies can raise wages
without having to raise prices _ a brake on inflation that gives
the Fed room to ease.
</P>
<P>
   The best case for easing is made by Professor Alan Blinder of
Princeton, a former vice chairman of the Fed. Blinder concedes that
the Fed's two earlier rate cuts this year have calmed financial
markets. A measure of investor fear _ the gap between interest
rates that investors charge risky corporate borrowers and safe
government borrowers _ has shrunk since Greenspan by word and deed
told investors he would not allow the economy to starve for credit.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap, Blinder says, remains well above the historical
norm for an economy that continues to grow respectably.
</P>
<P>
   Blinder focuses on the ``real'' federal funds rate, which
subtracts the expected rate of inflation from the interest rate
that banks charge each other for overnight loans. Today, the real
funds rate is, by Blinder's analysis, quite high, in excess of 2.5
percent. ``That puts a mild tug on growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tug made sense when the economy was roaring along. But ``now
that the economy is visibly slowing,'' Blinder said, ``it is
appropriate to turn the Fed's mild tug on the economy into at least
a neutral stance whereby monetary policy is no longer holding the
economy back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blinder is not calling on the Fed to do anything bold. He
notes that there is a risk of too much monetary ease, primarily in
the fueling of a still-overheated stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University makes the best
case for standing pat. He does not strongly oppose a quarter-point
rate cut. But neither is he enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of the American economy _ investors that are too
scared to lend _ will not be cured by modest interest rate cuts,''
he said. Friedman fears that investors are coming to depend on a
steady diet of rate cuts, in which case the Fed risks trapping
itself either in meeting those expectations or touching off a harsh
response on stock and bond markets if it disappoints them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one cut leads to another,'' he added, ``the Fed will wind
up cutting rates by a percentage point or more, satisfying the
expectation of bond traders along the way but risking
overstimulating the economy and driving the stock market to
unrealistic new highs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Mishkin of Columbia University says that rising stock
prices and low unemployment rates weaken the case for easing. He
applauded Greenspan for moving early to ward off the impact of
financial turmoil abroad, thus proving ``that the Fed would not
repeat the mistakes of Japan, where monetary authorities have sat
back while the economy sank.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warns, the threat of inflation should not be casually
dismissed. ``The Fed has sometimes overly stimulated the economy
when it was weak and triggered rising inflation that eventually
forced the Fed to crack down hard, sending the economy into
reverse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Greenspan's terminology, Mishkin concluded that ``the
current balance of risks is balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the case for further cuts next week is
tentative on either side of the ledger. Indeed, even the Wall
Street experts who call on the Fed to cut rates to save the economy
may exercise a different judgment when they invest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on bets that investors are making on the course of federal
funds rate in the next several weeks, Bridgewater Associates
calculates that investors set the probability of a Fed easing next
week at about 50 percent. Apparently, when Wall Street experts vote
with money, they judge the case for Fed easing a tossup.

LOCKOUT CONTINUES WITH NO END IN SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is what it has come down to: The executive director of the
NBA Players Association Wednesday held a conference call to reveal
that he may call the league Thursday to see if commissioner David
Stern wants to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NBA lockout continues with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday more than 30 players met with union chief Billy Hunter
for about five hours and decided that they needn't offer anything
new for discussion. Hunter did say he might call Stern to see if a
meeting could be arranged to get the stalled talks going again.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hunter said he expected no response from the league,
adding that Stern and the owners are waiting for the players to
start missing paychecks, the first of which are due Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period hasn't passed where our players are expected to
cave,'' Hunter said in a conference call with reporters. ``(The
players) have not broken ranks, and I can assure you we're not
going to break ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he thinks the league is pointing to a Jan. 1
start-up date after making the players ``sweat a little.'' He
added, however, that after meeting with the union's executive
committee and player representatives, he finds that the vast
majority of the players still are united and that there is a
``greater resolve'' to stick to their latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The sides are far apart on the key issue: how to divide the
lucrative NBA pie. The players received 57 percent last year and
are disinclined to take less. The league is asking for a 50-50
split. Various plans have been discussed to make sure neither side
gets more than agreed to, but those plans are meaningless without a
number with which to work.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conference call, Hunter revealed that the union is
trying to stage an exhibition in Las Vegas the first week of
December. He indicated that Michael Jordan would attend but not
necessarily play, that the game might feature players from the
three Olympic Dream Teams, and that Showtime had expressed interest
in televising it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are interested in keeping themselves busy, and we
think that one way to do it is have some sort of an exhibition
competition,'' Hunter said. ``The proceeds would go to the
(union).''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter made no reference to the game during his 45-minute
conference call. Instead, he again criticized the NBA for refusing
to negotiate and for thinking that the players will crack once the
paychecks don't arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Most players are paid twice a month, so already, they will miss
both November checks. Given the glacial pace of negotiations, it
seems likely they also will miss the Dec. 15 check; the league has
said there will have to be a three- to four-week period before the
start of the season for teams to have training camps and for free
agents to test the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players have taken a stand, and it's a stand based on
principle,'' Hunter said. ``If you think their demeanor is going to
change on Nov. 15 or Nov. 30, you're going to be let down. They are
prepared. But that is the antiquated thinking of the league. Well,
Nov. 15 is going to come and go, as is Nov. 30.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no serious discussions since Oct. 28, a pace
that has some agents a little upset. There was a brief meeting last
Friday, at which time the union was thinking of ``tweaking'' its
latest proposal. It didn't. Stern has authorized clubs to talk to
players about the league's proposal _ the NBA said the chats should
be ``informational only'' _ thinking it will show the majority that
the league's offer is equitable.
</P>
<P>
   The union disagrees. Hunter said the union has been making all
the concessions _ he said some were historic in relation to other
sports _ and won't offer anything new because ``we'd basically be
bargaining against ourselves.''

NEELY   -- OLDER, HEAVIER -- BACK ON THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ He stepped on the ice at 11:38 a.m., right
after coach Pat Burns and before forward Anson Carter. For the next
47 minutes, all eyes _ those of teammates, coaches, management, and
media _ were on Cam Neely, who Wednesday participated in his first
Bruins practice since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Neely acknowledged he is a few years older and a few
pounds heavier since his forced retirement before the 1996-97
season because of a chronic hip injury. But the once-fearsome right
wing said he will know in the next 12 days whether he will be able
to come back. The Bruins have unofficially earmarked Nov. 23 as the
day they expect to determine whether Neely has a legitimate chance
to return.
</P>
<P>
   Neely said Wednesday's workout, which was impressive, given his
long layoff, had only one guideline: ``Get off when you feel like
you're going to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can still shoot,'' he said. ``I can still pass. I
don't feel like I've lost a lot of skill. It's a matter of
conditioning and how my health is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, beginning in midseason of 1995-96, when Neely
couldn't sleep at night because he was in constant pain. In an
interview with the Globe in Edmonton right after he played what
turned out to be his final game in Anaheim Feb. 21, 1996, Neely
said that if his extreme discomfort continued, he would have to
consider retirement. It was thought in the months that followed
that the bone spurs in his arthritic hip would lead to a hip
replacement by the time he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Now physical therapist Dan Dyrek, whom experts believe added
five years to the career of Celtics great Larry Bird, has helped
give Neely a completely different outlook. Neely felt so positive
about his progress that he turned down job offers from the
Islanders, who wanted him as an assistant coach, and Fox-TV, which
wanted him as a hockey analyst in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would really be a fool for not giving it another
opportunity,'' he said. ``I didn't want three or four years down
the road to say, `What if I did give it the extra two or three
months and work a little harder to see if I could play again?' I
didn't want to be upset with myself down the road. If in another 10
days my hip tells me I can't do this, then I can absolutely walk
away and say I gave it an honest effort and I gave my hip a chance
I never thought I'd be able to give it and it just didn't work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely has never found anything outside the sport that stirred
the kind of career passion he had while playing in the NHL. In
addition, he didn't go out of the game on his own terms and has had
a hard time accepting that. But Neely said he won't jeopardize his
long-term health chasing a dream. Judging from his performance in
drills Wednesday, his skills are still very evident, though his
conditioning is obviously lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to put hockey completely out of my mind
because it wasn't my decision to pack it in,'' he said. ``I still
feel skillwise I can play, it was just healthwise. I do love
playing the game and I do love being around the guys and in this
atmosphere. It's just a matter of getting the tissues and muscles
back into condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic Dyrek has been able to work revolves around extensive
stretching exercises that lengthen the tendons and muscles in the
hip joint. The regimen got Neely to the point where he was able to
work out privately with coach Pat Burns and assistant Jacques
Laperriere, who endorsed full participation in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have bone spurs in the hip socket, but my hip socket
was compressed and the muscles and tendons have shortened,'' he
said. ``(Dyrek) went in and broke down the scar tissue. We're
trying to elongate those muscles and tissues around the hip. If I
skate four days in a row and my hip is barking at me, that's all
she wrote. I'm not going to go through the pain I went through when
I went to pack it in. That's just not worth it to me. Four days of
good, hard skating may tell me, `Hey, this is just not happening.'
My hip is allowing me to take it to this point. Will it allow me to
get to another point? I don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Neely's balky left knee, which was the subject of
daily updates for a couple of seasons, is the least of his
problems. It was once theorized that the reason Neely wound up with
a right hip problem was that he was overcompensating for the knee
problem on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee is so much better than it ever was, it doesn't
concern me at all,'' he said. ``I feel if I can come back, I hope I
can come back to an everyday player and practice every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He is tempering his enthusiasm, as are the Bruins, because all
partries know one day won't decide anything. Yet the first day
wasn't discouraging, and perhaps that is encouragement enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a couple years of pain in everyday life with my hip,
and one thing I said was I don't want to get better to get worse,''
said Neely. ``The only way I'm going to continue this is if I know
I won't jeopardize any long-term health. If I do continue this,
there will be periodic treatments with my hip. Hopefully, it won't
give me any problems in my future. That's really what I want to
avoid. If it shows it's going to do that, then I won't continue to
try to play. My hip felt pretty good. I feel it more in the longer
strides. If my lungs felt as good as my hip, I'd be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Neely, who defined the position of power forward in
the NHL with his punishing hits, fierce play in front of the net,
and cannon shot off the right wing, said contact doesn't concern
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the least of my worries, getting physical with this,''
he said. ``It's more just use of the muscles and tendons around the
joint than anything about taking contact or banging against the
wall. I expect to experience some pain for some part of the day.
Hopefully by the end of the day, it will be gone and (today) I
won't feel anything again. It all depends on how that goes. If I
feel it (today), I can expect to feel it worse the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Neely won't do is come back at half speed. Reason No.
1 is that he wouldn't be able to make a contribution. Reason No. 2,
which is more significant, is that his pride won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't feel I can play at a level I want to play at, I
won't continue this,'' he said. ``It's just not worth it to me (to)
not play as well as I'd like to play. The Bruins are giving me an
opportunity to take it to another level and get some quality
practice time that I can't get by myself. I'm not concerned about
anything else right now except giving my hip another test.''
</P>
<P>
   President-general manager Harry Sinden, who was in attendance
with assistant GM Mike O'Connell, said he couldn't help but be
enthused about the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm excited, but I'm realistic, too,'' said Sinden. ``I
don't see any hitch in his movement, but who knows if he wakes up
tomorrow and ... it's touch-and-go. I'm as realistic as he is. The
odds are against him. He feels better with the treatments he's been
getting that he began a few months ago and he thought, `Well, let's
keep going until something tells me to stop,' which might happen
and then we'll all hang our heads. I'm keeping my expectations
where they should be. I've told the coaches the same thing, and the
players understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sinden can't help being enthused about the prospects of
getting a 50-goal scorer back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those players you never forget, not only because
of what he did on the ice but the attitude he brought to the game
was fantastic,'' said Sinden. ``We've had a number of players like
that _ (Bobby) Orr, (Ray) Bourque, (Terry) O'Reilly, and (Gerry)
Cheevers _ and I don't forget those players, either. They really
brought an attitude to the team that helped us immensely. It's nice
to have him around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said Neely is covered for medical insurance, an
arrangement similar to that for players who come into training camp
for a tryout. Neely's representative, Jay Fee, who was also in
attendance, said he and Sinden have had preliminary discussions
about a potential contract.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Neely will continue to skate every day (with the
exception of tomorrow, when the club will be in New York to face
the Rangers), and only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie script,'' said right wing Steve Heinze, one of
the few Bruins left who played with Neely. ``Obviously, it's going
to attract attention. I like having him here as a friend in the
locker room. But we don't have a 50-goal scorer. On the ice, he
attracts attention by the style he plays, the big hits, the fights,
and the goals. What else do people come out to watch hockey for?
The bone-crunching hits, the flashy scoring, the fights _
obviously, that's what people come to watch. No knock to anyone in
this locker room, but we don't have one guy who's doing all of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Joe Thornton said he had met Neely but knew him mostly as
``a scoring machine. He's just a tank out there. He used to run
over guys. It's a little strange, but I think it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, Bourque, and Don Sweeney had a lot of experience with
Neely. Defenseman Kyle McLaren was just beginning his career as
Neely's appeared to be ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurting for sure (when the two were on the same
squad),'' said McLaren, whose tenure overlapped Neely's during the
defenseman's rookie season of 1995-96. ``Still, he can probably
beat me up, even today. His worst day is probably one of my best
days. I thought he looked good, real good. He was skating well and
shooting well. I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Sergei Samsonov was the lone Bruin who didn't skate
Wednesday. Samsonov, who injured the bursa sac in his elbow during
last Thursday's game against Toronto, had to have the sac drained.
He's expected to play Friday ... The Bruins learned that former
goaltender Frank ``Mr. Zero'' Brimsek, who played for them in the
1930s and '40s, died at the age of 83 at his home in Minnesota.
Brimsek played in 444 games for Boston, compiling a record of
230-144-70 with 35 shutouts.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARYS, KAN. _ To a passer-by, this small town has an idyllic
air. Its wide main street is packed with pickup trucks by day,
empty and serene at night. Many of the women and little girls wear
long skirts, even for riding bicycles. Crime is so rare that the
police statistics include ``cat bite.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, amid rumors of anti-government paramilitary groups
and hidden caches of guns, federal and state agents combed St.
Marys and its surroundings for links to Timothy McVeigh and Terry
Nichols, who had traveled in the area just before the Oklahoma City
bombing. The town of 2,000 people quickly became stereotyped as a
hotbed of heartland discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the business that the two Oklahoma City
bombers had here is still unknown. Talk of paramilitary groups has
gone underground and camouflage fatigues are generally out of
fashion. A closer look at St. Mary's, with some of the glare of the
bombing faded, reveals something about the environment that helped
create the right-wing movement, but it is also clear that St. Marys
was never quite the way it was often portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, this town that was known at the time as the last
civilized stop on the Oregon Trail, is a peaceful mix of
passionately held and often conflicting visions of American life.
</P>
<P>
   St. Marys lies 30 miles northwest of Topeka on the banks of the
Kansas River amid miles of corn and pasture land. From the very
first, it was a place where dreams were made and broken.
</P>
<P>
   The town began in 1848 as a Jesuit mission for the Potawatomi, a
tribe driven out of Indiana and forced to walk to Kansas, more than
600 miles, along what became known as the Trail of Death. Then,
during the Gold Rush, 300,000 adventurers passed through.
</P>
<P>
   These days, said Larry Teske, a St. Marys builder, ``It hasn't
been a covered wagon, it's a station wagon or a van,'' and the
families in them have come to stay. Teske has designed more than
100 new houses, many large enough to accommodate families with 9 or
10 children.
</P>
<P>
   While the farm population has been shrinking for decades, that
of St. Marys has grown. Some newcomers are government employees and
factory workers who commute to Topeka. But the main attraction is a
religious community established 20 years ago when the Society of
St. Pius X, a schismatic Roman Catholic group, bought the Jesuit
seminary and founded St. Marys Academy and College.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Pius families, committed to the old Latin mass, speak of
the need to return to traditional ways, without television, without
feminism, without welfare, without interference from the state. It
is they who give the town the appearance of a small-town America
that does not exist anymore.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pius members in and around the town have come to outnumber
the people in St. Marys itself, many of whom belong to another
large Roman Catholic church. The splits and silences between the
two groups are often acute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got regular Catholics in this town, and you have this
other outfit on the very conservative side,'' said James Mees, a
member of the City Commission. ``You get a disproportionate number
of right-wingers, a disproportionate number of John Birchers,
pro-gun and anti-government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months before the Oklahoma City bombing, Michigan and
Kansas paramilitary groups were recruiting in the St. Marys area,
and rumors flew that weapons were hidden on the academy grounds and
that paramilitary groups trained there.
</P>
<P>
   The Pottawatomie County sheriff, Anthony Metcalf, said with some
exasperation that he had ``walked every inch of the campus''
without finding anything. After the bombing, the academy's
headmaster, the Rev. Ramon Angles, denounced paramilitary groups in
his sermons.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of his congregation, however, joined the
Freemen, who refuse to acknowledge the authority of the federal
government and the banking system. For a brief time, they had a
compound north of town, with a ``Keep Out'' sign warning that the
property was not part of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That compound was instantly abandoned after the FBI raided the
Freeman compound in Montana. But the local group, which included
two prison guards, a former guard and an former police officer, had
written $1 million in fraudulent Freemen checks on nonexistent
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year Richard Keyes III, a bookish young factory
worker, left St. Marys to join the separatist Republic of Texas.
When its leaders surrendered in a siege by the police, Keyes
vanished into the mountains. Caught months later, he is now serving
90 years in prison on charges that include kidnapping and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the town's fault, and it was not the family's
fault,'' Dorothy Hoobler, who writes for The St. Marys Star and is
the town's unofficial historian, said of Keyes. ``I may not condone
what he did, but I don't think it should be a reflection on the
entire town, and that was the way it was made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Newcomers: What Is Appealing Isn't Always Found
</P>
<P>
   Leo Petit, 38, a self-employed plumber, moved here 11 years ago
from Glen Falls, N.Y. ``A lot of people thought that I was crazy,
packing up the family and moving halfway across the country,''
Petit said. But ``the old ways were good enough for my mom and dad,
good enough for my grandparents and for the saints and martyrs.''
</P>

   Petit, his wife, Denise, and their 10 children live in Belvue, a
small town west of St. Marys. ``I liked it here from the
beginning,'' Mrs. Petit said. ``Everyone has always been very, very
friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Heather, 17, who graduated this year from St. Marys
Academy, said she had no regrets about the school's strictness,
including a policy that only boys can play high school sports. ``It
doesn't help form the feminine nature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Petit said: ``Is it heaven here? No. Are there problems here?
Sure. I'm just trying to hang on. You never know what the future
will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl and Helga Konecy would agree, for entirely different
reasons. Konecy quit his job managing a power plant in Colorado,
sold the family's home with an orchard, a lake and enough land to
keep horses, and moved his wife and two daughters to St. Marys in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing they knew about Kansas was tornadoes, so the
Konecys built their house into the side of a hill on an expanse of
land overlooking the power plant where Konecy found a job. But in
1984, they parted ways with the St. Pius X community, which they
now regard as a cult, and found themselves stranded here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to return to what we used to have,'' Mrs.
Konecy said. ``We paid a price. We paid a heavy price.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its quaintness, St. Marys is part of mainstream America.
Families drive to Topeka to shop in the malls, and teen-agers
Rollerblade in the park and complain of nothing to do. The public
high school embraces all kinds of opportunities for girls as well
as boys.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the town park are a road and picnic shelter named for a
pioneer family, the Urbanskys. Sidney Urbansky, twice elected
mayor, was the last of the line. When he died in 1977 at the age of
94, no rabbi was available for his funeral, so a Protestant
minister read from the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Warren and Diane Sickel arrived in St. Marys and
found they were the only Jewish family in town. They still are.
</P>
<P>
   Sickel, the music teacher at St. Marys High School, has
organized a community band and participates in the town's annual
interfaith Thanksgiving service. But they also regularly make the
30-mile drive to Temple Beth Shalom in Topeka, and during what they
call the ``December dilemma'' each year, they put a lighted Star of
David in front of their house.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sickel, an elementary teacher, said she likes the sense of
continuity _ ``I've taught all eight kids in the same family''_ and
the security she feels.
</P>
<P>
   The Society of St. Pius X has been criticized for anti-Semitism
in remarks its leaders have made about the Holocaust. But the
Sickels said they had not felt those sentiments here, and Mrs.
Sickel said she knew what she was talking about. ``My mother had a
swastika burned to the ground on the lawn of her condominium in
Shawnee Mission,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Farmers: An Embittered Few In Declining Breed
</P>
<P>
   Kansas had its second largest wheat harvest on record this year,
but the price of wheat has been going down. To stay in business,
farmers have to keep cutting costs, said Doug Musick, the county
agent for the Cooperative Extension Service of Kansas State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The profit margin is so low and land prices are so high _ $2,000
an acre for river-bottom land _ that ``if you don't have land given
to you or a relative to help you, you probably can't start farming
and be successful,'' Musick said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ronnau farms 1,600 acres just west of St. Marys,
including 475 acres his grandfather bought in 1896. He rents land
from 10 farms that could not survive after their owners grew old or
died. ``Every house you see, a farmer lived in it and farmed that
ground,'' Ronnau said quietly. ``Now the people who live in the
houses don't have anything to do with the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six percent of Pottawatomie County's population is still
rural, but 75 percent of its $300 million tax base comes from the
coal-fired Jeffrey Energy Center, which generates one-third of the
state's electricity. Its 600-foot stacks can be seen for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Signs along highways here say, ``One Kansas Farmer Feeds 128
People Plus You.'' Those are fighting words to Dee Matzke, 62, who
keeps some dairy cows on land near the county seat, Westmoreland,
where she lives in a trailer with her husband, Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five to 87 percent of the population today are
parasites,'' she said over a glass of iced tea. ``I've really got
to work to feed these other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first husband, Arthur Kirk, was shot dead by a police
special weapons team in 1984, after a face-off with sheriff's
deputies serving foreclosure papers on his farm in Cairo, Neb. Kirk
fired on the police and they shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Matzke, too, lost his farm to foreclosure, and in 1985 he went
to prison for selling cattle that secured a loan from his bank. His
first wife died of cancer a year after his release. He met Dee at
farm protest meetings, but these days they expect nothing more from
angry farmers. ``At this point, they've lost it, survived and moved
on with their lives,'' Mrs. Matzke said.
</P>
<P>
   Matzke said: ``I fought the government five to seven years and
came out a loser. You never win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Changing Face: Defining Folks In Changing Times
</P>
<P>
   The decline of small family farms in places like Kansas, with
its consequent depopulation and anger, is the backdrop for the rise
of radical right-wing groups, but it is not the cause, said Leonard
Zeskind, the president of the Institute for Research and Education
on Human Rights in Kansas City, Mo., who has studied such groups
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers, he said, have not taken up arms, working instead
through organizations like the Farmers' Union to press for change
``along legitimate and realistic ways.''
</P>
<P>
   What caused the reemergence of anti-government sentiment,
paramilitary groups and the Freemen in places like St. Marys was
the shift in the nation's political climate ``in which the issue of
`Who is an American?' is much more up for grabs,'' Zeskind said.
``It used to be that Americans were the people who were not
Communists,'' he said. ``Now communism isn't around to
differentiate ourselves. Who are we now?''
</P>
<P>
   Zeskind added that Common Law theories, embraced by right-wing
groups, ``construct a white Christian nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pottawatomie County, like many other areas of the United
States, that also happens to define the population. St. Marys is
overwhelmingly Christian and white. The American Indians were
pushed out more than 100 years ago, and there are no blacks and few
Hispanics residents.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about who belongs here have existed ``from the
very beginning,' said Mrs. Hoobler, the town historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town was settled by different groups of immigrants,'' she
said. ``It probably is not that much different now.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancestor of several St. Marys families was Theresa Slavin, a
Potawatomi who made the walk from Indiana at the age of 3. At 12,
she was orphaned and brought to St. Marys. At 25, she married James
Slavin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Potawatomi in this area moved to Oklahoma after
1870. The rooms in which they received final payment for their
land, in what a journalist called ``one of the most utterly
forlorn, dismal, and miserable spectacles ever witnessed,'' are
preserved in a museum here.
</P>
<P>
   But only recently have some families felt able to acknowledge
their Potawatomi forbears, said Marjorie Guerich, a
great-granddaughter of Theresa Slavin. Just this fall, she helped
organize a re-enactment of the Trail of Death.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Pearl, who works in his family's farm equipment and
agricultural chemical business, is another of Mrs. Slavin's
descendants. He works at something that might be expected in a
place when old ways of life keep changing and no one knows the
shape of the new. He is using tractor-mounted computers and global
positioning devices to help farmers map the soil quality of their
fields.

ANALYSIS: TO REAP REAL CHANGE IN IRAQ, MILITARY FORCE MAY NOT
SUFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-U.S., IRAQ-U.S.-BUILDUP, IRAQ-U.N.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton ponders a military strategy
against Iraq, and the Pentagon once more picks its targets and
programs its cruise missiles for an attack, the debate at the White
House is whether to simply punish President Saddam Hussein, or to
try to change his political course by force, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States prepared Wednesday to send enough military
firepower to the Persian Gulf to batter Iraq for weeks. No battle
plans have been selected yet, but nothing short of a sustained
assault involving hundreds, perhaps thousands of bombs and missiles
can break the Iraqi leader's will and stop Baghdad's defiance of
the United Nations and the rebuilding of its arsenals, the
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be required is very substantial bombing, lasting
for weeks,'' said Zalmay Khalizad, a former senior Pentagon and
State Department official. ``But you cannot be certain that even
that will do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have to go get Saddam Hussein to force him to change
his mind,'' he said. ``It will either require a lot of bombing or a
lot more than bombing to coerce him. Without that, we may simply
acquiesce to his possession of these weapons and to his presence
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wants to punish Saddam for defying U.N. weapons
inspectors, that is easy: He can bomb Iraq for days, pounding the
leader's palaces and weapons depots into dust.
</P>
<P>
   But this may not end the threat posed by a ruler who knows how
to build biological and chemical weapons, and has hidden away the
wherewithal to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Iraq is a very difficult one and it will not be
solved magically by an air campaign,'' said John Deutch, the former
director of Central Intelligence. Bombs alone, he said, cannot
``destroy all the stock of biological or chemical agents or
missiles that Saddam Hussein has,'' or alter the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Washington believes that friendly persuasion will
force Iraq to resume cooperating with the United Nations weapons
inspectors, who for nearly seven years have sought to discover and
destroy Iraq's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen says the United States may try
``degrading his capability of manufacturing the weapons of mass
destruction'' with cruise missiles and smart bombs. But without
intensive inspections, these capabilities can be rebuilt over time.
And the inspections regime has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, U.S. commanders publicly identified likely
targets of a new attack in response to Iraq's rejection of
inspections. They include the Special Republican Guard, a
26,000-strong military unit that protects the Iraqi leader and his
weaponry, and the suspected weapons sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Forewarned, Iraq has taken measures to safeguard those targets.
So it now appears that nothing short of an attack greater than any
the United States has launched since the Persian Gulf war in 1991
could permanently damage the institutions that shore up Saddam and
shield his secret arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says the crisis will end only if the United Nations ends
the harsh economic sanctions imposed after the gulf war. Those
sanctions contribute to the deaths of up to 7,000 children a month
and are embittering the Iraqi people, according to Deniam in power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the United States again hit Iraq with cruise missiles,
attacking targets in the south to punish the Iraqi military for
invading opposition strongholds in the north. The missiles achieved
little of lasting military or political consequence. In fact, in
the judgment of U.S. intelligence officials, the Iraqi leader
emerged stronger politically.
</P>
<P>
   But without a likely successor who might lead Iraq, a U.S.
effort to undermine Saddam could could reap a whirlwind. Gen.
Anthony Zinni of the Marines, commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf, warned Congress last month, ``A weakened, fragmented,
chaotic Iraq _ which could happen if this isn't done carefully _ is
more dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam is now.''

DOW SINKS 40.16 AMID FADING HOPES FOR RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell broadly Wednesday, reversing an
early advance, as investors pondered what now seems little better
than an even chance that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term
interest rates again next week.
</P>
<P>
   The third consecutive session of declines was brightened by
Intel's projection of stronger-than-expected revenue for this
quarter, which lifted some technology stocks, and by enthusiastic
receptions for three initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly this was a day in which the tone seemed to be set by
investors cashing profits following a month of large gains amid
uncertainty not only about the Fed's meeting next Tuesday but about
the possibility of military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very powerful rally in a very short amount of
time,'' said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line
Asset Management. At a time when many believe that foreign
instability seems at least to be getting no worse, he called the
Fed's decision whether to make a third round of rate reductions ``a
very close call.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss of 40.16
points, at 8,823.82. It was up as much as 72 points in early
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The much broader Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks shed 7.29
points to close at 1,120.97. Even the Nasdaq market, which is
dominated by technology stocks and had posted five consecutive
advances, closed 3.51 points lower, at 1,862.11, and the Russell
2000 index of smaller issues fell 3.39 points, to 393.47.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little surprising that the Intel rally didn't take
the Nasdaq higher,'' said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard
Rosenblatt &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Intel surged 6 1/8, to 103 11/16, while Texas Instruments rose 5
9/16, to 69 7/16, and Micron Technology was up 3 3/8, to 47 5/8,
after hitting a 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   But most Internet stocks slumped, with Yahoo dropping 11 9/16,
America Online 7 3/8 and Ebay 14 15/16, part of what Epstein called
``pretty good profit-taking'' after sharp run-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculative money might have been redeployed into the new
issues, especially Earthweb, which sold 2.1 million shares at 14
and saw them soar as high as 59 before closing at 48 11/16, a 247
percent increase and the second-biggest first-day rise ever,
according to Securities Data. The record was Broadcast.com's
offering in July, which went from 18 to 74 before settling at 62
3/4, a 250 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   And in what was the third-largest initial offering on record,
News Corp. sold a 20 percent stake in Fox Entertainment Group, a
124.8-million-share deal that was priced late Tuesday at 22 1/2.
The shares traded as high as 25 5/8 Wednesday before closing at 24
1/2, an unusually big premium for a multibillion-dollar offering.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue to trade for the first time was MONY Group, the
insurance company formerly known as Mutual of New York, now owned
by shareholders instead of policy-holders. The shares, priced at 23
1/2, finished at 28 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market, from which stocks sometimes take their cue, was
closed in observance of Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were mixed overseas, closing up 4.28 percent in Hong
Kong, 2.27 percent in Tokyo and less than 1 percent in London and
Frankfurt. The main declines were 2.97 percent in Rio de Janeiro
and 1.13 percent in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest skittishness over Iraq, the usual demand for
oil shares was missing, with most fractionally mixed. Arco fell 1
15/16, to 66 5/8, and Phillips fell 1 1/4, to 43 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were among the prominent losers Wednesday, with
Merck, Pfizer and Schering-Plough more than two points lower and
Lilly and Abbott down more than one.
</P>
<P>
   In a soft financial sector, BankAmerica was down 2 5/16, to 57,
the main loser, but J.P. Morgan jumped 1 3/16, to 98 13/16, amid
continuing takeover rumors and word that it won Phelps Dodge's
401(k) business.
</P>
<P>
   American Express lost 1/2, to 92 9/16, despite news that Warren
Buffett bought 1.08 million shares in early October, the first time
the multibillionaire investor had raised his Amex stake since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler edged up 1/8, at 47 1/16, in its last week of trading
before the company's shares disappear because of its merger with
Germany's Daimler-Benz. Analysts said index funds may already have
disposed of their Chrysler shares. Safeway, taking Chrysler's place
in the S&AMP;P 500, climbed 1 3/16, to 49 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was 715.8 million shares,
up from 667.5 million Tuesday. There were 33 new highs against 19
new lows, but 1,797 issues declined while only 1,215 rose.

U.S. PREPARES FOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon bolstered forces in the Persian Gulf
Wednesday as President Clinton said he was preparing for possible
military action against Iraq unless Saddam Hussein stops defying
international arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council met in New York in emergency
session as Clinton ordered his national security team to develop
military options.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen signed an order dispatching
another 129 military aircraft and 3,000 Army troops to Kuwait. The
aircraft carrier Enterprise also was moving toward the region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already has 170 fighter jets and bombers and
20 Navy ships, several with the capability of firing Tomahawk
cruise missiles, stationed near Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In response to U.S. warnings, the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) evacuated its 400 arms experts and staff from
Baghdad. The State Department authorized nonessential personnel to
leave neighboring Kuwait and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking at Veteran's Day ceremonies at Arlington
National Cemetery, said failure to act against Saddam could
encourage the Iraqi leader to act recklessly and could undermine
the credibility of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to hope, indeed, pray, that Saddam will comply,
but we must be prepared to act if he does not,'' Clinton told
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   As he has repeatedly in the past 12 months, Saddam instigated
the international crisis by refusing on Oct. 31 to cooperate with
U.N. arms inspectors charged with determining the status of Iraq's
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities. The Iraqi
dictator is demanding that international economic sanctions, which
have crippled the oil-rich nation, be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq agreed to the inspections as part of the 1991 peace accord
dictated by U.S.-led allies who repelled Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait. But in recent years, the inspections have amounted to a
cat-and-mouse game as Saddam sought to thwart the experts.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the additional forces moving to the gulf
include 12 B-52 bombers armed with Tomahawk missiles, six B-1
bombers and 12 F-117A stealth fighters capably of avoiding radar.
Other fighter jets and support aircraft also are part of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's order also adds two Patriot anti-missile batteries to
the region in addition to the three already there. The Patriot
system was used in the 1991 Persian Gulf War to counter Iraq's Scud
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the first units will be leaving in the next few
days. It means that (President Clinton) has more options at his
disposal. It gives him more flexibility,'' said Ken Bacon, the
Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 23,500 U.S. military personnel in the
region, including 1,500 Army troops already in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright delayed her departure for
Malaysia where Clinton and other Pacific Rim leaders plan to gather
this weekend for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, Albright's spokesman, said Saddam would receive no
warnings if the United States decides to strike. ``We don't see the
point or the need for further warning,'' Rubin said. ``The clarity
of the situation in terms of what he needs to do does not lend
itself to diplomatic negotiation. It lends itself to Saddam Hussein
reversing course.''
</P>
<P>
   Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said during several television interviews that Saddam has
had enough warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision has not been made as to the use of force,'' Shelton
said on NBC's ``Today Show.'' ``I think Saddam clearly understands,
as we have said publicly, that all options are on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke to foreign ministers in Russia, France and
Britain as well as U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and informed
them of the decision to also reduce its State Department personnel
in U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Israel. Iraq fired on Israel during
the 1991 conflict although Israel was not a party to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, the U.S. Embassy also advised the 8,000 U.S.
civilians there to consider leaving the country in light of
possible military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations evacuated its arms inspectors and their
staff, as well as some humanitarian U.N. aide workers, within hours
of receiving warnings from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was obliged to act quickly, to take the decision that I
took, because of the strong recommendation that had been put to me,
which could have an impact upon the safety of our people,'' said
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler, adding he received the warning from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Butler appeared at the U.N. Security Council session convened
after Russia, which has opposed military action against Iraq,
demanded an explanation for the evacuation of personnel. The U.N.
staff was moved to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has been divided over the use of force
against Iraq. Russia and China insist fresh council approval is
needed for such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who is returning today from a North Africa trip because
of the crisis, urged the Iraqi government to ``rescind its decision
and resume immediate cooperation'' with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In his Veteran's Day address, Clinton said the international
community remained united and that Saddam could not ``have it both
ways'' by keeping his weapons of mass destruction and by getting
rid of the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Saddam must not only cooperate with the inspection
teams but allow them unfettered access to suspected sites. Without
such access, Clinton said Iraq would have a window of opportunity
to ``rebuild its arsenal of weapons and delivery systems in months,
and I say again, in months, not years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A failure to respond could embolden Saddam to act recklessly,
signaling to him that he can with impunity, develop these weapons
of mass destruction or threaten his neighbors,'' Clinton said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's abrupt buildup of air power in the
Persian Gulf expands the number and types of targets the United
States can strike in Iraq, and the magnitude of damage it can
inflict on President Saddam Hussein's government.
</P>
<P>
   In a move timed with President Clinton's Veterans Day warning to
Saddam, Defense Secretary William Cohen signed orders Wednesday
dispatching 129 aircraft, 84 of them combat jets, to the Gulf
region. They will join 170 already based in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
or aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest single buildup of U.S. forces in the Persian
Gulf since October 1994, when the United States ordered thousands
of Army troops, aircraft and warships to the region after Iraq sent
armored units toward its border with Kuwait. In previous
confrontations, the Pentagon has massed forces in the region more
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The new forces, which had been on standby, are expected to begin
moving from bases around the United States in the coming days and
should arrive in the region by the weekend or early next week,
officials said. But that does not preclude an U.S.-led strike
before then, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not yet ordered an attack, and a senior Pentagon
official said an option called for striking immediately, primarily
with cruise missiles aboard warships in the Persian Gulf, and
following up with a battering of military targets if Saddam still
refused to cooperate with arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Wednesday's decision, U.S. forces in the Gulf will
still not be as large as they were at the peak of the last
threatened confrontation with Iraq earlier this year. At that time,
the United States had 44,000 troops, 440 aircraft and 34 warships,
led by two aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, by contrast, there will be 27,000 troops, 300
aircraft and 14 warships. However, when the Pentagon reduced the
force in the region last spring, it doubled the number of Tomahawk
cruise missiles aboard warships plying the Gulf to about 250 to
350, giving the smaller force a larger punch.
</P>
<P>
   The new aircraft being sent to the region include a dozen of
F-117 ``stealth'' strike fighters able to evade air defenses and
attack with surprise and precision, as well as a dozen B-52s
equipped with 96 cruise missiles that can be fired from the skies
hundreds of miles from Iraq. The B-52s are being sent to Diego
Garcia, a U.S. base on British territory in the Indian Ocean; the
F-117s are expected to go to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also ordered the Air Force to send an ``air
expeditionary force,'' composed of 36 fighters and 6 B-1 bombers to
an unspecified place. If the United States attacks, it would be the
first combat mission for the B-1 in its troubled three decades of
development.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the wariness of some Gulf allies to be seen openly
supporting the United States against an Arab state, the Pentagon
declined to identify the country that had agreed to allow the force
to be based on its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Army will also send 3,000 soldiers to join 1,500 already on
exercise in the desert of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also plans to send Patriot missile batteries, as
well another 1,000 soldiers to operate and protect them. The
Patriots, widely used in the Persian Gulf war, protect against the
possibility that Iraq will retaliate with Scud missile attacks on
U.S. forces or the Gulf allies.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Cohen also announced that he had speeded up the arrival
of a second carrier, the Enterprise, with 70 aircraft, as well as
several escort ships; the Enterprise is now scheduled to arrive
Nov. 23, ostensibly to replace the Eisenhower, though both could
stay awhile, especially if attacks are underway.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Wednesday's deployments, the Pentagon
had drawn up two basic options, one involving a swift strike with
forces already in the region and another that called for a buildup
like that announced Wednesday. The new forces will allow the United
States to mount a more sustained attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the last showdown, the Pentagon's commanders drew up plans
for four days of strikes against Iraq's military bases and command
centers, as well as facilities associated with its chemical and
biological weapons programs. The force there now is large enough
and powerful enough to carry out a similar objective, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more things to put on his capabilities,'' a Pentagon
official said, describing Wednesday's announcement, ``you can
degrade his capabilities more substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   So far only Britain has openly joined the United States in
threatening Saddam with force. Britain has a total of 18 Tornado
attack fighters in Kuwait and Bahrain that could be used in an
attack.

U.S. LAW DETERS IMMIGRANTS FROM RETURNING TO STORM-TORN CENTRAL
AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Repeating for all needing.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If she could fly, Reina Palacios says, she would flap her wings
and soar above her apartment in Newark, N.J., fly across the
country and south to El Salvador, where she would search for the
three teen-age daughters she has been unable to reach since
Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Palacios can fly only in her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of Central American immigrants in the United
States, Ms. Palacios, an applicant for political asylum, is unable
to search for her daughters in El Salvador, because federal law
would prevent her from returning to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Their inability to travel home has always presented difficult
choices for illegal immigrants orthose in the process of becoming
Americans. But, Central Americans say, the challenge had never been
more anguishing than it is now when, night after night on the
evening news, they helplessly watch the wreckage caused by a storm
that swept up villages and flooded cities, leaving more than 11,000
people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palacios, like many others, faces a heart-breaking choice:
leave to aid her family and remain with them in a devastated
country where few jobs are available and salaries are low. Or stay
put and continue working here to support them while pursuing her
goal of becoming a permanent resident so that she eventually can
bring the rest of her family to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days I can function,'' Ms. Palacios, 34, said
softly. ``But then there are other days when I think my head is
going to explode. I have terrible nightmares. Big waves come
crashing down on me as I look for my girls.''
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks now, Ms. Palacios has been dialing the number of
the only family with a telephone in the village where her
daughters, 13, 14 and 16, live with their paternal grandmother. She
gets nothing but a busy signal on the other end. The storm cut
almost all communication between the countries it affected the most
_ Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador _ and the rest of the world.
Bridges have fallen and roads are flooded, making it nearly
impossible for people in the same country to communicate with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is agony for us,'' said Guillermo Chacon, a community
organizer from El Salvador who is an advocate for Central Americans
on New York's Long Island. ``I can not describe how deeply painful
and sad it is to know that your family is lost and you cannot go to
their rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   For days, Maria Cristina Guevara, a Honduran who has lived in
South Florida for 10 years, did not know whether her family had
survived the hurricane. Five days ago, one of her brothers was
finally able to call her from a borrowed telephone. He told her
they nearly lost their home _ the roof and a wall are gone and all
the furniture was ruined. He also told her they have nothing to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm desperate to go,'' said Ms. Guevara, 52, who every month
sends her family part of the salary she earns as a housekeeper.
``But if I go, they'll lose their only chance for recovering from
this disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Guevara, who is here illegally, were to leave, she could
not return to the United States because she lacks an immigration
status or a visa, a requirement before a foreigner can board a
plane to come to the United States. And if she went to an
immigration office seeking help, the law dictates that she be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   But immigrants like Ms. Palacios _ part of a group of thousands
of Guatemalans and Salvadorans victims of the Central American wars
of the 1980s who have been allowed to remain in the country legally
while the government processes their political asylum applications
_ can travel to their countries by asking the Immigration and
Naturalization Service for a special permit. The permits, which are
difficult to get, are granted at the discretion of directors of
local INS offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the permits were easily obtained, immigration officials
discourage Central Americans who are here legally but not yet
permanent residents of the United States from traveling abroad,
said Elaine Komis, an INS spokeswoman in Washington. If they leave
and come back, she said, they may not be able to become residents
of the United States because they will enter into another category
of immigrants for whom there are no legal protections under the
current laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never tell them what to do,'' said an INS official in
Washington, who was reluctant to attach her name to a warning for
immigrants. ``But if we were having a secret conversation, I would
tell everyone to stay firm and try to communicate through
telephone, letters, Internet, any other means possible until they
adjust their status.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers and advocates for immigrants agree. They too
are advising their clients to avoid traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the whole thing is a mess and there is
no easy way for them to go,'' said Ann Pilsbury, the director of
Central American Legal Assistance, a center in Brooklyn that helps
Central Americans with immigration issues. ``The fact of the matter
is that nobody can guarantee people that it won't have a fatal
effect on their case.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advice of lawyers, consular officials fear that some
people are leaving the country anyway, either because they do not
understand the laws of the United States or because they are so
desperate that they no longer care about returning.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Villalobo, vice consul of El Salvador in New York,
said that about 28 Salvadorans came to his office last week seeking
a special passport to travel home. He expected the number to grow
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been told that their families are lost, and they
want to look for them,'' Villalobo said. ``They must have a strong
motivation to make a decision to leave like that, without a
guaranteed return.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos Mateo Hernandez, a Honduran who is applying for political
asylum, may just be reaching the point of desperation Villalobo
worries about. After almost two weeks without news from his wife
and five children, he was able to speak to his family Sunday. He
learned his family lost the crops they depend on and, therefore,
have nothing to eat. His daughters, 6 and 8, are ill with stomach
problems. Because there are unreachable in a town called Lloro, he
can not send them medicine or money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is I can't be with them when they need me the
most,'' said Hernandez, 35, who lives in Queens, New York City.
``And that is killing me inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Central Americans who are now unable to travel to
their countries applied for political asylum years ago and have
been living in the United States for a dozen years or more. They
have learned English, found jobs, opened bank accounts, paid taxes
and started families, while still not having a legal status in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1997 population updates, prepared by the Census,
there are about 1.3 million Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans
in the United States. That number may include people who are here
legally as well as illegally, because the census does not
categorize individuals by immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of a million of the Salvadorans and Guatemalans,
though, are protected from deportation because the law allows them
to remain in the country while a determination in their political
asylum claims is made. There is a huge backlog of asylum
applications, and the majority of cases have not been heard.
</P>
<P>
   A new law in December halted the asylum process.
</P>
<P>
   The new law granted Nicaraguans permanent residency, but it
offered Salvadorans and Guatemalans the possibility to apply to
avoid their deportation only. It did not address Hondurans who are
here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another story of the injustice visited upon these
people,'' said Philippe Weisz, a lawyer who works with Central
American immigrants in New Jersey. ``Had the Salvadorans and
Guatemalans had the opportunity to have their asylum cases heard
when they fled to the United States, many would be lawful permanent
residents, if not citizens of this country.''

BOSTON SEEN IN FINAL 3 FOR CONVENTION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Boston is expected to be selected as one of two or
three finalists to host the prized Democratic National Convention
in 2000, although Los Angeles is highly favored to win the
lucrative contest, several Democratic Party sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boston's strong showing, party officials are likely to
use the city as a bargaining chip as they press Los Angeles leaders
to enhance their package of financial incentives to host the 2000
convention, according to party sources.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Wednesday that Boston could still win the
competition if Los Angeles fails to significantly improve its
current bid of $35.3 million in cash and services to stage the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has done a very impressive job,'' said a Democratic
Party source who is close to the selection process. ``But if Boston
wins, it will be by default.''
</P>
<P>
   With the party's site advisory committee scheduled to select the
finalists Thursday in Washington, Denver is the only other city
with a solid chance of entering the last round of the nearly
year-long competition.
</P>
<P>
   The other contenders _ Miami, Minneapolis, and New Orleans _ are
not expected to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be selected by President Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore, and party officials and is expected to be announced in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The city that hosts the 2000 convention will receive an
estimated $140 million boost to the local economy, in addition to
prestige and a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has been a major player since Day 1, and we expect them
to be a major player until the end of the process,'' said a party
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino has led an intensive campaign to persuade
party leaders to choose Boston as the site. The city, which has
never hosted a major party convention, has pledged $32 million in
financial incentives, which is considered more generous than the
Los Angeles bid because of the extra travel and production costs
associated with staging the four-day spectacle on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said that Clinton, Gore, and party leaders favor
California for several political reasons, most importantly the
necessity of the presidential candidate in 2000 capturing the
state's 54 electoral votes. By contrast, the New England states
account for only 35 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Angeles could be uncomfortable for Gore because of
his controversial appearance there at a fund-raiser in a Buddhist
temple that has been the focus of federal investigations, Clinton
is expected to push for Los Angeles behind the scenes. The 2000
convention is likely to provide the backdrop for Clinton's last
major speech to party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong sense that he wants it there,'' said a source
who is familiar with the process. ``And he is going to have a big
say in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver has offered nearly $34 million in financial incentives to
host the convention and is considered a strong contender, mostly
out of deference to Colorado Governor Roy Romer, the party's
general chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic national chairman is Steven Grossman, a
Massachusetts businessman who has been instrumental in leading the
party out of massive debt after the 1996 elections. But party
officials said that Boston has edged out nearly every other city in
the convention contest mainly because of Menino's lobbying, the
financial bid, and the city's success at showcasing itself when the
advisory committee was treated to a whirlwind visit last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was among 28 cities the party invited last year to
compete for the 2000 convention. The field was gradually cut to
seven semi-finalists, although Philadelphia dropped out of the
running last week when it was selected to host the Republican
national convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had been considered a leading contender for the
Democratic event, which is expected to attract as many as 30,000
delegates, journalists, and other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles always saw Philadelphia as the obstacle to LA
getting the convention,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic
strategist based in Los Angeles. ``The overwhelming sense here now
is that LA is in the driver's seat. The other sentiment is that
Boston is the only other player.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said the 51-member site advisory committee will
discuss a slate of finalists that will be recommended Thursday by
the panel's leaders, including the chairman, Joe Andrew of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will then vote on the recommendations, as
representatives from the semifinalist cities, including Boston,
look on.

SCELZI FITS IN AS `NOT-SO-FAMOUS' NHRA CHAMPION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Scelzi figures to leave Pomona Raceway this weekend a world
champion times two.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons in a Top Fuel dragster and two National Hot Rod
Association Winston world championships confirm that this driver is
a special talent. But don't try selling Scelzi on that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about his ability to routinely manhandle a Top Fuel coupe at
320-plus mph, and Scelzi humbly defers to the tuning expertise of
car owner and crew chief Alan Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says, `We all know Alan's great. But what's the deal
with his driver?' '' said Scelzi, winner of five races a year ago
and a record-tying six finals this season. ``Maybe I'm harder on
myself than I need to be. But I'm driving for the best. And he
expects the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggest that Scelzi's skills, then, make him worthy of mention
alongside multiple NHRA champions and peers Joe Amato, Kenny
Bernstein and John Force, and he cringes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different when you hear your name mentioned with these
great people I grew up watching and who are my heroes,'' said
Scelzi, a 38-year-old resident of Fresno, Calif. ``It's like, which
name doesn't belong here? It's almost frightening. I'm
not-so-famous. But I'm here. We're in the big leagues. We won a
championship last year, and it looks like we're going to do it
again this year. It's a great feeling. It puts me in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi holds a 115-point lead over friendly rival Cory
McClenathan heading into the season-ending Winston Finals in
Pomona, Calif. Round One of professional qualifications is
scheduled today, and Scelzi could secure the title with his first
quarter-mile pass. Qualify for the 16-car field, and the
championship is his.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is similar to last November, when Scelzi bagged the
NHRA championship with his first qualifying attempt at the Winston
Finals. He also became the first rookie to win an NHRA championship
in any professional category.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, neither Amato nor Bernstein nor Force _ who count 17
championships in Top Fuel and Funny Car among them _ could pull
that off as rookies. And none of the above captured his first
championship amid the emotions swirling around Scelzi in 1997.
Recall that Scelzi was hired to succeed the late Blaine Johnson,
Alan's brother, after his death during qualifications for the 1997
U.S. Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the part of this speedy equation that keeps Scelzi
so self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a car that's under a microscope,'' said Scelzi, driver
of the Team Winston Dragster. ``My biggest problem is I'm driving a
car that should win every single race. I have the best tuner out
there. My crew has the utmost confidence in Alan Johnson. When he's
onto something _ even if things don't go right 10 times in a row _
he knows that's the direction he's got to go. And he doesn't
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Team Winston was mired in eighth place after four
events in mid-March and looking every bit like a one-hit wonder. It
was because, Scelzi said, Johnson was attempting to refine a clutch
combination that would transfer to the rear wheels all the
horsepower his new cylinder heads were producing. It took Johnson
until the season's 18th race at Heartland Park Topeka to figure it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Scelzi has swept the national events at the Texas
Motorplex and Houston Raceway Park and transformed an 11-point
deficit to McClenathan into his current triple-digit runaway. In
addition, Scelzi has lowered the Top Fuel elapsed time (4.525
seconds) and raised the speed (326.44 mph) national records in one
very red-hot, red hot rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always driven cars that were good cars, but never the
dominating car,'' said Scelzi, a multiple champion in the NHRA's
Sportsman ranks. ``So, I always went out with nothing to lose. And
I think that's what made me so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has the car and the tuner to run for world
championships, Scelzi said nothing else counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of pride you put out when you are a
Winston champion. We didn't want to lose that,'' Scelzi said.
``Let's face it. We all want to wear a crown and we all want to be
on stage at the end of the year. Anybody who tells you they don't
is a liar.'' \Ntagtop:John Sturbin, (817) 390-7408
THE BUZZ NASCAR
</P>
<P>
   A slew of impressive records has accompanied Jeff Gordon's run
to a second consecutive NASCAR Winston Cup championship and third
in the past four years. The most visible, of course, are the 13
victories that tied Richard Petty's record for the modern era
(since 1972). But here are some astonishing stats. Gordon compiled
a 1.90 finishing average in the season's last 20 races, and
averaged 175.3 points per race (of a possible 185) during that
period. His victory in the season-ending and rain-delayed NAPA 500
at the Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday night was his 19th top-five
finish in the past 20 races. His only result outside the top five
during that marathon span was a seventh, at Phoenix International
Raceway, on Oct. 25. Incidentally, that was the only race of the
last four that Gordon did not win. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little upset about some things this season and maybe
that anger turned into determination,'' said Gordon, driver of the
No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``Maybe
certain criticisms we took this year kind of drove us to get more
out of ourselves and to prove to people out there that we're
legit.'' Recall that Gordon drew plenty of guffaws _ and a
collection of alarm clocks _ after oversleeping before a practice
at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May. ``My being late at Charlotte
fired me up, and I wanted to show the team that I'm dedicated to
this program,'' Gordon said. ``I was early for practice the rest of
the season.'' . . .

   Kenny Irwin Jr. won the 1998 Winston Cup rookie-of-the-year
title by 13 points over Kevin Lepage. Irwin, driver of the No. 28
Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus, became the first driver to win the
rookie honor and post winnings in excess of $1 million. That was a
nice weekend package for Irwin, who won his first Cup pole at
Atlanta Motor Speedway on Friday. ``I couldn't write down
everything I've learned \Rthis season\S because I've forgotten some
of it already,'' said Irwin, who had only one top-five finish and
one DNQ (did not qualify) in 1998. ``People talk about how would
you grade yourself, but I don't grade myself. You \Rthe media\S
grade me, Robert Yates grades me, the team grades me. That's how I
get my report card. Some weeks I feel like we're ahead of the game,
and some weeks I can't see the top. I don't know where it's going
to end. Hopefully, I'm here for the long haul.''

   Seven-time Funny Car champion John Force will carry a 91-point
lead over Ron Capps into the season-ending National Hot Rod
Association Winston Finals at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway beginning
today. ``The Brute'' can clinch his record eighth title by winning
one round of eliminations. But Force has other goals on his agenda.
Force owned drag racing's all-time speed record of 323.89 mph until
Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi blasted off a lap at 326.44 mph
during the Matco Tools SuperNationals at Houston Raceway Park in
Baytown this month. ``I was happy to see Gary Scelzi run the
mile-per-hour record, because I was getting tired of trying to
explain why I did it,'' said Force, driver of the Castrol GTX Ford
Mustang. ``We all know the Top Fuel dragsters are the kings of the
sport. But I'm going after the speed record next year with my new
car. As much as I love Gary Scelzi and the \RAlan\S Johnson family,
they've given me something to shoot for. I just don't chase the
Funny Car guys, I chase the dragster guys. It's the chase.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Capps stands to finish No. 2 in points to Force despite winning
more national events. Capps has bagged five races to Force's three.
Capps, who is wrapping up his second season for car owner and
mentor Don ``The Snake'' Prudhomme, hardly is complaining. ``I'm
still pinching myself that I'm driving for Snake,'' said Capps,
driver of the Copenhagen Chevrolet Camaro Z/28. ``Sometimes I sit
back and think, `Wow, is my life great.' It really is. At the same
time, I'm never satisfied. One thing I've learned from Snake is if
you relax out here and fall back on your heels for one tiny second,
you're going to get passed.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi is the ninth driver to win six NHRA Top Fuel races in a
single season. No one has won seven, but Scelzi and runner-up Cory
McClenathan are in position to do so during the Winston Finals. In
addition to Scelzi and McClenathan (1997, 1998), the others to have
won six races in a season are Don Garlits (1985), Darrell Gwynn
(1988), Gary Ormsby (1989, 1990), Joe Amato (1990), Kenny Bernstein
(1991), Eddie Hill of Wichita Falls (1993) and Scott Kalitta
(1995).

<P>
   Venturing deep into uncharted realms of ethics and medicine, a
small biotechnology company said Wednesday that its scientists had
for the first time made human cells revert to the primordial,
embryonic state from which all other cells develop, by fusing them
with cow eggs and creating a hybrid cell.
</P>
<P>
   The research comes from biologists who are well known in their
field, but has yet to be confirmed or even published in a
scientific journal. Their company, Advanced Cell Technology of
Worcester, Mass., said the method could eventually be used to grow
replacement body tissues of any kind from a patient's own cells,
sidestepping the increasing scarcity of organs available for
transplant and the problems of immune rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is likely to concern and perplex ethicists because
it involves the creation of an embryonic cell that is part human
and part cow, consisting of a human cell's nucleus inside a cow egg
whose own nucleus has been removed. The company said the hybrid
cell quickly became more human-like as the human nucleus took
control and displaced cow proteins with human proteins. Creation of
the embryonic cells is an important component of a strategy that in
principle offers high medical benefits if it can overcome a
doubtless high barrier to public acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The technique involves creating an embryo of uncertain moral
status, and one that crosses the barrier between humans and other
species. Even though the hybrid is in the form of cells, not a
whole organism, the concept of half-human creatures arouses deeps
anxiety, as is evident from the unfriendly powers ascribed to
werewolves, centaurs, mermaids, Minotaurs and other characters of
myth and folklore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are going to be horrified by this scenario, others
will say 'So what?' '' said Thomas Murray, director of the center
for biomedical ethics at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland and a member of the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission. ``This is the sort of thing that makes me very
uncomfortable. I think we are likely to get a very powerful
reaction to it, and I would like for all of us to have a breathing
space here to articulate our moral concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Another serious uncertainty is the preliminary nature of the
company's work. No article has yet been submitted for peer review
and publication in a scientific journal, an essential touchstone of
credibility. Scientists asked about the company's work said they
would require much more proof before believing that human embryonic
stem-like cells had been created as claimed, and some were
skeptical the technique would work at all.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had achieved the feat announced Wednesday
with one cell three years ago. Michael West, Advanced Cell
Technology's chief executive officer, said he was announcing the
work done to date in order to test its public acceptability He said
the company, which is privately held, was not planning to go public
or raise money at this time but needed to decide whether to commit
investment to development of the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists praised West's decision to make his work public
but others are critical, saying he has invited an emotional public
debate on a slender basis of fact.
</P>
<P>
   West is the founder of Geron, a biotechnology company that has
had two spectacular successes this year in its research on aging.
In January, the company developed a method for ``immortalizing''
human cells grown in the laboratory by making them leap the
supposedly immutable barrier at which cells usually lapse into
senescence. Last week, two university teams financed by Geron said
they had isolated and cultivated human embryonic stem cells, the
all-purpose cells from which the fetus develops. West lay the
foundations for these developments by financing leading scientists
in the two fields.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Cell Technology, which West joined in October, has
focused on cloning and genetically improving cows, a technology
developed by James Robl and colleagues at the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst. West said he hoped to use the technology
to further the founding concept of Geron: delving into the mystery
of human aging and sidestepping some of its processes.
</P>
<P>
   The company said work with human cells was performed in 1996 by
Jose Cibelli, a colleague of Robl at the University of
Massachusetts. Using 52 of his own cells, some of them white blood
cells and others scraped from the inside of his cheek, Cibelli
fused each one with a cow egg whose own nucleus and DNA had first
been removed, the company said. Most failed to thrive but one
embryo grew and divided five times, generating cells resembling
embryonic stem cells. Cibelli and West say the method can be made
more efficient with present technology.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this work was sufficient to describe an invention,
Robl and Cibelli filed a patent application and then set the
research aside to focus on the more immediately practical field of
cow cloning. Only two others besides himself and Robl knew what had
been done, Cibelli said. The patent has not yet been issued but
West said he was confident of receiving ``important intellectual
property'' in the field. He said he is making the hybrid cell
technique public now ``because I want to be very open and level
with everyone. We need to get the ethicists to talk about it so as
to encourage a rational response to these new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cibelli said he regarded any embryos obtained in this way as
``not a separate individual, just a de-differentiated cell from a
patient.'' Differentiation is the process whereby the all-purpose
cells of the very early embryo, known as human embryonic stem
cells, become committed to their roles as the various specialized
tissues of the body. The process is irreversible in nature but egg
cells apparently have the ability to de-differentiate, or reset to
default mode, the settings in a specialized cell's nucleus. This is
presumably what happened in the experiment reported in July when
mice were cloned by transferring the nucleus of an adult mouse cell
into another mouse's egg cell.
</P>
<P>
   Cibelli, who trained as a veterinary doctor in Argentina, said
he believed that he and his colleagues ``were the first to
de-differentiate a human cell by nuclear transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned about destroying, in principle, 52
potential twins of himself, he said, ``I never thought about it,
it's a good question. But if you use your own cells to treat a
disease you may have, you are not taking cells from another person
selfishly.''
</P>
<P>
   West and Cibelli said they had no intention of transferring the
embryos to a uterus, a step they consider unethical and unsafe for
it. The embryos would be created solely for the purpose of tissue
culture. ``Any technology can be abused but once the public
understands how these cells can be used to treat any disease caused
by loss or malfunction of cells, from Parkinson's to diabetes to
heart disease, the concerns will be overshadowed,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not West's prediction will be borne out depends on
two major sets of factors, the scientific validity of the proposed
method and the ethical and legal questions that related work has
already raised.

 UNDATED: already raised. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From discussions with scientists, ethicists and lawyers in the
past few days, several concerns have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are particularly critical of the lack of supporting
evidence accompanying Advanced Cell Technology's announcement,
saying in essence the claim could be true but there was no
compelling reason yet to accept it. Even if the claim is valid,
biologists note a serious uncertainty relating to an important part
of the cells known as the mitochondria, components that produce the
energy the cell needs and that are, in essence, the cell's
batteries. If the bovine mitochondria should prove incompatible
with their humanized environment the cells will not be viable.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists believe the mixing of species is likely to trouble the
public severely, at least at first. Lawyers who specialize in
issues of human reproduction note that the moral and legal status
of the human embryo is undecided in American law, a fact pointed up
by the isolation of the human embryonic stem cells announced last
week. The new entity adds further complexity.
</P>
<P>
   If Advanced Cell Technology can produce viable hybrid cells,
those cells will offer a new route to grow tissue for transplant.
This is the same goal held by the scientists who announced last
week they had grown human embryonic stem cells in the laboratory.
It is widely accepted in principle that embryonic stem cells can be
directed to develop into any desired tissue, with enormous
potential for medicine, even though this has yet to be achieved in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   West said the advantage of the Advanced Cell Technology method
was that embryonic cells derived from the patient being treated
would generate entirely compatible tissues. The two methods
reported last week, by James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin
and John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, derive stem cells
from human embryos or fetuses. Tissues made from these cells would
be incompatible with the patient, a problem that has yet to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In support of its claim, Advanced Cell Technology supplied a
patent application and a photograph taken of its embryonic cells
under a microscope. The patent application describes how the cells
are made but provides no proof that they possess the properties to
be expected of human embryonic stem cells. Robl said his laboratory
was not set up to perform the required tests at the time the hybrid
cells were made.
</P>
<P>
   Shown the photograph of the hybrid cells, John Gearhart of Johns
Hopkins University, author of one of the two methods reported last
week, said that ``they certainly could be embryonic stem cells''
but that no scientific journal would publish the result without
further proof. ``It's not that I don't believe this biologically. I
just think they could have given a little bit more assurance as to
what was done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Pedersen of the University of California at San Francisco,
who also works on human embryonic stem cells, said he doubted the
hybrid cells would last long enough to develop into useful tissue
because of their cow-derived mitochondria.
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondria, former bacteria enslaved by cells eons ago, have
their own genes but operate in close cooperation with genes from
the cell's nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Pedersen cited a recent experiment showing that within the
human-ape-monkey family, each species' mitochondria is subtly
different, the more so the longer the evolutionary distance between
the species in question. The mitochondria of chimpanzees and
gorillas work well enough in human cells but those of primate
species that diverged more than 10 million years ago from the human
line, do not work.
</P>
<P>
   Because cows and humans last shared an ancestor so long ago, cow
mitochondria are very unlikely to work well with a human nucleus,
in Pedersen's view, and as most of the mitochondria in the hybrid
cells are contributed by the cow egg, the cells would probably not
remain viable for long. ``It's hard to say this is a total sham,
but I smell a sham here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the same data, Gearhart said the mitochondria in the
hybrid cell had clearly carried it through its first few divisions
but might not sustain it in further development, unless the few
human mitochondria that were also present somehow took over.
</P>
<P>
   Pedersen said Advanced Cell Technology should be held to a high
standard of proof ``because of what the implications are for
upsetting people unnecessarily _ if you cry fire in a crowded
auditorium you may be liable if it's a false alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The human embryonic stem cells announced last week have already
pushed against the frontiers of ethical acceptance. Experts in
biomedical ethics say the public is likely to be alarmed by the new
technique, particularly because of the mingling of species. Murray
of Case Western Reserve University said that the hybrid embryo
``escapes our usual categories.'' When biologists first learned to
transfer genes from one species to another, ``The idea of
human-animal hybrids was often raised as the kind of monstrosity
that no morally perceptive person would ever create,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's only to create tissue, the minute you start
mixing species you raise all kinds of red flags in people's
minds,'' said Barnie Steinboch, a moral philosopher at the State
University of New York in Albany. But she noted that pig valves are
now seen as acceptable replacements in human hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Dresser, a law professor at Washington University in St.
Louis, noted, as did several biologists, that distinctions between
humans and other animals are less clear in nature than they are in
people's minds. ``Biologically a lot of this research is showing us
similarities and the upshot in a hundred years may be that the
lines between humans and non-humans will be viewed as a little bit
grayer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A perplexing feature of the hybrid embryo is that it starts off
mostly bovine and then becomes mostly yet not entirely human. But
some legal experts have no doubt that it should be regarded from
the start as a human embryo. ``It doesn't matter that the
mitochondria come from a cow, it also has human mitochondria and so
has all the potentials of a human embryo,'' said Lori Andrews of
the Chicago-Kent College of Law in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it's gone through that first division it has gone from
being a somatic cell to a thing with potential life,'' she said,
referring to the ordinary specialized cells of the human body. If
transferred to a woman's uterus the embryos may or may not come to
term, ``but under state laws it doesn't matter whether the fetus is
going to be born or not - it doesn't make them less human.''
</P>
<P>
   The human body consists of 100 billion cells. Should embryos
created from them by the cow egg method be regarded as having
special status when they can be made so easily and plentifully? Ms.
Andrews said that human embryos are not so hard to make the usual
way, and the fact that an embryo is easily made, by whatever means,
is irrelevant to arguments about its status.
</P>
<P>
   The moral status of the human embryo ``is not clearly
established in U.S. law,'' Dresser said. The embryo can be regarded
as mere property, as a person, or as something in between but
deserving of special respect. Congress, in banning the use of
federal funds for research on human embryos, has favored the view
that they are in the category of people. But in custody battles
over fertilized embryos, courts have favored the special respect
status. Dresser said the hybrid cells could be seen as somewhere
between the property and special-respect status.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid cells were made by Cibelli in Robl's laboratory in
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Michael Weinberg,
executive secretary of the university's human subjects committee,
said the experiment was given administrative approval, without
review by the committee or any major discussion. Cibelli was using
his own cells, not experimenting on other people, and
self-experimentation does not require special consent. ``If someone
wants to inoculate themselves they can do that,'' Weinberg said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Intel Corp.'s announcement that its fourth-quarter
results would exceed Wall Street estimates not only bolstered its
stock to a new high on Wednesday, but analysts said it boded well
for a broad range of technology stocks, particularly those whose
fortunes are tied to the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said on Tuesday that stronger-than-expected demand for
personal computer products across all market segments and
geographical regions would raise fourth-quarter revenue by 8
percent to 10 percent, compared with third-quarter revenue of $6.7
billion. The company also said that profit margins would be up a
couple of points from 53 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel shot up Wednesday on the report, gaining $6.125
each, to $103.6875.
</P>
<P>
   And Intel's news was buttressed on Wednesday by a bullish
forecast from the Semiconductor Industry Association, which
predicted that the global chip market would rebound next year. The
association said strong demand for microprocessors, memory and
digital signal processors would increase sales by 9.1 percent, to
$133.4 billion, and that sales would rise an additional 15.2
percent in 2000 and 18.2 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts scrambled to raise estimates on Wednesday, taking the
consensus to $1.05 a share for the fourth quarter from 95 cents a
share, and to $3.41 a share for the full year for $3.31 a share,
according to the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
Analysts raised their estimate for Intel's 1999 earnings to $4.16 a
share from $3.92 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel pre-announced strong earnings in the third quarter
only to exceed even the revised estimates, and many analysts expect
the company to do the same this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel historically has not pre-announced very often, and when
they do they are very careful,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The company had a break-out
quarter in Q3, and and I expect more of the same in Q4.'' Edelstone
continues to rate Intel a strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has long been a leadership company: It invented the
microprocessor and the dynamic random access memory chip, or DRAM,
without either of which the personal computer would not exist.
Analysts say it is now also a leadership stock, one whose
performance serves as a bellwether for the whole technology group,
much the way IBM once did. If demand for Intel microprocessors is
growing, so too should demand for memory, disk drives and other
personal computer components.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, has been predicting for some time that Intel's stock price
could reach $120 by the end of the year. He said
stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings for Intel pointed to
a broad-based technology rally. ``It's the right sign for the
technology sector because what it's saying is there is still
genuine double-digit growth in PC's,'' he said. That growth was
hidden by the inventory glut that hung over the sector for the
first two quarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Intel's good news, Tom Kurlak of Merrill Lynch retained
his neutral rating on the stock, as did eight of the 32 analysts
polled by First Call. One raised a neutral to a strong buy, one a
neutral to a buy. That left the stock rated a buy by 9 analysts and
a strong buy by 14.
</P>
<P>
   Those not recommending Intel point to concerns about increased
competition at the low end the market, where Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. has been coming on strong, and less need for ever greater
processing power at the high end, which in the age of the Internet
is more driven by band width than by microprocessor power. Some
analysts say the surge in demand now is mostly inventory
replenishing, a temporary phenomenon created by efforts to clear
the previous glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that was almost set up to happen and now it is
occurring,'' said John Rossi, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens. ``We should enjoy things as they are now, but realize it
will also go through the usual seasonal cooling off in mid- to late
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, however, Rossi said he expected traditional
blue-chip companies to suffer more from the Asian economic crisis
and to spend more on technology to improve productivity and cope
with the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a great place to put money for 1999,'' he
said. &QL;

BOSTON SEEN IN FINAL 3 FOR CONVENTION  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Boston is expected to be selected as one of two or
three finalists to host the prized Democratic National Convention
in 2000, although Los Angeles is highly favored to win the
lucrative contest, several Democratic Party sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boston's strong showing, party officials are likely to
use the city as a bargaining chip as they press Los Angeles leaders
to enhance their package of financial incentives to host the 2000
convention, according to party sources.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Wednesday that Boston could still win the
competition if Los Angeles fails to significantly improve its
current bid of $35.3 million in cash and services to stage the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has done a very impressive job,'' said a Democratic
Party source who is close to the selection process. ``But if Boston
wins, it will be by default.''
</P>
<P>
   With the party's site advisory committee scheduled to select the
finalists Thursday in Washington, Denver is the only other city
with a solid chance of entering the last round of the nearly
year-long competition.
</P>
<P>
   The other contenders _ Miami, Minneapolis, and New Orleans _ are
not expected to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be selected by President Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore, and party officials and is expected to be announced in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The city that hosts the 2000 convention will receive an
estimated $140 million boost to the local economy, in addition to
prestige and a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has been a major player since Day 1, and we expect them
to be a major player until the end of the process,'' said a party
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino has led an intensive campaign to persuade
party leaders to choose Boston as the site. The city, which has
never hosted a major party convention, has pledged $32 million in
financial incentives, which is considered more generous than the
Los Angeles bid because of the extra travel and production costs
associated with staging the four-day spectacle on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said that Clinton, Gore, and party leaders favor
California for several political reasons, most importantly the
necessity of the presidential candidate in 2000 capturing the
state's 54 electoral votes. By contrast, the New England states
account for only 35 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Angeles could be uncomfortable for Gore because of
his controversial appearance there at a fund-raiser in a Buddhist
temple that has been the focus of federal investigations, Clinton
is expected to push for Los Angeles behind the scenes. The 2000
convention is likely to provide the backdrop for Clinton's last
major speech to party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong sense that he wants it there,'' said a source
who is familiar with the process. ``And he is going to have a big
say in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver has offered nearly $34 million in financial incentives to
host the convention and is considered a strong contender, mostly
out of deference to Colorado Governor Roy Romer, the party's
general chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic national chairman is Steven Grossman, a
Massachusetts businessman who has been instrumental in leading the
party out of massive debt after the 1996 elections. But party
officials said that Boston has edged out nearly every other city in
the convention contest mainly because of Menino's lobbying, the
financial bid, and the city's success at showcasing itself when the
advisory committee was treated to a whirlwind visit last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was among 28 cities the party invited last year to
compete for the 2000 convention. The field was gradually cut to
seven semi-finalists, although Philadelphia dropped out of the
running last week when it was selected to host the Republican
national convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had been considered a leading contender for the
Democratic event, which is expected to attract as many as 30,000
delegates, journalists, and other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles always saw Philadelphia as the obstacle to LA
getting the convention,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic
strategist based in Los Angeles. ``The overwhelming sense here now
is that LA is in the driver's seat. The other sentiment is that
Boston is the only other player.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said the 51-member site advisory committee will
discuss a slate of finalists that will be recommended Thursday by
the panel's leaders, including the chairman, Joe Andrew of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will then vote on the recommendations, as
representatives from the semifinalist cities, including Boston,
look on.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Citing continuing egregious violations, state
forestry regulators on Tuesday suspended the conditional logging
license of Pacific Lumber Co., the largest private logger of
old-growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension could complicate a state and federal deal to
spend $380 million in taxpayers' money to buy one of the oldest
groves of virgin redwoods on earth from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension covers only the remainder of 1998, and the
company may appeal it, but regulators have warned the company that
it might not renew the license for 1999. This has provided ample
fodder for environmental groups. It is unknown whether the
suspension will affect the deal for a government purchase of the
virgin redwood Headwaters Forest, but several environmentalists
were quick to say that the suspension proved that Pacific Lumber, a
subsidiary of Maxxam Inc., could not be trusted to carry out its
share of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Forestry said Pacific Lumber had
repeatedly violated significant regulations, by, among other
things, clearing redwoods and Douglas firs near an endangered coho
salmon stream, driving heavy vehicles and equipment across a
tributary, which clogged another coho salmon stream, and logging
within a northern spotted owl nesting territory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two years that Pacific Lumber, which
has been battling environmentalists for more than 10 years over its
logging practices, was found to have violated the state's rules to
protect streams, wildlife and soil. In 1997, the state refused to
renew the company's license because of illegal logging and other
violations. It granted a conditional license this year after the
company agreed to comply with a strict logging plan.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, Pacific Lumber's president, said the company
would do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain committed to making the changes that are necessary
to regain our leadership as a responsible steward of the state's
timber resources,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The forestry department tallied 16 violations this time. Among
them is the accusation that Pacific Lumber covered up its illegal
logging near one salmon stream until loggers had finished hauling
the trees to the mill.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wilson, director of the forestry department, said he had
no choice but to suspend the company's license, despite the loss of
jobs it would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is not an easy one to make, considering the
effects on employees,'' Wilson said, ``but we simply cannot allow
these violations to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bullwinkel, a spokeswoman for Pacific Lumber, said the
company had indefinitely laid off 180 lumber employees, of its
total work force of 1,600. About 50 percent of the company's
logging is done by independent contractors hired by Pacific Lumber
to cut its trees. They will be allowed to continue logging.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the company said that rendered the suspension a mere
slap since Pacific Lumber could hire more contractors to take up
the slack in production created by the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agencies have been holding hearings to
complete a deal by March 1999 that would protect Headwaters Forest.
In the deal, the company would hand over the 3,000-acre forest to
the public for $380 million (with California paying $180 million
and the federal government the rest). It would also set aside, for
50 years, a 4,500-acre buffer considered important for nesting
marbled murrelets, an endangered sea bird that nests exclusively on
the tops of old-growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Pacific Lumber would be allowed to log 500 acres of
virgin old-growth forest and 8,000 more acres with scattered stands
of old-growth trees.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mason, president of the Environmental Protection
Information Center, which is based in Garberville, near Pacific
Lumber's headquarters in Scotia, said the license suspension was an
acknowledgment that Pacific Lumber was ``such a disreputable and
dishonest timber company that they shouldn't be allowed to run a
chainsaw in their own forest.''
</P>
<P>
   What has groups like the Environmental Protection Information
Center most concerned is that as part of the Headwaters deal,
Pacific Lumber would get what is known as an ``incidental take
permit.'' This would absolve it from liability for harming
endangered species' habitats in the approved 8,500 acres if it has
done so accidentally, or incidentally. The permit must be issued
based on the company's concrete habitat conservation plan that
shows how it will minimize harm to endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bullwinkel of Pacific Lumber said the license suspension and
the company's effort to get a permit in the Headwaters deal were
separate issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Bundy, another member of the Environmental Protection
Information Center, said that considering what he called Pacific
Lumber's flouting of basic state forestry rules, it could not be
trusted to follow its habitat conservation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are voluntary efforts that the company would have to
enforce themselves,'' Bundy said. ``It has all these written
logging plans that obviously comply with rules. Then out in the
woods, it does something else entirely.''

DEMOCRATS PRESSURE HYDE FOR QUICK VOTE ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Va., Pa., Mo., La.)  (Eds: See also REPUBS-DILEMMA) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to capitalize on the public's distaste with
the inquiry against President Clinton, Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee called on the panel Wednesday to vote early
next week on whether the allegations in the independent counsel's
report are grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats knew how Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee
chairman, would reply _ (``No'') _ even before they delivered the
request to him Wednesday night. But they didn't particularly care.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by their unexpected Election Day gains and the growing
number of Republicans outside the committee who now say the full
House is unlikely to vote to impeach Clinton, committee Democrats
are trying every tactic to force Hyde to fold his tent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democrats' letter, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the
committee's ranking Democrat, and Rep. Robert Scott of Virginia,
the lead Democrat on the constitutional subcommittee, asked Hyde to
``help us avoid a divisive inquiry that is not warranted by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee has called the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
to testify on Nov. 19. But Democrats insist that before summoning
witnesses, the committee should decide whether the main charges in
Starr's 445-page report _ lying under oath, obstructing justice and
witness tampering _ constitute impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans had not yet received the Democrats' letter
Wednesday night, but the arguments are familiar ones and
unpersuasive to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact-gathering process comes first and the committee will
get to the question of whether or not the allegations against the
president warrant impeachment at a subsequent point,'' a Republican
committee spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., criticized the Republicans' handling of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought for some time that a majority of Republicans were
bent on not only considering impeachment actively but bringing many
other issues into this, in a process that I think is defective and
not well thought through,'' Gephardt told reporters over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said that after hearings and a committee vote on
articles of impeachment, ``We're then, I guess, going to go to the
floor with an impeachment resolution. The House is not terribly
prepared to deal with it because it's been done in my view very
poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Democrats' criticisms, there was fresh evidence
Wednesday of waning support for impeachment among Republicans
outside Hyde's committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., of the Judiciary Committee, suggested
in an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times and again at
a news conference that the impeachment inquiry be abandoned in
favor of criminal prosecution of Clinton after he leaves office in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said that lawmakers were ``searching for a way out'' of
an impeachment process that was ``going nowhere.'' The senator said
he had broached the idea to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader, and Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., the likely successor to
Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House. Both men were noncommittal,
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, speaking in Wheaton, Ill., said the hearing with Starr
will go ahead, as would other committee deliberations. ``Sen.
Specter's always ahead of the curve,'' Hyde said. ``But he'll get
his chance to express himself authoritatively, ultimately, I
suspect.''

NBA'S SENIOR OWNER SPEAKS OUT, AND BLUNTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abe Pollin bought the Washington Wizards 34 years ago, when they
were called the Baltimore Bullets and the National Basketball
Association consisted of nine teams and was was more than a decade
from becoming a global marketing phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is a 29-team league and Pollin not only owns the Wizards
and the Washington Capitals hockey team, but also the $200 million
MCI Center in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At 74, he is the senior owner in the NBA, one of three left who
have worked with Walter Kennedy and Lawrence O'Brien, David Stern's
predecessors as commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry and I hired David Stern,'' he said during a telephone
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stern's leadership in the lockout, which has prevented the
start of the season, has kept Pollin's Wizards idle, while Pollin's
Capitals continue playing on his MCI Center ice.
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, now more than four months old, owners have
hardly been heard from as Stern has forged a management unit by
cautioning them not to talk about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the lockout, Pollin did not provide sensitive
details and did not break with Stern. But he provided an unusually
candid view of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is generally optimistic about a deal being reached,
Pollin said the owners must get a fair deal. Or, he said: ``We're
prepared to gut the season. We went into this knowing that if we
can't make a fair deal, the season would be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Pollin doubted that the NBA would require a long
period of recovery if it shutters the entire season. Major League
Baseball needed until this past season to heal the wounds from the
1994-95 players strike that scotched the 1994 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NBA will recover quicker,'' he said. ``There's no
question the league will survive. It's not something you look
forward to, but I'm sure we have some good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollin praised Stern's leadership, but said he is not an
omnipotent commissioner towing the owners behind him. ``He doesn't
do this by himself,'' Pollin said. ``But we agree completely. There
is 100 percent unity. There is no split.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollin said the economic model that helped the NBA flourish
financially for the past 15 years is no longer fair _ to owners.
``It doesn't work,'' he said. ``We need one that works. When you
have a system where most of the teams aren't getting any type of
return on the value of their investments, and for many it's
negative, the system doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Wizards' finances, he said, ``I'm not getting
anywhere near a fair return.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the lack of revenues from Wizards games will not
hurt his ability to pay the debt service on the arena. ``I've never
missed a payment and I never will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner Sports will make their full $16 million-a-team
payments this season, cushioning teams' loss of revenue from ticket
sales and concessions. Pollin's bottom line is also comforted by
revenues from Capitals games and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Pollin is peeved by the suggestion that if the
return on his Wizards investment is so small, well, maybe he should
sell the team _ a recommendation made by Michael Jordan during a
negotiating session last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let Michael Jordan or anybody else tell me to
sell my team,'' he said, anger cutting his genial tone. ``Nobody is
going to tell me I have to sell my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollin has maintained his affection for his basketball team
despite years of disappointment since Washington's 1978
championship. He was prompted to propose changing the team's name
in 1995, from the Bullets to the Wizards, after his friend Yitzhak
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this sport and I love this team,'' said Pollin, a
widely respected owner who is deeply involved in Washington-area
charities. ``This team and this league have been a big part of my
life. I love the players individually. I get to know the players'
wives. They come to my home. I've taken them to China and Israel.
This team is a very important part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollin has been involved in nearly every major issue in the NBA,
and served on nearly every major committee. ``You enjoy having
someone like Abe, with his experience, with his league mentality,
who's also very charitable and has a great sense of humor,'' Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin is still yearning for a second NBA championship to add to
the team's 1978 title. ``I just hope we get better,'' he said. ``I
think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   But first he wants to change the system. The owners want to
limit players' salaries to 50 percent of league revenue, not the 60
percent players have proposed, and below the 57.1 percent players
made last season. Owners also want to limit rookie salaries and
alter the so-called Larry Bird exception that lets teams exceed the
salary cap when they re-sign their own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The system, he said, has resulted in ticket prices rising far
beyond the capability of families to attend games without financial
hardship. ``That disturbs me,'' he said. ``My greatest pleasure is
to see families and children come to my building to see an NBA game
in a clean environment. So the escalating salaries have to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollin retains an optimism that an agreement can be reached,
``but I can't say when _ it's up to the players.'' Unfortunately,
he said, players don't seem to trust the owners' proposals or
claims about team finances, among them that 15 teams are losing
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not putting blame on owners or the players for the way
things are,'' he said. ``We signed a deal in 1995 that doesn't
work, so we have to change it.''

GUBERNATORIAL RACE EXPENSES HIGHEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In his grueling campaign to win a full four-year term,
Governor Paul Cellucci spent $6.9 million, a record for a
Massachusetts gubernatorial race, finance records show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 1998 Massachusetts gubernatorial contest _ in which
candidates spent over $18 million _ was the most expensive campaign
for a state office ever waged, breaking the $14.8 million mark set
in 1990 when five candidates ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic nominee Scott Harshbarger spent more than $5.5
million and state Treasurer Joseph D. Malone used more than $3.3
million to challenge Cellucci in the GOP primary. Two other
candidates, Democrats Patricia McGovern and Brian Donnelly, spent a
combined $2.8 million in their primary races.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures _ compiled by the Office of Campaign and Political
Finance _ are based on reports covering the period up to Oct. 31,
the last filing deadline. With a host of bills still outstanding
for each candidate, the final expenditure figures will increase
even further. The figures include spending in the year previous to
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spent far more than any other single candidate in a
Massachusetts governor's race. For example in 1990, John Silber,
the losing Democratic nominee, spent $3.8 million, while William F.
Weld spent $3.4 million to win.
</P>
<P>
   Weld spent $4 million in his re-election bid four years later,
four times what his Democratic opponent, Mark Roosevelt, spent.
Harshbarger's spending includes the nearly $945,000 he received in
public funding.
</P>
<P>
   The spending figures for this year's gubernatorial race surpass
the $16 million spent in the 1996 US Senate race when Weld tried
unsuccessfully to unseat Senator John F. Kerry. But the record for
one race still rests with the $19 million Senator Edward M. Kennedy
and GOP rival Mitt Romney spent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the reason we need the Clean Election Law,'' said Jim
Paisner, chairman of Common Cause of Massachusetts, when told of
the money spent for this year's governor's race. Common Cause is a
public interest group that focuses on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Paisner noted that, while the candidates broke spending records,
voters last week overwhelmingly approved a sweeping campaign
finance plan _ the Clean Election Law _ which provides 85 percent
in public financing to candidates who agree to overall spending
limits and to accept no invidual contributions of more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which is expected to be challenged on constitutional
grounds, would completely change the way state-wide campaigns are
run. It has already created confusion among current office holders
and political aides, who are trying to understand its details and
its far reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
   But Paisner claimed a significant benefit of the statute is that
it will allow candidates to spend less time fund-raising and more
time campaigning. ``Once politicians are weaned from this current
system, there will be much more time for them to spend delivering
the politcal message they need to deliver to their constituents,''
Paisner said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gubernatorial race, Massachusetts voters may
have also seen the most ever spent by one committee on a ballot
question. The electric industry, through its committee, Yes on 4,
spent $7.8 million as of Oct. 31 in its effort kill the proposed
rollback of the electric industry deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   The industry expenditures dwarf the $285,000 that proponents,
who argued the law gave most of the savings to utilities and not
consumers, said they spent as of the Oct. 31 filings.
</P>
<P>
   The spending on this year's Question 4 could challenge the
record set in 1988 when the nuclear industry and its opponents
spent $9.1 million on a ballot initiative over whether to ban
plants that produce nuclear waste. It was defeated. The cigarette
industry spent more than $7 million in 1992 in its failed bid to
defeat a cigarette-tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The gubernatorial expenditure reports do not include the ``soft
money'' funds that were spent by third parties, such as the two
major state parties and labor unions, on behalf of either candidate
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cellucci aides estimated that the state Republican
Party spent about $500,000 on Cellucci's behalf, mostly for
advertising, phones, and mail. Harshbarger was aided by a
television ad by the Massachusetts Teachers Association. The
AFL-CIO also spent large amounts for mailings, phone banks, and
leaflet drops.

 &HT;    AirTran not out of the clouds
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. -- AirTran Airways offers low fares and service
basically indistinguishable from that of a big carrier. It has a
zippy ad campaign and a generous frequent flier program.
</P>
<P>
   What it doesn't have are enough passengers or profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando-based discounter, Atlanta's second-biggest carrier,
was among the few U.S. airlines of any size that lost money in the
summer quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising third-quarter loss, which came amid ideal
conditions of high travel demand and low fuel prices, dashed
earlier indications that AirTran was on the verge of consistent
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is not just when, but if, the airline will ever
achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive D. Joseph Corr calls the loss a temporary
setback caused by unusual costs and the government's refusal to
police unfair price competition by big carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, he said fourth-quarter results will
be close to break-even, owing to declining costs and fall route
changes that shift AirTran's focus even more heavily to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Corr said efforts to attract business fliers are slowly boosting
both ridership and per-passenger revenue, and he added the airline
still plans to begin acquiring new Boeing 717s next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do seems to work ... the rebranding, going after
weekday travelers. It's all working. All we really are is short a
couple of load factor points,'' said Corr, referring to the
percentage of seats sold.
</P>
<P>
   Hired to guide recovery
</P>
<P>
   Corr was hired in 1996 to take over ValuJet Airlines' effort to
recover from the shutdown that followed the Flight 592 crash that
year. One year ago he led ValuJet into a name-changing merger with
AirTran, coupled with a service and marketing overhaul that
included the addition of business-class sections and other changes.
Company headquarters were moved from Atlanta to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run a very competitive product, have nice clean airplanes
and good on-time and reliability rates,'' Corr said. ``If we can
continue to build loads at the rate we have, I see no reason we
can't be profitable long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline filled 56.7 percent of its seats in October, up from
a year earlier but still well below load factors posted by larger
airlines. Atlanta-based Delta, AirTran's biggest competitor, filled
71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow AirTran and its low-flying stock, which
hovers around $3 a share, aren't encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions have been so good for the last few months,'' said
Ed Starkman of Warburg Dillon Read. ``Even as the second guy in
Atlanta sweeping up the crumbs from Delta, you should be able to do
very well. The fact they didn't is worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   James Parker of Robinson-Humphrey expects another loss in the
fourth quarter and says the outlook for 1999 ``is very uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran logged its first post-merger profit in the spring
quarter. Corr predicted then that it would be ``solidly
profitable'' for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than gain momentum in the summer, AirTran posted a
$10.9 million loss for the July-September quarter, laid off workers
and made plans to return two of its 50 jets to lessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was overly optimistic,'' Corr said. ``If you do what I
do you just get mad and work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   As the poor summer results emerged, Corr moved to ditch the
remnants of the original AirTran's Orlando-based route system and
add flights to the old ValuJet network out of Atlanta. Those
changes were completed this month, giving AirTran 130 daily
departures to 29 cities from Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Corr said yields _ the amount of money generated by each
passenger _ are 40 percent higher on Atlanta routes because of the
business travel market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back on track now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive attributes the summer results to three
factors. AirTran spent $3 million preparing for a threatened flight
attendant strike and suffered a rash of engine problems that
required extra maintenance. That helped boost unit costs to 8.6
cents per seat-mile, almost as high as Delta's.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta factor
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AirTran contends it lost passengers to an escalation
of predatory price-matching by Delta. The Department of
Transportation had proposed new guidelines to define and police
predatory pricing, but the rules were delayed after a lobbying
campaign by big carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They folded their tent and went home,'' Corr said of the DOT,
although he added he is hopeful the agency will yet act. He said
AirTran has presented specific allegations to the DOT, but he won't
discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials hotly deny any wrongdoing and say the DOT
guidelines will do more harm than good. They say offering varying
numbers of seats at the same fares as AirTran is clean competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their accusations are baseless,'' said Mark Drusch, a Delta
senior vice president who heads pricing. ``We've been vigorous but
aboveboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Drusch said Delta has laid out its actions to the DOT, which
lodged no objections. He suggested AirTran ``should be censured''
for its public accusations, made prominently in news releases. ``I
really think you've got an airline looking for an easy way out from
its own problems,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are split about the merits of AirTran's complaints, but
they agree it faces broader problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger problem for them is that Delta is able to compete
much more effectively than they did when ValuJet started up,''
Parker said. ``The (1996 crash) changed the competitive situation
immensely by prodding people to make the first call to the
brand-name airline. That's still a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulling out right stops
</P>
<P>
   Delta also has refined its ability to offer significant numbers
of matching fares without diluting profits, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors raise the elemental question of whether AirTran
can compete long-term in Delta's shadow at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are those who say we shouldn't operate out of
Atlanta, but I don't know what numbers they see because the ones I
see say we should,'' said Corr. ``It's just too big a market.
Delta's vulnerable to a well-run alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Corr and other AirTran executives say fares would soar on many
routes if their carrier left the market.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff MacKinney, senior vice president for marketing and
planning, said numerous small and medium-size companies have voiced
that concern and cut volume-based travel deals with AirTran since
it installed business class.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the size to have much leverage with Delta, and
they see in us a very attractive alternative. Atlanta's full of
those companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinney says AirTran's marketing and route strategy won't
change much in the next few months. The next big move will come
next summer when new 717s begin arriving to replace the carrier's
aging DC-9s and 737s.
</P>
<P>
   New image planned
</P>
<P>
   Corr said AirTran will be able to lease the planes despite its
lack of profits, though it may pay higher financing rates. He said
the 717s will be cheaper to fly and maintain and will help AirTran
build a fresh image.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded the stigma of the ValuJet crash remains an obstacle
and will for sometime. ``The world treats us differently,'' he
said. ``It's just something we have to strive to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran appears to have an unremarkable safety record,
notwithstanding the recent accident in which one of its jets ran
off a Hartsfield runway after an emergency landing prompted by
hydraulic problems. Prior to that, AirTran/ValuJet's only accident
since late 1996 came last spring, when a jet flew through hail over
North Georgia and made a forced landing.
</P>
<P>
   (During the same time frame Delta had 24 safety incidents,
ranging from very minor to serious, according to the National
Transportation Safety Board database on the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   Corr, who previously held top jobs at Continental and TWA and
casts himself as a turnaround specialist, has a year left on his
contract. He answers to a board of directors that includes ValuJet
co-founders Robert Priddy and Lewis Jordan, who remain major
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   When AirTran posted the third-quarter loss, the trade journal
Aviation Daily reported Corr's job was in jeopardy. The airline
denied any shake-up was considered. Corr says he still has full
control and wouldn't stay on if he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I wasn't here for the long run,'' he said.
``Had this business been going great by now I would be leaving.
It's a matter of finishing the job.''

 &HT;    Black manufactures may hold tools to boost poor Atlanta areas
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ William Peel doesn't think of himself as a central
player in economic development. Rather, he calls himself a
``real-life, old-line toolmaker from Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta businessman custom-builds tools and machines that
make everything from salt and pepper shakers found in fast-food
restaurants to parts for high-speed trains. As owner of Peel's
Technical Services on West Marietta Street in downtown Atlanta, he
employs three people, all of them black.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work but not a lot of toolmakers'' or other
skilled workers, says Peel, who moved here in 1971 because he saw
Atlanta ``as fertile opportunity for small, flexible
manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   A new study on black Atlanta released today suggests that Peel
and other black manufacturers may be the key to jump-starting
Atlanta's poor neighborhoods. Manufacturing firms have the highest
profits of any small businesses and pay an average yearly wage of
$30,642 in the Atlanta region, according to the report by Clark
Atlanta University's Southern Center for Studies in Public Policy.
The Status of Black Atlanta report examined 120 black manufacturers
that employ 2,811 people in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturing was one of the more viable sectors to develop,''
said Goro Mitchell, a Southern Center researcher and one of the
study's authors. It also is the most logical industry to help
scores of blacks isolated from job opportunities in the suburbs,
Mitchell added. The 125-page report, patterned after the National
Urban League's yearly State of Black America, also looks at
politics, housing and women's issues. Clark has done the annual
study since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Revving up manufacturing in the black community is one of many
recommendations in a report that essentially says progress for
blacks in Atlanta has inched along since the 1996 Olympic torch was
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public-private efforts to lure more middle-class
families back to the city and an infusion of $100 million in
federal money into so-called empowerment zones, little has changed
for many black Atlantans, the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The report draws heavily on U.S. Department of Commerce data on
black businesses, much of which is at least 5 years old. But
Southern Center director B-- b Holmes said data from more recent
sampling indicates conditions for black Atlantans haven't changed
considerably this decade despite the metro area's healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of black Atlanta is not very good,'' said Holmes,
another of the study's authors. ``The trend, if one goes back 15
years or more, shows that progress has been slow and incremental.
But there has also been ... an increase in the disparities between
blacks and whites in Atlanta in housing, manufacturing, income and
unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   The study looks only at the city of Atlanta, and the authors say
that's because many of the city's blacks haven't shared in the
economic growth of the region. ``Unfortunately, the rapid economic
growth which has characterized metropolitan Atlanta during the last
two decades has not occurred at the same rate inside the city
limits,'' Holmes added.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the wage gap: Many middle-class blacks have moved
to the suburbs, leaving the city with a large number of blacks who
work in low-paying jobs in the fast-food, hotel and retail
industries, said Holmes, a political science professor at Clark
Atlanta. At the same time, many of the small businesses in Atlanta
have few financing options to grow, thus further blocking economic
growth in some of Atlanta's toughest areas.
</P>
<P>
   The study cites one encouraging trend: the new wave of black
entrepreneurs who are more highly educated. Eighty-three percent of
black business owners in Atlanta and Fulton County have some
college, 62 percent have bachelor's degrees and 22.2 percent hold
graduate degrees, the study noted.
</P>
<P>
   If the city is to flourish in the future, the study suggests
bolstering black manufacturers through training programs for
workers and managers, loosening the grip on bank loans and other
financing for blacks and helping black manufacturers become more
technologically savvy. The study said more black-owned
manufacturing firms need to be in the empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   While black manufacturers tend to be in predominantly black
neighborhoods and employ more blacks than their white counterparts,
they face their own set of challenges. They tend to be younger and
smaller and generate lower sales than the white firms, and they
have a harder time getting capital, which is essential to a
company's ability to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Machine shop owner Peel doesn't see himself as an economic
catalyst but he agrees black manufacturers and entrepreneurs in the
city need encouragement. ``There's a lot of work out there, ``
Peel, 55, said. ``But to get that work to the inner city where the
majority of jobs are needed and then have the kinds of jobs people
can do _ everything can't be computerized _ takes a plan, not a
wish. It's a long-term plan and anything less than five years in
duration isn't going to work.'' He said small-business owners need
a steady flow of contracts and more apprenticeships for workers.

 &HT;    Robust economy failsto ensure insurance
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The percentage of Georgians under age 65 without
health insurance stayed virtually the same in 1997 as the previous
year, despite a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia State University study found 19 percent of Georgians
under 65, or about 1.3 million residents, lacked coverage in 1997,
the latest year such statistics are available. That's a slight drop
from 20 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years of strong economic growth, the Georgia
uninsured figure has ranged from 18 percent to 20 percent, Bill
Custer, a Georgia State economist, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go into recession, the percentage of uninsured would go
up dramatically,'' Custer warned, citing a similar rise during the
early 1990s economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 43 million Americans, or 18 percent of the
non-elderly, lacked health coverage last year, up from 41.4 million
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance figures are tabulated from a Census Bureau survey
conducted in March. Almost all Americans 65 and older are covered
by the federal Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii and Wisconsin had the lowest rates of uninsured, at 9
percent, while Arkansas and Arizona had the highest, at 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the uninsured tend to be younger, male, at lower income
levels and working in smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
   Two of three uninsured Georgians live in families where there's
a full-time worker. Many employers, though, don't offer coverage to
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the principal reason for the rise of uninsured Americans
over the past 15 years is the increase of health-care costs as a
proportion of family income, Custer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens as health care costs go up is that more people
take the risk that they don't need health insurance _ or that they
can fund whatever care they need out of savings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those without health insurance tend to postpone needed care,
which leads to higher medical costs later. And when health-care
bills aren't paid, those costs are borne by taxpayers, the
privately insured, doctors and hospitals, Custer noted.
</P>
<P>
   One positive development in health insurance is the
federal-state initiative to extend coverage to uninsured children.
In Georgia, the PeachCare for Kids program, which will debut
statewide in January, aims to cover more than 100,000 of the
380,000 children in the state who have no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could make a significant dent'' in the uninsured figure,
Custer said.

 &HT;    Super Show a no-show for 2002

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Goodbye, Super Show _ at least for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's largest and glitziest convention won't return to the
city in 2002 and probably won't come here in 2001, according to Dan
Graveline, executive director of the Georgia World Congress Center.
He called the loss ``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show, which brings more than 100,000 delegates to
Atlanta for its January convention and has an economic impact of
$70 million, will likely go to Orlando in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Super Show couldn't be reached, but Bill
Peeper, president of the Orlando/Orange County Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau, said he was ``really optimistic'' the show will go
to the Florida city.
</P>
<P>
   Graveline said the Super Show will return to Atlanta in 1999 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show, the convention of the Florida-based Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association, has convened in Atlanta since its
inception in 1986. In recent years, it has outgrown space in both
the GWCC and adjacent Georgia Dome. Last year, it used 400,000
square feet in pavilions in the Dome parking lot in addition to one
million square feet in the Dome and GWCC.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's the GWCC's hope to expand that forced the Super
Show to look elsewhere. If the proposed $225 million,
450,000-square-foot expansion of the GWCC is approved by the
Legislature, it would be built on the Dome's northern parking lot,
thus making that space unavailable for exhibits for several years
during construction.
</P>
<P>
   However, without the expansion, Graveline said the city is
certain to lose the convention permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the expansion is not approved in the next session, we stand
virtually no chance of getting the Super Show back,'' said
Graveline. ``We simply can't accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando convention center plans to double its 1.1 million
square feet of space. Atlanta convention officials fear that even
with an expansion here, they could have a hard time winning the
show back.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Roy Barnes already has heard the pitch for the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dedicated to the idea that we have got to build the next
phase (of the GWCC),'' Barnes said. ``But, first I want to get a
comfortable feel for the growth revenue of the state. We have got
some (financially) unstable times internationally.

<P>
   In 1938, the director Victor Fleming made a movie about a Kansas
farm girl who gets swept into the air and enters a dizzying world
of excitement and heartbreak. It was called ``Test Pilot,'' it
starred Myrna Loy, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, and it was an
enormous hit.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, he took over a troubled production about
another Kansas farm girl who gets swept into the air and enters a
dizzying world of excitement and heartbreak. It was called ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' it starred Judy Garland, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr,
and it failed to recoup its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's career is a study in the vagaries of movie history. In
the days of the Hollywood ``dream factory,'' he was a towering
figure. In his engaging memoir ``Studio Affairs,'' Vincent Sherman
recalls Gable's telling him that Sherman knew more about film than
any director except Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman took it as a compliment. Yet today, critics and
festivals pay more attention to Sherman, whose most famous movie is
probably ``Old Acquaintance,'' than they do to Fleming, who
directed two of America's best-loved pictures _ ``The Wizard of
Oz'' and ``Gone With the Wind'' _ for release in a single year:
1939.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's reputation as a tough leader, a savvy filmmaker and
Gable's favorite director led David O. Selznick to recruit him to
take over ``Gone With the Wind,'' a production even more troubled
than ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming won an Oscar for filming most of this prototype of
prestige blockbusters. Over the next half-century, ``The Wizard of
Oz'' and ``Gone With the Wind'' would run neck and neck in stature
and popularity. ``Oz'' was one of the first event movies on network
television when it was broadcast in prime time, in 1956. Between
1959 and 1998, ``Oz'' was shown with unmatched regularity, going
from a box-office disappointment to a broadcast cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the fabled musical re-opened on more than 1,900
screens, nine months ahead of its 60th anniversary. It ranked sixth
on the notorious American Film Institute list of ``the greatest
American movies'' and fifth in a separate Los Angeles Times
readers' poll. (``Gone With the Wind'' ranked fourth and first,
respectively.) The MGM production team has received most of the
credit for ``The Wizard of Oz'' and Selznick for ``Gone With the
Wind.'' Fleming is a forgotten man.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the films he directed helped define ``the movies'' for
generations. His celluloid storybook versions of Stevenson's
``Treasure Island'' (with Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper) and
Kipling's ``Captains Courageous'' (with Spencer Tracy and Freddie
Bartholomew) became childhood favorites not just for those who saw
them in theaters in 1934 and 1937, but also for the legions who
caught them after school in the 50s, on television slots like the
``The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 60s and 70s, college film series became hot tickets
whenever they double-billed Fleming's steamy pre-censorship-code
classics: the 1932 comic-erotic melodrama ``Red Dust,'' with Gable
and Jean Harlow, and the 1933 satire of sex-symbol celebrity,
``Bombshell,'' again with Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   Whether directing swashbucklers or farces or horror films,
Fleming knew how to make a movie's kinetic impact serve a writer's
intentions rather than the other way around. But next to nothing
has been written about Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   You would have to read a biography of Ingrid Bergman to learn
that during the making of Fleming's ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde''
(1941) _ in which she displays a dazzling, un-self-conscious
sensuality _ she became infatuated with her director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got things out of me that were different from anything I
had done before,'' she said to The London Times in 1971. ``What
more can an actor want?''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman's 1946 performance on Broadway in Maxwell Anderson's
``Joan of Lorraine'' prompted Fleming to mount a screen version of
the story, ``Joan of Arc.'' As partners and lovers, Bergman and
Fleming weathered this exhausting, ruinously expensive epic
together. Their affair ended with the movie. He died on Jan. 6,
1949, two weeks after its premiere, while on vacation with his wife
and daughters. Bergman had photos of him nearby at the time of her
death, 33 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming helped imbue ``Gone With the Wind'' with the appeal of a
``women's picture'' and the gusto of a bareknuckled adventure.
After all, Fleming himself was a man's man and a ladies' man. Male
stars like Gable and Gary Cooper and directors like Howard Hawks
patterned themselves after him.
</P>
<P>
   Female stars _ Clara Bow, Lupe Velez and Norma Shearer, as well
as Bergman _ fell in love with him. The renowned producer of
musicals Arthur Freed, who did uncredited work for ``Oz,'' told the
writer John Kobal that Fleming ``was a poet, probably one of the
great unsung men of this business.'' To Freed, he was not just a
``strange fellow'' who ``had this feeling'': he was ``even greater
than John Ford, who was one of the masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pasadena, Calif., in 1883, Fleming was a race-car driver
and mechanic and a Signal Corps photographer who got his big break
in the industry working as a cameraman for Douglas Fairbanks Sr. He
was one of those native Westerners who based stirring fantasy on
real experience.
</P>
<P>
   His hugely influential 1929 version of Owen Wister's cowboy
romance, ``The Virginian,'' was an early talkie with the visual
zest of the immortal silents, a Western milestone comparable to
John Ford's ``Stagecoach'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   It was this movie that turned Gary Cooper into an American icon:
as the Virginian he walks softly and carries a big gun. He is not
just laconic; he is lyrically laconic.
</P>
<P>
   He does not holler or simper or carelessly toss his weight
around. What he does is obey the rules of frontier morality, even
when they hurt. He lynches his closest friend (Richard Arlen) for
cattle rustling and, hours before his wedding, faces the ultimate
black-hat villain, Trampas (Walter Huston), in a shootout. From the
rugged locations in the High Sierras to the unforced sound effects
and confident pacing, the feel and style of the film are what used
to be called ``virile.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traditional masculine pride demanded that a man take action
against threats or insults, serve his own independent morality and
play the sexual aggressor. Fleming's top films codified those
values and made them irresistibly seductive. Gable reached his peak
as a pulse-racing heartthrob in ``Red Dust.'' Playing the
super-competent boss of an Indochinese rubber plantation, he
mesmerizes an elegant married woman (Mary Astor) and a good-natured
prostitute (Harlow).
</P>
<P>
   Few films are this funny and frank about committing adultery and
covering it up. Gable goes to bed with both women without
devastating Astor's decent husband. And he winds up with the woman
who is best for him, Harlow. Gable's brusque persona is like
Cooper's with the courtliness singed off.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's ``Bombshell'' demonstrates how much clout he wielded
in his heyday. According to an interview with his favorite
screenwriter, John Lee Mahin, this delirious burlesque about the
``Monarch'' studio began as the tragedy of an exploited star. Then
Mahin said it struck him as a comedy, and Fleming started
reminiscing about the chaotic home life of ``the It girl,'' Clara
Bow: she had a dog with the run of the house, ``a beautiful
Oriental rug with coffee stains,'' and ``her father'd come in
drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing without being smarmy, Fleming and Mahin added arpeggios
of grace notes. Harlow's title character, for example, is just
finishing up ``Red Dust.'' In the studio-within-the-film, the Hays
Office censors threaten to cut the prostitute's nude bathing scene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, the Hays Office suggestions for eliminating raciness
from the American screen became binding. Fleming answered the call
for family entertainment with ``Treasure Island'' and ``Captains
Courageous.'' When the producer Mervyn LeRoy scrapped the early
footage of ``The Wizard of Oz'' and fired the first director,
Richard Thorpe, he turned to Fleming because he needed a moviemaker
with a child's eye for wonderment. Fleming had settled into
marriage; Mahin thought Fleming took on ``Oz'' because it connected
to his close bond with his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the vitality of ``Oz'' springs from the way Lahr, Bolger
and many others turn their roles into vaudeville acts. Fleming's
sure touch with these performers should not have been a surprise.
He had directed comedy since the silent days. And there had been a
vaudevillian strain to ``Bombshell,'' too, which featured Frank
Morgan, the Wizard himself, as the bombshell's comical fraud of a
father.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's impeccable handling of Judy Garland was not different
in kind from the work he did with other child actors or insecure
stars like Gable.
</P>
<P>
   King Vidor took over the direction of the sepia-toned Kansas
scenes when Fleming departed for Tara. But Fleming and Mahin had
already left their mark. According to Aljean Harmetz's ``The Making
of the Wizard of Oz,'' the pre-Fleming script commenced with static
farmland shots and a blase Dorothy ``riding a pony, talking to a
scarecrow, and grinning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mahin's version, we see Dorothy in turmoil from the get-go,
anguished over the prospect of losing her dog, Toto, to the vile
Miss Gulch and unable to interrupt Aunt Em and Uncle Henry as they
deal with a malfunctioning incubator. Her urge to escape is
immediately understandable. Whether on the high seas of ``Captains
Courageous'' or in the high altitudes of ``Test Pilot,'' Fleming
made sure to root adventure in sturdy emotions _ like Garland's
ardent, innocent yearning for happiness, then home, in ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest stars long outlived and overshadowed him. Yet
Fleming's reputation remains high among filmmakers as varied as
James Cameron and Philip Kaufman (an admirer of ``Red Dust''). In
1989, Steven Spielberg, a devout fan of Fleming's, remade Fleming's
World War II tear-jerker, ``A Guy Named Joe'' (1943), as
``Always.'' And no director had a year like Fleming's 1939 until
Spielberg made ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Schindler's List'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming is still anonymous to the general moviegoing public.
Perhaps that is because his contributions to American popular
culture are so profound as to be intangible.
</P>
<P>
   He conjured a sense of childhood that included risk and
wildness. And in bold, textured images, he conveyed a notion of
adulthood that was adventurous and sexually up-front but rarely
flighty or irresponsible. ``Of all the men I've known,'' Clara Bow
once said, ``there was a man.''

MEDPARTNERS PLANS TO DIVEST ITSELF OF BUSINESS OF PHYSICIAN
PRACTICE MANAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MILT FREDUENHEIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest admission of failure in the business of physician
practice management, Medpartners Inc. announced on Wednesday that
it was leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   Medpartners, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to
concentrate on more profitable units that provide managed care drug
benefits for health plans and coordinate treatments for such
medical conditions as hemophilia and growth hormone deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Medpartners has been the largest publicly traded company that
specializes in buying and operating physicians' practices. It tried
to squeeze savings and profits by centralizing information and
billing systems, marketing to health plans and generally promoting
efficient operations.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors involved often sold their practices to Medpartners
for stock that later plunged as earnings growth stalled. On
Wednesday, some doctors complained that the executives in
Birmingham did not understand their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Crawford, a turnaround specialist who became chief
executive of Medpartners in March, questioned whether publicly
traded physician practice management companies were viable.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, ``It's a question whether the physician
business fits well in a public company setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Medpartners would try to sell the medical groups
to hospitals, venture capitalists and back to the doctors
themselves. The company, which plans to complete the divestiture
within 12 months, said it might also spin the physician practice
unit off to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are just plain bad employees,'' said Kenneth
Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ``It's
not a lot of fun managing 3,000 prima donnas who don't think it's
the best thing to work for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Medpartners, the largest company in physician
practice management, would leave the field to Phycor Inc., which
said last month that it was considering offers to take it private
in view of its low stock valuation. FPA Medical Management, another
big manager of physician practices, filed in July for protection
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Medpartners shares dropped 25 cents, to $4.125, Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange in relatively heavy trading of 5.2 million
shares. The price plunged to $1.625 on Sept. 10, from a 52-week
high of $26.625 a year ago. Phycor rose 31.25 cents on Wednesday,
to $7.5625, on Nasdaq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Brin, board chairman of the 85-physician Summit
Medical Group in Summit, N.J., said Medpartners did not inform
member groups like Summit of its plans until after the stock
markets closed on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported the
plan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brin said the divestiture was ``the best resolution for all
concerned for an industry that is clearly going through the pains
of growth, trying to redefine itself in a marketplace that is
changing extremely rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from managed care buyers and a slowdown in the growth
of government medical payments have intensified the financial
problems of medical groups.
</P>
<P>
   Brin said physician groups would still need access to capital to
grow and consolidate, as companies like Medpartners had promised.
But he said the management of clinics ``needs to be provided at the
local level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the industry believe there will ultimately be a new
version of the physician practice management companies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   William McKeever, an analyst at Paine Webber Securities, said
the companies would have to ``revamp themselves to create more
value'' for doctors by providing a menu of optional services.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz said many hospitals were eager to buy physician
practices, even though they often turn out to be money losers,
because the doctors provide a steady flow of patients to fill
hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   Medpartners reported net income of $7.7 million, or 4 cents a
share, on net revenue of $1.74 billion for the three months that
ended on Sept 30. That was down 84.3 percent from profits of $49.2
million, or 26 cents a share, on net revenue of $1.61 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company projected 10 percent growth in 1999 in its Caremark
drug benefit unit, half from new customers and internal growth and
half from rising drug prices. Pharmacy benefit managers negotiate
discounts with drug makers and offer selected products to health
plans at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said Caremark would handle 43 million prescriptions
this year through 53,000 affiliated pharmacies and its mail-order
center. He said Caremark had 7 percent of the $30 billion annual
sales of drugs through pharmacy benefit management companies. The
business is dominated by units owned by drug manufacturers, Merck &AMP;
Company, Eli Lilly &AMP; Company and SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Medpartners said Caremark had revenue of $661 million in the
quarter, up 7 percent from the year before.

CHRYSLER DISAPPEARS INTO DAIMLER-CHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Germany)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ After decades of close calls with
bankruptcy, a federal government bailout and finally a recent flood
of profits from minivan and Jeep sales, Chrysler Corp. will
disappear as an independent company on Thursday, merging with
Daimler-Benz AG of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   With $140 billion in annual sales, the new company,
DaimlerChrysler AG, will become the world's fourth largest, after
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Mitsui of Japan.
DaimlerChrysler will have 428,000 employees and sell vehicles
ranging from $12,120 Plymouth Neons to $137,895 Mercedes-Benz
CL-600 coupes.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of both companies are exchanging their shares for
stock in the combined company, which will have dual headquarters
here in this northern suburb of Detroit and in Stuttgart, Germany.
Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, and Juergen Schrempp, Daimler's
chairman, will serve as co-chairman for three years; then Eaton is
to retire and Schrempp will run the company alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler and Daimler have also gone to elaborate lengths to
prevent cultural clashes, but one of the most popular subjects of
speculation now in the global auto industry is whether the combined
company can raise revenues and cut costs while avoiding the
cultural conflicts that have plagued previous cross-border
alliances in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler and Daimler executives are convinced that the combined
company will be more competitive. ``There isn't any doubt this
merger is based on growth,'' Eaton said in an interview here
Wednesday. ``If anything, the opportunities get clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics recall that the last trans-Atlantic partnership,
the controlling stake in American Motors Corp. that Renault of
France obtained in the early 1980s, produced few savings and deep
management differences; Renault ended up selling the company to
Chrysler in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Further, skeptics note that Daimler and Chrysler plan to
continue selling all their same cars and trucks under the same
brand names and using the same dealerships. Indeed, the two
partners want customers to continue to perceive their brands as
completely different, and will not even share many engines and
other important parts.
</P>
<P>
   John Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive of GM, said in an
interview Wednesday that the merger would not significantly
increase the competitive pressure on his company. DaimlerChrysler's
size might allow it to demand slightly better deals from parts
suppliers, he said, but added, ``I don't see there's that much in
the way of great synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler and Daimler officials strongly disagree. Chrysler
decided a year ago that it had to expand outside North America to
prosper in the long term, but that it lacked the resources to do so
on its own, Eaton said. Slightly less than a quarter of Daimler's
revenue comes from North America, compared with 90 percent for
Chrysler; thus, he said, Daimler is a logical partner for marketing
Chrysler's vehicles overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The merger partners plan to save money by combining operations
that customers do not see, said Thomas Stallkamp, Chrysler's
president. For example, when Daimler's automaking division,
Mercedes-Benz, ships sport utility vehicles from its factory in
Tuscaloosa, Ala., the trucks return to Alabama empty. Soon, the
trucks will carry vehicles south from Chrysler's assembly plants in
the upper Midwest and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said that he had signed Wednesday the last document
necessary for Mercedes to start producing its sport utility vehicle
in Chrysler's Jeep factory in Graz, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The official language of the combined company will be English,
partly because many German engineers speak English, while few
Chrysler engineers speak German. Top jobs and even upper-middle
management posts will be shared fairly evenly among Americans and
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will be the final day of trading for Chrysler's stock
on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of DaimlerChrysler, trading
on a when-issued basis, rose 18.75 cents Wednesday to close at
$75.875, while Chrysler gained 12.5 cents, closing at $47.0625.
Regular trading of the combined company's shares is to begin
Tuesday under the symbol DCX.

DRY BREAD FOR BRAZIL, BUT JAM FOR ITS LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA _ In late August, as South America panicked at the
possibility that Brazil's economy would follow Russia's into
default, the government here scrambled for ways to protect the
country's shrinking foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced billions of dollars of spending cuts
and tax increases, and started discussing a bailout with the
International Monetary Fund. Communications Minister Luiz Carlos
Mendonca de Barros went to Madrid, where he persuaded Telefonica SA
to advance Brazil the next $3 billion payment toward the company's
purchase of a Brazilian state-owned telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   But back home, Mendonca de Barros took delivery of four Persian
kilims to decorate his office, billing the government $4,000. That
was a modest sum compared with the $38,000 that the Supreme Court,
which will probably have to rule on a number of sacrifices
Brazilians are called on to make in the name of austerity, forked
over for Persian rugs a few months before.
</P>
<P>
   In Pernambuco, the capital of Brazil's poverty-stricken
northeast, the Federal District Court bought $6,500 in
top-of-the-line decorative accent pieces, including wooden vases
and fruit bowls costing $500 each. Here in Brasilia, Congress is
spending $1 million to build a moat around itself.
</P>
<P>
   And the presidents of the House and Senate agreed to shower
maximum benefits on the 594 lawmakers who will attend a special
session to debate government cutbacks and tax increases, paying
them $47,000 for three months _ a sum that the majority of
Brazilian workers, making less than $330 a month, would need at
least 11 years to earn.
</P>
<P>
   As the Brazilian government hoists the banner of austerity and
finishes negotiations for an IMF-led standby loan, the gap between
the government's calls for sacrifice and its spending practices
appears striking.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is not the only country whose leaders spend lavishly on
furnishings or perks, but some leading economists, like Paulo
Rabello de Castro of the Rio de Janeiro-based Atlantic Institute,
say that systematic government overspending is so serious here that
it lies at the heart of Brazil's financial crisis. An undisciplined
government soaks up credit, they say, choking growth of the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   A review of purchase orders from every branch of government,
obtained by The New York Times from a member of the Brazilian
Congress concerned about excessive spending, along with official
budget figures and spending regulations, suggest that the
government has taken minimal steps to control spending, despite the
crisis that has been rolling toward this nation since last autumn,
when the Central Bank doubled interest rates in reaction to the
crisis in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In category after category, government spending has gone up this
year. The executive branch spent $221.8 million on travel between
January and August this year, compared with last year's $206.6
million. Salaries and benefits in the federal judiciary were up
42.8 percent by this August over last, rising to $4.7 billion from
$3.2 billion. Federal legislative branch salaries rose 10.6
percent, while those for the military jumped 20.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of tax increases and pension cutbacks, press reports
of loose spending are drawing angry criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investments are being cut,'' Sylka dos Santos Carneiro, a
reader outraged at a report of government spending on travel, wrote
to the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil. ``Spending on health, education
and other `unimportant things' is being cut. The country has lost
its reason!''
</P>
<P>
   Augusto Carvalho, an opposition congressman and longtime
watchdog of government waste, said senior officials should set an
example of restraint for junior workers. The Congress itself, he
noted, was appealing a recent court ruling against the $47,000
special payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to the IMF for $30 billion, it's the Brazilian
people who are co-signing that loan,'' Carvalho said. ``The
government shouldn't spend for anything that's not absolutely
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Costim, the minister of administration and state reform,
said the government needed to cut expenses and ``moralize'' them.
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso sharply curtailed first-class
travel by government officials recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't represent a great savings,'' Ms. Costim said in an
interview here. ``But at a time when we're asking people to make
sacrifices, we have to make the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   While the gesture may be praiseworthy, the problem runs deeper.
Brazilian civil servants who travel, unlike their U.S.
counterparts, are not reimbursed mainly for receipts but given a
generous allowance for each day away, a system common in many
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Brazilian official visiting Washington, for example,
collects $280 a day whether he stays at a five-star hotel or at the
ambassador's residence. An American official on the same trip would
collect no more than $168 a day. The Brazilian stipends, keyed to
seniority levels, can add up to a kind of supplemental salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Costim said Brazil did not have the personnel to monitor
travel receipts. The executive branch, though, is reviewing major
government contracts and has ordered each agency to come up with
ways to trim spending, she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University of
Brasilia and the president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency
International, said that after October's national elections, the
government cut the budget for auditing and tax collection, citing
the need for austerity. He said such cuts were often a way of
thanking major campaign donors, but Brazil could not afford such
largesse now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even shooting yourself in the foot,'' he said. ``It's
shooting yourself in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others have pointed out that the $7 billion in budget cuts,
announced as part of a $23.5 billion austerity package recently,
are not all based on actual savings, but on cuts to a pre-election
budget for 1999. That budget counted on 4 percent economic growth,
instead of the 1 percent shrinkage the government now forecasts for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Supreme Court President Jose Celso de Mello Filho
boasted of slashing 20 percent from the court's 1999 budget. But
that was after initially raising it by 23 percent, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Mello also said the $38,000 in Persian carpets the court bought
for its salon were necessary because visiting dignitaries
frequently dropped in. Before the court bought the carpets,
visitors would go to the courtroom itself because there was no
suitable reception area, and the justices ended up giving cocktail
parties for the visitors. ``Now, we just give them coffee, maybe a
glass of juice,'' he said. ``It's in, out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Borges, a spokesman for Mendonca de Barros, also said
Persian carpets were justified at the Communications Ministry,
since foreign visitors dropped in there.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court justices have also been lobbying for higher
salaries, which could reach $18,000 a month. The new salary would
apply to the 24 sitting and retired justices. At $9,150 a month,
the justices already earn more than the president of Brazil, who
collects $7,200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was ``a very difficult time'' for Brazil, Mello said
he might argue against an increase at a coming meeting. But
Fleischer and other analysts suggested the justices would probably
get their increases later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more smoke and mirrors for the World Bank, the IMF and
the others, to show the impulse of austerity,'' Fleischer said.
``After the IMF signs off on the loan, it will go back to normal
and they'll probably pass the increase.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of government officials, questioned about the wisdom of
expensive purchases, argued that the Federal Accounts Tribunal
oversaw all spending.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribunal itself has also come under fire. So far this
year, seven of its eight ministers, who are political appointees,
have spent $640,000 on foreign travel, collecting $358,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Erivan Carvalho, a spokesman for the Accounts Court, defended
the travel, saying that Brazil belonged to a number of
international auditors' groups. ``The tribunal already assumed
those commitments,'' he said. ``It has to fulfill them.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With the resignation of the second House
speaker in a decade, the first is hoping that historians will now
come to see him as prophetic, rather than fallen and sullied.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jim Wright, a Democrat who resigned as speaker in 1989
after an ethics investigation kicked off by Newt Gingrich, would
permit himself to exult now that Gingrich is leaving. Certainly not
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would ill become me to gloat or to say, `I'm glad you're
gone, you rascal, you,' '' he said in a late afternoon interview at
his office here on the campus of Texas Christian University. No,
that would be the sort of behavior that, in measured words, he
decries.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright is quite willing to recall his warning in his
resignation speech on the House floor that Gingrich himself would
be consumed by his own ``mindless cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, Wright said, echoing comments he made in a book
several years ago, ``reminds me of an arsonist who sets fire to his
building without stopping to realize the flames are going to
consume his own apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did it escape Wright's notice that in notifying
Republicans last Friday night that he was resigning, Gingrich said,
``I'm not willing to preside over people who are cannibals.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the last election and the likely choice of Rep.
Robert Livingston of Louisiana as the next speaker give Wright
confidence that a new, more constructive tone will finally prevail.
Judging from the comments of friends who served with Livingston on
the Appropriations Committee, Wright said, ``I have the impression
that Bob Livingston will be more an agent of unity than
polarization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright grants that the public and the Congress took years
longer to reject the scandal-mongering style that Gingrich and,
yes, many members of his own party practiced.
</P>
<P>
   He thought his own resignation _ from the leadership and, like
Gingrich's, from the Congress _ would be cathartic. He thought that
civility and collegiality would be restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you might as well have been trying to siphon off the Gulf
of Mexico with an eyedropper,'' he said. Instead, he witnessed
years when budget disputes shut down the government, campaigns
became sharply negative and trading accusations took the place of
improving health care or education.

BONDHOLDERS OF FAILED BARINGS REJECT DEAL TO RECOVER LOSSES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors holding the bonds of Barings PLC, the failed British
bank, Wednesday rejected a proposed settlement seeking to recover
their losses, saying the amount was only a fraction of $1.3 billion
lost in 1995 during a wild and unauthorized trading spree by one of
the bank's Singapore traders.
</P>
<P>
   The bondholders sued the bank, former executives and the
accounting firms that audited the bank's financial statements after
unauthorized trading by Nicholas Leeson led to the collapse of the
232-year-old British merchant bank, which was then acquired by a
Dutch company.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson is serving a 6{-year prison sentence in Singapore for
illegally covering up the trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, Barings and the other defendants
offered to pay the holders of the bank's secured bonds about $100
million, or 63.5 percent of the bonds' face value, said Wilbur Ross
Jr., senior managing director at Rothschild Inc., the Wall Street
firm that is advising the majority of the bondholders. The proposed
settlement, he said, represented far less than even 10 percent of
the trading losses caused by Leeson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that's enough,'' Ross said. He said it was not
clear whether the defendants would make another settlement offer or
allow the case to go to court. The bondholders have retained David
Boies, the lawyer now representing the government in its antitrust
case against Microsoft Corp., to represent them if a settlement
cannot be reached, Ross said. If the court rules that the
defendants must pay the bondholders, they would also have to pay
the bondholders' legal costs under British law.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants had also offered the holders of the bank's
unsecured bonds about 23 percent of the face value of those bonds.
Because of the bondholders' rejection of the settlement, the
investors holding the secured bonds and those holding the unsecured
bonds must now renegotiate how they will split any settlement, Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest holders of the secured bonds are Mutual Shares,
a mutual fund overseen by Michael Price, and Halcyon Partners,
another investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   The two accounting firms that audited Barings' books were
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, which merged with
another accounting firm this year to become PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Leeson wiped out Barings with his unauthorized trading
of securities linked to Japanese stock and bond prices. The losses
led to the bank's takeover by the ING Groep N.V. of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson's lawyers later argued that some of the bank's executives
knew about the financial problems piling up on the books of the
Singapore office. In 1996, British regulators sanctioned at least
five former bank executives by suspending them from securities work
for as long as three years.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting firm hired as the bank's
liquidator, is trying to recover as much money as possible to pay
the bondholders.

FILTER BLOCKS ACCESS TO HATE SPEECH ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PAMELA MENDELS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual move, a prominent nonprofit human rights
organization has developed and will sell to the public an Internet
filter that blocks access to several hundred Web sites that the
organization says advocate bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, the Anti-Defamation League, unveiled the
filter Wednesday at its annual national meeting in Boston. The
device is intended for use by parents and is called the ADL
Hatefilter.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet filters have been created and marketed by
businesses. Although many of those products block sites espousing
intolerance, the devices are generally used to screen out online
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The ADL filter bans sites that preach anti-Semitism, racism,
homophobia and other forms of bigotry. Among the off-limits Web
pages are Ku Klux Klan sites and the white supremacist Aryan
Nations site.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said the project had been undertaken to bring his 85-year-old
organization's experience in fighting anti-Semitism and other forms
of prejudice to the Internet. Foxman said the ADL ``stands with a
certain reputation and credibility on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate out there is rampant,'' he said. ``You used to have to
make an effort to get hate. Now it comes into your home
unsuspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of filtering devices have questioned whether they
are appropriate shields against offensive material or high-tech
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Schneider, a librarian who has written a book about
Internet filters, said the Anti-Defamation League's effort was
misguided because she believed that it sought to fight prejudice
with an electronic version of eye-averting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it disturbing that the Anti-Defamation League thinks
that the way to prevent anti-Semitism is to hide it from the people
who care about anti-Semitism,'' Ms. Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   But Foxman said it was appropriate for parents to try to keep
hate speech from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I as a parent decide I don't want access to this or I don't
want my child to have access to this, that's not censorship,'' he
said. `That's exercising my constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   But as of Tuesday, the device was not foolproof. When a user
working on a computer with the filter running tried to reach three
sites likely to be caught by the filter _ her access was blocked.
But when she tried to reach a white nationalist site called rahowa,
standing for for ``racial holy war,'' she was still able to view
the group's home page even though she was denied entry to most of
the site.
</P>
<P>
   When the problem was pointed out, it was corrected shortly
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wallace, a founding member of the Censorware Project, a
group that opposes filtering, said filtering technology was still
so crude that it was always imperfect, and that it ended up either
blocking legitimate material, missing objectionable sites, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``People market these products as if they protect a child 100
percent,'' Wallace said. ``What if it protects a child 40
percent?''
</P>
<P>
   When the filter is in place, a user who tries to call up a
proscribed site instead sees a page that says: ``Hate Zone. Access
Restricted.'' There is also a button that takes the user to an ADL
``Stop Hate'' Web site, with information about bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The filter is based on technology developed by Cyber Patrol, a
popular filtering product made by The Learning Company in
Cambridge, Mass. It costs $29.95 for the first three months, and
$29.95 for every year afterward. A spokeswoman for the
Anti-Defamation League said the price was meant to offset the costs
of developing and maintaining the filter, not to generate a profit.

U.S. CALLS ISRAELI VOTE `STEP FORWARD' TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-PEACEPLAN) 
(jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday
welcomed the Israeli Cabinet's approval of the Middle East accord
``as an important step forward in the peace process,'' State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that decision having been made, she believes all
concerned must now proceed to implement the agreement as quickly as
possible,'' he said. But he made no reference to the conditions set
by the Israeli Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Other American officials said the Israeli conditions did little
more than state understandings already reached at the talks in Wye,
Md. They expressed relief that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel succeeded in getting the accord through his Cabinet without
the need to call new elections now.
</P>
<P>
   And they said that a formula for a vote by the Palestinian
National Council, and other Palestinians, to change the Palestinian
charter and formally remove clauses calling for Israel's
destruction would be forthcoming. The vote will take place with
President Clinton himself in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a clear and unambiguous reaffirmation that will
satisfy the needs of both sides,'' said National Security Council
spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official in Washington, briefing reporters,
said that Israel understood at Wye that there would be some form of
vote by a quorum of the Palestine National Council. But he refused
to define what sort of vote might satisfy Israel, implying that a
voice vote might be enough, or to say how many members would be a
quorum.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Leavy said, the Cabinet vote, despite the delays,
``is certainly a positive step forward.'' The Wye agreement ``is in
Israel's security interests and in the interests of the peace
process,'' he said. ``The tough challenge now is to get down to
final-status issues and we're eager to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   About suggestions that Netanyahu might restart construction of
housing at Har Homa, within Jerusalem's boundaries, Ms. Albright
``said clearly that we don't want actions to be taken that
undermine or harm the environment in which the implementation of
Wye and the final-status talks must take place,'' Rubin said.

GERMANY AND U.S. NURTURE BOND AT A MANSION WITH A FEW GHOSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Private pain and public hopes came together in a Berlin
mansion last week when the new American Academy was opened on a
site marked by Nazi terror and now dedicated to the trans-Atlantic
partnership that raised Germany from the ruins of war.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at what was once the lakeside house of a prominent
Jewish banking family, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
described Hitler's rule as ``an aberration, but not an organic
aspect of German society'' and said the academy's existence showed
how the wounds of ``the 12-year interregnum'' could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the founding grant for the academy was provided by the
descendants of Hans Arnhold, a Jewish banker who fled the mansion
before it became the wartime home of Hitler's chief economic
adviser, Walther Funk, and later a recreation center for Americans
stationed on the Cold War's eastern frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Richard von Weizsacker, the former German president, called the
Arnhold family's endowment of the academy an act of ``unbelievable
magnanimity,'' dedicated to overcoming ``the evil of the past''
through ``a generous gift for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind von Weizsacker, sailboats passed on the waters of the
Wannsee lake, on whose banks stands another villa where the
destruction of European Jewry was decided by Nazi bureaucrats on
Jan. 20, 1942, a decision later described by Adolph Eichmann as
``the final solution of the Jewish question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arnhold family escaped, but as she recalled the lost places
of her childhood, Anna-Maria Kellen, Arnhold's daughter and now a
New York philanthropist, battled her emotions. The staircase where
she once played was gone, she said, but not her hope that the
mansion would now be a ``staircase leading to higher levels of
understanding and closer degree of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy was conceived four years ago as a symbol of enduring
American commitment to Germany after the end of the Cold War, a
demonstration that even in the absence of a common enemy a
relationship at the heart of the NATO alliance would not be allowed
to erode.
</P>
<P>
   But Kissinger, an honorary chairman of the academy, and Michael
Naumann, the chief cultural official in Germany's new Social
Democratic government, both expressed concerns about the state of
German-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new generation of German and American leaders must redefine
the creative purpose of this period,'' Kissinger said. ``America
and Europe no longer have clearly defined common paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Naumann, a former chief executive of the publisher Henry Holt in
New York, lamented a loss of ``Germany's political importance in
the United States'' and said he detected the ``quiet emergence of a
cultural anti-Americanism'' in Europe driven by negative reaction
to ubiquitous American television and the effects on incredulous
Europeans of the Clinton sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   By holding seminars and by awarding fellowships to American,
German and central European scholars in the fields of the arts and
humanities, the academy aims to promote understanding between
Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Richard Holbrooke, chairman of the academy, talked of Funk
and the Nazis, who built a bunker in the basement of the house, a
sudden gust blew in from the Wannsee. It forced open the glass door
behind Holbrooke and sent a sudden rush of cold air through the
house. ``The ghost of our former occupants,'' Holbrooke said.

   But how can we? We can't help ``Dreamin'.'' That was, as I
recall, Johnny Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's all about ``Wishin' And Hopin''' (Dusty
Springfield).
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible _ I mean, is it really (itals)possible(unitals)?
_ that Cam Neely can make it back, all the way back, to become a
viable member of the Boston Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. Harry Sinden doesn't know. Cam Neely doesn't know.
But there he was, gliding up and down the Ristuccia Center ice
Wednesday, looking indistinguishable from the other Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, wow. ``What A Day For A Daydream'' (Lovin' Spoonful).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this on a day-to-day basis,'' he explained in the
wake of a 47-minute workout. ``If, over the next 10 days, my hip
tells me I can't do it, I will walk away and feel I gave it a good,
honest effort. That's all I'm asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain something to anyone coming to this story a little
late. This wasn't some Ordinary Joe Schmoe talking. This was
(itals)Cam Neely(unitals) talking. Cameron Michael Neely. A
one-of-a-kind hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   If Neely can return to the Bruins' lineup at _ pick a number _
75, 80, 90 percent of his old swashbuckling self, the Bruins
automatically will be a better hockey team. They will surely be a
more interesting team. We are, after all, talking about Cam Neely.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's so hard not to let your imagination take a
1-yard gain and turn it into a 95-yard touchdown run. Getting Neely
back is a tantalizing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   If you're assistant general manager Mike O'Connell, you are
trying very hard to let your head overrule your heart. ``Daydream
about getting him back?'' inquired O'Connell. ``I've been doing it
all summer, like everyone else. But he came to us and explained the
situation. It's a (itals)trial(unitals), he said, and so we're
looking at it the same way. We'll just take a look and see where he
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Harry Sinden himself. Harry is exquisitely
human. He can start out a sentence being a head guy, but before
he's finished his thought, he has turned into a major heart guy.
You think this Neely comeback bid isn't putting a strain on the
Sinden emotions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I start to dream about what could happen here,''
Harry said, ``Cam keeps me in line, because he himself is very
aware of the odds. I've had two or three discussions with him after
his skates. He'd say, `Pretty good, but I'm not where I want to be.
The pain is going away quicker, though.' Keeping in touch with him
has helped me from getting too excited.''
</P>
<P>
   About two minutes later, Neely put on a burst of speed and
unloaded one of those mortars on the goalie. ``Did you see that?''
Harry exploded. ``Not exactly a light skate, is it? I thought he'd
be out there floating around.'' About two minutes after that, Neely
did something else Harry liked, and suddenly, you could tell he was
back in the late '80s or early '90s, back in one of those 50-goal
years, back when Cam Neely was inserting a basketball term _ power
forward _ into the hockey lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't he a devastating body checker when he was healthy?''
Harry blurted out, to no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he was. Everyone knows that. Cam Neely was a new blend
of power and finesse, unlike anything the NHL had known. There had
been tough-guy scorers, people like the legendary Gordie Howe,
whose great extracurricular expertise involved clever use of the
stick when the referee wasn't looking. Neely wasn't like that. His
game was to knock the snot out of an opponent with a legal body
check on one shift and then swoop in for a goal a power play or
shift later. There was, quite frankly, no one quite like him.
</P>
<P>
   Neely didn't hand out assists. No Gretzky, he. Neely was a
professional finisher. Now ask yourself: If you could give the
Bruins one thing, what would it be? A professional finisher, that's
what.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Willie McGee, where-would-we-put-him? issue here.
Cam Neely _ the old Cam Neely, or some reasonable facsimile _ would
have a place on the 1998-99 Boston Bruins. Hence all the dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   He is News, with that capital N. There were eight minicams to
record the historic first practice. One channel thought it was
important enough to do a midday live shot. On a normal practice
day, there might be a half-dozen media folk present, tops. We may
have approached triple figures Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Do not underestimate the enormity of the task in front of him.
Say the damaged hip says it's a go by the end of next week. That
doesn't mean he'll be racking up a hat trick against Tampa Bay or
the Florida Panthers the week after that. This man has not played a
serious game, against serious top-shelf competition, since Feb. 21,
1996. Once he has established his physical viability, there will be
the rather daunting matter of regaining his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice is like riding a bicycle to a guy like him,'' warned
O'Connell. ``But the timing needed to play a real game is something
else. When do you break into the open? When do you retreat? When
someone throws something at you, how do you react? When you see the
subtle hand or feet movements of either an opponent or a teammate,
will you react instantly, the way you used to? The ability to read,
and read quickly _ those are going to be the hard parts.''
</P>
<P>
   All true, of course. But we're talking about Cam Neely, right?
Cam can do it if anybody can do it, right?
</P>
<P>
   I can't help but be excited. I'm pumped. I can't help it. I
mean, ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'' (Andrews Sisters).

 FORT WORTH: or education.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 75, Wright has the wavy white hair, deepset eyes and
bristly eyebrows to lend oracular weight to his pronouncements. But
he takes pains to contrast Gingrich's outrage and hyperbole _ he
repeatedly called Wright ``a crook'' and ``the most corrupt House
speaker of the 20th century'' _ with his own restraint, even
self-deprecation. He now calls himself ``an ersatz columnist and an
ersatz professor,'' given his light writing and teaching loads for
the local newspaper and the college.
</P>
<P>
   Wright resigned after the House ethics committee charged him
with 69 ethics violations. He was accused of improperly taking
gifts from a developer who had a direct interest in legislation and
using sales of an earlier book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to
lobbyists and supporters to circumvent restrictions on outside
income.
</P>
<P>
   Wright still hopes that historians who review his 7,000-word
departure speech and the documents he submitted for the record will
agree that he broke no laws or House rules.
</P>
<P>
   Wright began pointing out the accumulating ironies a few years
ago when Gingrich got into his own ethical scrapes. On Jan. 21,
1997, the House formally reprimanded him and fined him $300,000 for
using tax-exempt money to promote Republican goals and giving the
ethics committee false information. By then, Gingrich had returned
to Rupert Murdoch a $4.5 million book advance that, as Wright's
supporters say, was far more than Wright ever earned from his book.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich resigned not over his transgressions, however, but over
what his Congressional flock saw as his responsibility for his
party's reversals. Gingrich has said that political as much as
ethical considerations motivated his pursuit of Wright, for he
feared that the speaker had the skill and power to extend
Democratic domination of Congress indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Wright agrees that historians could fairly count him and
Gingrich as House speakers who helped keep Congress from being
reduced to merely reviewing presidential actions and initiatives.
At least initially, Wright said, ``I admired the parliamentary
skill with which Gingrich pursued the items on his chosen agenda,
the Contract With America. I thought that was leadership, though I
didn't embrace his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the Gingrich reign, Wright said, Gingrich was
using the same tactics against President Clinton that Gingrich had
used against him. ``Isn't it obvious?'' Wright said, adding that
even when he resigned he also warned of overreaching by zealous
special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wright calls for campaign finance changes to reverse the
alienation of an electorate whose participation declined to 38
percent in this month's election. He recalls how in 1954 he mounted
his successful first congressional campaign, against an incumbent,
with just $34,000 raised mostly from individuals and 6,500 block
captains who rang every doorbell in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when campaigns are waged by commercials, he said, ``People
don't feel they're involved. All they hear on television is
negative stuff about candidate A and candidate B, so they go away
disenchanted and disillusioned, and they don't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most prominent Republican winner in the elections, Wright
said, Texas Gov. George W. Bush demonstrated the moderate,
accommodating style that Clinton has used to his advantage. ``He
contrasted with the political practitioners whose tactics have been
repudiated by the voters,'' Wright said. ``He has not gone out to
defame or discredit anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about then, Wright's assistant, Norma Ritchson, interrupted
to say that Wright even showed sympathy for Gingrich. ``Poor man,''
Ms. Ritchson recalled Wright saying earlier this week. ``He must
feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Wright admitted he didn't remember putting it quite so
warmly. ``I didn't weep. I didn't shed tears,'' Wright said. ``But,
hey, we're all in this together.''

ISRAEL'S CABINET APPROVES PEACE PLAN, BUT BINDS IT WITH
STIPULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to insert material after 2nd graf and 5th graf, and
correcting spelling of Abu Rudaineh in 15th graf.)  (htv) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Cabinet, after a two-week delay,
conditionally approved the land-for-security peace accord Wednesday
night, attaching a series of stipulations and threats that the
Palestinians interpreted as overtures to conflict, not resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The approval by the 17-member Cabinet was a shaky victory for
Benjamin Netanyahu, the beleaguered Prime Minister of Israel who
faces stiff opposition from the right.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the Cabinet's 17 ministers voted in favor, five
ministers abstained and four voted against the agreement, which was
reached with American mediation at talks last month between
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The ratification came after three days of raucous deliberation,
interrupted by a terrorist attack last Friday and resumed Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement may have been reaffirmed technically, but the
ministers have no confidence in the government,'' said Yitzhak
Levy, the Minister of Education and leader of the National
Religious Party, who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet's approval was welcomed by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albrigh ``as an important step forward in the peace
process,'' the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement goes to the Israeli Parliament on Thursday, where
a majority is expected to approve it, although the vote could be
complicated if a motion of no-confidence _ or of confidence _ in
the government is appended.
</P>
<P>
   The feeble majority in the Cabinet underscores the weakness of
Netanyahu's coalition, which has become increasingly dysfunctional
as a governing body.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised news conference announcing the ratification,
Netanyahu, flanked by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, issued what
amounted to a threat to annex chunks of the West Bank if the
Palestinians moved next spring to unilaterally declare an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right to apply Israeli law to the security
areas, to the Jerusalem area and the area of the settlements and to
other things that are accepted as vital interests of Israel,''
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet shackled its support for the agreement to conditions
that are likely to prove future points of friction. It said that
the entire Palestinian National Council, which has 670 members,
must meet and vote by a majority to strike clauses calling for
Israel's destruction from the Palestinian covenant. That goes
beyond the text of the accord, which makes no mention of a vote or
a majority decision. And some Palestinian leaders have proclaimed
that no vote will be taken because they believe a vote taken in
April 1996 should suffice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet also declared that in the third redeployment, which
the peace accord says will be deliberated by a committee, Israeli
troops will withdraw from no more than an additional 1 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And the ministers said they will reconvene to reconsider the
accord's approval after each brief phase of the 12-week
implementation period, weighing whether the Palestinians have lived
up to their promises before recommitting to the next troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, tried through his chief
spokesmen to emphasize his relief that the accord had been
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that they approved the agreement,''
said Nabil Abu Rudaineh, a senior spokesman. He added, using
Netanyahu's nickname: ``Now Bibi has no excuse for delaying
further. The implementation will create an atmosphere of trust
among the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Palestinian leaders chafed at what they saw as the
Israelis' audacity in attaching conditions to an international
agreement that was not meant to be amended by one side.
</P>
<P>
   The implementation was structured in phases so that the Israelis
and the Palestinians could progress toward a relationship of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian leadership does not accept any of these
conditions,'' said Hassan Asfour, a top aide to Arafat. ``This sets
a dangerous precedent for the relationship. We are not agents of
the Israelis. We do not do as they command. We will abide by the
terms of the international agreement, and only by those terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu announced that he was ready to take two concrete steps
in the next week _ to allow the opening of the Palestinian airport
in Gaza and to return ``a batch'' of political prisoners to the
Palestinians, ``not ones with blood on their hands or members of
Hamas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention the first Israeli troop withdrawal, which is
supposed to take place no later than next Monday. It has inevitably
been delayed by the postponement of the Israeli Cabinet's
ratification of the accord. The Israelis agreed to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 15,000 Jewish settlers, who arrived in hundreds of buses
from the West Bank, rallied against the agreement in Rabin Square
in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, playing to the jeering crowd a tape
of a speech by Netanyahu in which he said it was wrong to turn over
any territory to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jerusalem sits a clumsy, useless and confused government
which doesn't care that our Jewish brothers in Hebron, at Katif,
and in Judea will be hung out to dry,'' said Rehavan Zeevi, head of
the far-right Moledet Party. ``And maybe, God forbid, murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear where such rhetoric will lead, as the right
wing does not want to topple Netanyahu only to find itself
responsible for installing a Labor government. Also, there may be a
sizable gulf between the settlers and their leaders. A survey by a
polling firm, working for the leftist Peace Now group, found that
only 40 percent of Jewish settlers were emphatic in their
opposition to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference, Sharon, who was brought into the
government partly to placate the right, presented the Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank as an inevitability because of the
interim peace agreement signed by the previous government in Oslo.
But the current government, he said, toughened it with reciprocal
demands for security.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were able to achieve, and I don't think anyone could
achieve more, was the minimum evil,'' Sharon said. ``It's not an
easy retreat. It's difficult and painful. But we made every
possible effort not to harm our security.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on a late-night interview show, Netanyahu said his
chief concern was not Palestinian autonomy but Palestinian arms.
``I know there is a majority of Israelis who believe a Palestinian
state will exist, but I am confident if we are sane that we don't
mean an armed state next to us,'' he said. ``When you have an
autonomous state, it's very hard to restrict sovereign decisions
such as an alliance with Saddam Hussein. My insistence is to
sterilize elements which will stop the Palestinians not from
running their lives but from threatening us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political insiders expected the Cabinet to attach one more
condition: the start of construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa, in the vacant hills of southeast Jerusalem. That did
not happen, although Netanyahu implied Wednesday night that his
government would move forward on the project. ``Watch the papers,''
he said, referring to the legal advertisements that must be placed
to solicit construction bids.
</P>
<P>
   Construction at Har Homa would expand the city's borders before
its fate is decided in the delicate final phase of peace
negotiations. It is a very sensitive issue. An Israeli decision to
build at Har Homa provoked the 19-month freeze in the peace talks
that ended with the signing of the peace memorandum at the White
House on Oct. 23.

Erika Milvy writes a bi-weekly column called Cybertainment for the
Los Angeles Times. 
 By ERIKA MILVY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we saw Tom Hanks with Meg Ryan, they fell in love
before ever setting eyes on each other. ``What if someone you never
met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only
someone for you?'' asked the advertisements for what seemed like a
far-fetched fairy tale, ``Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, people are falling in love with strangers
across a crowded chat room, and e-mail has woven itself into the
fabric of our day-to-day lives, an adult equivalent of passing
notes in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail,'' the new romantic comedy opening on Dec. 18
from Hanks, Ms. Ryan and Nora Ephron, the trio who made ``Sleepless
in Seattle,'' close-focuses its camera on the care and feeding of
an e-mail romance.
</P>
<P>
   When the producer Lauren Shuler Donner set her sights on
updating the 1940 classic ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' she had
an inspiration: we'll use e-mail, she said. In Ernst Lubitsch's
film of Nikolaus Laszlo's Hungarian play, James Stewart and
Margaret Sullavan are feuding co-workers who correspond in eloquent
epistles unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Ephron, along with her sister and co-screenwriter, Delia,
transformed this premise into ``You've Got Mail.'' Speaking by
phone from her apartment on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, Ms.
Ephron said: ``You couldn't really have done this 10 years ago. In
that era of the 20th century, when mail had ceased to be a means of
communication, you couldn't really have done a new version of `The
Shop Around the Corner.' E-mail manages to bring back something
that is old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' not only brings back something
old-fashioned; it also seizes on the spirit of the times. Peopled
with New Yorkers knocking back Starbucks lattes while bemoaning the
malling of America, the film encapsulates a late-20th-century
ambivalence about progress and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Fox, played by Hanks, owns and operates a chain of
cappuccino-brewing mega-bookstores whose comfy chairs beckon
browsers to idle away an hour. When he decides to open a branch on
the Upper West Side, the small children's bookstore nearby, owned
by Ms. Ryan's Kathleen, is threatened with extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Inherited from her mother, the 40-year-old business, called the
Shop Around the Corner, so defines Kathleen that her on-line
pseudonym is Shopgirl.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the film, Kathleen's boyfriend, a
typewriter-collecting neo-Luddite played by Greg Kinnear, proclaims
that the computer heralds the end of Western civilization. As soon
as he is out the door, Kathleen hurries to her laptop with a rush
of guilty pleasure. Next we hear the familiar song of modems
connecting as she logs on to America Online: Kathleen has met a
special someone in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   As trend-spotters have spotted, e-mail has, in its way, revived
the lost art of romantic letter-writing. In the film, an elderly
character reminisces about his correspondence with a former
sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had beautiful penmanship,'' he muses, reminding us of a
now irrelevant virtue.
</P>
<P>
   In electronic courtship, it is witty wordsmithing that wins
hearts. Hanks and Ms. Ryan are engaged in a meeting of minds
without bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Amorous e-mailers who have met in cyberspace ``feel that their
relationship grew from the inside out instead of the outside in, as
face-to-face relationships do,'' said Esther Gwinnell, author of
``Online Seductions: Falling in Love with Strangers on the
Internet.'' She notes that such intimacy results from a feeling of
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are in the safety of your own home,'' she said, ``where
you can sit around in your ratty bathrobe and bunny slippers. You
don't have the kind of social anxiety that you would have meeting
people in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Poring over her e-mail, Kathleen is enchanted by Joe's language.
``I would send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils if I knew
your name and address,'' he writes. ``On the other hand, this not
knowing has its charms.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gwinnell acknowledges the charm: because the Internet offers
virtually no information about a person, he or she becomes a
``tabula rasa,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are able to fill in all the blanks from your imagination
and fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle, author of ``Life on the Screen: Identity in the
Age of the Internet,'' concurs. ``E-mail raises the possibility of
projection to a higher power,'' she said. ``All you have are the
other person's words. A great deal is left to the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line conversation allows a suitor to perfect his personality.
We see Hanks struggling with his words, backspacing, deleting and
starting again until they are just right.
</P>
<P>
   As the book baron bares his softer side on line, the movie makes
another point, one also made by Richard Booth in ``Romancing the
Net: A Tell-All Guide to Love Online.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men tend to open up faster and divulge more of their thoughts
and feelings on line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While such attributes may jump-start an infatuation, a recent
study from Carnegie Mellon University found that cyberspace is
hardly an emotionally satisfying sphere. The study, ``Internet
Paradox: A Social Technology That Reduces Social Involvement and
Psychological Well-Being?,'' published in the September issue of
American Psychologist, found that even moderate use of the Internet
was associated with increased depression and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use was also associated with a decline in the amount of
time spent with family members and the size of one's social circle.
</P>
<P>
   In making the film _ renamed ``Sleepless in Cyberspace'' in a
recent AOL chat room _ Ms. Shuler Donner was concerned about how to
tell a story that transpires mostly under the fingertips of its two
stars. ``It potentially could be static,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delia Ephron added: ``We are very lucky that Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan are the two people writing the letters. Watching me compose
e-mail would not be as riveting.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``The Net'' feature fancy computer graphics that
enhance the visuals. ``We don't have anything going on on our
computers but words,'' said Nora Ephron, ``which is what the movie
is essentially about anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   While the film offers less traditional action, otherwise
workaday gestures take on new meaning. An index finger hovering
hesitantly above the send button becomes a moment of high tension.
Nora Ephron recalls that in a preview screening in Los Angeles,
members of the audience called out, ``Delete it!'' when Hanks's
character typed, ``Do you think we should meet?''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ``You've Got Mail'' the first film to document
cybercourtship, it is also perhaps the first film to take the
computer for granted. Its characters are not engaged in high-tech
identity annihilation (``The Net'') or complex hackery
(``Sneakers''). They are simply living their lives at the turn of
the 20th century, meeting in one of AOL's 16,000 chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And when they decide to meet, Joe and Kathleen experience all
the anxieties that are part of love with a perfect stranger. Sure,
they may look good in an attractive font, but what in the world
will they be like f2f (that is, face to face)? Her friends tease
Kathleen that NY152, as Joe calls himself on line, may well be the
rooftop killer stalking the Upper West Side. What might that handle
mean anyhow _ 152 pockmarks? 152 felonies?

DESORMEAUX AND DRYSDALE DELIVER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Cali lf. _ The first stakes race of Hollywood Park's
autumn season ended with Kent Desormeaux and Neil Drysdale in the
winner's circle and boos drifting up to the stewards' booth.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some things didn't change when thoroughbred
racing moved across town on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Drysdale training and Desormeaux riding, English-bred
Bodyguard avoided a collision in midstretch and won by 1} lengths
over Moonlight Meeting in the $44,100 Itsallgreektome Stakes for
3-year-olds on the rain-dampened turf. It was the two men's 19th
stakes victory together this year, including 18 in Southern
California, the most on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go out there (on a Drysdale horse), I feel like I
can't get beat,'' said Desormeaux, whose wins with the trainer
include Fiji's in the Yellow Ribbon Stakes at Santa Anita on
Sunday. ``When the gates open, I can promise you the horses are
ready for the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodyguard had to scoot outside to avoid a midstretch tangle that
resulted in Success and Glory and jockey Chris McCarron being
disqualified from fourth to sixth for causing favored Silic and
Gary Stevens to brake.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd of 6,775 booed, thinking Bay Street Blues and
Laffit Pincay should have been DQ'd. But the stewards ruled Bay
Street Blues, who finished third, turned into Silic's path only
after Success and Glory bumped his hind end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's the hardest call we have all meet,'' senior
steward Tom Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The day's other stakes, the $72,350 Steinlen Handicap on turf,
was won by favored Brave Act, also an English-bred, with Chris
McCarron riding for trainer Ron McAnally. Drysdale's Prize Giving,
with Alex Solis, finished second, and Drysdale's Tamhid, with
Desormeaux, ran fourth.
</P>
<P>
   McAnally, McCarron and jockey Corey Black each won twice on the
first of 31 days of racing at Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Main-track races were dominated by front-runners. The day's
longest-priced winner, Bit O'Dixton ($34.20), slipped through to
the lead on the rail on the turn, and the other upsetter, Rebound
Boy ($22.80), led from gate to wire.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance was down more than 2,200 from last fall's opener.
But all of the opening-week numbers figure to look bad in
comparison to 1997, when fans were excited about Hollywood Park
hosting the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In a backward step, Hollywood Park canceled plans to guarantee a
seven-figure pick-six pool on Nov. 29, the day of the Matriarch
Stakes and the Hollywood Derby. The track introduced such
guarantees with success at its summer meet. But the gimmick drew
disappointing wagering in two tries at Oak Tree and Hollywood Park
saw that as a sign it was being overused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope other tracks will follow our lead to ensure the
guaranteed pick-six remains a special event,'' Hollywood Park
chairman R.D. Hubbard said.

METS TAKE A GAMBLE AS BONILLA RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ He's baaaaack. But this time, the Mets insist,
Bobby Bonilla will be a different person and a different player.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, whose first tenure with the Mets was a disaster from a
production and public relations standpoint, returned Wednesday in a
trade that sent Mel Rojas, a disaster as a relief pitcher, to the
Los Angeles Dodgers. The Mets received $1 million in the deal to
offset the difference in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we will make it eminently clear to him he's not
expected to come here and carry the ballclub,'' said Frank Cashen,
the Mets' interim general manager, who completed the swap initiated
by Steve Phillips, who is on a leave of absence. ``It was an awful
burden on him the first time he came. He was supposed to lead us
out of the wilderness, take us to the Red Sea and part the waters.
It didn't work that way. He said he couldn't swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bonilla drowned, and took the Mets down with him. It was
the winter of 1991-92, and the Mets, with Al Harazin having
succeeded Cashen as general manager, embarked on what they thought
would be a breakthrough season, adding Bret Saberhagen and Eddie
Murray along with Bonilla. But they barely had stepped into the
water when they went straight down.
</P>
<P>
   Signing a five-year, $29 million contract that was then a major
league record, Bonilla stumbled each step of the way. ``You can't
knock this smile off my face,'' he said at his introductory news
conference, then proceeded to remove the smile himself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides failing to hit as he had when he was No. 2 to Barry
Bonds in Pittsburgh, Bonilla riled Shea Stadium fans by wearing
earplugs to block out their boos and alienated reporters with his
threats and his behavior, including an incident where he called the
press box to complain about an error he was charged with in a
one-sided game.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonilla, whom the Mets traded in 1995 to Baltimore, wanted
to come back. He wanted to do it right this time, he told friends,
and turn things around. The Mets' owners are among his biggest
boosters. ``I'm very upbeat about the trade,'' Fred Wilpon said.
``I think Bobby will have a real turnaround year. He doesn't want
to end his career without making it in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashen admitted to having ``slight concerns'' but added, ``I
really am probably assured in our own mind that he has matured so
much since that time that he understands what he's going to be
into, that he will be well prepared and will report in shape and
ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla himself was not available to react to the trade. The
Dodgers had been unable to reach him to tell him about the trade,
team officials said, because he was vacationing in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets went after Bonilla, Cashen said, because they needed
somebody to bat behind Mike Piazza, their $91 million man. ``With
the investment we've got in him, we wanted to make sure he was
protected,'' Cashen said at a news conference at the general
managers' meeting. ``We think that he does that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said that Bonilla, who will be 36 years
old next season, would play left or right field. The Mets got
dismal offensive production from those two positions this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby Bonilla is a guy who comes with some risk but
also comes with a lot of reward,'' Valentine said, then added,
``The risk is whether he catches the ball when it comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets sign B.J. Surhoff, a free agent, the manager would
put Surhoff in left and Bonilla in right. Surhoff, a New York
native, is so eager to play for the Mets that he called his agent,
Greg Clifton, from Japan, where he is playing with a major league
all-star team, to ask if the Mets had called.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also are interested in Brian Jordan, a right fielder,
but they most likely have too much competition to be able to sign
him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides another outfielder, the Mets seek a leadoff hitter who
could play second base. They have talked with the Milwaukee Brewers
about Fernando Vina, but the Brewers want low-priced starting
pitching, which the Mets can't give them.
</P>
<P>
   The trade with the Dodgers could lead to another deal that would
give the Mets a second baseman. The teams, in fact, considered
making this one a multi-player swap. Kevin Malone, the Dodgers'
general manager, said he would consider giving the Mets Eric Young
in a trade for Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's available, as they say he is, I'd like to have him,''
Malone said. ``I like his competitiveness. I like his desire and
passion to win. I like what he brings to the table. I like
warriors. He's a warrior. He loves to play the game. The
personality of the Dodgers would benefit greatly from someone of
Todd's makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets continue to suggest that they will trade Hundley to
an American League team.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers said they traded Bonilla to open third base for
Adrian Beltre, whom Malone said is one of the game's best
prospects. But they also wanted to shed some salary. Bonilla has
two years left on his contract at $5.9 million a year. Rojas has
one year left at $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, whom the Mets obtained from the Chicago Cubs in August
1997, never pitched effectively for them. He was so bad that
Valentine quit using him late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were willing to take Rojas for two reasons: He made
it possible for them to trade Bonilla, and Malone knows him from
Montreal. Malone also wants to improve the Dodgers' bullpen,
although Rojas isn't certain to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla doesn't come with any guarantees, either. He knocked in
only 45 runs during an injury-plagued season with the Marlins and
the Dodgers while hitting 11 home runs and batting .249.

TRANSFORMATIONS AS A WAY OF LIFE, NOT JUST ON SCREEN  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
Justine Elias writes about film, television and theater from New
York. 
 By JUSTINE ELIAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Faculty,'' which opens on Christmas Day, Famke Janssen
plays a timid, bespectacled high school teacher, a woman whose
voice quavers when she urges a promising but wayward student to
apply himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since the movie is a thriller directed by Robert Rodriguez
(``Desperado'') and written by Kevin Williamson (``Scream''), it is
safe to expect that the shy educator will undergo a radical shift
in personality and appearance before the final reel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then it should be easy to recognize Ms. Janssen as the
confident actress who has given a series of witty, engaging
performances in relatively small parts: the Russian-born owner of a
gambling joint in ``Rounders,'' the bitter, alcoholic ex-wife of a
Southern lawyer in ``The Gingerbread Man'' and a tough, blue-collar
Bostonian in ``Monument Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Celebrity,'' a Woody Allen film that opens on Nov. 20, she
plays a sophisticated editor in love with a neurotic, on-the-make
writer played by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to fight typecasting as hard as I can, while I have
time,'' says Ms. Janssen, who lives in Manhattan with her husband,
the director and screenwriter Todd Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Though she earned good notices in 1995 for her performance as a
lethal Russian spy named Xenia Onatopp in ``Goldeneye,'' Ms.
Janssen says that the international publicity she earned from being
a Bond Girl led her to reject offers to play glamorous, cartoonlike
leading women and to seek out more intriguing supporting roles.
``Once you achieve a certain level of success or fame, it becomes
really difficult to go against type. This is a good time for me to
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is hard to imagine Ms. Janssen blending into a crowd _
she is 5 feet 11 inches, and her exotic beauty has been compared to
that of 1940s stars like Hedy Lamarr _ her colleagues praise this
very quality, as well as her dedication and humor.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Leary, who acted with Ms. Janssen in ``Monument Avenue,''
says he didn't recognize Ms. Janssen when first saw her in the
film's Boston production office. ``She came dressed in character,
in leather pants and denim, and I walked right by her,'' he says.
``I thought she was someone from the neighborhood, auditioning for
a small role,'' he says. ``She spent a few days hanging around, and
within a few days she had the accent down. I was really
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Janssen's ability to adopt a convincing regional accent _
Slavic by way of Brooklyn, Savannahian, or blue-collar Bostonian,
to name a few _ is all the more surprising because English is not
her native language. The 34-year-old was born in Amsterdam, and she
did not move to the United States until she was in her early
twenties.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, she had dropped out of her Dutch university, where
she was studying economics, and spent several years working in
Europe as a fashion model. She arrived in New York with enough
money saved to join an acting workshop and re-enroll in college _
this time as a creative writing and literature student at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Janssen now sounds thoroughly American, an agent
urged her to change her name to avoid being perceived as foreign.
(Her first name, unusual even in her native country, means ``little
girl'' in the Friesland dialect.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know actors do it all the time, but I felt I'd be losing my
identity,'' Ms. Janssen says. ``Instead, I worked harder on losing
my accent.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, make one concession for her career: convinced
that she would have a better chance at getting film work, she spent
five unsatisfying years as a struggling actress in Los Angeles,
playing a crime-fighting supermodel in a television movie, and an
object of desire in a ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode
called ``The Perfect Mate.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of her career, she says, her success is tied to
the director. ``It's really in the director's hands, and I've tried
to work with directors who consistently do their own thing. If you
do well as an actor, a good director will pick up on it, and keep
it in the film.''

MONSANTO AIMS TO RAISE $5 BILLION VIA OVERHAUL, JOB CUTS, STOCK
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Monsanto Co., which for the last few years has
aggressively pushed into biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, said
Wednesday that it planned to raise about $5 billion by
restructuring its operations, reducing its work force as much as 9
percent, or 2,500 jobs, and selling additional shares to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that the plan, which comes just a month after
its failed merger with American Home Products, a giant
pharmaceutical producer with large reserves of cash, is expected to
help finance Monsanto's recent acquisitions of a number of large
seed businesses and prepare the company to develop a number of
promising new products.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto announced the plan after the close of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, where its shares closed at
$38.6875, down 50 cents. But Wall Street analysts say that without
the American Home Products deal, which some think broke down
because of a dispute over who would run the new company, Monsanto
found itself in desperate need of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid big bucks for their seed businesses, and they also
have a lot of drug products in the pipeline,'' said Richard
O'Reilly, an analyst with the Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group.
``Right now, they have a lot on their plate, and so they have to
pay some of the bill until the drug pipeline comes to fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Monsanto evidently agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it really means for the company is that we will get the
financing issues behind us and we can focus our energies on
bringing the pharmaceutical pipeline and the agricultural and
biotechnology products to the market,'' said Gary Crittenden, chief
financial officer at Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis. ``We
are on the brink of launching one of the largest pharmaceutical
products of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   That product, Celebrex, has been described by Monsanto as a
promising new arthritis drug, which is under review by the Food and
Drug Administration. It is also a symbol of the new path that
Monsanto has taken in recent years, shifting its focus from the
chemicals business, which tended to be cyclical, to the high-growth
pharmaceutical and futuristic biotechnology businesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That shift has sent shares of Monsanto soaring in recent years,
more than tripling in worth. And the deal with American Home
Products, which analysts expected to benefit both companies, seemed
to have offered a solution to backing Monsanto's huge bet on what
it calls the ``life sciences'' business _ an approach to
integrating the businesses of agriculture, health care and
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The life sciences business, the company says, is creating more
efficient crop yields, cotton that can be protected against insects
and healthier foods. But Wall Street analysts say that without
American Home Products, Monsanto found itself without the cash
required, particularly after it made huge investments in the seed
and biotechnology business.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Monsanto has spent more than $8 billion on the
seed business, including the acquisition in June of Cargill Co.'s
international seed business.
</P>
<P>
   Some deals are still pending. The company recently announced
plans to acquire the 60 percent of DeKalb Genetics Corp. of DeKalb,
Ill., that it does not already own for $2.3 billion. DeKalb is one
of the nation's largest seed-corn companies.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's other big seed deal, valued at $1.9 billion, is a
proposal to buy Delta and Pine Land Co., the largest domestic
cotton-seed producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of opportunities, but they need cash,'' said
Timothy Meyer, an analyst with Equity Advisers in Chicago. ``So
their first choice was American Home Products, which is a cash cow.
But if they're not going to get it, they're going to have to go to
the public markets. But it's good; it relieves a lot of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan announced Wednesday, Monsanto would issue
about $1 billion in new common stock, about $500 million in debt
that is convertible into stock, $2.5 billion in long-term debt, and
about $1 billion from the sale or divestiture of some of its
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to restructure its operations in ways
that will eliminate as many as 1,000 of its more than 28,000 jobs,
and cut as many as 1,500 more through the sale of assets. By 1999,
Monsanto expects administrative costs to be reduced by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But marketing and technology spending will rise as it brings
products to market, and hopes to move aggressively into new
biotechnology ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions today continue a long-term process,'' Monsanto
chairman and chief executive Robert Shapiro said in a statement.
``From 1992 to 1995, we developed our strategy to transform
Monsanto into a leading life sciences company. From 1995 to the
present, we've been putting together the resources and capabilities
_ business portfolio, people, technologies and infrastructure _ to
carry out that strategy.''

FOR FAMILY FILMS, IT'S SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ga.)  (af) 
Anita M. Busch writes from Los Angeles about the entertainment
industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Like children elbowing one another for their
parents' attention, Hollywood studios are vying for the holiday box
office. The number of films targeting family audiences has set off
the most intense competition among studios in years.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave _ two animated films, ``The Rugrats Movie'' and
``A Bug's Life,'' and the sequel ``Babe: Pig in the City'' _ will
open around Thanksgiving. Even seasoned Hollywood veterans are
bracing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, much of the family audience will go to all three
films,'' predicted Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, which
is releasing ``A Bug's Life.'' ``But after that, it will come down
to who has the highest-quality film.''
</P>
<P>
   Come December, the second wave of family films bows: the
animated Bible story ``The Prince of Egypt,'' the live-action and
puppetry drama ``Jack Frost'' and the special-effects drama
``Mighty Joe Young.'' By the middle of the month, studios will be
scrambling to retain theater bookings for pictures released at
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   For films shouldering heavy budgets, holding on to screens over
the holiday period could make the difference between profit and
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating things this year is an unprecedented number of
animated films. ``It's a car wreck waiting to happen,'' said Terry
Press, the Dreamworks executive marketing ``The Prince of Egypt''
for a Dec. 18 release. ``The only question is, who will drive their
car into the other car first?''
</P>
<P>
   Universal Pictures' chairman and chief executive, Casey Silver,
said, ``It will be survival of the fittest.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Fay, president of marketing for the AMC Theaters chain,
based in Kansas City, Mo., concurs. ``It's going to be tough,'' he
said. ``What it really comes down to is how they market these
films.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Paramount are trying to start a franchise with
their ``Rug-rats Movie,'' hoping to expand beyond its Nickelodeon
audience. To that end, artists like Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo and
Jakob Dylan perform on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Rugrats'' music video is also in heavy rotation on MTV,
which is owned by Viacom, the parent company of Paramount and
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Warner Brothers wants to attract teen-agers by using
the rock group Hanson on its ``Jack Frost'' soundtrack. In the
movie, which features Jim Henson puppets, Michael Keaton plays a
musician who gets a second chance to prove himself as a father.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Thanksgiving films have enlisted help from
corporate America. Paramount Pictures has signed with Burger King,
Lincoln-Mercury, Post Cereal and others for promotions that will
add approximately $50 million in advertising to the ``Rugrats''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's marketing machine is selling ``A Bug's Life'' as
another ``Toy Story,'' helped by $50 million from promotional
partners led by McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Pictures is taking a different tack with ``Babe,''
betting that the original film's audience will turn out again for
the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   As Silver puts it: ``You can't really have a fast-food partner
when you're selling a film about a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Universal is joining with theater owners to sell
``Babe'' plush toys with the popcorn and soda. The offer is
enticing for theater owners, who generate most of their income from
concession sales.
</P>
<P>
   Another battle front is in theater lobbies. Paramount is asking
theaters to participate in a contest that entails parking 15{-foot
Mercury Villager vans inside. And Dreamworks' elaborate ``Prince of
Egypt'' display includes a 50-inch DVD monitor. ``We're literally
running out of space,'' said one theater executive, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers, meanwhile, will see less movie-based merchandise in
stores. ``Retailers are being far more selective because they've
gotten burned over the years by the studios,'' said Ira Mayer,
publisher of The Licensing Letter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``Rugrats'' seems to be generating the most interest,
said Michael Patrick, president of Carmike Cinemas in Columbus,
Ga., the nation's third largest theater chain. ``We've been getting
calls from our customers asking for `Rugrats' since early
October,'' he said.

   Patrick also expects ``A Bug's Life'' to do well. ``Disney's
advantage is that their pictures are parent-friendly,'' he said.
``Parents don't dread sitting in a theater for an hour and a half
on Disney's family films like they did with Barney.''

   ``The Prince of Egypt,'' which does not lend itself to toys or
promotional partners, recently embarked on a retail promotion with
Wal-Mart. Asked how Dreamworks expected to compete in such a
crowded marketplace, one of the company's principals, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, said, ``I'm counting on the hope that Someone up there
has a bigger agenda for the movie than me.''

 POP-KELLY-COX &HT;    `R' always has something to say
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe a No. 1 hit and three Grammy Awards have convinced Mr. ``I
Believe I Can Fly'' that he can try anything now. Rapping? R. Kelly
does that in tolerable Puff Daddy fashion on ``If I'm Wit You.''
Wait, is that R. yodeling? Yep, at the end of ``Get Up on a Room.''
And four album tracks later he takes on, briefly (thankfully),
opera.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of surprises, coupled with Kelly's incredible gift
for arranging, make getting through one of contemporary R&AMP;B's few
double albums a lot easier. But what about, simply, his singing?
</P>
<P>
   After two solo efforts, fans should know that Kelly's limited
alto has never been as interesting as what he has to say. Remember,
this is the guy who sang about some woman reminding him of a Jeep.
And he proves just as clever crafting a plea for monogamy in the
guise of ``Half on a Baby.'' Then, he has some usually aggressive
hip-hop artists (Jay-Z, Noreaga) on ``We Ride,'' a song that would
nestle comfortably next to a Babyface ballad.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystifying trick Kelly continues to pull off is
borrowing blatantly from Jeffrey Osborne, Lenny Williams and, too
often, his own ``Down Low'' song _ and still coming up with hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``R''
</P>
<P>
   R. Kelly. Jive.
</P>
<P>
   29 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   ``R'' must be short for a really good use of Kelly's pop
sensibilities.

 &HT;    `The Salesman and Bernadette' turns silly and sublime
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, listening to Vic Chesnutt, I think he may be as
succinct and profound a songwriter as Willie Nelson. Other times,
when his knack for crafting what sound like grown-up nursery rhymes
teeters toward surreal self-indulgence, I laugh out loud at his
utter disregard for formal propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than an artifact of his abortive major-label deal with
Capitol Records, Chesnutt's latest album (picked up by
Atlanta-based Capricorn) is the best of both those sides of the
singer's personality. Partnered with the protean Nashville ensemble
Lambchop, whose horn arrangements sprawl from English Beat-style
exuberance to the ragged dirge of a New Orleans funeral procession,
the Athens, Ga.-based performer finds the coherence lacking in his
previous effort (1996's ``About To Choke''). Along with his gallery
of amusingly observed characters (''a man dripping with Vitalis,''
a ``self-ordained Faustian''), Chesnutt happens onto a surprising
Al Green falsetto and, in the brooding, Dylanesque folk-rock of
``Parade,'' evokes an existential sadness that may be one of the
forgotten qualifiers of great art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Salesman and Bernadette''
</P>
<P>
   Vic Chesnutt. Capricorn. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: By turns silly and sublime, a local favorite flirts
with a masterpiece.

 &HT;    `Tracks' traces 23 years of the Boss
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ultimate keepsake for any hard-core fan of Bruce Springsteen,
the expansive ``Tracks'' covers 23 years of the singer's career _
from his nascent ``street poet'' phase heralded by ``Mary Queen of
Arkansas'' to the mature, Woody Guthrie-influenced populist of
``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' Compiled by Springsteen and cleanly
remastered, the songs offer a parallel perspective on the Boss's
indefatigable rock classicism and New Jersey grit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps predictably, the 1970s outtakes are the most compelling.
As feverishly over the top as such micro-epics as ``Zero and Blind
Terry'' and ``Thundercrack'' are, they pack a snake-hipped charisma
and loquacious drive that puts you in mind of a really good Martin
Scorsese movie: marinara sauce for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Gems are scattered amid a lot that rings redundant, but the
reward of this sort of package is how it sketches the arc of an
artist's development. What's clear is that, while Springsteen can
be dully consistent (the early '90s weren't kind), his compassion
never wanes. It's the core of his work, and the key to this
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracks''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen. Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   66 tracks (4 CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An open vault of alternative versions and
unreleased songs meant to indulge the faithful.

   Vets remembered
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Berkmar High School principal Jim Markham, Veteran's
Day in Gwinnett County, Ga., did not go unrecognized. The Vietnam
vet contacted about 75 local churches with bells and requested that
the bells ring for one full minute at noon.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted musically inclined residents to pick up a horn at 6
p.m. Wednesday and blow taps throughout the county. Even more
amazing is that Markham managed to organize all this while battling
bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a reflective moment for those who gave their
lives in America's wars,'' explains Markham. ``It's my good fortune
to be responsible for organizing these activities.''

 &HT;    Earlier Elizabeths had the regal stuff
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British royal family has been so reduced to tabloid fodder
that it's nice to be reminded that wearing the crown of England
once meant something more than polo matches and People magazine. On
Nov. 20, ``Elizabeth,'' an admirable new film about Queen Elizabeth
I, opens in Atlanta. The star is Cate Blanchett, from last year's
``Oscar and Lucinda.'' She has quite an act _ make that quite a few
acts _ to follow. Don't worry; she does just fine. But consider
these royal talents who proceeded her.
</P>
<P>
   HER MAJESTY BETTE DAVIS
</P>
<P>
   (THE FIRST TIME)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex'' (1939): The
31-year-old Davis endured excruciating age makeup (including
shaving her hair back two inches) and 65 pounds of costumes to play
the 60-ish monarch in this lavish adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's
Broadway play. Ironically, her co-star and romantic interest was
none other than Errol Flynn, the actor who had been suggested to
play Rhett to her Scarlett in one version of ``Gone With the
Wind.'' Davis said no to ``Gone With the Wind,'' and the search
went on. In order to play opposite Flynn here, she later said that
she simply fantasized that she was acting with Laurence Olivier,
who was her choice for Essex.
</P>
<P>
   HER MAJESTY BETTE DAVIS
</P>
<P>
   (THE SECOND TIME)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Virgin Queen'' (1955): This time, Davis was in her late
40s and she was playing a 50-ish Elizabeth, so it was less of a
stretch. Richard Todd, better known as television's Robin Hood,
plays Sir Walter Raleigh, the queen's ``favorite.'' A very young
Joan Collins, better known as television's Alexis Carrington, plays
a lady of the court loved by Todd. Reportedly, Davis got along with
Collins about as well as she did with Flynn. Still, Queen Elizabeth
was always one of her favorite roles; in fact, she had been away
from the movies for three years when she was lured back by the
chance to portray her again.
</P>
<P>
   HER MAJESTY FLORA ROBSON
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fire Over England'' (1937): Set during the latter part of
Elizabeth's reign, when she was taking on the much-feared Spanish
Armada, this movie was meant to stir up similarly patriotic
passions in late-1930s Britain in respect to the storm clouds
gathering over Europe. Instead, it mostly stirred up the passions
of co-stars Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. Already infatuated
with each other, they began a full-scale affair during the shooting
(both were already married). But that was offscreen; onscreen,
Flora Robson creates a monarch to rival either of Davis'
better-known efforts. She's majestic, imperious and wears a ruff
every bit as well.
</P>
<P>
   HER MAJESTY GLENDA JACKSON
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mary, Queen of Scots'' (1971): Jackson had just finished
playing Elizabeth in an acclaimed six-part BBC series, ``Elizabeth
R,'' so portraying her again wasn't exactly what the actress had in
mind. She told the producers, ``I much prefer Vanessa's (Redgrave)
part.'' But that part, of course, was as Mary, so no dice. In the
interests of historical accuracy, Jackson allowed her hairline to
be shaved three inches; less accurate was a totally fictional
meeting between the rival monarchs on the Scottish border (Jackson
protested but was overruled). She was later unhappy with the movie
overall and called her performance ``a bit of a rehash.'' Consumer
alert: This film may not be readily available on video. But
``Elizabeth R'' is, and Jackson liked it better anyway.
</P>
<P>
   HER MAJESTY JEAN SIMMONS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Young Bess'' (1953): Probably closest in spirit to the new
``Elizabeth,'' this movie not only showcases the lovely and
talented Simmons but also offers Charles Laughton in a return to
one of his most famous roles: as King Henry VIII (unfortunately, he
dies early in the film). Deborah Kerr, who was originally
considered for the title role but was deemed too old by the time
production started four years after she was first contacted, plays
Catherine Parr, Henry's sixth and last wife. Stewart Granger, then
married in real life to Simmons, is a dashing courtier loved by
both women. Adding a certain art-mirrors-life aspect: Granger and
Kerr had had an affair while he was married to his previous wife.

 &HT;    IN STORES THIS WEEK
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Small Soldiers'' (PG-13) _ So many toys, so little fun in
this violent kid comedy about action figures that come to life and
wreck a suburban neighborhood. A lot of effort has been spent on
the computer-generated animation and the toy design. But somebody
should have bothered with the script, and the human characters
(including Kirsten Dunst and the late Phil Hartman). Though the
movie is bloodless, parents might be surprised by the ferocity of
the violence. (The warring toys use all kind of weapons, from
flamethrowers to chain saws.) Priced to own: $22.99. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Music From Another Room'' (PG-13) _ Badly off-key. With its
lyrical title and a cast including Jude Law (``Gattaca'') and Oscar
nominee Brenda Blethyn (``Secrets &AMP; Lies''), the movie sounds like
a charming character study. But it's mainly an endurance test. Law
plays Danny, who falls in love with the woman (Gretchen Mol) he
helped birth 20 years before. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I Went Down'' (R) _ In this blithely shapeless bit of
blarney, two mismatched Irish hoodlums _ one a mere amateur (Peter
McDonald), the other more hard-core (Brendan Gleeson) _ embark on a
mission for their boss that's more road-buddy movie than caper.
Director Paddy Breathnach seems perfectly comfortable with the
film's many detours, as do his delightful actors, both of whom do a
lot to help sustain its laid-back, shaggy-dog style. But a little
clipping around the middle might have helped. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Trevor'' (unrated) _ Peggy Rajski's Oscar-winning short
brings humor to the potentially maudlin tale of a 13-year-old
musical theater fanatic (Brett Barsky) who finds out he's gay. The
sly, exuberant tale follows Trevor through various stages: falling
in love with a school jock, getting rejected, deciding that maybe
it's not a great idea to dress up as Diana Ross for Halloween. It's
a credit to Rajski's sure hand that the 20-minute film can broach
the issue of teen suicide without ever losing its light touch. And
the Ross songs on the soundtrack don't hurt. Grade: A

 &HT;    BEST NEW RELEASE A long labor of love: `Whisperer' unfolds in
its own sweet time
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Horse Whisperer'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Redford's meandering self-help western only seems to take
longer than it would to read Nicholas Evans' book. Redford plays
the crusty-mystical cowboy-veterinarian who heals a wounded horse
and the psyche of its young rider (Scarlett Johansson). He also
romances, and calms, her Tina Brown-like editor mother (Kristin
Scott Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   Much of this thoughtful but slow movie is spent on scenic
horseback tours of the Montana landscape. On the plus side, every
time Redford and Thomas lope off on another picturesque ride, you
know you've got plenty of time to go to the kitchen and fix a
snack. They'll still be riding when you get back to the couch.
Unfortunately, all the big-sky scenery can't compensate for the
movie's thin mix of New Age tropes and simplistic view of Western
life. This is a place of lasso-happy white folks, from whom never
is heard a discouraging word.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is available in wide screen, pan-and-scan and DVD.
Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Also directed by Robert Redford: ``Ordinary People,'' ``A River

NEW WAY TO BUILD A MOVIE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Michele Willens writes frequently about arts and entertainment from
New York and Los Angeles. 
 By MICHELE WILLENS   
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When ``Playing by Heart'' opens on Dec. 18,
audiences are meant to exit the theaters drying their eyes. Here,
after all, is a multi-generational, multi-character drama depicting
numerous love stories in various stages of peril.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood will be keeping its eyes wide open.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which managed to entice actors like Sean Connery, Gena
Rowlands, Dennis Quaid, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillipe, Madeleine
Stowe, Anthony Edwards and Gillian Anderson for $50,000 apiece, a
fraction of their usual fees, may represent something vaguely
threatening to studios yet potentially exciting for moviegoers: the
mini-mainstream movie.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a major studio picture (big budget, big noise, flimsy
plot) nor an independent one (offbeat, quirky, fringe audience), it
is a hybrid made possible by a new kind of entertainment company,
one that does not make movies but rather allows them to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The company defying convention here is Intermedia, which first
made its mark this year with ``Sliding Doors.'' Formed by Nigel
Sinclair, a former entertainment lawyer (with a stellar list of
clients including Mel Gibson, who thanked Sinclair first upon
winning his Oscar for ``Braveheart'') and Guy East, past president
of Majestic Films (``Driving Miss Daisy''), the company operates
more like a packager than a producer.
</P>
<P>
   With offices in Los Angeles and London and a staff of about 40,
Sinclair and East develop film projects, but always with a
production partner who is actually responsible for the filmmaking.
While independent filmmakers must usually scramble for financing
and partnerships at each juncture in a film's progress from script
to screen, Intermedia lines up the complete package up front.
</P>
<P>
   The company uses distribution partners in Europe as well as
numerous capital investors to handle all costs of a movie _
development, pre-production, worldwide financing, marketing _
before it even starts shooting. Sometimes the company just fills in
the particular needs of a project.
</P>
<P>
   With Woody Allen's ``Deconstructing Harry'' and David Mamet's
``Spanish Prisoner,'' for example, it provided the foreign
distribution. ``Sliding Doors,'' with Gwyneth Paltrow, which cost
around $10 million and earned nearly $60 million, was considered
its first start-to-end feature. (Its producing partner was Sydney
Pollack's Mirage Enterprises.)
</P>
<P>
   While it often sounds more Wall Street than Sunset Boulevard _
``Intermedia Film Equities U.S.A.,'' its telephone recording
announces _ the company wants to be a haven for creative filmmakers
with more than grosses on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing most of us cannot _ or don't want to _ compete with
the `Armageddons,' we are determined to make movies about
content,'' Sinclair says. ``We try to stay small but bring
first-class marketing and distribution. We want our films to be the
kind you'd never ask yourself, `Why did they make this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The recipe seems to be working: actors like Paul Newman, Kevin
Costner and Linda Fiorentino are making films for Intermedia. The
company has signed partnership deals with the directors Ridley
Scott, Tony Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Kevin Costner and Pollack.
And it has joined forces with Kenneth Branagh for a projected
series of Shakespeare films.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't just about looking at the marketplace,'' says the
producer Sarah Pillsbury (``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' ``Eight
Men Out''). ``Their reputation is that they value relationships
with filmmakers, they have excellent taste and they respond to
material on an emotional level. They manage to have the clout of a
large company or studio, but the sensibility of a boutique.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proof is in the product, and Intermedia's other 1998
releases _ ``Clay Pigeons,'' starring Vince Vaughan, and ``Land
Girls,'' about women in England during World War II _ did not rock
the industry. The company has a lot at stake with ``Playing by
Heart,'' but it is confident that what began as a charmed project
will remain so.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Friday night a year and a half ago that Rosalie
Swedlin, one of the top literary agents in Los Angeles, gave
Sinclair a script with the intriguing title ``Dancing About
Architecture.'' It was written by Willard Carroll, whose earlier
credits, like ``The Brave Little Toaster'' (1987), hardly promised
a bold treatment of adult themes.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Swedlin calls, people listen, and Sinclair read the
script late that Saturday night. By Sunday, he was reading it aloud
to his wife. His company bought it the following Tuesday. The
project was moving forward with Carroll's Hyperion Productions when
Sinclair ran into Miramax's co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, who asked
if there was anything interesting on which they might collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was given Carroll's script that night, read from
midnight till 2:30 a.m., and quickly struck a deal to co-finance
the film and co-distribute it domestically. Miramax, which used to
be the little guy in town, now had the muscle to expand the project
_ whose title has changed several times _ from a modest $6 million
labor of love to one costing three times as much, and to hire crew
members like the Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax is already touting the film as a ``Good Will Hunting''
for 1999, a break-out sleeper worthy of Oscar nominations. (Of
course, the company is known for its award-hungry hyperbole.)
</P>
<P>
   If the men at the top were dreaming of Oscars, the one who did
most of the work, Willard Carroll, who also directed, says such
thoughts were far from his mind while shooting. ``I'd been given 40
days to make this happen, and that was quite enough pressure,''
says Carroll, whose encounter with a quote from Clara Wieck
Schumann _ ``Talking about music is like dancing about
architecture'' _ inspired the script.

 LOS ANGELES: the script.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write a character-oriented piece that deals with
subjects people don't usually talk about in movies _ and not even
in real life,'' Carroll says.
</P>
<P>
   What was never a problem was attracting actors to fill the many
roles. ``People were literally begging me to be in this movie,''
says the casting director (and producer) Meg Liberman.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie, one of the most sought-after young actresses
after her double Emmy nominations for ``Gia'' and ``George
Wallace'' last year, recalls arriving the first day of shooting:
``I looked around, and there were some of my lifetime idols and all
these great actors, and I thought, `How did I crash this party'?''
</P>
<P>
   There were moments when Carroll felt the same, admitting he was
especially in awe of Connery. But he said the veteran actor eased
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't intimidating,'' Carroll says. ``We met right after
he signed on, and I did a rewrite overnight based on his ideas.
Sean likes to be very sure of his dialogue, that it fit his speech
patterns. I think he also appreciated being part of an ensemble,
and acting opposite a real equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The equal to whom he refers is Gena Rowlands, the first of the
stars to read the script. ``I put it down and called my agent and
said, `Yes, I'd be delighted,' '' says Ms. Rowlands, who plays a
television personality and great cook (``Let us not call her Martha
Stewart right out loud,'' she says with a laugh) whose marriage is
suddenly threatened by an old photograph.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who has made three other films this year, reveled
in the idea of a senior-citizen couple capable of such passionate
emotions. Although she signed on without knowing who would play her
husband, she admits the choice pleased her. ``Because Sean and I
come out of the same era, our processes are similar,'' she said.
``We don't rehearse that much. We're prepared, and we like to see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's expected that Ms. Rowlands and Connery will bring in
audiences who can relate to relationships tempered by good years
and bad. But it is Ryan Phillipe (``54,'' ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer'') and Ms. Jolie, whose characters have relationships
numbered in days, with whom younger audiences will identify.
</P>
<P>
   Their parts were originally conceived for actors in their
mid-30s, but Carroll decided it was more touching, and
contemporary, to see 20-year-olds dealing with adult issues. For
Ms. Jolie, who plays a chatty, in-your-face partygoer, the part
came as a relief after the tortured, drug-addicted model she played
in ``Gia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so dark that I longed to grasp a lighter side of
life,'' she says. ``There is an art to being light. It was a
stretch, but I learned that I like being happy. And I learned that
if someone told me they were sick or dying, it wouldn't change a
thing about my love for them.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility colors another of the film's relationships,
between a sympathetic mother portrayed by Ellen Burstyn and the
critically ill son played by Jay Mohr. Their scenes all take place
in a hospital room, yet the word AIDS is never spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``His having AIDS and being gay is not even the issue,'' Carroll
says. ``Their story is really about how we often underestimate our
parents. It turns out the mother is completely cool about her son
being gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The director says he was constantly working against the maudlin
_ ``I tried to write the story with a lack of sentimentality'' _
and much of the comic relief in the film is provided by Quaid's
character, Hugh, a man of many moods. Like the others, the actor
took one read and said yes. He says one reason was the film's
depiction of women _ not a prostitute or a bimbo among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many great actresses not getting enough work,''
says the actor (who is married to one who does, Meg Ryan).
``Willard has a really good bead on women. Good women's roles make
men's roles better because we have something to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says: ``I worked hard to make them complex rather than
neurotic. I just felt it was really important not to have them come
off like whiners _ just as it's about family, but not necessarily
dysfunctional families.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, which has been accused of being pretty dysfunctional
itself, may, in this film, be looking at one solution: not too big,
not too small, allowing one person's vision to make it to the
finish line, understanding that good people are often willing to do
interesting work for less. Still, predicting a film's outcome is
like, well, dancing about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the archetypical film for us,'' says Nigel
Sinclair of Intermedia. ``It would have probably cost $45 million
to $50 million if a major studio had made it, but we've managed to
keep it relatively small, market it well and, by the way, take a
late-20th-century look at relationships.''

 Levi's to Sell Clothing on Its Web Sites  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. will start selling Levi's and Dockers clothing
over its World Wide Web sites later this month, a move that may
boost sales for the troubled company but also could alienate the
retailers that sell its wares.
<P>
   Managing its own Internet sales is an opportunity for the San
Francisco company to control how its products are presented and
potentially increase profits, since it won't have to share revenues
with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But by competing against the department stores and specialty
shops that have sold Levi's for decades, the company risks angering
its key accounts at a time when merchants are already unhappy with
the poor performance of Levi's products.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen percent of the jeans sold in the United States are
Levi's, down from 30 percent in 1990, according to Tactical Retail
Monitor, an industry newsletter. Top Levi's retailers include J.C.
Penney, Mervyn's, Sears, Kohl's and Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department stores are definitely going to get hurt'' by
the Web sales, said one Levi's retailer, who declined to be
identified. The impact will be small at first, but will grow with
the popularity of e-commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jay Thomas, director of digital marketing for the Levi's
brand, disagreed. He said Levi's will use the sites to get input
from customers on the fashions they prefer, and that information
will be used to create better-selling product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We honestly believe that by understanding our customers
better, we'll be a better partner at retail,'' he said. The Web
sites will include a store-locator service accessible from every
page of the sites, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet visitors are expected to do their actual buying in
stores, rather than on the Web, said Jeff Beckman, a Levi's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's executives believe they have failed to forge strong ties
between shoppers and the Levi's brand because retailers, rather
than Levi's, have direct contact with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has attempted to run its own stores but has never
had much success. It operates a test Docker's shop in Troy, Mich.,
and has no current plans to open more. It also operates 28 Original
Levi's Stores, but seven of them will be closed by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Global sales of Levi's products, which include the Dockers and
Slates brands, are expected to drop this year by an estimated 10
percent, which follows a 4 percent decline in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The two Web sites,  &LR; www.levi.com &LR;  and  &LR; www.dockers.com, &LR;  will
attempt to develop relationships with customers by asking about
their fashion and lifestyle preferences, recommending clothing
based on their taste, and e-mailing them information about special
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The sites also will showcase a much wider assortment of
merchandise than is typically found in stores, offering virtually
every available cut, wash and color.
</P>
<P>
   They will help surfers put together outfits and, on the Levi's
site, let surfers chat with rock musicians who wear Levi's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The Levi's site has been around since 1995, and the Dockers site
was launched the following year. They will start selling products
on the Monday before Thanksgiving and will be promoted heavily in a
holiday advertising campaign, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's new Web initiative supplements a two-year direct
marketing effort that was also designed to develop a database of
Levi's customers and learn their fashion preferences.

 Get Right Back to Where You Started From  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Once in a while I'll be surfing the Web and suddenly the
Back button on my browser won't work. Why does this happen, and is
there any way to get around the problem and return to the previous
page I was viewing?
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  According to the experts at Netscape, this
frustrating predicament may be caused by a glitch in the
programming code used to create the Web page that won't let you
retreat. Fortunately, the problem is easily solved. Just
right-click the Back button, which will display a menu of the Web
pages you've visited during your current browsing session. Then
choose the page you want. (By the way, this procedure also works
with the Forward button.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: Can you recommend a software program that will translate
French into English?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I can't recommend one, because I've never used such a
program, and besides, I can't speak French, so I wouldn't know
whether the translation was any good. But I can give you the names
of a few companies that make translation software. There's
Globalink ( &LR; www.globalink.com &LR; ), LanguageForce ( &LR; www.wforce.com &LR; )
and Transparent Language ( &LR; www.transparent.com &LR; ). Programs from
these companies typically cover many languages, not just French.
You can find them at CompUSA and other computer stores. Expect to
pay at least $50 for a program that can translate word processing
documents and Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I put a shortcut on the desktop? I'd like to shorten
the process of opening programs. For example, currently I have to
go from the Start button to Programs to Expert Software to Bicycle
Bridge (solitaire game).
</P>
<P>
   A: Shortcuts are icons that let you open a program, file or
folder without having to track it down in a complicated menu or
file directory. If you use Microsoft Word every day, for instance,
you might want to put a shortcut on the desktop for it.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a desktop shortcut is easy. First, though, you have to
locate the actual file, program or folder on your hard drive. You
can do this by using My Computer, which you'll find in the upper
left corner of the desktop, or with Windows Explorer, which is in
the Program menu.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've tracked it down, drag the file, program or folder to
the Windows desktop with the right mouse button held down. When you
release the button, a menu will appear. Choose Create Shortcut(s)
Here.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it. Oh, yeah, you can also put a shortcut
in the main Start menu, which is useful if you've got a lot of
windows covering up the desktop. To do that, follow the previous
instructions to locate the file, program or folder, right-click it
and drag it to the Start button rather than to the desktop. When
you release the mouse button, the shortcut will appear on the Start
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am automatically logged off America Online if they detect
no activity after a certain period of time. This is very
inconvenient, particularly if you take a phone call or do something
off-line and miss their message asking if you wish to remain
connected. Is there anything that can be done about this? I thought
my contract with AOL was for unlimited use.
</P>
<P>
   A: The reason AOL automatically knocks people off is to prevent
them from staying connected for long periods without actually using
the service. Otherwise many users would log on in the morning and
not log off until bedtime, since the monthly rate for AOL is the
same no matter how much you use it, and there's no charge for a
local phone call to get connected. And if too many users were
always online, AOL's computers would not be able to handle the
load.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, I can tell you that there are a number of
freeware and shareware programs designed to fool AOL's computer and
prevent it from knocking you off. Their names include StayOn, Wizon
and Popup Monitor, and you should be able to track them down with
any Internet search engine. Technically, AOL prohibits you from
using them, but in actuality the service can't detect if you're
using one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMACHINES.  &LR; Many readers have written asking for more
information about eMachines, the new company that's about to start
selling a complete PC, with a monitor, for $499. The eTower should
be available in the next couple of weeks at Fry's stores, Best Buy,
Office Depot and Costco. Information about eMachines and its
computers is available at the company's Web site,  &LR; www.e4me.com. &LR; 
Or you can call toll-free at (877) 566-3463.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tip of the Week
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  In the market for a real bargain PC? Check out Computer Currents
and/or MicroTimes. These free magazines (you'll find them in
newspaper racks in the city or at computer stores) are full of ads
for great, inexpensive systems, like a Pentium II computer and
monitor for $988. The vendors are mostly small, independent shops
that assemble their own PCs. But many of them offer warranties
comparable to name brands.

4 TEAMS IN PURSUIT OF JORDAN OF ST. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Md., Mich., Calif., Mo., Texas, Ariz., Mass.,
Ohio)   (jw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ Suddenly, Brian Jordan is in an economically
advantageous position that would be the envy of all free agents
except for the elite members of this year's market. The outfielder
is sought after by both New York teams as well as Atlanta and
Baltimore, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the dominant team in the National League, where he
lives,'' Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, said Wednesday. ``You have the
most dominant team in baseball managed by someone he greatly
respects. You have the team in the city where he grew up and where
his parents live. You have the team that said they're going to do
everything they can do to be a contender and have added three
players.''
</P>
<P>
   In order, those teams are the Braves, the Yankees, the Orioles
and the Mets. Jordan, who batted .316, hit 25 home runs and drove
in 91 runs for St. Louis, is scheduled to meet Monday with the
Braves, who have joined the pursuit aggressively since trading
Michael Tucker to Cincinnati Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to sign him as soon as we can,'' John Schuerholz, the
Atlanta general manager, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Yankees called Turner and invited Jordan and
him to visit New York next Wednesday. Turner immediately accepted.
They presumably could visit with the Mets while they are in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he has received one four-year offer with the
possibility of a fifth year and ideally would like five years
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want teams to know that we clearly would like to speed up
the timetable,'' Turner said by telephone from St. Louis. ``We
think that can be accomplished. We'd like to make it no more than
two weeks. I'd love to think it can be done much quicker than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   RED SOX TALKING TO VAUGHN
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette had a timetable, too. The Boston general manager
was scheduled to leave this southwest Florida town Thursday morning
and hoped to have Mo Vaughn signed by then. But it didn't appear
that he would have his wish granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making some progress in our talks that we hope will lead
to a deal,'' Duquette said Wednesday. ``We're making progress on
some issues that are important to Mo Vaughn.''
</P>
<P>
   But the progress apparently wasn't as significant as the issues
because Vaughn wasn't rushing to sign on the dotted line. The Red
Sox offered their first baseman $60 million for five years Monday
and made some modest changes in the offer Wednesday that did not
raise it to the level of the offer the Anaheim Angels made last
week for $72 million for six years. Duquette said he was ready to
move on if this round of negotiations didn't produce a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we get to the point where we sign a
contract,'' he said. ``If we can't, we need to go out there in the
market and see if we can recruit some other players for the Red
Sox. ``
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he is interested in Albert Belle and Bernie
Williams as possible replacements for Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   TIGERS SIGN ROYALS' PALMER
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers made an uncharacteristic but promised move
Wednesday, signing a free agent to a lucrative contract. They gave
Dean Palmer, Kansas City's third baseman, a five-year contract for
$36 million. Earlier in the off season, the Tigers had considered
making Bernie Williams the target of their new spending policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated early that there wouldn't be a whole lot of
clubs in play,'' General Manager Randy Smith said. ``Then a bunch
of clubs expressed interest. We figured that hurt our chances. We
wanted to strike very quickly. We wanted to do something in a hurry
so it sets up anything else we're able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers also had made an offer to Ken Caminiti, but Smith
said, ``Caminiti wasn't ready to make an affirmative answer and
Palmer was. Caminiti's preference, we've known all along, was to
stay in San Diego or go back to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who in 1996 hit 38 home runs for Texas, hit 34 home runs
and drove in 119 runs for the Royals this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks signed two other free agents, giving
pitcher Greg Swindell $5.7 million for three years and first
baseman Greg Colbrunn $1.8 million for two years. The Diamondbacks
also traded pitcher Bob Wolcott to Boston for a player to be named.

 Digital Books Could Be Your Big Break  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
This year, a book that was never published on paper was a nominee
for one of the world's most prestigious literary awards.
<P>
   ``The Angels of Russia'' by Patricia le Roy was distributed
exclusively over the Internet by Online Originals of London, one of
a new breed of electronic-book publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The critically acclaimed novel, which details a tragic love
affair set in Paris during the Gorbachev era, was nominated for
Britain's Booker Prize after &UR;  &LR; David Gettman, chief executive of
Online Originals, persuaded the five-member judge panel to consider
it. (It did not win.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Digital books are growing in respectability and sales, as
writers break into publishing by having their works showcased and
distributed by ``virtual bookstores'' on the Internet. But there's
a catch: Prospective writers pay the companies to have their
``e-books'' published on the Internet, although the writers can
earn royalties if their books find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, your chance of being published was as good as
spotting the next Elvis,'' said Mark Smith, CEO of Spirit Virtual
Books in Richardson, Texas. ``This is the greatest thing since the
printing press.
</P>
<P>
   ``These digital, downloadable books give the future Hemingway
and Faulkner an opportunity to shine in an additional vehicle that
wasn't available a few years ago,'' said David Valenti, head of
NetBooks.com in Costa Mesa (Orange County). ``They will never
eliminate hardbound books, but it is a nice alternative for
struggling writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, publishing your idea of the great American novel has
never been easier.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of online publishers is distributing thousands of
electronic books featuring the words of first-time authors.
Startups with names like 1stBooks Library and Spirit Virtual Books
advertise and distribute authors' content on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The books are typically distributed either via e-mail or as a
downloadable file. The publishers format the transmitted content
into chapters, with page numbers, photos and illustrations. Many of
the sites let you ``browse'' the books _ reading a chapter or two
for free. Some even let you buy a chapter at a time.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of these information-age publishers do not edit
copy or even read the original works (other than to omit
hate-mongering and sexually explicit material).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Authors pay $300 to $500 for a six-month listing on the sites,
and a nominal charge (about $10) for each subsequent month. They
usually collect the first couple of hundred dollars earned from all
sales and 40 to 50 percent for every additional order.
</P>
<P>
   The e-books, which are heavily promoted on the Web sites, cost
readers $3 to $7. At least 35,000 are transmitted annually.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of online _ don't call them vanity _ publishers is
offering a forum for unpublished, and accomplished, writers. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ 1st Books &LR;  ( &LR; www.1stbooks.com &LR; ). The Bloomington, Ind.,
company was co-founded by Tim Jacobs in 1996 after he
unsuccessfully pitched his children's books to major
publishers. &UR;  &LR; It is now the largest online publisher, with 1,300
books _ ranging from science fiction to cookbooks. By early 1999,
it should top 2,000 titles, making it the most prolific publisher
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   1stBooks' portfolio of publications include ``More Rough
Sketches,'' a collection of editorial cartoons by Pulitzer Prize
finalist Joel Pett, and ``Hearing the Noise: My Life in the NFL,''
an inside account of the NFL by former Dallas Cowboys running back
Preston Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Spirit Virtual Books &LR;  ( &LR; www.spiritvirtualbooks.com &LR; ). Named
after Smith's dog, it boasts a wide range of provocative titles
such as ``Murder Revisited,'' ``Web of Deceit'' and ``Matthias the
Birth of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Xlibris Corp. &LR;  ( &LR; www.xlibris.com &LR; ). The Princeton, N.J.,
company offers paper and electronic editions of books and
``on-demand digital publishing'' of single copies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials boast they employ the ``mother of all laser printers''
to print books. The room-size, high-resolution printers eliminate
the returns and inventory problems that often plague conventional
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ UPublish.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.upublish.com &LR; ). It charges $249 to put a
book on the Web and $20 to print ``paperbound copies with a
wrap-around cover.'' The Parkland, Fla., company publishes a gamut
of works, including academic textbooks, fiction, nonfiction,
lecture notes, transcripts and scientific manuals.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; NetBooks.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.netbooks.com &LR; ). Launched this year by
Kanakaris Communications, it also lets authors post original works
for sale on the Net. Among its titles: ``Simple I Ching,'' a tome
on Eastern philosophies, and ``Aliens Above, Ghosts Below:
Explorations of the Unknown,'' a series of scientific articles on
paranormal events.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Online Originals  &LR; ( &LR; www.onlineoriginals &LR; . &LR; com &LR; ). &UR;  &LR; The Booker
Prize nominee ``The Angels of Russia,'' which sells for $7, is part
of a literary stable of several dozen titles that includes ``The
Paternoster Bead,'' a murder mystery set in medieval France.

DUMMY BOWLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Bowl Championship Series used graduation rates as part of
its complicated formula for determining the No. 1 team, no one
would care about this week's Tennessee-Arkansas game.
</P>
<P>
   It's being billed as The Dummy Bowl. Both teams are undefeated _
and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Arkansas, both 8-0, each received black eyes in
the latest NCAA graduation-rate report released Monday. The Vols
and Razorbacks have the two worst football-graduation rates among
all schools ranked in this week's ESPN/USA Today coaches' Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single athlete on either team in this game is included
in that report,'' Tennessee athletic director Doug Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year graduation average was computed for the freshmen
football classes of 1988, 89, 90 and 91. The average for all
Division I-A teams is 53 percent. Arkansas was at the bottom of the
list with only 20 percent who earned degrees within six years.
Tennessee ranked 11th in the SEC at 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1991 freshman class, the Vols rank last among SEC
football programs with an 11 percent graduation rate. Arkansas is
next to last at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the NCAA report couldn't have been more ironic for
the Vols. It came the same day as Tennessee climbed to No. 1 in the
BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be alarmed if I thought it was going to be 11 percent over
the next several years,'' said Carmen Tegano, assistant athletic
director for student life at Tennessee. ``But it was a fluke class
in terms of graduating. We had 10 players out of 18 who have been
active in professional football at one time or another. When those
players often leave school, they usually concentrate on their
careers before coming back to graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 18 freshman players who enrolled in the 1991 fall semester,
only two had graduated by August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One footnote to the game: It pits ex-USC defensive coordinator
Keith Burns, now secondary coach at Arkansas, against ex-USC
offensive line coach Mike Barry, who holds the same title at
Tennessee. The pair didn't exactly see eye to eye in their five
years together at USC, to put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   __ Yes man: Kansas State coach Bill Snyder found plenty of
faults with the Wildcats' 49-6 victory over Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Can you be unhappy with 49-6 win?''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Classy guy: Ohio State offensive lineman Rob Murphy admits to
being one of the Big Ten's trashiest talkers, but it wasn't until
Monday after the Michigan State loss that Murphy also showed
himself to be one of the league's shadiest players.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was asked if he was surprised Michigan State backup
defensive end Julian Peterson could record 11 tackles and three
sacks in replacing All-Big Ten senior Robaire Smith, who broke his
leg on the seventh play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pulled and got (Smith), I thought that's who their
bread-and-butter guy was. When I cut him and saw him rolling
around, grabbing his leg, I'm not going to lie, I was kind of
happy,'' Murphy said. ``But, I don't know. They had nothing to
lose. They were going to blitz us the whole game. I don't know.
With Robaire Smith out, it didn't matter. They had nothing to lose
and everything to win. They kept bringing it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Later, Lou: LSU is 0-14-1 against Alabama at home since 1969,
but head coach Gerry DiNardo isn't taking all the heat for the
most-recent flop. The most brutal signs at Tiger Stadium were aimed
at defensive coordinator Lou Tepper. They read, ``Lou Tepper's Last
Home Game'' and ``Goodbye, Lou.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Briefly: Texas running back Ricky Williams needs 204 yards to
pass Pitt's Tony Dorsett's career rushing record. It could be
difficult against Texas Tech Saturday. The last running back to
gain 200 yards against Tech was Texas A&AMP;M's Darren Lewis, who had
232 yards in a 28-24 victory in 1990. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is a 10-point underdog to Kansas State. According to
America's Line in Las Vegas, the last time the Huskers were that
big an underdog was the 1994 Orange Bowl against Florida State. . .
. Texas coach Mack Brown is popular with the student body these
days, and not just because the Longhorns are 7-2. When students
began lining up at dawn Monday for tickets to the Nov. 27 Texas A&AMP;M
game in Austin, some students waited as long as six hours to get
theirs. Brown noticed the long lines and ordered 100 pizzas from a
local restaurant. About an hour later, students were seen leaving
with tickets in one hand and a box of pizza in the other. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who suffered
season-ending neck and arm injuries last Saturday, finished with a
school-record 218 passes without an interception; he had six
against North Carolina State. &QL; 
THE TOPS &QL; 
__ 1. Tennessee (8-0): It's no longer just a women's basketball
school. &QL; 
__ 2. Florida State (9-1): Fans mourning loss of Weinke were
cursing him seven weeks ago. &QL; 
__ 3. Kansas State (9-0): The preliminaries are over, now we see
how good 'Cats really are. &QL; 
__ 4. Florida (8-1): Looking past South Carolina, and trip to
Tallahassee? &QL; 
__ 5. UCLA (8-0): Toledo rips Aliotti's coaching. OK, drop Bruins a
notch. &QL; 
__ 6. Ohio State (8-1): We told you Buckeyes would lose to Michigan
. . . State. &QL; 
__ 7. Wisconsin (9-0): It's only been nine games before Badgers get
first serious test. &QL; 
__ 8. Texas A&AMP;M (9-1): If they hadn't scheduled Fla. State, Aggies
might be in BCS mix. &QL; 
__ 9. Michigan (7-2): Our preseason No. 1 finally living up to
expectations. &QL; 
__ 10. Arizona (9-1): Wildcats actually see increasing chance of
making Rose Bowl. &QL; 
__ Five more to watch: 11. Arkansas (8-0); 12. Nebraska (8-2); 13.
Tulane (8-0); 14. Virginia (7-2); 15. Notre Dame (7-1). &QL; 
__ Say What?: ``We're probably the most feared losingest team in
the country.'' &QL; 
_ Oregon State running back Ken Simonton, on the Beavers losing
their past three games by a combined nine points. &QL; 
__ Best Bet: No. 11 Nebraska (8-2) at No. 2 Kansas State (9-0). OK,
Nebraska is down, but this will be the Wildcats' first real game of
the season. They haven't beaten the Cornhuskers in 29 games. The
Huskers are vulnerable. They've started three quarterbacks and
haven't had two losses entering November since 1981.

 High-Tech Storytelling  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It was a dark and stormy site.
<P>
   Best-selling horror author John Saul led multimedia workers and
writers on a flashlight tour through the Winchester Mystery House
last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was promoting ``The Blackstone Chronicles,'' a hybrid
combination of new media and traditional publishing. The title is
both a CD-ROM computer game that leads users through the dark maze
of a haunted asylum, as well as a novel, serialized into six short
books, that lays the groundwork for the asylum story.
</P>
<P>
   Saul is among a new wave of established and fledging authors who
are making creative use of technology to enhance their
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fiction or nonfiction, on the Web or on a disc, for
promotion or for reader feedback, writers are finding interactive
media to be as invaluable as pens and paper. They aren't just
putting up Web sites; they're adding richness to their narratives
with video and sound, publishing some original content online, and
enlisting readers to help shape stories or even suggest titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new way of telling a story, adapted to this new
medium,'' Saul told the audience at the Winchester Mystery House.
</P>
<P>
   Popular spy novelist Tom Clancy is the most notable in the
field, as his Red Storm Entertainment makes CD-ROM games that are
tied to his latest novels. Although his initial foray, Politika,
was widely panned, his latest venture, Rainbow Six, is getting
positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction and fantasy novelists are among the first to
adapt their stories to new media. Alexander Besher, a San Francisco
novelist, is now publishing in serial form on the Internet a novel
about the horrors that may await the city thanks to the dreaded
Year 2000 computer bug. Another San Francisco writer, Joe Hutsko,
has his first novel due out next year, and _ perhaps in part
because the theme has something to do with handheld computing _
he's already sold the PalmPilot rights.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hunter S. Thompson, always known for pushing the envelope,
is getting into the act, sort of. The dean of gonzo journalism is
publishing his first novel, ``The Rum Diary,'' the manuscript for
which was written in the 1950s but only recently unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   Four independent Bay Area bookstores are stirring up interest in
the book, and adding to its appeal, with a ``Web ring'' _ a series
of linked sites _ that connects to other sites of Thompsoniana and
includes photos and hand-scrawled notes that are available nowhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter S. Thompson fans, I'm sure, are gaga over the chance to
see these sorts of things, and it's material that would otherwise
never come to light in print form,'' said Thomas Gladysz, the Web
manager at the Booksmith, a Haight Street bookstore that's among
the sponsors of the sites.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is manifest in scores of other ways. Children's
book authors tap into the educational urge to include multimedia,
for example, letting kids hear the stories read aloud or ``play''
with the characters online. &UR;  &LR; Web sites _ notably those like
 &LR; Amazon.com  &LR; that sell books, but also others like America Online's
site at  &LR; www.thebookreport.com &LR;  _ build communities around authors
and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the authors and publishers who make forays into
multimedia and the Web are only scratching the surface. The medium
is still not mature, and its potential remains uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving a book onto the Net just like people moved the
old manuscripts out of monks' libraries and into print when
Gutenberg invented movable type. They just raid the old texts,''
said Robert Coover, a novelist and professor at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Computer storytelling will really take off as Internet
connections get faster to accommodate material like video and as
more people get hooked up to the Net, Coover predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Computer games based on novels are becoming increasingly common.
Good games can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce,
and publishers want to bet safely on hits. Spinning a brand-name
novel into a game at least theoretically guarantees an interested
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Games based on novels are ``a natural,'' said Johnny Wilson,
editor in chief of Computer Gaming World. ``When people read a
novel they really like, they would like to play in that universe.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Wilson said, ``there have been a lot of false starts,''
such as the computer game based on William Gibson's ``Johnny
Mnemonic'' that Wilson labeled a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many of the new online novels carry some type
of computer theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Bug,'' Besher's serial novel at  &LR; sfgate.com/thebug, &LR; 
features graphics, hyperlinks and a protagonist named Geronimo Poe
Smith _ GPS to his friends _ whose job is to ride around San
Francisco on a bicycle, making sure that those French self-cleaning
toilets are Year 2000-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected bonus for Besher has been the contributions of
readers around the world. Bike messengers tell him ``how they view
the world from a bike. ... An African hip-hop DJ in Holland is
giving me interesting insights into a character who's Nigerian.
Some other guy is making sure my Swahili is fluent. How else would
I do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just accessing sites, I'm accessing people's minds and
hearts,'' Besher said.
</P>
<P>
   And when a reader catches an author's mistake online, Besher
said, ``you can go back and make little corrections and fine-tune
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors may not publish online, but they still use the
Internet to take the pulse of their readers.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Fitzgerald, publisher and executive producer of
 &LR; thebookreport.com, &LR;  said ``some writers go in undercover and talk
to their readers,'' using assumed names in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald's site publishes interviews with authors, who discuss
different ways they use the Internet. Clive Cussler said he
researched his latest book, about Atlantis, on the Web. Even
romance writer Nora Roberts conducts online research, as well as
maintaining message boards with her readers. Janet Evanovich has a
Web site in which she asks readers to name her next book.
</P>
<P>
   John Saul found that people who read his books, ``The Blackstone
Chronicles,'' were going online and inserting themselves into the
stories. ``One day, a werewolf moved in,'' Saul said, somewhat
incredulous. ``It was bizarre. You'd read this and you'd swear it
was all happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul conceived of ``The Blackstone Chronicles'' as a computer
game. He had ``always liked at least the idea of computer games, if
not the games themselves,'' he said. ``The story line was never
compelling. Whoever designed it knew a lot about gaming and
puzzling, and not a lot about storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul enlisted Bob Bates, president and game designer at Legend
Entertainment, who had worked with science fiction and fantasy
authors like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan. Then Saul's publisher,
Ballantine Books, saw some synergistic potential, and commissioned
a six-part serial novel.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime horror writer sees several reasons these projects
are getting produced. ``Everyone's experimenting right now,'' he
said. ``They're excited with the new technology, and the
possibilities are going to expand as processors get faster and
storage gets bigger. People are going to keep trying to find new
forms of storytelling to use the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``publishers are seeing book sales flatten
like crazy. They're slowly becoming aware that the book audience is
suddenly the Internet audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go through five or six books a week. Now I'm lucky
if I read two or three books a month,'' Saul said. ``We've all
become slaves to our computers.''

TIPPER GORE VISITS REFUGEE CAMP FOR MITCH VICTIMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLA NUEVA, Nicaragua _ On the final day of a quick trip
through hurricane-ravaged Central America, Tipper Gore on Wednesday
led a clutch of U.S. lawmakers, aid workers and camera-clicking
journalists through this sprawling camp for storm victims on the
edge of the Nicaraguan capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here because we want to help the people rebuild their
neighborhoods, their lives,'' said Gore, the wife of Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen people living in the streets, families ripped apart
and loved ones lost forever in this region,'' she said after
arriving in Managua from Honduras, where she slept in a refugee
camp Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's delegation caused a brief flurry as it swung through
Villa Nueva, where as many as 15,000 people left homeless by Mitch
live in hastily assembled hovels made out of heavy black plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a military-style vest, Gore talked through interpreters
to people who lost their homes and most of their possessions to
Mitch's floodwaters. She toured a small health clinic set up in
tents. She watched as workers passed out wash basins, toilet paper
and toothpaste donated by the U.S. government to the newly
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan officials herded dozens of barefoot children to greet
Gore with an arm-waving chorus of ``gracias,'' or thank you.
</P>
<P>
   But most residents of the camp seemed too busy struggling to
build new lives to pay much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before Oct. 31, most of the residents of Villa Nueva lived in a
slum on the shores of Lake Managua. Many worked as street vendors
in a public market also destroyed by the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Out of work, they now depend on charity for shelter, food, water
and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they leave us a little something,'' said Nestor
Peralta, a 25-year-old father of two toddlers, as he watched Gore's
entourage pass. ``We've lost our homes, our jobs, the lives we
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad as things here may have seemed to the group from Washington,
Villa Nueva is something of a refugee-camp showcase. People here
have it far better off than many of Mitch's victims deep inside the
Nicaraguan and Honduran countryside, where aid has been slow to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in cattle pastures and empty fields bought by the Managua
city government, Villa Nueva had been set aside for new housing
even before Mitch struck. The camp sits alongside Ciudad Sandino, a
community of 70,000 that began as a camp for refugees following the
1972 earthquake that destroyed central Managua.
</P>
<P>
   Families who have relocated here have received 24-by-36-foot
lots. The government has given them plastic to build shelters and
has promised that bricks to build walls and laminated tin to cover
roofs will come.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, water lines were installed. Spigots set about five
houses apart are now providing water for drinking and bathing.
Latrines are being dug. The government is handing out food.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and other organizations are setting up facilities
to provide medical care and other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The help is coming, but it's coming very slowly,'' said
Raymundo Bermudez, a young city engineer who was assigning lots to
refugees and distributing aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced Wednesday that the United States will send an
additional $1.5 million in medical supplies to Nicaragua and other
countries hit hard by the storm. That came on top of the $10
million in relief she announced in Honduras on Tuesday, bringing
the total amount of emergency U.S. aid pledged to the region to
just over $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, Gore said, will also send 12 more
helicopters to the area to help ferry relief supplies to remote
villages and outlying regions. Officials in Honduras and Nicaragua
have cited a shortage of helicopters as a major obstacle in the
effort to get aid to those who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nicaragua and Honduras _ the two countries struck hardest
by Mitch _ already rank among the poorest in the Americas. In
Nicaragua, per-capita income hovers at just $450 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch killed an estimated 6,000 people in Honduras and 4,000 in
Nicaragua. The storm chewed up bridges and roads across the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, estimates of Mitch's damage range to as high as $3
billion, nearly equal to the country's annual economic output. In
Nicaragua, officials place the damage at $1 billion, about half the
annual value of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras lost as much as 70 percent of its crops, including most
of its bananas, which provide much of its export income. In
Nicaragua, coffee, sugar and other crops were badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid is destined purely for emergency relief operations,
said Brian Atwood, the director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, who travelled with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's intention is to ``make sure people down here don't
get the diseases that usually follow something like'' Mitch, Atwood
said in Villa Nueva.
</P>
<P>
   A multinational meeting is planned for early December in
Washington to map out a long-term aid strategy for Central America,
Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need are plans that we all feel comfortable with,''
Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Atwood, Gore's delegation included U.S. Reps. Jim
Kolbe, R-Ariz., Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., Gary Akerman, D-N.Y., as
well as Democratic Sens. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Jeff
Bingaman of New Mexico and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Also along was Dennis Martinez, the Nicaragua-born pitching star
for the Atlanta Braves, who urged Nicaraguans to work together in
the wake of Mitch.
</P>

   INTERNET STOCKS FALL SHARPLY AS INVESTORS TAKE PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Yahoo fell $11.5625, to $165, and America Online
declined $7.375, to $137.125, as most Internet stocks slumped on
profit taking after recent increases. Although shares of the chip
maker Intel rose $6.125, to $103.6875, after the company projected
stronger-than-expected revenue for the quarter, it was not enough
to rally the Nasdaq, which decreased 3.51 points, to 1,862.11.
</P>
<P>
   Market gauges fell as investors pondered what seems little
better than an even chance that the Federal Reserve will cut
short-term interest rates again next week. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 40.16 points, to 8,823.82, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index shed 7.29 points, to 1,120.97.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Earthweb, an online provider of technical information

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)

Franz Lidz is a senior writer for Sports Illustrated and the author
of the memoir ``Unstrung Heroes.'' Steve Rushin is a senior writer
for Sports Illustrated whose book, ``Road Swing: One Fan's Journey
into the Soul of American Sports,'' was just published by Doubleday

<P>
   Last year's teen slasher smash, ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer,'' proved that each generation of adolescents is new to the
genre's creaky conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The formula calls for invincible, barely visible villains (Jason
of ``Friday the 13th,'' Michael Myers of ``Halloween,'' Freddy
Krueger of ``Nightmare on Elm Street'') shrouded in malevolent
headgear (goalie mask, Halloween mask, felt brim fedora) and
wielding sharp, shiny implements (hunting knife, carving knife,
razorlike Lee press-on nails).
</P>
<P>
   The most important convention is the sequel, the ceaseless
serializing of serial killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday,'' ``Halloween'' and ``Nightmare'' have spawned 20
unholy offspring. And last week, the inevitable first sequel to
``Summer'' opened. In the original, an angst-riddled angler named
Ben Willis (Muse Watson), wearing a black sou'wester and
brandishing an ice hook, terrorizes the teen-age townies Julie
James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and
their innumerable soon-to-croak cronies in a North Carolina seaside
burg.
</P>
<P>
   Julie and Ray live to see the sequel, and so does _ surprise! _
Fisherman Ben. This time the three are joined in the Bahamas (don't
ask) by Karla Wilson (the mononamed pop star Brandy). The film
concludes with the sine qua non of sequeldom, an ambiguous ending.
With that in mind, we asked two of Hollywood's hottest young
screenwriters to plot out endless ``Summer'' sequels. When they
turned us down, we did it ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Know What You Did in the Summer of '42''
</P>
<P>
   In this prequel to ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' the
grandparents of Julie and Ray cope with the horrors of World War II
by playing beach volleyball, catamaran-sailing and lawn bowling in
East Hampton with Hermie and Oscy, teen-age heroes of the 1971
crypto-classic ``Summer of '42.''
</P>
<P>
   The older movie's Older Woman, Jennifer O'Neill, seduces a young
beachcomber (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) who boasts of his conquest to
multinamed classmates Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jennifer Jason Leigh,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary Louise
Parker, Sarah Jessica Parker and Sarah Michelle Gellar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I Know What You'll Do Next Summer''
</P>
<P>
   Julie and Ray are transported to 23d-century Los Angeles, where
the only living link to the city's past is Bob Hope, whose 392rd
annual NBC Christmas special is as fresh as ever. The
great-great-great-great-great grandson of Fisherman Ben (Freddie
Prinze Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr.) is not casting crankbait _ he's casting
movies! When he asks, ``Where's the hook?'' he's in a pitch
meeting!
</P>
<P>
   As president of 24th Century Fox, Ben is still looking for fresh
ideas. He tells his idea people to stop living in the 2200s, and
the studio releases the only non-sequel in the last 200 years.
Alas, Romulo Ebert of The Mars Daily Planet gives the movie three
thumbs down. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I Know What Hugh Did Last Summer''
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman Ben washes ashore on a private beachfront in Malibu,
where Westec security guards frog-march him off the property, the
summer rental of Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley. Grant tells Hurley he's
popping out for a Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurley finds him 72 hours later at the L.A. County Jail,
Grant is performing ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' with his
cellmates Willis, Robert Downey Jr., Sean Penn and Christian
Slater. A bootleg copy of the surveillance video turns up at the
Chichester offices of Merchant Ivory, who turn it into ...  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I Dreamt What You Did Last Midsummer''
</P>
<P>
   In a well-intentioned homage to the 1935 Max Reinhardt
masterwork (which featured Mickey Rooney as Puck and Jimmy Cagney
as Bottom), the director Kenneth Branagh brings nothing new to this
familiar standard. Helena Bonham Carter quits in pre-production,
cattily calling the film little more than ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer Stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Preview audience response cards are hardly kinder, and Branagh
hastily tacks on a new ending set in a Viennese sleep disorder
clinic. Rex Reed writes, ``Oscar's napping if he doesn't come
calling on Kenneth!'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I Know You Took the Last Dim Sum''
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman Ben orders Chinese takeout in Manhattan. When the
deliveryman (Jackie Chan) arrives with larceny in his heart and
duck sauce in his beard, all hell breaks loose. John Woo directs. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Lst Sjommer Zum Zum Vlit Kjlmmer''
</P>
<P>
   Death (Joe Piscopo) visits Stockholm, but is thwarted when
Lufthansa loses his scythe. So Death takes a holiday. To the
familiar Bergman themes _ godlessness, life's emptiness, the thin
line between sanity and madness _ the Swedish auteur adds a new
one: the utter hopelessness of finding a decent &UR;  &LR; mochaccino around
Stallmstaregrden Norrtull. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I Know What You Did Last Summer, but Enough About You: Let's
Talk About What I Did Last Summer''
</P>
<P>
   This $400 million epic from the writer-director James Cameron
goes wildly over budget when the egocentric King of the World
summons to the set the perceived rivals Larry King, Alan King, Don
King, Billie Jean King and King Vitaman, the cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders describe the increasingly paranoiac Cameron as a royal
pain. No animals were harmed in the making of the movie, set in an
Azerbaijani abattoir, though Amnesty International decries the
tortured soundtrack by Celine Dion. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I Know What You Did, Miss Sommer''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Winters summers on Cape Cod. Suzanne Somers, Pat
Summerall and Elke Sommer winter in Aspen. On the first day of
spring, all four connect at O'Hare, where bomb-sniffing dogs
determine that this movie will be one.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover FAA officials _ working in tandem with the
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater and the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences poobah Jack Valenti _ shut the production
down and order a cessation of any and all ``Summer'' sequels.

NO NEWS IS NOT GOOD NEWS AS PLAYER LEADERS MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 27 locked-out players met here Wednesday to
discuss labor strategy and reaffirm their solidarity, Billy Hunter,
the executive director for the National Basketball Players
Association, stood at a microphone to announce the union had no
intention of detonating the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our desire or intent to blow up the season,'' Hunter
said. ``We don't want to damage the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But with 29 owners firmly entrenched in their position, the
league's labor dispute plods on toward an unofficial mid-December
deadline for reaching an agreement before losing the season. With
no new negotiations scheduled and a sixth week about to be stricken
from the 82-game schedule, a 50-game season is looking more likely.
</P>
<P>
   The union's negotiating committee and several team player
representatives met for more than five hours to discuss the lockout
and whether to alter their proposal to the owners. Hunter said he
planned to speak to NBA commissioner David Stern on Wednesday night
or Thursday morning to set up either a one-on-one meeting or a full
bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   With major differences on how to implement an escrow system and
limit the escalation of high-end salaries, both parties have about
a month to compromise on their current positions. And the longer a
deal is not reached, the mechanics of putting the season back
together become more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also said Stern informed him last week that the NBA may
soon be submitting a new proposal to the players. But deputy
commissioner Russ Granik replied, ``We have no idea what he's
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said: ``As you get into month in December, you are
flirting with the complete loss of the season. We refuse to put a
deadline on it, because we want to make a deal. But there are
different timetables involved, including the gap between the time
you shake hands over a deal and actually reduce it to writing.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers working around the clock to hash out details is the
least of the NBA's worries. Both sides have agreed that a
three-to-four-week period would be needed for training camps and at
least one exhibition game for each team before the start of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement were signed Thursday, the New York Knicks, for
example, would be reduced to a 60-game schedule. While many
observers have penciled in NBC's Christmas Day doubleheader
featuring the Knicks versus the Chicago Bulls and the Phoenix Suns
against the Los Angeles Lakers as a watershed for beginning the
season, the network's entertainment division is already working on
alternate programming for that day.
</P>
<P>
   One league official, who requested anonymity, said, ``Those
games are pretty much gone, unless something happens in the next
few days.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the NBA has released some of its hotel and meeting
rooms for the All-Star Game in Philadelphia for Feb. 14. Although
the event is not a huge revenue supplier for the league, the city
stands to lose as much as $30 million. Stern has been on the
telephone weekly with Mayor Edward Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a season of any kind, we would try and save the
All-Star Game,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The other option may be awarding Philadelphia the All-Star Game
in 2002. Golden State won the bid to host the 2000 game. The 2001
game has not been announced yet, but the MCI Center in Washington
has all but been promised the event.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsday scenario has not been discussed at length by either
side, and with a month to go, it is possible to salvage much of the
season. Stern has said he plans to reschedule some of the lost
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a season, you look at open dates and travel
schedules and see if you can add dates,'' he said. ``But as you
lose more games, you lose the opportunity to reschedule some of
those games because your base gets smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the only professional basketball taking place in
December may not take place in an NBA arena.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter confirmed that an all-star exhibition game scheduled for
the first week in December for Las Vegas is close to being put
together. The game, organized by David Falk, Arn Tellem and other
agents with prominent clients, would benefit financially strapped
players and would most likely be televised by a national cable
outlet. Hunter added that Michael Jordan may play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not he will play won't be known until the last
moment,'' Hunter said of Jordan. ``If he doesn't play, he'll coach.
But he'll be physically present.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of progress, Hunter expressed some optimism
that a deal could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think what we've put out there is a pretty fair proposal,''
he said. ``We're prepared to negotiate from that proposal, but only
if they're willing to do the same. When they demonstrate a
willingness on their part to sit down and strike a deal, then we're
prepared to strike one.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I think it's sort of crunch time. We've already
missed about two weeks of the season. Sooner or later, they're
going to have to decide it's time to make a deal. But I think what
you do, at this stage of the game, is do whatever you have to do if
you're not inclined to back off from your position.''

FIGHTING OVER THE FUTURE OF AN AMERICAN ARDEN  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Deborah Weisgall, who writes on the arts from Boston, spends her
summers on the coast of Maine. 
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL 
   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, Maine _ The Bok Amphitheater here lies below the
library, a Georgian brick building on Main Street. A graceful
double flight of stairs leads down from the library to the
amphitheater's lawn, green as the Emerald City of Oz and ringed by
a tiered horseshoe of low stone terraces, its symmetry broken by
huge mossy boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The open end of the horseshoe overlooks Camden harbor across a
park sloping to the shore. Around the closed rim, trunks of birches
tilt at bold white angles among stands of hemlock and black spruce.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I played in there and wondered how such a beautiful,
mysterious place came to be. Ferns flourished under the trees; it
was an idealized woodland, an American Forest of Arden, where,
naturally enough, Shakespeare was often played, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was in the center of town, the evergreens screened
the noise of commerce and the presence of surrounding buildings,
even the library.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1929 and 1931, Fletcher Steele, one of this country's
most brilliant landscape architects, designed the amphitheater and
the library grounds; at the same time, Olmsted Brothers, the firm
headed by the son and stepson of Frederick Law Olmsted, laid out
the harbor park.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these are recognized as one of the great achievements
of landscape architecture in America. After 70 years, they badly
need restoration, but the story of the efforts to preserve them is
a comedy of errors, an object lesson in how such a project can go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the landscape is languishing. Shrubs in the park have
disappeared; its grass has worn away. The amphitheater's magical
ferns have died off, as have some trees; branchless trunks of
overgrown evergreens weave a threadbare fabric between the town and
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, an underground addition to the library was built,
and many large trees on the library lawn were removed. A new
entrance opened into a hillside beside the amphitheater, and with
little regard for the imaginative adventure the amphitheater
offers, a new children's garden was wedged between it and the
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A cluttered, literal landscape, this garden features benches in
the shape of shelves supported by concrete books complete with
titles. Moreover, a hill in the harbor park blocked the view of the
water from the new library entrance. The library trustees were
preparing simply to bulldoze that hill, when Eleanor Ames, a
respected landscape historian who lives near Camden and was alarmed
by what was happening, organized a private effort to finance a
restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the plan was to make the library trustees and the
public aware of the place's historical importance and to educate
them in how to preserve an important work of art. A committee was
formed, and after a careful review it hired Patricia O'Donnell,
whose firm, Landscapes, had done distinguished restoration and
rehabilitation on historic locations, including Olmsted's Prospect
Park in Brooklyn, his Emerald Necklace in Boston and the Taconic
Parkway in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell prepared the plan in collaboration with Robin
Karson, Steele's biographer, and Charles Beveridge, editor of the
Frederick Law Olmsted Papers in Washington and author of
``Designing the American Landscape,'' an authoritative book on
Olmsted's work.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is an elegant and scholarly work, proposing restoration
of the amphitheater and suggesting changes in the harbor park to
accommodate new patterns of use. Both to satisfy the trustees'
desire for a view and to make the new bunkerlike library entrance
more attractive, the plan called for narrowing the summit of the
hill.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees looked at the plan, saw the light, and two of them
immediately offered to contribute $700,000 toward its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Camden has never lacked for patrons. In 1928, Mary Curtis Bok,
the daughter of the publishing magnate Cyrus Curtis, paid for the
design and construction of the harbor park, the amphitheater and
the library building. Placement of trees, vistas, contours, the
demolition of warehouses and boat works: all were brilliantly
orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape cost more than the library; it was part of Mrs.
Bok's grand plan to reshape the waterfronts of Camden and Rockport
two miles south. Most people do not know that many of the postcard
images of the Maine coast, what seem classic scenes of pristine
wilderness, are, in fact, designed landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I began working on the Olmsted papers that I
realized the firm had designed a landscape I passed every day,''
said Charles Beveridge, who grew up in Camden. Coastal Maine,
according to a recent survey conducted by the Maine Olmsted
Alliance, a private group dedicated to the preservation of designed
landscape, is rich in such places.
</P>
<P>
   Most were built between the last decades of the 19th century and
the Depression. Many were private gardens for wealthy summer
people, but others, including the carriage and motor roads of
Acadia National Park, were built for the public and paid for by
private benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Bok named the Camden library trustees stewards of the
amphitheater and the harbor park, she donated the land to the town.
The trustees held a few poorly attended public hearings on the
restoration plan, but since its implementation was already paid
for, there seemed to be no reason for the plan's widespread
dissemination.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the last meeting was televised on the local cable channel.
With no chance to study the plan, with no clue as how it came to
be, with very little information on why solutions were proposed,
people were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shaving the hill!'' became the opponents' rallying
cry. Ms. O'Donnell had proposed removing many overgrown trees and
replacing them with new ones, and the day before the town voted on
the plan, its opponents, a group called Friends of the Park, tied
yellow ribbons around the trunks of the doomed trees. Townspeople
assumed that the plan was a tool for the trustees to get their view
of the harbor, and they voted it down by 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   After the defeat, a commission was appointed to study the plan
and to submit it to the kind of careful review that should have
taken place in the beginning. Restoring a beloved landscape is as
tricky as restoring the ``Mona Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to understand landscape as art,'' said Ms.
O'Donnell. ``Places become beloved in their decrepitude; people
have a visceral reaction against change.''
</P>
<P>
   Landscape is art, but it is also real estate, and the
controversy in Camden centers on possession, not preservation.
Paradoxically, the library trustees' support of the plan became its
downfall. ``This is a power struggle,'' explained one opponent,
anonymously. ``It is not a fight between philistines and esthetes.
It's about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Beveridge agreed. ``This kind of fight in a New England town is
always a different story, a story of groups and their
relationships,'' he said. ``It becomes a question of how to include
all groups in the planning process.'' As far as the landscape goes,
the real issue, however, is how to preserve it while responding
both to changing uses and changing notions of what landscape ought
to be and do.
</P>
<P>
   The amphitheater's beauty lies in how Steele edged back and
forth between civilization and wilderness. He used only native
plants growing within five miles of the site. With a huge labor
force (during the Depression, Mrs. Bok employed many inhabitants of
Camden), Steele transplanted full-grown trees and enormous rocks in
an extremely subtle design.
</P>
<P>
   He set plants in precise rhythms; he placed boulders to echo the
random glacial terrain of the Camden hills. The space is both
strange and familiar; it offers the solitude of a walk in the woods
and the community of an open lawn; it is both private and public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amphitheater is very symmetrical,'' Ms. O'Donnell
explained. ``Then Steele breaks apart the symmetry. He creates
echoes, birch clumps paired with hemlocks. We very carefully tried
to understand what he did. Many big trees were in major shock from
replanting. By the late 60s there were major losses. We worked on
teasing apart the spacing, making it available for contemporary
maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting down trees used to be a civilizing act; now it is
considered barbarous. But pruning, not planting, is the difficult
part of managing a garden. Cutting back and cutting down seem like
destruction; it takes effort to understand how that can mean a
landscape's preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Designed landscapes imply a tension between nature and art.
Nature, messy and evolving, behooves us to leave it be; art grants
the illusion of stillness. Landscape, then, is the most fragile of
art forms; its permanence relies on constant change.
</P>
<P>
   Rustics and nobles stripped of evidence of rank wandered in the
Forest of Arden; only in that woodland could disputes resolve and
enemies become friends. At the end of ``As You Like It,'' the wise
fool Touchstone, as a way to avoid arguments, advises trading
``ifs'' _ choices _ instead of insults. ``Your `if' is your only
peacemaker; much virtue in `if,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over Camden's local Arden has all the elements of
comedy: good intentions, bad misunderstandings, muddled motives,
mutual mistrust. The landscape was built in an age of imperious
generosity. Its future, however, depends its surviving the
democratice process.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been plenty of accusations; some ``ifs,''
some possibilities, might hasten a happy ending. This landscape was
built in an age of imperious generosity. It endures as a sublime
reminder that sometimes art can improve upon nature.

PUBLIC RADIO NAMES NEW CEO 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   National Public Radio's governing board announced Wednesday that
Kevin Klose, a former Washington Post reporter and editor and the
current head of the federal government's overseas radio broadcasts
has been named the new president and chief executive of the public
radio network.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes as the public radio network has largely
weaned itself from dependence on the federally financed Corporation
for Public Broadcasting, but it remains under control of its
biggest customers, the country's local public radio stations, which
took effective control of the network after bailing it out of a
financial crisis that emerged in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Klose is also taking over in an era of far greater competition
among the electronic media, as cable news networks and Internet
news sites proliferate. For the past few years, NPR's audience, now
at 13.5 million, has continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky, discursive style of news broadcasts like ``All
Things Considered'' and ``Morning Edition'' and the off-beat humor
of the popular weekend program ``Car Talk'' have propelled the
popularity of the network, but network executives like Jeffrey
Dvorkin, the vice president for news, say more programming like the
new news-and-irony offering, ``Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me,'' are
needed if the audience is to continue expanding.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing competition from commercial radio remains a
worry. ``They know the kinds of people who listen to us,'' Dvorkin
said. ``This is a demographic that is clearly appearing to everyone
in radio. We have to be vigilant that our news programming remains
of the highest quality _ and that we remain distinct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that ended in September 1997, the most recent
year for which figures are available, the 604 local stations that
use NPR programming paid the network about $40 million in
programming, membership and connection fees. These fees, which
account for two-thirds of the network's budget, are set by the
network's 16-member board, which includes 10 members selected by
the member stations.
</P>
<P>
   Another $21 million of the $70 million budget comes from direct
and indirect support from listeners and underwriters like the Ford
Foundation and the agricultural products conglomerate
Archer-Daniels-Midland. Government grants accounted for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem facing us is the structure of the
organization,'' said Paul Delaney, a columnist and editorial writer
for The Baltimore Sun who is one of the NPR board's six public
members. ``How are we going to approach the future as an
organization in which you have the users also running it? We've got
to come to terms with that in some equitable way.''
</P>
<P>
   Klose, who replaces Delano E. Lewis, a lawyer and former
telecommunications executive who retired in August, said the
network's job ``in an increasingly competitive information world''
was to ``look at the challenge of the multimedia, multichannel
world,'' and use new opportunities ``for keeping our extraordinary
listenership and adding to it.''

   ``Dru Hill''
</P>
<P>
   Tick, tick, tick, tick.... As time passes and listeners slowly
forget about M.I.A. bad boys Jodeci, Dru Hill still isn't an easy
substitute. Sisqo can ache and riff like K-Ci of Jodeci. And when
Dru tries on a sexual persona (``Real Freak''), it seems to fit.
But someone should tell this technically fine quartet that cranking
a note up to the heavens isn't the only way to emote. Use this
album's ``Beauty'' or ``These Are the Times'' as examples of what
works, if you must. Anything to curb what occasionally feels like
unflattering mimicry.

<P>
   Even though actor Ewan McGregor (playing feral rock star Curt
Wild in director Todd Haynes' glam-rock movie fantasia) can't match
role model Iggy Pop's intensity on the movie's version of ``T.V.
Eye,'' this soundtrack of an era doesn't miss much. Loaded with
original tracks from Brian Eno, Lou Reed and Steve Harley and
Cockney Rebel, and copycat versions of Roxy Music and the New York
Dolls, it offers an entertaining gloss on music that was already
obsessed with artifice. New material from Shudder to Think, Grant
Lee Buffalo and Pulp is impressively stitched in, seamless
contemporary nods to rock's high mannerist phase.

   ``Reunion''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is sacrilege (or at least the devil-metal
equivalent), but I've always preferred bat-biting rocker Ozzy
Osbourne's solo material to his work with Black Sabbath. True,
Sabbath's relentlessly sludgy sound influenced everyone from
Metallica to Mudhoney, but even the most accessible hits, such as
``Iron Man,'' don't have the propulsiveness of Ozzy's ``Crazy
Train'' or ``Flying High Again.'' One listen to this live reunion
album, which features original Sabbath members Osbourne, Tony
Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, confirms that the band's music
remains a sonic tar pit. You know you're in for a long,
head-splitting haul when Butler uncorks an interminable bass solo
two songs into the set.

SPORTS COLUMN: HE'S BAAAACK, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that Bobby Bo is back in the Mets' uniform as an
outfielder who will be age 36 by opening day, maybe he will fit
that uniform better this time. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In a trade of two players that neither team wanted, the Mets
reacquired Bobby Bonilla, their $29 million crybaby in 1992, from
the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mel Rojas, a right-handed
reliever who threw so much gasoline on so many fires he was utterly
useless late last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Mets obtained Bonilla to hit behind the cleanup
batter Mike Piazza, but he must prove he's more mature in dealing
with Noo Yawk expectations and that he's capable of playing right
field or left field, depending on which free-agent outfielder (B.J.
Surhoff?) the Mets sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby comes with some risk,'' Bobby Valentine, the Mets'
manager, said in a conference call from Naples, Fla., where the
major league general managers are meeting, ``but also with a lot of
reward, and I think the Met fans will be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valentine, the risk is ``whether he catches the
ball when it comes down.'' Even more of a risk is how much Bonilla
has left as a slugger after a season with the Florida Marlins and
the Dodgers when he wasn't always able to play because of a damaged
left wrist and an intestinal infection.
</P>
<P>
   When he did play last season, Bonilla didn't hit anywhere near
the way he did in other years with the Pirates, the Mets and the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a 1997 World Series ring as the Florida Marlins'
third baseman when he hit 17 homers and drove in 96 runs, he
arrived at spring training following surgery on his left wrist and
left Achilles' tendon. In 100 games with the Marlins and the
Dodgers, he batted .249 with 11 homers and 45 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Davey Johnson was hired last month as the Dodgers'
new manager, the whispers were that Johnson, who had Bonilla in
Baltimore, demanded that Bonilla be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson denied that Wednesday, saying: ``I hate to lose Bobby,
he's a great hitter. He helped me get to a league championship
series in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also blamed the Baltimore news media for the turmoil
over Bonilla's wanting to play right field rather than being the
Orioles' designated hitter in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was over in two weeks,'' Johnson said. ``I finally put
him in right field and left him alone. He caught everything he got
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Bonilla is such a ``great hitter,'' why were the Dodgers
so quick to trade him? Especially for such a disaster as Rojas was?
</P>
<P>
   The reality of this trade is that the Dodgers, for whatever
reasons, didn't want Bonilla, and the Mets, for obvious reasons,
were delighted to deal Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the Mets reportedly will receive from the
Dodgers the $1.4 million differential in their 1999 salaries _ $5.9
million for Bonilla, $4.5 million for Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Frank Cashen, the Mets' interim general manager, he
completed the deal that had been ``principally engineered'' by
Steve Phillips, the general manager now on a leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, then baseball's highest-paid player, had signed his
five-year, $29 million Mets contract in 1992 when Al Harazin was
the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cashen, the architect of the 1986 World Series champions, had
retired, but Cashen is aware of Bonilla's problems with Met fans as
well as the Noo Yawk news media.
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival that off season, Bonilla, who grew up in the
Bronx, said that nothing would ``wipe the smile'' off his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from New York, I've got tough skin,'' he said then. ``I
just want to do what's on the back of my bubble-gum cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's famous smile soon disappeared. To escape the boos, he
wore earplugs. He loudly disputed official scorers' calls.
</P>
<P>
   In an ugly clubhouse scene with a reporter, he snapped: ``I'll
show you the Bronx right here. I will hurt you.'' The next day he
publicly apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's matured since that time,'' Cashen said. ``He understands
what he's getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bonilla, his maturation as a Met occurred when a
newspaper cartoon had him wearing a diaper. Annoyed, he showed it
to his wife, Millie, but when she laughed, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But on Bobby Bo's second time around with the Mets, laughing
won't mean much unless he hits and he catches those fly balls.

PRESIDENT OF MUSEUM TO LEAD U.N. ASSOCIATION
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ William Luers, a former diplomat who has been
president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1986, is to be
the next chairman and president of the United Nations Association
of the USA, the association announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a bold move for the organization, which does research and
organizes chapters of U.N. supporters around the country, Luers
will combine the two top jobs, chairman and president, when he
takes office in February.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds John Whitehead as chairman and Alvin Adams as
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a retired career diplomat, will leave the association.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead plans to stay on as one of two vice chairmen, to be
joined by Richard Voell, chairman of the Business Council of the
United Nations, a corporate group that is likely to be combined
with the United Nations Association this year.
</P>
<P>
   Luers, who is retiring from the Met on Jan. 31, said in an
interview Wednesday that he was first asked five or six months ago
to serve as chairman, but that the proposal to combine the top jobs
emerged only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I got involved, the more intriguing I thought it
was,'' he said, ``both in terms of what could be done at this
difficult stage in the United States' relationship to the United
Nations, specifically on the debt issue, and generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an organization that has enormous potential,'' said
Luers, who association officials hope will considerably improve the
group's fund-raising and its public profile. ``Off and on, it has
realized some of it, but maybe there's more that can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Luers, a former State Department official and ambassador to
Czechoslovakia and Venezuela, said he has been watching the
association from the sidelines for years and is fascinated by its
roots in the American people and what they think about the world.
He has also stayed in touch with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very close friend of Kofi Annan and Dick Holbrooke and
Tim Wirth, some of the key actors,'' he said. Kofi Annan is
secretary general; Richard Holbrooke is the administration's choice
to become the next American representative; Timothy Wirth is
president of the United Nations Foundation, which was established
by Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Luers, William Luers' wife, is founder and president of
the Foundation for a Civil Society, which aids democracy-building
movements in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. She has also formed
an organization to promote art and preservation at American
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign affairs has always been my primary interest,'' Luers
said. But he added that he could not resist a management challenge.
``I like running things,'' he said.

Rob Sabin is a contributing editor for Stereo Review's Sound and
Vision magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardcore videophiles are a suffering lot. Determined to
re-create in their homes an experience akin to that of the local
movie theater _ minus the sticky floor and ringing cell phones _
these enthusiasts can spend $100,000 or more pursuing cutting-edge
equipment that promises to deliver the nuance and impact of
celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   They log endless hours on the World Wide Web debating the merits
of the latest wide-screen projector or surround-sound processor,
and they pay technicians hundreds of dollars to calibrate their
televisions so the image is just so.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sorry, all-consuming existence for this high-tech centaur
_ half gear-head, half Siskel and Ebert. But when the lights go
down and the picture and sound come up, these fanatics enter a
world most of us visit only at the multiplex. For them, feeling
that first jet fly-by, or seeing that breathtaking vista in its
natural, blazing glory, makes it all worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, you don't need to go to such lengths to
share their bliss. Late-generation digital video and audio gear has
narrowed the gap between entry-level home theater and
state-of-the-art. It's a matter of degree.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have a 27-inch or larger television, a modest
$1,500 system suitable for small to mid-size rooms can easily
achieve those blockbuster special effects. Got more dough? You can
enhance the experience by stepping up to a larger television and
more powerful sound. Money's no object? Tear up a room and install
plush theater seating, high-end hidden speakers, a 10-foot wide
screen and a computerized control system. That is home-video
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Every home theater system, regardless of cost, has the same
basic elements. It starts with a video source component, such as a
VCR or videodisk player. When playing a movie, the soundtrack goes
to an all-in-one surround-sound receiver, or separate surround
processors and amplifiers, and then to five or six speakers
strategically arranged in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The picture portion of the movie winds up at the television or
video projector. Pretty simple, really. Unless, of course, you're
not a technical type, in which case shopping for this stuff can
seem like a ``Nightmare on Elm Street,'' complete with ghoulish
audio/video salesmen waiting to ambush you at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   But by following a few basic tips, even a neophyte can end up
with a system that will impress friends and family, stay within
budget and deliver hour upon hour of movie and music enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   TIP NO. 1: Get a DVD player. The DVD, or digital versatile disk,
looks like a regular compact disk but has from 7 to 25 times the
data capacity. That extra real estate, combined with some fancy
digital data compression, gives DVD movies twice the detail of VHS
videocassettes, with noticeably richer, truer colors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most disks offer six channels of digital sound,
instant access to any portion of the movie and such interactive
extras as multiple languages and subtitles, a choice of wide-screen
letterbox or conventional picture formats, and additional material
like comments from the director, cast biographies or scenes that
never made it to the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, what was strictly a videophile's format when
introduced in the spring of 1997 has become the people's format.
The cost of basic players has dropped to $299 at good sales, and
there are now more than 2,000 DVD video titles, including most new
films from virtually all the major studios.
</P>
<P>
   With about a million players sold, big video chains are
beginning to offer DVD rentals. And a new Web service called
NetFlix (www.netflix.com) stocks every title and rents by mail.
Some DVD players will accept new Divx pay-per-play DVDs, which are
purchased outright for $4.49 each and renewed for a small fee via a
modem in the player when they are watched a second or third time.
If you have been waiting to see whether DVD will stick around
before buying a player, you are out of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   TIP NO. 2: Go with a Dolby Digital sound system. Many DVD
movies, and virtually all new releases, offer Dolby Digital
surround sound. That is a huge improvement over the surround sound
from VHS tapes. Videotapes, as played through an old-style Dolby
Pro Logic audio/video receiver or processor, can offer only four
separate channels of sound, including a single rear channel that
goes to two speakers on either side of the viewing seats.
</P>
<P>
   DVD's, however, when played through appropriate Dolby Digital
equipment, have six separate channels, with independent sounds
going to each of the two rear speakers, plus an additional
``low-frequency effects'' channel that feeds a dedicated subwoofer
to reinforce explosions and the like.
</P>
<P>
   With these advances, movie sound engineers can now place
specific sound effects virtually anywhere in the room. You can hear
alien zombies creeping up from behind your left shoulder, or
egomaniacal fighter pilots flying diagonally overhead. Furthermore,
because Dolby Digital is a digital audio system, it delivers the
dynamic impact and clarity familiar from CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on Dolby Digital receivers have plummeted to nearly half
what they were a year ago, with budget models now advertised at
$399 or less. And the same Dolby Digital receiver that plays DVDs
will also decode Dolby Digital broadcasts received on satellite
dishes and on the new digital televisions. These units offer Dolby
Pro Logic surround sound as well, in case you still get the urge to
play one of those wimpy videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   TIP NO.3: Don't fret about digital television _ yet. The buzz is
on about the new DTV broadcasts, particularly about high-definition
television. You haven't really seen your favorite news anchor until
you've seen every hair on his well-coiffed head from the comfort of
your den.

   ATLANTA _ Reading between the lines of the Braves-Reds trade:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Baseball players are like the stock market,'' Cincinnati
general manager Jim Bowden says, ``and Bret's at his highest
value.'' In Wall Street parlance, the Reds sold high. Nine teams
had expressed interest in Bret Boone, according to Bowden, and the
Reds were willing to trade him only if someone would overpay. The
Braves overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   _ A recent 20-game winner (Denny Neagle), a serviceable
outfielder (Michael Tucker) and an outstanding pitching prospect
(Rob Bell) represent quite a bounty for a slick-fielding,
unpredictable-hitting second baseman (Boone) and a journeyman
left-handed pitcher (Mike Remlinger). The only mitigating factor is
that the Braves dealt from an area of excess, pitching, to address
an area of dire need, second base.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boone would have been a much better buy a year ago, when his
stock was at an all-time low. He had a dismal offensive season in
'97, and the Reds were so eager to unload his four-year,
$11.4-million contract that they did not protect him from the
expansion draft. But Tampa Bay and Arizona passed on him, believing
_ along with everyone else _ that his contract was too lavish. Now,
after Boone's surprising 24-homer, 95-RBI season and another surge
in baseball salaries, the same contract is perceived as a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Braves needed to shore up their middle infield, and
defensively Boone is unimpeachable. He led NL second basemen in
fielding percentage in '95, '96 and '97, set a major-league record
for fielding percentage by a second baseman in '97, then won an
overdue Gold Glove this year. He makes both the routine plays and
the spectacular plays _ a combination not often found.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offensively, there is more reason for wariness about what the
Braves are getting. To an inconsistent offense overly reliant on
the home run, they have added another inconsistent hitter whose
value skyrocketed because of the career-high 24 homers. In fact,
few hitters in recent years have been as inconsistent as Boone. His
batting average has fluctuated from .320 in '94 to .223 in '97,
settling at .266 in '98. He strikes out a lot, and he is neither a
leadoff hitter nor a base-stealing threat, so those deficiencies of
the Braves' offense remain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remlinger? He represents an effort to address the need for an
experienced left-hander in the bullpen, but his career record of
19-31, 4.63 ERA, is nothing to get excited about.
</P>
<P>
   _ The key pitcher going to the Reds was not Neagle. ``The key to
this trade,'' Bowden says, ``was Rob Bell. All of our people see
him as a 15-20 game winner down the road _ a cross between
(curveball pitcher) Darryl Kile and (power pitcher) John Smoltz.''
The Braves have a wealth of pitching prospects, yes, but it is not
a well to which they should go often in trades.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tucker's inclusion in the deal signals that the Braves intend
to upgrade right field, their other position _ in addition to 2B _
that was clearly not up to standards this season. It remains to be
seen, though, how they'll do it. Free agent Brian Jordan is
appealing but very expensive, and with Neagle gone, the team's most
tradeable chip has been used.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Reds say they intend to keep Neagle, rather than dealing
him for prospects, but if they're out of the race by midseason next
year, they probably will get a too-good-to-refuse offer from a
contending team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Neagle departs the Braves with class and characteristic good
humor _ surprised to be dealt to a non-contender, unsure how long
he'll be in Cincinnati, but nevertheless upbeat. ``I'm an
optimistic guy. I see the glass half-full instead of half-empty.''
He'll win a lot more games somewhere.

 UNDATED: your den.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HDTV is that sharp. And if you're in the market for just a plain
old television around which to build a home theater, the thought of
premature obsolescence may be enough to make you freeze in terror.
But you should worry only if you plan to buy an HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   The models just hitting stores are too expensive ($7,000 and up)
for average consumers and still in their technological infancy.
Over the next few years, critical features will be added and prices
will drop. One option is to pay a premium today for an HDTV-ready
television, to which a digital television tuner can be added later.
But there is no guarantee such a ``separates'' approach will offer
the same functionality as an integrated HDTV available in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   So the best advice for most of us is to wait on HD. And while
you wait, go get a regular analog television. Big-screen
direct-view tube sets are a steal these days, with 36-inch models
going for as little as $1,000 and 32-inch televisions starting at
$550.
</P>
<P>
   For something bigger, there are plenty of bargains in the
rear-projector category as well. Just plan ahead and don't buy a
television so big that it will not function in a secondary
location, such as a bedroom or summer home, if you are ready to
step up to HDTV in a few short years.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, the television you buy today will never go
dark: even after broadcasters turn off their analog channels some
time beyond 2006, a set-top tuner will permit the viewing of
digital programming until the set itself dies.
</P>
<P>
   TIP NO. 4: Know your options. Like anything else, home theaters
come in good-better-best packages. A starter system that would
impress 90 percent of us includes a DVD player, a Dolby Digital
receiver rated at 75 to 100 watts per channel, and, in all
likelihood, a subwoofer/satellite speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   The latter consists of five tiny monitors (the satellites) and a
separate, compact subwoofer to handle bass duties. Good sub/sat
systems start at about $800, and they are a great choice for those
whose homes are short on space or long on interior design. All
together, it might cost $1,500 to $2,000 to add all these items to
an existing television.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to go after bigger speakers that will play even
louder and offer better dynamics than a modest sub/sat system. A
full ensemble built around a decent pair of floor standing tower
speakers might start at $1,500. It will take a top-line receiver to
drive those speakers ($800 to $2,800), and you may now be thinking
about adding a 48-inch or larger rear-projection television ($1,300
and up). Are we having fun yet?
</P>
<P>
   If space and budget permit, the last step takes you into the
realm of high-quality separate surround-sound components, better
(though not necessarily louder) audiophile speakers, and a
front-projection system that paints an image on an 8- to
10-foot-wide rectangular screen that descends from the ceiling or
occupies a wall. A good front projector alone might cost $10,000 to
$50,000 (though, if it is any consolation, most will display
high-definition television images with the addition of a digital
tuner).
</P>
<P>
   Start adding the rest _ remote-controlled lights and drapes,
installation _ and you are entering the rarefied territory
described earlier. However, what this home theater offers, with
good DVD or high-definition source material, is a picture nearly
indistinguishable from film, accompanied by powerful, gut-wrenching
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, do some research before shopping. Specialty magazines
are a good source for component recommendations, as are on-line
bulletin boards and news groups. And here's one more tip: After
installing a new home theater, there is a tendency to, well, stay
home. So do make it a point to get out once in a while. Maybe go
see a movie.

 &HT;    Clemson to meet Georgia Tech tonight

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CLEMSON vs. Georgia Tech, Today, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After changing offenses several times, the Tigers seem settled
on a three-wideout formation that has enabled QB Brandon Streeter
to post better numbers. Streeter set school single-game records
with 27 completions and 329 yards in a 46-39 loss to N.C. State,
and he has thrown just four interceptions in his last five games
after throwing nine in his first four. ... Outside linebacker
Adrian Dingle needs one more sack to tie the single-season school
record of 10 held by William Perry, Michael Dean Perry and Jim
Stuckey.... Head coach Tommy West had a busy ``day off'' with the
Tigers idle last Saturday: His wife gave him a 12-chore list. ``I
told the team they wouldn't be getting any more days off because
I've worked harder on my day off than I have all season.''
</P>
<P>
   DUKE vs. Maryland, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1994 and the second time in the 1990s,
the Blue Devils have a chance to close their year with a winning
record. Coach Fred Goldsmith was asked if he thought the Duke
program had turned the corner. ``We've got the blinker on,'' he
deadpanned. ``After all the harassment we've gotten in the last few
years, we've got something to play for in November. This is an
opportunity to be a winner. This is so different than last year or
the year before. The last few years, we've just been running the
string out, and that's no fun.'' ... Goldsmith will have his top
two receivers, Scottie Montgomery and Richmond Flowers, available
for the first time in four weeks. Flowers missed three weeks after
an appendectomy, and Montgomery was out with a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE at Wake Forest, Saturday, 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden professes great confidence in Marcus Outzen,
who will start his first game at quarterback now that Chris Weinke
is out for the season. ``I've got a feeling he'll play pretty good
if he gets over his mistakes,'' Bowden said. ``If he makes some
mistakes early, how he responds to them will probably tell how he's
going to do. He spent two years going against our top defense in
practice. He's one of those guys you look at and say he's a winner.
When we signed him, we couldn't judge his passing because his high
school was a running team. ... We will not cut back as much as we
did when Weinke had that (six-interception) game against North
Carolina State. We made a big thing of getting our running game
cranked up. We'll run it some and try to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND at Duke, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   With freshman QB Randall Jones continuing to struggle, coach Ron
Vanderlinden will announce his starter either today or tomorrow.
Neither Jones nor junior Ken Mastrole has been able to generate a
passing attack for the Terps, who throw for a measly 88 yards a
game. The two have thrown for just one TD each, the same as RB
LaMont Jordan. ``We felt we need to take some pressure off Randall,
and we felt we needed to give Kenny another chance,'' Vanderlinden
said. ... Jordan needs 274 rushing yards in his last two games to
reach 1,000 for the season. ... FS Tony Jackson, who has missed the
last three games with a knee sprain, is questionable, as is DT Kris
Jenkins, who has a pinched nerve in his shoulder and didn't play
last week against North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA at Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carl Torbush says he's not worried about how freshman
quarterback Ronald Curry will react to antagonism from Virginia
players and fans. Curry had verbally committed to the Cavaliers
before switching to the Tar Heels. ``I'm not concerned about Ronald
Curry,'' Torbush said. ``He'll approach this just as he has every
game this season _ with maturity and poise and great concentration.
It's not Ronald Curry vs. anybody else. It's our team vs. theirs.
I'm sure the fans will get involved, but Virginia's always had a
great fan atmosphere. They get involved in trying to distract an
opposing team.'' ... Torbush said Virginia has the best running
attack North Carolina will face this season, with Thomas Jones and
Antwoine Womack.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE at Maryland, Nov. 21
</P>
<P>
   Torry Holt is closing in on several key ACC receiving records.
With 3,113 career yards after picking up 404 in the last two games,
he is 205 yards shy of the league record held by Duke's Clarkston
Hines. He needs six catches to surpass the ACC single-season mark
of 77 set by Geroy Simon of Maryland in 1994. Last week against
Wake Forest, Holt had a career-best 15 catches for 179 yards. ...
Both State and North Carolina have sold approximately 30,000 of the
34,000 tickets they were allotted for their regular-season finale
Nov. 28 at Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium.... Freshman Ray Robinson,
a midseason replacement at tailback after a shoulder injury ended
Rahshon Spikes' season, is fifth in the ACC in rushing with 644
yards. He had 164 and two TDs in last week's win over Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA vs. N. Carolina, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As if the Cavaliers wouldn't have their hands full against the
Tar Heels anyway, defensive lineman Antonio Dingle has given
Carolina something to rally around. The 6-3, 300-pounder said he
wanted to hurt Carolina quarterback Ronald Curry and make him
scream. Coach George Welsh tried to downplay the controversy.
``These are just kids,'' Welsh said. ``I can't believe he really
wants to hurt him. It's Virginia vs. North Carolina; it's not
anything personal about anybody else. I don't hold anything against
him. I think too much has been made of it.'' But Welsh did say he
planned to discuss the controversy with his team. ``I intend to
talk to the players. I don't want this to take away from the game,
take away from their concentration. We need to be thinking about
North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST vs. Florida State, Saturday, 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Caldwell says the absence of injured FSU quarterback
Chris Weinke won't affect his team's preparation too much. ``We
know Florida State is among the top recruiting programs in the
country, but their depth is so good and they have so many great
players, I'm certain they won't miss a beat.'' Caldwell said he was
aware that the Seminoles lined up once against Virginia last week
with wide receiver Peter Warrick at quarterback. ``Peter Warrick
could line up anywhere on the field and be an effective player,''
Caldwell said. ``If he lines up at quarterback, he would present a
little bit more of a problem.'' ... Marcus OutzenWake's leading
receiver, Desmond Clark

 &HT;    I-AA playoffs in the picture for Bethune
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bethune-Cookman College, the smallest member of the
Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, has evolved into one of the
biggest stories in I-AA football.
</P>
<P>
   Despite only 52 players on scholarship, 11 fewer than the I-AA
maximum, the small private school in Daytona Beach, Fla., has a 7-1
record and probably will make a postseason appearance. Picked to
finish seventh in the nine-team MEAC, the Wildcats already have won
homecoming games at South Carolina State, North Carolina A&AMP;T and
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   According to second-year head coach Alvin Wyatt, who in 22 years
at Bethune-Cookman has been head women's basketball coach and a
football assistant during two separate stretches, the Wildcats have
generated shockwaves by using the ``Wyatt Bone'' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of the wishbone, the broken bone (and) the
dive option, as well as the shotgun,'' said Wyatt, whose son,
Antwuan, is a former Clemson and Bethune-Cookman receiver currently
on the Miami Dolphins' practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt, 4-7 last season, did not implement the offense until late
August. He was encouraged to do so because of the presence of
quarterback Patell Troutman, a 5-10, 175-pounder from Daytona
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Troutman, along with All-America candidate James Adderley at
receiver, has the Wildcats ranked among the top 20 in the I-AA
Sports Network poll for the first time in school history, and
second behind state rival Florida A&AMP;M in the latest Sheridan poll.
</P>
<P>
   Playing huge roles in a program supported by a booster club that
is now 31 chapters strong, Troutman, Adderley and the Wildcats
defense have put themselves in the picture for the I-AA playoffs
and the Heritage Bowl. And they could share the MEAC title if they
beat Norfolk and then Florida A&AMP;M the next weekend in Orlando,
where a crowd at the Citrus Bowl might reach 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Troutman has rushed for a team-high 672 yards and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlers benefit
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Bethune-Cookman itself, the biggest beneficiary of
the Wildcats' success so far is Florida A&AMP;M. After surviving a
scare and emerging with a 50-48 victory over Southern last weekend,
the Rattlers (8-1, 5-1) not only moved ahead of Hampton to the No.
1 spot in the Sheridan poll but also put themselves in position to
grab a share of the MEAC title as a result of the Wildcats' victory
over Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 14, the Wildcats will try to take all of that away
from a Rattlers team that beat them 52-35 before a crowd of nearly
57,000 in Orlando a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   G-Men on brink of .500
</P>
<P>
   With a victory over Division II opponent Winston-Salem State on
Saturday, in a game to be played in San Diego, Grambling first-year
coach Doug Williams will have pushed his team to 5-5 heading into
the annual showdown with Southern in the Bayou Classic at the
Superdome in New Orleans Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   A Grambling victory also would enhance the chances of little
Livingstone College making its second appearance in the
Atlanta-based Pioneer Bowl Dec. 19 as the CIAA representative. The
team from the smallest school in Division II has won more games
(6-3, 5-2) than Winston-Salem State (5-4, 5-2), which will be an
underdog against the G-Men.

 &HT;    Rankings shrouded in mystery
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's say you are a Tennessee football fan. Your world
has just become a very complicated place. Here, the Vols have
become the No. 1-ranked team in the country, positioned nicely for
an ultimate national championship game, and you don't really know
how.
</P>
<P>
   There are not enough fingers and toes to do the math involved.
Even if the whole family takes off its deerskin boots.
</P>
<P>
   No one can really help explain it, either. Whenever the
components of the Bowl Championship Series standings are broken
down, it always comes out sounding like this to the average Joe:
Buzzzzzzzzzzz. Quartile rank. Buzzzzzzzzzzz.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm fascinated by the new system. I haven't had this
exciting of a math challenge since the last time, long ago, I tried
to balance the checkbook. Football without long division just
wouldn't be as fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   In the good ol' days, a team got to be No. 1 very simply _
enough media people had heard some rumor about it over drinks in
the hospitality room to vote it there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with this complex formula guiding the future, every Tuesday
that they release the Bowl Championship Series standings is like
tax day. Some CPA juggles the numbers, and you either get a
pleasant surprise or take it in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this: ``I've gotten a half-dozen calls from
mathematicians who said we had miscalculated the deviation,'' said
Charles Bloom, who handles media relations for both the SEC and the
BCS. So, this was the way to put academics back into college
football.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, adjusted deviation is not a White House strategy.
It's a device to mitigate the differences in the three computer
polls that are part of the BCS equation. And here we take one great
bit of comfort in the process _ computers never will get together
and take over the world, because they can't even agree on a No. 1
college football team. Three computer polls and currently three
different No. 1s: UCLA (Seattle Times), Kansas State (Sagarin) and
Florida State (New York Times). They're going to have to get
together and thrash this out over some frosted mugs of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, you are a Tennessee football fan, and you have so
many questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times has a computer poll? That computer can't know
anything about college football. It's never even been to
Starkville.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get this straight _ I have to root for Florida? Well, as a
matter of fact, yes. No matter how many laws of nature that
violates. The better the Gators do from here, the better the Vols'
strength of schedule, an important aspect in the BCS standings.
</P>
<P>
   How safe is our position? Just keep the name Newt Gingrich in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you just hate to be a Kansas State fan? Know there must
be one somewhere. The Wildcats currently are the unbeaten left out
of the national championship picture. They have to make up 1.26
points on the BCS No. 2, UCLA. What the hey does that mean? (Here
Bloom supplies a little perspective: ``That's the equivalent of 32
places in strength of schedule. Kansas State currently with the
79th-ranked schedule, plays Nebraska this weekend and can get a
sizable bump.'' Got that?)
</P>
<P>
   Remember when being No. 1 was a matter of opinion? Back when all
it required was a single index finger, convincingly raised?

</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide (6-3, 3-3 SEC) has won four of its last five

DuBose when the Tide was trailing in the fourth quarter. ...
Alabama is eligible for a bowl, with games remaining against
Mississippi State and Auburn. ... Mississippi State has won two in
a row over Alabama. ``We've never matched up well with Mississippi
State,'' DuBose said. ``They have always physically beaten us.''
... After giving up 201 yards rushing to LSU's Kevin Faulk last
week, coaches are concerned about stopping Mississippi State's
James Johnson, who ran for 198 yards in last year's 32-20 loss to
the Bulldogs. Johnson leads the SEC in rushing with 1,040 yards.
... Alabama's Shaun Alexander is third in the conference in rushing
with 1,019 yards.

   ARKANSAS at Tennessee, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major overhauls for the Razorbacks this season has
been in the secondary, which had been near the bottom of the SEC in
pass defense the last two years. Arkansas is fourth in the league
and 35th nationally and already has surpassed last year's
interception total by three, picking off 12 passes through eight
games. ... Free safety Keroy Kennedy was named SEC defensive player
of the week for his play against Ole Miss, including nine tackles,
an interception, a fumble recovery and two passes broken up. ...
Tight end Al Heringer, who platoons as a starter, underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday and will miss the Tennessee game.
... The last time two unbeaten SEC teams met this late in the
season, Alabama routed Auburn 31-7 in 1971.

<P>
   AUBURN vs. Georgia, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker James Callier, who tore an ACL in last week's game
with Central Florida, is out for the season and will be replaced by
Haven Fields. Fields came off the bench to record 12 tackles and a
sack last week. ... Linebacker Tavarreous Pounds, who bruised a
shoulder against UCF, is expected to playBill Oliver. ... Auburn's
defense has at least one interception in its last five games and 15
on the season. ... Wide receiver Karsten Bailey has caught at least
one pass in 26 consecutive games. ... PK Robert Bironas has made 10
of 11 field goals this season. The rest of the kicking game is not
good. The Tigers have had two punts blocked and are giving up 24.9
yards per kickoff return. ... Fullback Heath Evans, who broke his
ankle Sept. 19, will not play against Georgia but might be ready
for Alabama next week.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA vs. S. Carolina, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries continue to hit Florida's defensive line. Tackle Ed
Chester was lost for the season with a knee injury in October. The
other tackle, Reggie McGrew, will miss Saturday's game because of a
back injury. Defensive end Willie Cohens will miss at least one
game because of floating bone chips in his knee. ... Saturday will
be homecoming at Florida, but the Gator seniors have elected not to
ride on the float during Friday's homecoming parade to show they
are serious about the game with South Carolina. ... There are
strong indications that this will be the last home game for junior
linebacker Jevon Kearse, who continues to drop hints that he will
turn pro. Coach Steve Spurrier has encouraged Kearse to take part
in all the senior activities during homecoming.Jacquez Green

 &HT;    Bulldogs' defense has become source of concern, controversy
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ With three regular-season games left, Georgia has
a 6-2 record and a good shot at its second New Year's Day bowl game
in a row. Yet, Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan spent much of the past two
weeks addressing his team's lapses on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the different people that scrutinize your program
nowadays, with the talk shows and everything, it's just a lot more
prevalent to find out what's wrong with your team,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been two weeks of leisure for Georgia's players,
either. Instead of nursing various bumps and bruises, Donnan put
his team through two full-contact scrimmages at Sanford Stadium
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tackling has been so poor that we really needed to go
live,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   As much progress as the No. 17 Bulldogs have made in their third
season under Donnan, the defense continues to be a concern,
especially its play in Georgia's biggest games. Under Donnan, the
Dogs are just 2-6 against the Big Three of Auburn, Florida and
Tennessee, with the opponents scoring an average of 35.6 points in
those contests.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 38-7 loss to Florida in Jacksonville two weeks ago was
an especially bitter defeat for Donnan. While the offense gained
461 yards, Florida scored touchdowns on three of its first four
possessions in the opening quarter, putting Georgia in a hole it
couldn't claw out of. LSU and Kentucky also scored on three of
their first four series against the Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism has fallen on defensive coordinator Joe
Kines, in his fourth season at Georgia. The Bulldogs rank seventh
in the SEC in total defense, allowing 347.3 yards per game. Georgia
has been especially suspect against the run, surrendering 135.8
yards per contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that criticism should be on me, not on the players,''
Kines said. ``That's going to happen during the course of the year.
But the only thing we're worried about right now is Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who host Georgia Saturday in a nationally televised
game, appear to be a good remedy for the Bulldogs. Auburn ranks
last in the SEC in total offense with only 263.2 yards per game,
including only 98 yards rushing. The Tigers have battled injuries
on the offensive line and are starting true freshman Gabe Gross at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Dogs faced in last year's Auburn game, when the
Tigers stunned then-No. 7 Georgia 45-34 in Sanford Stadium. Auburn
came into the game with one of the nation's worst running games,
gaining less than 50 yards on its previous 77 attempts. Yet, the
Tigers rushed for 159 yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's Coach Kines' fault,'' linebacker Dustin
Luckie said. ``We've got to go out and execute the game plan. When
we watch film, a lot of guys are lining up wrong and not doing
their assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans have complained about Kines' scheme, saying that it's
too much of a ``bend-but-don't-break'' approach. The Bulldogs tried
to pressure Florida quarterback Doug Johnson with seven blitzes in
the first 18 plays, while playing man-to-man coverage on a few
plays. But the Gators opened with a no-back set and five wideouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect them to be in no-back and running a no-huddle
offense,'' Luckie said. ``They caught us on our heels. We adjusted
late in the first period, but it was already 21-0. They kept
running the same four plays, but we couldn't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's problems on defense appear to start up front _ the
Bulldogs have just two sacks in the last two games. Defensive end
Marcus Stroud, a 6-foot-6, 297-pound sophomore, has the size and
speed of a dominating presence, but he has only 15 tackles. Seniors
Paul Snellings and Antonio Cochran, who have battled injuries, also
haven't been as productive as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our defensive line is as deep as some people
think,'' defensive line coach Rodney Garner said. ``We've got to
get some pressure. We've got to knock down the quarterback. We're
not going to sack them every time, but we've got to rattle them.''
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers generally have played well, but the secondary
has had some breakdowns. Junior free safety Larry Mann struggles in
man-to-man coverage, and strong safety Kirby Smart often is
criticized for his tackling ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's blown out of proportion a lot of times,'' Smart
said. ``It's just like baseball. If a guy hits .300, he's a
success, but at the same time he's a failure. Those guys (on
offense) are getting scholarships to break tackles, too.

 &HT;    Christian worthy of his name, on field and off
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost nothing about Bob Christian gives him away as a
football player. He's neither big nor tall, by pro standards. The
only player in the NFL who owns a dulcimer and can play it, also
the piano and the trumpet. One of the few players in the league who
needs no help changing a light bulb. He holds a degree in
electrical engineering. The only Atlanta Falcon ever cut by both
the Falcons and the London Monarchs. He has made it back to Suwanee
but never made it to Piccadilly Circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a new camera and everything, ready to go, then they
called me in and cut me. That was a slap in the face,'' he said.
``You see, they trained at Orlando, then took the team to London.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons first drafted him in 1991, their last pick. Then cut
him at the round of 60 in preseason. Next came the Monarchs, and by
this time he began to wonder if there was a place for him in
football after Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ``During spring practice after my freshman season, our running
backs coach had told me he thought I could play in the NFL,'' he
said. ``That really gave me a boost. It became my goal,'' but here
he was, shot down twice, by one team that would finish 6-and-10 and
a migratory team from another continent. Then the Chicago Bears
called, and we get on with the story that led him to where he is
today, with the Falcons again, facing the San Francisco 49ers,
biggest game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Christian is a throwback, to the day of the single-wing, when
the quarterback was the blocking back. He's a fullback who blocks.
That's his primary job. He came out of Northwestern a running back
who carried the ball 25-30 times a game. When he gets to run the
ball with the Falcons, it's stop-the-presses stuff. They do trust
him with it on passes now and then, and last week the screen pass
Chris Chandler threw to him set up the first touchdown against New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be dangerous when he gets his hands on the ball,'' Dan
Reeves said. ``He's as good a blocker as I've ever been around, but
he can do more than block.''
</P>
<P>
   Football computes about everything it does. No statistic is too
obscure to be logged, but somehow blocks got overlooked. No record
is kept of devastating blocks, killer blocks, pancake blocks. They
keep records on half-tackles, but the blocker who clears the track
goes unrecorded, except by the coach and the old blocker doing
analysis from the broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   To be a blocking back, you have to play without fear. ``It's
against human nature. You're bearing down on some guy as big as you
are, both going full speed. If you flinch, you lose. I put my faith
in God. I feel like He gives me the courage to do what I do, or I
wouldn't still be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are the sixth stop he has made as a pro. The first
time, ``It was kind of crazy, as anyone who has ever played for
Jerry Glanville knows.'' Then the Monarchs. Then San Diego. Cut
again. Then the Bears, then to Carolina in the expansion draft,
then the Falcons again as a free agent. Here he fit into Reeves'
scheme and becomes a more important cog each passing week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to be getting my hands on the ball more often, and
that's a thrill, but I knew my role was blocking, and I have to be
unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   No pampered athlete here. He plays to serve, as he lives his
life. Last spring, he and some other athletes made a Christian
mission into South Africa and Zimbabwe, referring here to the
faith, not the family name.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking is no precise science. It has to be the nature of the
beast, to stick his head in a lion's den and hope to get it back.
Rare is the fan who has a full appreciation of it, unless it's in
full view. It's a life of sacrifice, but here's a man who has the
attitude for it, Christian the Christian.

 &HT;    Apparent mismatch pits the Falcons' pass defense vs. 49ers
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the ball was on its way, Falcons free safety
Eugene Robinson was yelling, ``Tip! Tip! Tip!'' In retrospect,
maybe he should have been screaming, ``Take cover.''
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much the theme during the first half on Sept.
27, when the San Francisco 49ers took a 31-7 lead against Atlanta
en route to a 31-20 victory. The Falcons were talking about big
plays; the 49ers were making them.
</P>
<P>
   The second play of the game was the ugliest of all. Before the
fans had settled into their seats, future Hall of Fame quarterback
Steve Young threw 24 yards over the middle to future Hall of Fame
receiver Jerry Rice, who capitalized on several Atlanta mistakes to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Ronnie Bradford wasn't as deep as he should
have been in ``underneath'' coverage when Rice ran a slant from
Atlanta's right to left. Nickel back Juran Bolden was covering Rice
closely. Robinson slowed as he approached the play from behind,
figuring Bolden would tip the ball or knock it down.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption was the third Atlanta mistake in a span of about
1.5 seconds. Bolden didn't raise a hand, Rice caught the ball,
Robinson never touched him, and the resulting 66-yard touchdown
reception broke Atlanta's back.
</P>
<P>
   Young completed 20 of 27 passes for 266 yards and three
touchdowns in the first half, and the 49ers dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons need to remember that game when they play the 49ers
on Sunday in the Georgia Dome for sole possession of first place in
the NFC West. Both teams are 7-2. The Falcons will place the NFL's
No. 29-ranked passing defense against the 49ers' top-ranked passing
offense. On paper, it's a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Last time,) I did something that normally I wouldn't,''
Robinson said. ``Juran was in great position, so I played for the
tip. Next time, if I have a shot, I'm going to play for the hit,
not the interception. They came out playing so fast. We were
reeling the rest of the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' receiving corps of Rice, J.J. Stokes and Terrell
Owens and running back Garrison Hearst, who had a 65-yard screen
pass, ended up with 387 receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   When Rice scored in the second quarter on a 26-yard pass down
the middle, Bolden again was in excellent position, but didn't make
a play. He was waived less than 48 hours after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do a good job early in the game of making plays. We
were in position to make them, but we didn't,'' Atlanta secondary
coach Ron Meeks said. ``That's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially against Young, 36, who scrambles as well as any
quarterback in the league to allow well-covered receivers extra
time to get open.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have a tough task against a 49ers receiving corps as
talented _ and big _ as Rice (6-foot-2, 196 pounds), Stokes (6-4,
223) and Owens (6-3, 217).
</P>
<P>
   Rice has 48 catches for 710 yards and five touchdowns; Owens has
40 catches for 613 yards and six touchdowns, and Stokes has 41
catches for 498 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Rice has just about all the attributes,'' Falcons
cornerback Ray Buchanan said. ``He might be lacking a little speed,
but he's still quick and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell Owens is more of a deep threat, running crossing
routes and things of that nature,'' Buchanan said. ``He's very
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then J.J. Stokes is more of a tall guy they just throw the
ball up to and let him make plays, especially in the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford (5-10, 188), who missed the last two games with a
sprained knee, could play Sunday in a limited role. Starting
corners Buchanan (5-9, 195), Michael Booker (6-2, 203) and nickel
back Randy Fuller (5-10, 175) will be tested often.
</P>
<P>
   They'll need help from safeties Robinson (6-1, 197), William
White (5-10, 205), and Devin Bush (5-11, 210) _ and a steady pass
rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like we did last week, and knock receivers off
their routes, the only thing we might have problems with is Steve
Young scrambling,'' Buchanan said. ``Their entire offense is based
on timing, and the ball and the receiver arriving in a certain spot
at the same time. If you can throw the timing off, a lot of times
the play won't be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that simple against receivers who are good at beating
bump-and-run coverage, especially with the Young factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to keep things in front of you and keep your
leverage (and balance),'' Meeks said. ``When you play San Francisco
and Steve Young, he's going to (scramble and) buy time for his
receivers. Our focus has to be on finishing the play. We have to
stay in coverage.'' ``Getting (Young) out of the pocket is big,''
Buchanan said. ``He can hurt you when he runs, but if he has time
to do whatever he wants, he can hurt you more.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the key is to return to basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep things simple,'' he said. ``We're not going to
worry as much about adjustments. We're just going to line up in
man-to-man, and say, `If you beat me, you beat me.' I think that's
how you eliminate all the confusion we had early in that game. We
were making too many adjustments (just before the play).
</P>
<P>
   ``And if something goes wrong, it takes a mature team to weather
the storm, instead of going, `Oh man, woe is me.' We didn't do that
last time.

AT LONG LAST, A BIG GAME  
 CENTERS WAITED 9 YEARS FOR SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals fullback Larry Centers has waited nine years for a
game as big as Sunday's.
</P>
<P>
   The (John) Madden cruiser looking for a parking spot. Hall of
Famer Terry Bradshaw showing up at a practice. A fan from Minsk,
Belarus (of the former Soviet Union), inquiring about buying team
merchandise. Businesses offering to feed the players breakfast the
rest of the week in helping them try to ``Destroy Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more coming. Red pompons will be passed to a sold-out
crowd when it enters Sun Devil Stadium Sunday for the game between
the Cardinals (5-4) and the NFC East-leading Dallas Cowboys (6-3).
</P>
<P>
   Centers isn't complaining about the distractions, not when he's
had so many meaningless games in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Usually by now, the Cardinals are so far out of contention,
Centers has struggled to remain motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I wondered whether we would be able to get
things turned around here during my football lifetime,'' said
Centers, who has been with the team longer than any active player.
</P>
<P>
   Not once since Centers joined the team as a fifth-round pick in
1990 has the team been over .500 after nine games. Twice, they've
been 2-7. Five times, they've been 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   In five of those years, they've been in the division cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come in and try to be the best at your profession, but it
used to be pretty hard,'' Centers said. ``It was work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing was trying to find something to be excited
about, finding something good about the situation, something to
focus on so that it was not as bad a situation as it seemed. I
would try to go to practice and make a catch I've never made
before, make a move I never had made before.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Cardinals played a home game that was
televised locally, they met the Cowboys on Christmas night three
years ago on Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, ABC-TV's Dan Dierdorf walked in on middle
linebacker Eric Hill and defensive end Chad Brown brawling in the
Cardinals locker room. Then the Cardinals went out and were routed,
37-13.
</P>
<P>
   Centers wound up catching 12 passes for 172 yards and made all
of the TV highlight films when he hurdled Cowboys cornerback Larry
Brown en route to a 29-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't consider it one of his special moments. ``It was a
meaningless game except for the fact it was the end of a rotten
(4-12) season,'' Centers said.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the end of Coach Buddy Ryan's two-year reign of
terror. He was fired the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Centers said the attitude changed soon after Coach Vince Tobin
was hired to replace Ryan. Two years later, the Cardinals are in
contention for a division title and the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're not successful officially,'' Centers said.
``Getting where we want to get is a process. This is part of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   After an 0-2 start, the Cardinals have won five of seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is such a game of confidence,'' Centers said.
``We're starting to believe we can get it done. That's why I'm
happy the way (last Sunday's game) ended and the way we had to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals blew a nine-point lead in the final three minutes
last Sunday against Washington but rallied in the closing seconds
to win, 29-27, on Joe Nedney's 47-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever Centers goes out in public, fans are stopping him
and asking him about Sunday's game.
</P>

   They also want to know when the Madden cruiser arrives. The
answer is Friday.

   ``People like Larry deserve more than a game when we're 5-4 and
have a chance to share first place,'' center Aaron Graham said.
``I'm more excited about getting Larry the opportunity to play in
December for a division championship and a playoff game.
</P>

   ``I know Larry is going to be excited, because he hasn't had
this opportunity before, but I foresee bigger games down the
road.'' &QL;

TRANSFORMING DEATH'S WOUND: A HEALING ART  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Kay Larson, an art critic, has practiced Zen for several years. 
 By KAY LARSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In the doorway of the room that houses ``The
Letter Writing Project,'' a graceful, meditative installation by
the 34-year-old Taiwan-born artist Lee Mingwei, you duck under a
noren curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The noren _ a common feature in Japanese architecture _ is a
translucent white scrim that lowers the height of the doorway by
about a foot. Your head nods, your back bends, and suddenly you are
bowing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Westerners don't expect to bow at an exhibition. But throughout
Buddhist Asia, bowing is more than common courtesy. It signifies
acceptance of the way of the universe: the importance of setting
aside ego, of acknowledging the web that unites all beings, and of
expressing gratitude for this miraculous gift of life.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing, it turns out, is integral to Lee's exhibition, on view
here at the Fabric Workshop and Museum through Saturday. Lee, who
lives in New York City, has minded the teachings he received for
six summers, beginning at age 6, in a Chan monastery. (Chan is the
Chinese ancestor of Zen.)
</P>
<P>
   Sent by his dissident parents, who were busy demonstrating for
Taiwanese independence, Lee rose for meditation at 3 a.m. and
learned the simple power of concentrating on daily activities at
the side of his Chan master, Mou-chan.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became subject to the draft _ and possibly to the
``accidents'' that had claimed the lives of sons of dissidents _
his parents packed him off to San Francisco, to a high school run
by Benedictines. College and graduate school followed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Letter Writing Project'' is about bending to the
mysterious necessity of loss: the commonplace transfigurations of
death and passage. Three booths _ with walls of blond wood and
frosted glass, akin to shoji screens _ offer stationery and
envelopes on small tables.
</P>
<P>
   You are invited to express the unsayable to those who are beyond
reach. (Next fall, letters will be ceremonially floated down a
river on paper lanterns and burned, in accordance with Asian Bon
festival practice.)
</P>
<P>
   Slats in the walls display previous efforts _ envelopes
addressed `To my father which I will never see'' or ``In memory of
Jamal,'' testaments to the shared difficulties of letting go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you take up the pen, the act of writing gives thoughts a
curious weight. Some words seem to obstruct the pen, others to
encourage it. The actuality of having written changes the writer
subtly. Something is made real, then given away. In Lee's view,
this ``emptying out'' is a healing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he has varied the height of the table, obliging you
to assume one of the three meditative postures of Buddhism:
standing, sitting, kneeling. Each posture has its mental correlate:
gratitude, insight, forgiveness. Thus the three components that
create karma _ body, speech and thought _ are all activated as you
write. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The karma has been great for Lee ever since he arrived at Yale,
from which he earned a master of fine arts degree. Knowing no one,
he put up notices all over campus promising to cook an intimate
dinner for anyone who signed up.
</P>
<P>
   His mother asked what he was doing in school, and he said,
``Hanging out at Stop &AMP; Shop.'' He explains: ``My interest was to
find a connection with a community through food. My grandmother
used to do this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dinner became Lee's first gallery show, ``The Dining Project,''
which opened at Lombard-Fried Fine Arts in SoHo on May 31, 1997, a
week after his graduation from Yale. On an elegant tatami-mat
platform, Lee served one person a night, chosen by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests were David A. Ross and Eugenie Tsai of the
Whitney Museum. Ms. Tsai's ancestors, like Lee's, came from
mainland China, though they bypassed Taiwan and settled in the
United States. At dinner, Ms. Tsai was initially nervous but
quickly charmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself talking about very personal things,'' she says,
``although I had just met this person.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tsai took ``The Dining Project'' to the Whitney last May; it
was Lee's first museum show. Photographs of Lee serving dinner on
tatami mats at the museum recently occupied half an issue of the
French art magazine Ninety.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney installation included the first two booths of ``The
Letter Writing Project.'' Lee's grandmother had recently died, and
he had been composing long epistles to her containing everything he
could not say during life to this forceful woman who studied
Western medicine and lived in Japan (hence Lee's love of things
Japanese).
</P>
<P>
   In its completed form at the Fabric Workshop, ``The Letter
Writing Project'' is his tribute to her, and to the strange power
of releasing strong emotions to the air and water.

BOBEK QUALIFYING ATTEMPT TO TAKE PLACE IN SCOTTSDALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicole Bobek, a five-time medalist at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships, 1995 World bronze medalist and '98 Olympian, must
skate next month at the Pacific Coast Sectional in Scottsdale in
order to qualify for nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bobek has not won an international medal since 1995,
missing by one place at Skate America two weeks ago, she is
required by the U.S. Figure Skating Association to go through a
sectional for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The top four finishers in senior, junior and novice divisions at
each of three sectionals plus automatic qualifiers advance to the
1999 U.S. Championships, Feb. 7-14 in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Bobek goes to the Pacific Coast Section because she represents
the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club, although she is training out
of Detroit and Richmond, Va., and her hometown is Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Coast meet is Dec. 6-12 at the Cellular One Ice Den,
which organizers said will seat 800 with portable bleachers. Bobek
is to skate Dec. 11-12. Tickets will be sold at the door but are
not currently available in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The senior ladies field also will include Amber Corwin (sixth at
1998 nationals), Sydne Vogel (ninth), Cohen Duncan (who withdrew
from nationals because of a hip injury) and Naomi Nari Nam (fourth
in juniors).
</P>
<P>
   Bobek, 21, and silver medalist Michelle Kwan, 18, opted to
remain eligible for international skating after the Nagano Olympics
rather than turn pro like gold medalist Tara Lipinski, 16.
</P>
<P>
   At 1998 nationals, Bobek completed five triples in her free
skate to beat out Tonia Kwiatkowski for an Olympic berth,
encouraging talk of an American sweep in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski and Kwan came through. Bobek, affected by a pre-Olympic
hip injury and bronchitis, missed all but one jump in her short and
long programs and placed 17th out of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Bobek then was an injury dropout from the World Championships in
Minneapolis and thought to be finished as an Olympic-eligible
skater. Instead, she again changed coaches and is working with
Richard Callaghan, who trained Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is that I've trained for 17 years and I'm
at least going to end my eligible career on a good note,'' Bobek
said before Skate America. ``I didn't want to leave it with the
Olympics. It's always been my goal since 1995 to win back my
national title. So right now I'm focusing on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobek's preparation for Skate America was marred by a training
accident at the Detroit Figure Skating Club when she ran into the
boards at full speed and was knocked unconscious and off the ice
for several days.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Coast senior men's field will include two-time
defending champion Michael Chack, who was the U.S. bronze medalist
in 1993 when nationals were held at America West Arena. &QL;

IT'S ALL UP TO VAUGHN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who has
increased the team's offer to Mo Vaughn, was hopeful Wednesday
night of bringing closure to the 18-month negotiations between the
team and its star slugger.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was Vaughn's to make as both the team and the free
agent first baseman's agents awaited word on how he wanted to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, WednesdayDuquette denied a report by Channel 4's Bob
Lobel that the club had raised its five-year offer from $60 million
to $65 million. By Wednesday night, however, sources said Duquette,
who met twice with Vaughn's agents during the afternoon, increased
the team's offer to compete with the six-year, $72 million proposal
made last Friday by the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual value of a five-year, $65 million deal would
be $13 million, which would match the industry ceiling set by Mets
catcher Mike Piazza when he signed a seven-year, $91 million
package.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was not setting a deadline for Vaughn to make a
decision on the Sox offer, Duquette said he planned to leave the GM
meetings here Thursday morning, not to return to Boston but to meet
with prospective free agent signees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to our fans to present good players,'' Duquette
said, ``and there are a limited supply of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette did not reveal his destination, but it was a clear
signal that he expected a definitive response from Vaughn.
Wednesday Duquette said he met twice with Vaughn's agents, Tom
Reich and Mark Gillam, and as he left for dinner with the Red Sox
contingent attending meetings here, he said he expected to have
further contact Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about at that point where we're going to find out if
there's a deal,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Sox ``were making progress on some issues important
to Mo Vaughn.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated that the Sox do not place no-trade provisions in
their contracts but questioned why that should be a deal-breaker
for Vaughn. He referred to the provision in baseball's Basic
Agreement that stipulates a player with 10 years of big league
service and at least five years with the same team has veto power
over any trade.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn will attain 10-5 status in another three seasons, he
noted. ``To me, it's not a big issue,'' Duquette said. ``If Mo
Vaughn wants to stay in Boston, he will be in charge of his career
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' original offer, averaging $12 million a year, is
equal in annual value to the original proposal made to Vaughn by
the Angels, who were said to be willing to increase their offer if
it would expedite Vaughn's signing. For the moment, those are the
only two deals on the table for Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was asked if the Red Sox might offer a sixth year as a
club option, meaning the team would have the right to decide
whether to exercise the option for an extra year or give Vaughn a
sizable buyout if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Structuring the contract in such a way would give the Red Sox
protection in the event Vaughn's skills eroded by the end of the
deal, while Vaughn would be assured of receiving at least some
compensation for not taking the guaranteed six years offered by
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette did not answer the question directly, saying only that
some ``challenges'' remained to closing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, the Red Sox made a minor deal with Arizona
for righthanded pitcher Bob Wolcott, who made a brief splash three
years ago when he was a surprise Game 1 starter for Seattle in the
1995 American League Championship Series against Cleveland. Wolcott
won that game, but his career has spiraled downward since.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took him in the second round of the expansion
draft last year, but Wolcott was unable to hold a spot in their
rotation, going 1-3 with a 7.09 ERA in six starts. Duquette said
the 25-year-old sinkerballer pitched well against the Sox, with a
career record of 4-1 and a 4.34 ERA, but even those numbers are
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two appearances against the Sox, Wolcott gave up 17
hits and 10 runs in just 8 2/3 innings. The Sox reportedly will
give up a pitcher from the lower minors in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also officially lost lefthanded reliever Greg Swindell,
who signed a three-year contract for $5.7 million with Arizona. The
Red Sox had offered Swindell a two-year extension during the
season, but he turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As a Class A free agent, Swindell, who cost the Sox three minor
leaguers in a trading deadline deal with Minnesota in July, will
net them an additional first-round sandwich pick as well as a
second-round choice in compensation.

RIVALS MEET 1 LAST TIME IN COLLEGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since they were the country's most coveted high school
quarterbacks, Brock Huard and Cade McNown have impacted each
other's lives in curious ways.
</P>
<P>
   The two square off in Husky Stadium on Saturday, and McNown's
8-0 UCLA Bruins can clinch a Rose Bowl berth with the victory.
Huard's 5-4 Washington Huskies are simply trying to salvage their
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny twist of fate,'' Huard said.
</P>
<P>
   When the two were looking at colleges, McNown waited for Huard's
decision. If Huard had decided to attend UCLA, McNown would have
opted for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both have ridden the roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins visited the Huskies two years ago and lost,
41-21, McNown met Huard on the field after the game and bemoaned
his fortune. UCLA was in the midst of a 5-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really complaining about the play-calling and coming up
here and not having the weapons and (saying), `You have Corey
Dillon running the ball and all you do is play-action pass,' ''
Huard recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The two could face off in the NFL one day. Huard, a junior who
sat out one year as a redshirt, is expected to leave early and join
senior McNown in the draft. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Around the Pac &QL; 
 &QL; 
Huard's frustrations this season were evident Saturday to
television viewers, who saw the quarterback bark at his receivers
after drops and interceptions during a 27-22 loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the usually poised Huard actually chased Andre
DeSaussure down the field.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized to teammates the next day and later told the media
he still has confidence in his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too pleased with my vocal swearing on TV by any
means,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heart-breaking ending for Andrae Holland, out of Peoria
High School, who was an unlikely goat in Oregon State's 41-34 loss
to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, because Holland is the Beavers' single-season and
career leader for passes broken up. His 15 this season leads the
Pac-10 and he also has 40 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Holland took the bait on the Bruins' final play of the game and
opted not to go deep on pass coverage. He could only watch as
UCLA's Brad Melsby took McNown's pass for the game-winning 61-yard
scoring play with 21 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, whose reputation around the conference is that of a
class act, bravely met reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the game,'' he repeated several times, his hands over
his face. ``I blew the coverage. I was supposed to be deep and I
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Melsby was not even the primary receiver on the play, ``but when
the corner bit on the 20-yard route, Cade made a great play,'' UCLA
Coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo let it be known this week that he's not thrilled by the
recent efforts of first-year defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti and
other assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' struggles on defense came to a head during at Oregon
State. They allowed 34 points and 491 yards to a team that went in
averaging 23.1 and 345.9, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to realize that I'm not pleased with them as
well,'' Toledo said. ``And I've told them. I'm not saying anything
I haven't told them. I think we need to do a better coaching job.
It's easy to continue to blame it on the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Ken Simonton has one game and 129 yards to go
to be the first Oregon State player in nearly three decades to rush
for 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Three Pac-10 defensive backs are among 10 semifinalists for the
Jim Thorpe Award: Arizona's Chris McAlister, UCLA's Larry Atkins
and Southern California's Daylon McCutcheon. &QL;

THE RACE IS ON FOR AWARD GIVERS AND AWARD GETTERS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Helen Dudar writes about the arts for Smithsonian magazine. 
 By HELEN DUDAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As every devout moviegoer knows, we are now approaching the
season of excess. These final weeks of the year occasion a tidal
wave of new pictures, followed soon after by an avalanche of
awards. We're not just talking Oscars here.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar, of course, is the royal prince of prizes. Before that
epic March 21 event seizes the world's attention, those who find
eternal pleasure in any awards ceremony can look forward to Golden
Globes and Golden Apples and Golden Satellites and Golden Popcorn
Buckets, to name a few of the honors awaiting the women and men
judged the most deserving talents of the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the reasons for the surge of important releases right
now are wreathed in dollar signs. For one thing, the industry
always expects big audiences during the year-end holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   No less important, the people who bestow awards _ critics,
industry folk, academics, special interest groups and just plain
fans _ are thought likelier to remember a blockbuster they saw last
month than a first-rate movie screened in April.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, prizes are comforting ego-boosters for the creative
men and women involved in film. Prizes also lend a sense of purpose
and perhaps even power to the people who bestow them. More
practically, they encourage spending: lines of people dropping
large bills at the box office because they have heard that
somewhere a collection of experts thought the title on the marquee
merited special praise.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and oldest, of the prize-givers, to be heard from
next month, is the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.
Born in 1909, the board began as an anticensorship group after the
mayor of New York, an otherwise unmemorable chap named George
McClennan, revoked moving-picture exhibition licenses for Christmas
Eve 1908. Mayor McClennan was convinced that the new medium
corrupted community morals, a complaint that has, from time to
time, been heard since.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Review has been handing out awards since 1929, and
it attracts a parade of celebrities to its ceremony at the Tavern
on the Green in February. Still, mentioning the Board of Review to
members of almost any other awards group may elicit the same
response: Who are they?
</P>
<P>
   You might say they are an elite, rather quiet, extremely serious
fan club numbering about 75. Lois Ballon, who runs the group while
disdaining a title, reports that the membership includes film
students, retired film professionals, retired teachers and writers
and editors. ``We're not out to be critics,'' Ms. Ballon says.
``We're out to appreciate film.''
</P>
<P>
   They get to appreciate film at least 30 times a month and often,
after a screening, are honored with a visit and a talk with the
director. Their awards, which once bore the name of the film
pioneer D.W. Griffith, now certify the significance of the givers.
They are simply National Board of Review awards.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the National Board prizes come the laurels conferred
by the New York Film Critics Circle. This is a collection of 31
newspaper and magazine reviewers (no room here for television
critics with their brief, chatty notices) who were described by a
Los Angeles journalist a few years back as ``venerable but
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Circle has been around since 1935. Predictability is a more
complicated issue. One member, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that ``as a matter of pride,'' the critics, who will vote on
Dec. 16, are almost never influenced by the commercial success or
failure of a film. ``We're New York, not L.A.,'' the member said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the group may sometimes be driven by what
another member calls ``think-alike Manhattan elitism,'' which can
yield interesting compromises. In the voting last year for best
picture, one bloc lined up behind ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' an
adaptation of the melancholy Russell Banks novel, while another
group wanted ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither favorite won; the compromise vote, as always
by secret ballot, went to ``L.A. Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mathews, a Newsday critic who has held membership in the
critics organizations on both sides of the continent, fondly
recalls the Los Angeles Film Critics Association as ``a ragtag
bunch'' that allots votes not only to television critics but also
to people no longer reviewing at all.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the New York system, the Los Angeles voting, on
Dec. 12, is open and discussion is passionate. But Mathews says
that ``despite all the huffing and puffing New York critics do
about the low caliber of L.A. critics, their awards aren't that
different.'' Except when they are.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the West Coast critics also crowned ``L.A.
Confidential'' as last year's best. But their fame _ or infamy _
rests on an incident in 1985, a coup engineered by Mathews in which
they honored an unreleased movie.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Universal was sitting on a quirky futuristic film,
``Brazil,'' which Mathews greatly admired. Not long before voting
day, Mathews organized screenings for the Los Angeles critics,
creating a swell of energy that he described as
``let's-do-something-important.''
</P>
<P>
   The group stunned the industry _ and forced the movie's release
_ by showering ``Brazil'' with awards for best movie, best
direction and best screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The other major critics group is the National Society of Film
Critics, which announces its selections on Jan. 3. The society's
original members bolted from the New York Circle in 1966, grousing
that its choices were too conventional. Perhaps the most noteworthy
thing about the National Society today is its deeply resented
membership policy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to several critics, the group has a history of
inviting applications and then rejecting the applicants. Mathews
will not even consider applying. ``I just do not believe that as a
professional I need to submit clips, like I'm trying to join a car
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Golden Globes, tributes from the more than
80-odd members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, to be
delivered on Jan. 24 at the Beverly Hills Hilton Hotel. Once these
prizes were suspect items, cynically regarded as favors to studios
that had been generous with press junkets and sumptuous restaurant
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a few years of prime-time television coverage of the
glittering ceremonies, they have not only acquired a kind of
respectability but a reputation as fairly reliable predictions of
the Oscars. Moreover, for at least some addicts of these rituals,
the relaxed dining room setting of the event seems livelier and
more appealing than Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, dissatisfaction lingers. There have always been
complaints that a substantial number of Hollywood Foreign Press
Association members are part-time journalists or not in the trade
at all. (For years, a running gag had it that on the night of the
Globes, you could not find a good waiter anywhere in Hollywood.)
</P>
<P>
   For this and other reasons, a former HFPA member started a rival
group, in 1996. It is the International Press Academy, and it will
announce its third set of Golden Satellites in mid-December. Its
founders dream that in the great ``Star Wars'' tradition, the
Satellites will some day vanquish the Globes.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, of course, will overtake the evening when the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences sanctifies labors in 25
categories. Five thousand members vote in the nominating process,
and there is always controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar Snubs High and Mighty,'' a Los Angeles Times headline
reported last year. The highly praised ``As Good as It Gets,'' and
``Amistad'' had failed to make the list of best picture nominees,
and Leonardo DiCaprio had to do without a best actor nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There are often surprises. In 1997, the year independents
flooded the box office, ``The English Patient'' gathered many
nominations and a near-record 9 awards. Until ``Titanic'' tied the
record with 11 statuettes, ``Ben-Hur'' (1959) was the all-time
winner. It would be impolite to ask how many people today think of
``Ben-Hur'' as a memorable film.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more. Indeed, it might be said that there are more
kinds of awards in the film industry than any art form could want
or need. The following list is by no means complete.
</P>
<P>
   _ Directors Guild of America Award, for best director.
</P>
<P>
   _ People's Choice Awards, determined by nationwide Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   _ Independent Spirit Awards for low-budget original films, voted
by the 8,500-member Independent Feature Project.
</P>
<P>
   _ Screenwriters Guild of America awards for, among other things,
best original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Writers Guild of America, for original and adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Screen Actors Guild award, an eight-pound bronze human figure
holding the masks of comedy and tragedy, for memorable
performances.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Comedy Awards, for both movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   _ NAACP Image Awards, for the accomplishments of black artists
in movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eddies, the American Cinema Editors award for best editing in
film and television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gavel Awards, from the American Bar Association, for worthy
portrayals of the legal profession in film and other mediums.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golden Apple, from the Hollywood Women's Press Club, for the
male and female stars of the year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golden Popcorn Bucket, a fairly recent award voted by viewers
of MTV, paying homage to such milestones as Best Kiss, Best Fight
and Best Villain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golden Raspberry, also known as the Razzies, for the year's
worst achievements in film; voted by several hundred people said to
be industry insiders and students.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sad to say, no one is yet offering an award for the Best
Award. Or for the Worst.

TAHOE'S MACKINAW A MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; CARNELIAN BAY, Calif. _ The fact that lake trout, or mackinaw,
survive at all in nutrient-poor Lake Tahoe is remarkable enough.
But that they live to be so old and fat has biologists baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense,'' said Russ Wickwire, a Department of
Fish and Game associate fish biologist in Fresno. ``Most trout live
in nutrient-rich water, where they grow so fast they burn out. At
Tahoe, it's just the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake is sterile because it's so pure; there is not a lot
of food. But the lake trout grow so much slower and longer and
bigger. Maybe it's the cold water. Genetics have probably changed
over the years. It's an anomaly.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently a frigid bath is nature's preservative.
</P>
<P>
   Most trout don't see their 10th birthday. Tahoe's mackinaw _
Salvelinus namaycush _ can live 40 years or longer. An 18-pound
mack was aged at 23 years. The state-record 37.6-pounder caught in
1974 was surely plucked from its rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the oldest granddaddy of the lake was beckoning us early
on a recent overcast Wednesday when our party of six boarded the
Big Mack II, a 43-foot charter boat out of Carnelian Bay skippered
by mackinaw guru Mickey Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number-one priority is to keep from getting the lines
tangled and number two is to catch fish. In that order, all the
time,'' Daniels warned as he set up six 10-pound monofilament
trolling lines with Rapala lures off Crystal Bay Point. ``And if
you do catch a mackinaw, watch out: They'll pull the boat
backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, one of Daniels' clients boated a 44-inch,
28-pound mackinaw after an 80-minute battle. His own top catch is a
30-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   Imported from Michigan's Great Lakes in 1896 as a sporting
alternative to Tahoe's native Lahontan cutthroat trout, the
mackinaw _ properly a char, not a true trout _ appears to have
outcompeted its brethren and might have contributed to a major
cutthroat die-off early this century by introducing disease.
</P>
<P>
   I had caught two 9{-pound mackinaw _ personal bests for trout;
10 pounds is considered trophy size _ during trips with Daniels in
the late 1980s while I was living and working in nearby Incline
Village, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   But this outing was not likely to yield such dimensions, since
the largest fish _ Tahoe's mackinaw reach maturity at age 7 and 24
inches _ spawn from September to November and slow their intake
down or stop eating altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Fond of the cooler waters in deep lakes, the mack feel right at
home at Tahoe, where depths have been measured to 1,645 feet. They
are frequently caught trolling with wire line in 60 to 600 feet of
water on lures and live minnows. But a stiff breeze kept the
captain from targeting midlake depths. ``It's harder to fish for
mackinaw in the wind; you have to go faster to keep from going
sideways,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second strike against us in our bid to land mackinaw.
</P>
<P>
   We took the news in stride as our guide suggested targeting the
lake's population of rainbow trout that hugs the nearshore at 20 to
60 feet of water and bite best in fall. Besides, with mackinaw
constituting 70 percent of Tahoe's game fish _ rainbow (10
percent), brown trout (5 percent) and landlocked kokanee salmon (15
percent) make up the remainder _ a few were bound to be found at
line's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are little fish on the surface,'' said Daniels, a
staunch advocate of catch and release who fishes 200 days a year
and claims to have tagged 5,000 mackinaw in 30 years of guiding.
</P>
<P>
   It proved a foreshadowing, as I reeled in the first mack _ an
18-incher _ after four rainbows were boated. Two more lake trout _
the largest 19{ inches _ would add to the barbecue fare for dinner.
The fish with the prominent white spots, deeply forked tail and
large eyes _ all the better to see at the lake's darkest reaches _
is as tasty as it is beautiful. Its pink, oily flesh is similar to
that of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-hour tour, we hooked more than two dozen trout,
landed 15 and kept six, including three 'bows to 17 inches. The
rest were released, most notably three tagged lake trout.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels charts the length of the fish before pinning it with a
tag that notes his phone number. When anglers phone, he asks for
the size of the fish, determines its growth rate and dishes the
data off to biologists; perhaps it will someday help unravel the
mystery of Lake Tahoe's mackinaw.

   INTERNET-MUSIC (Undated) _ A specter is haunting the music
business: the prospect of listeners getting the music they want
directly from the Internet, free of charge. Right now, all it takes
to make a recording executive nervous is the mention of MP3, a
powerful piece of software that allows users to zap music all over
the Internet, unchecked and untithed. For utopians, MP3 is a way to
liberate music from the clutches of gatekeepers and profiteers, and
perhaps to return music to its intangible essence. But the
recording business sees MP3 as a Pandora's box of copyright
destruction, unleashing anarchy and piracy while robbing musicians
of royalties and record labels of capital. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).

   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH-FIENNES-FILMS (London) _ Ralph Fiennes devotees will
recall that the 1992 television film, ``A Dangerous Man: Lawrence
After Arabia,'' more or less introduced the actor to the United
States. It's unlikely, however, that viewers also caught the
fleeting presence of a younger Fiennes, Joseph, playing Ralph's
onscreen brother. Six years, and many more substantial parts later,
Joseph Fiennes 28, is emerging as a name to reckon with on his own.
His role next month as Gwyneth Paltrow's Bardic suitor in
``Shakespeare in Love'' is expected to clinch him as a separate but
equal talent to that of his Tony-winning, Oscar-nominated brother.
By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ZAILLIAN-SCREENWRITER (Hollywood) _ Ask a studio mogul, top
producer or agent for the names of the superior screenwriters in
Hollywood, and Steven Zaillian will be near the top of the list.
``He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in town, and I'm
being liberal when I say that,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt
Disney Studios, which made ``A Civil Action,'' the newest film
written and directed by Zaillian. ``There's an economy and clarity
to his writing that's always entertaining.'' Zaillian, who won an
Academy Award for his adaptation of ``Schindler's List,'' is a
surprisingly diffident, almost modest and entirely un-Hollywood
figure. In contrast to other screenwriters, who may earn lavish
sums but complain all the way to the bank about their plight at the
hands of producers, stars and executives, Zaillian, 45, shrugs off
any problems he has faced over his 18-year career. By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STUDIOS-HOLLYWOOD-FILMS (Hollywood) _ The holiday season is a
scary time in Hollywood. The season that begins just before
Thanksgiving and ends with the New Year is the busiest time of
moviegoing in the nation. It's also when studios and independent
companies roll the dice and release films whose box office tally
can spell the difference between success or failure for the year.
(The nearly 100 films released over the next six weeks will account
for as much as 20 percent of the 1998 box office). By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HOME-VIDEO-THEATER (Undated) _ Hardcore videophiles are a
suffering lot. Determined to re-create in their homes an experience
akin to that of the local movie theater _ minus the sticky floor
and ringing cell phones _ these enthusiasts can spend $100,000 or
more pursuing cutting-edge equipment that promises to deliver the
nuance and impact of celluloid. They log endless hours on the World
Wide Web debating the merits of the latest wide-screen projector or
surround-sound processor, and they pay technicians hundreds of
dollars to calibrate their televisions so the image is just so. By
Rob Sabin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FLEMING-FILMS (Undated) _ In 1938, the director Victor Fleming
made a movie about a Kansas farm girl who gets swept into the air
and enters a dizzying world of excitement and heartbreak. It was
called ``Test Pilot,'' it starred Myrna Loy, Clark Gable and
Spencer Tracy, and it was an enormous hit. Later that year, he took
over a troubled production about another Kansas farm girl who gets
swept into the air and enters a dizzying world of excitement and
heartbreak. It was called ``The Wizard of Oz,'' it starred Judy
Garland, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr, and it failed to recoup its
costs. Fleming's career is a study in the vagaries of movie
history. By Michael Sragow. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-FAMILY-FILMS (Hollywood) _ Like children elbowing one
another for their parents' attention, Hollywood studios are vying
for the holiday box office. The number of films targeting family
audiences has set off the most intense competition among studios in
years. The first wave _ two animated films, ``The Rugrats Movie''
and ``A Bug's Life,'' and the sequel ``Babe: Pig in the City'' _
will open around Thanksgiving. Even seasoned Hollywood veterans are
bracing for the worst. By Anita M. Busch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ROMANCE-FILMS (Undated) _ People are falling in love
with strangers across a crowded chat room, and e-mail has woven
itself into the fabric of our day-to-day lives, an adult equivalent
of passing notes in grade school. ``You've Got Mail,'' the new
romantic comedy opening on Dec. 18 from Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and
Nora Ephron, the trio who made ``Sleepless in Seattle,''
close-focuses its camera on the care and feeding of an e-mail
romance. By Erika Milvy. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LAST-SUMMER-SEQUELS (Undated) _ Last year's teen slasher smash,
``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' proved that each generation of
adolescents is new to the genre's creaky conventions. The formula
calls for invincible, barely visible villains (Jason of ``Friday
the 13th,'' Michael Myers of ``Halloween,'' Freddy Krueger of
``Nightmare on Elm Street'') shrouded in malevolent headgear
(goalie mask, Halloween mask, felt brim fedora) and wielding sharp,
shiny implements (hunting knife, carving knife, razorlike Lee
press-on nails). The most important convention is the sequel, the
ceaseless serializing of serial killing. ``Friday,'' ``Halloween''
and ``Nightmare'' have spawned 20 unholy offspring. And last week,
the inevitable first sequel to ``Summer'' opened. By Franz Lidz.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JANSSEN-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Faculty,'' which opens on
Christmas Day, Famke Janssen plays a timid, bespectacled high
school teacher, a woman whose voice quavers when she urges a
promising but wayward student to apply himself. Since the movie is
a thriller directed by Robert Rodriguez (``Desperado'') and written
by Kevin Williamson (``Scream''), it is safe to expect that the shy
educator will undergo a radical shift in personality and appearance
before the final reel. By Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INTERMEDIA-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ When ``Playing by Heart'' opens
on Dec. 18, audiences are meant to exit the theaters drying their
eyes. Here, after all, is a multi-generational, multi-character
drama depicting numerous love stories in various stages of peril.
But Hollywood will be keeping its eyes wide open. The film, which
managed to entice actors like Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Dennis
Quaid, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillipe, Madeleine Stowe, Anthony
Edwards and Gillian Anderson for $50,000 apiece, a fraction of
their usual fees, may represent something vaguely threatening to
studios yet potentially exciting for moviegoers: the
mini-mainstream movie. By Michele Willens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-AWARDS (Undated) _ As every devout moviegoer knows, we
are now approaching the season of excess. These final weeks of the
year occasion a tidal wave of new pictures, followed soon after by
an avalanche of awards. We're not just talking Oscars here. Oscar,
of course, is the royal prince of prizes. Before that epic March 21
event seizes the world's attention, those who find eternal pleasure
in any awards ceremony can look forward to Golden Globes and Golden
Apples and Golden Satellites and Golden Popcorn Buckets, to name a
few of the honors awaiting the women and men judged the most
deserving talents of the big screen. By Helen Dudar. (Moved).

   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   SPIRITUAL-DANCES (Undated) _ This week, in theaters a few blocks
apart in Brooklyn, N.Y., two programs will address and seek to
incorporate and represent the spirit. The dance in those programs
is worlds apart in time, history and geography. The Madras-based
Chandralekha, whose new full-evening ``Raga: In Search of
Femininity'' is to open on Wednesday for four performances at the
Majestic Theater, presented by the Next Wave Festival of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, comes from the East and a culture that
at least by Western standards is permeated with the spiritual. The
three choreographers whose work will be shown in ``Dance and
Spiritual Life,'' the second event, are a part of a long, though
largely unacknowledged, tradition in American modern dance.
Unusually, attention will be paid to the potential of dance to
connect the spirit and the body in the one-performance program on
Saturday, which features choreography by Dianne McIntyre, Bebe
Miller and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, three black choreographers who
have been prominent on the American modern-dance landscape during
the last several decades. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).

<P>
   DEROSA-THEATER (New York) _ Six weeks after the revival of
``Irma Vep'' opened to gushing reviews and packed houses, Stephen
DeRosa is still adjusting ``to life in the theah-tah,'' he said,
with an Olivia De Havilland flourish. He already has a budding fan
club _ well, mostly retired teachers from his days at P.S. 193 in
Whitestone, Queens. And even though his performance thrusts him
into four disguises, strangers do occasionally recognize him on the
street. ``It must be the nose,'' said DeRosa, a slight, shamelessly
self-deprecating 30-year-old with thinning hair and basset-brown
eyes who seems to take great pleasure in talking about
psychotherapy, his mollycoddling mother and ``the dark years'' he
spent as an underemployed actor. By Andrew Jacobs. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-ARIAS (Undated) _ Arias from American operas, however,
have not found much of a home on record. Until recently, in fact,
American operas themselves have largely been ignored. Now the
release of two CDs by the sopranos Dawn Upshaw and Renee Fleming
suggests that the tide may be turning. The two albums, Ms. Upshaw's
``World So Wide'' (Nonesuch 79458-2) and Ms. Fleming's ``I Want
Magic'' (London 289 460 567-2), concentrate on repertory that most
listeners will find unfamiliar, though several of the composers _
Gershwin, Copland, Barber and Bernstein among them _ are household
names. By David Mermelstein. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-VERSIONS (Undated) _ The profound and the worthy can be
tiring, and there is nothing like a little smallness to ease our
passage from one Bach B minor Mass to the next Elliott Carter
Double Concerto. Weakness of this sort applies also to the
performances we like: ones that we know are ``wrong'' but that are
irresistible nonetheless. Stokowski's Bach, jacked up for 100
musicians, makes the musicologist's hair curl but makes mine stand
on end. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   LENNON-IMAGE (Undated) _ At a glance, the just released four-CD
``John Lennon Anthology'' looks very much like an ambitious
collectors' trawl. Lavishly packaged and copiously annotated, this
``Anthology'' (Capitol) brims with studio outtakes, concert
performances, private composing tapes and assorted spoken bits _ 94
selections in all. But satisfying the quasi-musicological
obsessions of collectors is not the primary purpose of this set.
``Anthology,'' compiled by Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, is less a
freestanding record release than an installment in a continuing
multimedia biography. It joins a mountain of CDs, videotapes,
material for film documentaries and radio series, picture books,
collections of Lennon's writings and art works _ that Ms. Ono has
released, overseen or sanctioned since Lennon was murdered on Dec.
8, 1980. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved).

<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBITION-BOW (Philadelphia) _ In the doorway of the room that
houses ``The Letter Writing Project,'' a graceful, meditative
installation by the 34-year-old Taiwan-born artist Lee Mingwei, you
duck under a noren curtain. The noren _ a common feature in
Japanese architecture _ is a translucent white scrim that lowers
the height of the doorway by about a foot. Your head nods, your
back bends, and suddenly you are bowing. Westerners don't expect to
bow at an exhibition. But throughout Buddhist Asia, bowing is more
than common courtesy. It signifies acceptance of the way of the
universe: the importance of setting aside ego, of acknowledging the
web that unites all beings, and of expressing gratitude for this
miraculous gift of life. Bowing, it turns out, is integral to Lee's
exhibition, on view here at the Fabric Workshop and Museum through
Saturday. By Kay Larson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMPHITHEATER-ARCH (Camden, Maine) _ Between 1929 and 1931,
Fletcher Steele, one of this country's most brilliant landscape
architects, designed the Bok Amphitheater here and the library
grounds; at the same time, Olmsted Brothers, the firm headed by the
son and stepson of Frederick Law Olmsted, laid out the harbor park.
Together, these are recognized as one of the great achievements of
landscape architecture in America. After 70 years, they badly need
restoration, but the story of the efforts to preserve them is a
comedy of errors, an object lesson in how such a project can go
wrong. By Deborah Weisgall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-TV (London) _ Some of the most memorable characters to
emerge from Britain's latest television fad, fly-on-the-wall
documentaries that profess to show the unvarnished truth about
various institutions, from health spas to veterinarians' offices to
supermarkets. Their quality varies widely, but the shows seem to
have so captured a public mood that at times they can draw as many
as 10 million viewers, or about half the national viewing audience
on a given night. By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   ALICE-WONDERLAND-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For years, Justin G.
Schiller, a New York dealer in children's books, was certain that
he knew most everything about the publishing history of ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' The story had intrigued him since childhood, and so
in 1960 when he became a bookseller while still in high school, he
began buying and selling early printings of the book. In 1980, he
bought a rare copy of the first edition of ``Alice,'' printed in
1865 by Clarendon Press at Oxford University, an edition that had
been suppressed when Carroll, the pseudonym used by Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson, and John Tenniel, the illustrator, found
imperfections in the printing. He had been willing to pay $200,000
_ his entire savings _ for the book, but he was luckily able to buy
it at an auction in Paris for $56,000. Of the original 48 copies of
the first edition, 23 survive, 16 of them in libraries. But none of
the other copies is as distinctive as the one Schiller bought: it
includes 10 of the work's original pencil drawings by Tenniel, each
of which is signed with his monogram. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

 &HT;    M.E.D.I.C.O. heads up Honduras relief efforts
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc

<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ The tables in the old cafeteria at
Southwestern University are hardly crowded now, but Mandy
Cleavinger wants to stack them high with boxes of food, clothing
and medicine for the victims of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we're bombarded,'' said Cleavinger, a 20-year-old
junior who is helping lead a student effort to assist people in
Honduras hit by the devastating October storm. ``If we're
bombarded, we can find people to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The students are part of a much larger relief effort, headed by
Georgetown-based Medical, Eye &AMP; Dental International Care
Organization Inc., or M.E.D.I.C.O., an independent non-profit
organization that since 1990 has sent medical supplies and teams of
doctors from around the country to rural Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is leading a Central Texas drive to collect donations
for the victims of the hurricane, which killed an estimated 10,000
people. Next week a DC3 aircraft loaded with up to 6,000 pounds of
goods gathered by M.E.D.I.C.O. is expected to depart Georgetown on
its way to San Pedro Sula, Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Donations of all types are needed, from clothing, food and
medicine to bottled water, paper goods, blankets, insect repellent,
soap and money. As supplies arrive, students will sort, package,
label and weigh them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best description we've had was called in Friday,'' said
Norm Peters, co-founder of M.E.D.I.C.O. ``There are 400 children in
one refuge center without homes and more importantly without
parents. We'll lose a third of them within two weeks because of
lack of water and milk. . .Picture the Jarrell tornado and multiply
that by hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   Packages of diapers, cartons of old shirts and sacks of rice and
beans are trickling into the old Commons Building at Southwestern,
which was vacated last month when the university opened its new
student center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space, M.E.D.I.C.O. needed space. We have manpower,
M.E.D.I.C.O. needed manpower,'' said Ken Roberts, a professor of
economics and business at Southwestern who set up the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch formed as a storm on Oct. 22 and hit Central America with
hurricane winds three days later, causing massive floods and deadly
mudslides across Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
Since then, governments and aid organizations from around the world
have promised hundreds of millions of dollars in relief, ranging
from bags of beans to forgiveness of millions in foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, several groups, including the American Red Cross,
Salvation Army Disaster Relief, Catholic Charities, Honduran Unity
and El Buen Samaritano Episcopal Mission are collecting money and
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   M.E.D.I.C.O. board member Sandra Romero de Thompson of Austin,
whose family lives in Honduras, said the agency has been flooded
with phone calls and e-mails from people around the country who
want to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help is going to be needed immediately and for many years to
come,'' she said. ``Just because the hurricane has left doesn't
mean the need isn't going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said Mitch set back Honduras at least 50 years.
Dozens of roads and bridges were wiped out and hundreds of
thousands of people are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to send teams down as we pull them
together,'' Peters said. ``We will do as much as we can afford to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   M.E.D.I.C.O. plans to send four doctors to Honduras next week,
and a boatload of supplies later this month. The agency works
directly with non-profit organizations in Honduras, including Save
the Children and the Lions Club.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwestern, collections will continue at the Commons
Building until Wednesday. The site is open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts thinks the volunteers will get something out of the
experience. He said, ``It makes students realize that part of the
meaning of life is to help others.''

 &HT;    Students begin to examine results from space shuttle experiment
By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ The only sound in Robert McLean's lab here
at Southwest Texas State University was the clicking of a
mechanical counter.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Texas primary and middle school students, so awestruck
that they spoke in whispers when they spoke at all, were making
history this week _ taking turns helping McLean, a professor of
biology, tally bacterial colonies grown last week aboard the space
shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   It was much more than show-and-tell, or even what the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration originally had intended:
simply a way to encourage young kids to consider science careers by
getting them involved in a space experiment.
</P>
<P>
   It had turned out that the students were helping hand NASA a
potential showstopper for interplanetary travel the first
scientific confirmation that bacterial biofilms, a
little-understood, multimillion-dollar problem on the ground, also
can occur in an orbiting shuttle's cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The slimy biofilms that clog water purification systems and
other industrial processes on Earth could jeopardize lengthy trips
to Mars, if a solution isn't found, by clogging water recycling
systems used for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only ones on Earth right now who know that biofilms
can form in space,'' McLean told the students from Travis Middle
School in Port Lavaca on the Gulf coast, and Scudder Primary School
and Bowen Intermediate School in Wimberley. ``That's the fun of
science.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean, a biofilm expert who volunteered the experiment when
NASA came looking for a way to get students involved in shuttle
research, wanted to use the shuttle's water recycling system for
the test. But NASA decided the experiment had to be flown in
equipment already approved for research.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, and his NASA co-investigator, biologist Marybeth Edeen,
hope to get a crack at the recycling system on a future flight.
</P>
<P>
   As the counting continued in McLean's lab, discovering hundreds
of bacteria colonies growing in each of more than 40 round, plastic
petri dishes flown aboard the Discovery with space hero John Glenn,
McLean was considering what he and Edeen have to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of them is tedious hours of counting, recounting and
measuring the bacteria, which would normally be carried aboard
spacecraft on crew bodies and equipment, to see if anything unusual
occurred in their growth in microgravity.
</P>
<P>
   McLean and other biofilm investigators long ago discovered that
the phenomena -- called plaque by dentists when the living films
form on teeth and cause cavities -- are made by slow-growing
communities and microcolonies of ordinary bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   So tenaciously do the colonies attach themselves to the surfaces
of things that, as any diligent toothbrusher knows, they are very
hard to dislodge.
</P>
<P>
   Putting one of the colonies on a glass slide under a microscope
attached to a desktop computer, McLean showed the students how the
colony looked when it was colored with a special stain to reveal
living (green) and dead (red) parts, and rotated in three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks real slimy,'' said Justin Franke, 13, from Port
Lavaca. Like the other Travis Middle School students, he wore a
black knit shirt with the words ``Slimy Biohunters'' on the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slime is a pretty accurate description,'' McLean said. ``But
you can't just rinse them off. Even a brush can't always get at
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the computer's video screen, the single bacterial colony,
grown during eight days of orbit around the Earth, looked like a
lumpy green cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notice how the bacteria don't cover all the area,'' McLean
said. ``But they look completely normal. The whole thing is 30
microns thick. Each bacteria is about a micrometer long.''
</P>
<P>
   A micron, or a micrometer, is one millionth of a meter, which is
39.37 inches.
</P>
<P>
   A possible solution to NASA's biofilm problem, McLean said,
could be similar to one already used on the ground -- applying air
pressure of thousands of pounds per square to a spacecraft's water
recycling systems to blow the slime off the systems' filters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what some people do now with water purification,''
McLean said.

 &HT;    Record sales in 1998 for Whole Foods
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Whole Foods Market Inc. on Wednesday reported
record sales and earnings for fiscal 1998 _ the same day the
company's stock hit a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all standards of financial performance, fiscal year 1998
has been the greatest year in our company's history,'' said John
Mackey, Whole Foods chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods, based in Austin, reported profit of $45.4 million,
$1.64 per share, a 70 percent increase from the previous year. The
profit was slightly higher than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company's fourth-quarter profit was $11.1 million, up 116
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Results were released after the market closed Wednesday. Whole
Foods shares closed down $1.68 3/4 to $33.25 _ a 52-week low. More
than 3.3 million shares changed hands in heavier-than-normal Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods reported annual sales of $1.39 billion, up 24
percent from a year ago. Fourth-quarter sales rose 21 percent to
$326.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable-store sales _ one of the best indicators of a
company's financial health _ were up 11 percent for the year and
8.5 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing company _ the nation's largest chain of natural
foods supermarkets _ grew from 75 to 87 stores over the past year.
Leases have been signed for 10 new stores in such markets as
Winston-Salem, N.C., Baltimore, Md. and Minneapolis, Minn. The
company is currently developing 29 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors are to be believed. The Nov. 16 issue of Business
Week quoted an analyst who said Whole Foods may be interested in
buying chief rival Wild Oats Markets Inc., which has 60 stores,
``for practical business considerations.'' Whole Foods has not
commented.
</P>
<P>
   Despite upbeat earnings over the past year and merger
speculation, Whole Foods stock has slid downward since hitting a
52-week high of $70.12 1/2 on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods' shares have been affected by a market that has been
inhospitable to companies in the ``healthy living sector.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Whole Foods released its third-quarter earnings the
night before the stock market sell-off that resulted in the Dow
Jones industrial average's third-biggest point decline ever. It was
the same day that another industry giant, General Nutrition Cos.
(GNC), released its quarterly earnings and said it would slash
prices to fend off rising competition.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods stock plummeted more than $11 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dietary supplement companies have been hit particularly hard,
and Whole Foods is being dragged down with them,'' said Steve
Hoffman, publisher of Natural Business, a Boulder-based trade
publication that tracks the natural foods industry.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Natural Business Composite Index'' _ which follows 70
publicly held companies in the natural and organic products
industry _ has fallen 31 percent this year. Just four months ago,
it was up 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also has responded to the announcement last month
that Whole Food President Peter Roy would resign at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago (Whole Foods was) the darling of Wall Street,''
Hoffman said. ``Now, the industry is trying to emerge from a bear
market. Of all these companies, Whole Foods is one of the most
solid.''

GROWTH OF WORK SLOWS IN HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County's entertainment industry has
slowed dramatically this year with job growth at its lowest level
since the 1992 recession, a forecaster says.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of production to Canada, a slowdown in big-budget feature
films and the threat of an actors' strike earlier this year were
the chief culprits, according to the Economic Development Corp. of
Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   That means 2,600 new motion picture and television jobs will be
added by the end of the year, bringing the county's total
entertainment work force to 240,000. That's well off from the 1997
gain of 13,000 and the 94,500 jobs added in the 1993-97 period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air went out of the balloon and now we're going through a
period of adjustment,'' Jack Kyser, chief economist with the
Economic Development Corp. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens to a lot of industries when you have rapid
growth. So there's no sense of panic when you talk to people in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser believes the industry will see a moderate rebound next
year with 7,000 to 8,000 new jobs _ still far short of the gain
last year and minuscule compared with a rise of nearly 30,000
entertainment jobs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the gain ranks well above the darkest days of the early '90s
recession, culminating in a loss of more than 10,000 jobs during
1992 as producers deserted Hollywood for lower-cost locations
outside California.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is part of the EDC's semiannual forecast for
the county, comes on the heels of last week's disclosure of sharp
declines in production outside studio lots. Year-to-date off-lot
location production was off 5.6 percent for the first 10 months of
1998 after rising by 78 percent between 1994 and 1997, according to
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of sluggishness, Woodland Hills-based Panavision
Inc. reported Wednesday a third-quarter loss of $700,000 compared
with profits of $7.6 million in the 1997 period while revenues for
the movie-camera specialist slid to $50.7 million from $55.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Panavision had warned previously that results would be hurt by
softness in production of large-budget action films by major
studios.

YANKS, CONE REACH A 1-YEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Cone waited in his Connecticut home Wednesday night,
pondering his future, waiting to see whether the Yankees would
agree to his latest proposal. He had until midnight to decide
whether he would immediately work out a one-year deal with the
Yankees or opt for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just real hopeful something will get done,'' Cone said.
``I'm trying to bend over backwards to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the deadline, the bending ended.
</P>
<P>
   Cone signed a one-year deal with the Yankees for an $8 million
salary that, with incentives, might push the value of the deal to
about $9.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always made it clear that my first choice was the Yankees,''
the right-hander said in a conference call Wednesday night.
``That's where I want to be, where I want to end my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone was well aware that other teams, such as the Baltimore
Orioles, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Mets, would have been
willing to offer him contracts of either two or three years, for
about $7 million to $8 million annually. But he said he thought he
had received his ``fair market value'' in the deal with the
Yankees, for whom he has won 48 games in three and a half seasons,
including 20 this past season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might second-guess me for not testing the
free-agent waters,'' he said, ``but I'm satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying with the Yankees allows Cone, who turns 36 in January,
to remain in a stable environment in which he was comfortable, even
though staying with the Yankees also will cost Cone millions at a
point in his career when he has already made more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are also moving closer to reaching a final agreement
for 1999 with Darryl Strawberry, the outfielder who is recovering
from the effects of colon cancer. That deadline, also for midnight,
was extended to Nov. 20, the team announced Wednesday night. And
the Yankees are monitoring what teams are pursuing the free-agent
center fielder Bernie Williams _ a group that seems to be
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Cone compiled a 20-7 record for the Yankees in 1998, the most
victories on the team, and Manager Joe Torre and club officials
have deep respect for the pitcher's competitiveness and leadership;
he has been among those players who Torre has relied upon for
clubhouse stability.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman was pleased with the signing. ``We
are extremely happy to retain such a vital part of our championship
club and one of the best pitchers in baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had twice agreed to delay the deadline by which he was
supposed to reject or accept the option for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were clearly concerned about his physical
well-being. The pitcher had surgery to repair an aneurysm in 1996
and needed shoulder surgery after the 1997 season. When he pitched
poorly at the beginning of the 1998 season he had fleeting thoughts
of retiring; the Yankees were concerned when Cone said he had
trouble throwing his breaking pitches in cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   But he rebounded strongly and was dominant into late August,
before he seemed to wear down. Cone began his rehabilitation late
last year and has felt that his late-season struggles this year
were because he did not have the benefit of a full off season of
rest, and that he tried to make all his scheduled starts as he
tried to reach the 200-inning mark that gave him the 1999 contract
option.
</P>
<P>
   There is no similar provision in the new deal, Cone said,
because reaching the 200-inning mark ``became somewhat of a
distraction to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have a full accounting of Cone's condition from
their own doctors, may disagree, and they have relied heavily on
the advice of their doctors in the past. After the 1996 season, the
team's doctor, Stuart Hershon, advised the Yankees that they should
not give Jimmy Key a two-year deal, and the Yankees instead signed
David Wells to a three-year offer. Wells is a Cy Young award
candidate, Key broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the Yankees had until midnight Wednesday night to
decide to exercise the $2.5 million option on Strawberry. But they
agreed to another extension of the deadline, this one until a week
from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in Arizona Wednesday meeting with Jerry Colangelo,
chairman of the Arizona Diamondbacks, as well as with Buck
Showalter, the Diamondbacks' manager. Before the meeting, Colangelo
said he would not engage in a financial war for Williams,
contesting speculation the Diamondbacks were preparing a deal for
Williams somewhere in the neighborhood of $90 million to $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in bidding up players at this stage,''
Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies were expected
to be involved in the bidding on Williams, but they have already
signed center fielders.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not yet made an offer to Williams, but insist
they will at some point. &QL;

 &HT;    UT acquires art collection worth $35 million
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Filling a void in the regional arts scene, the
University of Texas is acquiring a one-of-kind collection of Old
Masters paintings and drawings valued at nearly $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art collection is a very big deal,'' said UT President
Larry R. Faulkner, who personally intervened to secure the
Suida-Manning Collection for UT's Blanton Museum of Art. ``This is
a great day in the cultural life of the university, the state of
Texas and the art community.''
</P>
<P>
   UT is expected to announce today it will obtain _ through gift
and purchase _ the prized collection of more than 700 artworks from
the Renaissance through the Rococo periods in Europe. Originally
assembled in Italy by art historian William Suida, the son of
Austrian textile manufacturers, the collection was later expanded
by his daughter, Bertina Suida Manning, and her husband, Robert
Manning, art historians as well.
</P>
<P>
   Born in tiny Mart, near Waco, Robert Manning, who lived most of
his life in New York and died in 1996, wanted the collection to
remain intact for display in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was of the utmost importance that it be kept together,''
said his heir, Alessandra Manning Dolnier, who arrived in Austin
Tuesday from their home in Connecticut. ``And my father wanted it
to end up in his home state.''
</P>
<P>
   To be unveiled at the Blanton in March, some of the
Suida-Manning Collection is now in storage, but other paintings
currently hang on the walls of New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art and Vassar College's Lehman Loeb Art Center in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The collection rings with the familiar names of the masters:
Rubens, Poussin, Tiepolo, Veronese, Boucher, Fragonard, Lorrain and
Correggio. It ranges from 14th-century Italian paintings to late
18th-century French drawings, with significant holdings of Italian,
French and German art. Certain Baroque masterpieces, such as
Giovanni Guercino's ``Landscape with Tobias and the Angel,'' were
actively sought by the nation's wealthiest musuems, such as the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and California's Getty Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute triumph for UT,'' said George Wachter, Old
Masters expert for Sotheby's auction house in New York. ``There is
nothing like it in private hands. There are several museums that
will be upset that they won't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas museum experts, some of whom lobbied for the collection,
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major addition to the cultural resources of the
whole region,'' said Edmund Pillsbury, former director of Fort
Worth's Kimbell Art Museum, which houses the state's best gathering
of pre-1800 paintings. ``This is the sort of collection you just
can't put together on the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did UT, with signficant holdings in prints, drawings, Latin
American and American art, but very few Old Masters, get the nod?
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that the university would be a more dynamic home for
the collection,'' said Dolnier, who trained as an art historian and
is now an interior designer. ``It is very cohesive, so it works
together beautifully in a teaching sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection does not come without more work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful opportunity, but it's also a wonderful
challenge,'' said Blanton director Jessie Otto Hite. ``We have to
get the collection here, and figure out how to store it properly,
make sure we have adequate space for it in the new building and
security.''
</P>
<P>
   At least $37 million has been raised for a new museum structure,
slated to open in 2002 at the corner of Speedway and Martin Luther
King Boulevard. UT is seeking $10 million more to construct and
endow what it sees as a landmark building.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of $20 million for UT's part of the
Suida-Manning acquisition deal. Three anonymous patrons have given
$4.75 million toward obtaining the collection, but the university
will need to raise the rest of the sum. Dolnier and her husband,
Kurt, a commercial photographer, are donating the remaining value
of the collection, which Sotheby's assessed at between $30 million
and $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collection transforms this museum completely,'' said
Blanton curator Jonathan Bober. ``This puts us on par with the
Menil Collection (in Houston) and the Kimbell as a very carefully
defined collections-based art museum going into an exemplary
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The boon to the study of art history on campus is
phenomenal,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Austin arts leaders expressed delight over the impending arrival
of the Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous news because it is in an area (of art) not
available in Austin,'' said Elizabeth Ferrer, director of the
Austin Museum of Art. ``This will round out the UT collection and
give it a very strong historical foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton director Hite hopes the acquisition attracts more
donations, perhaps in other neglected areas, such as 19th-century
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't see these paintings without going to major
museums, not just in this country, but in Europe,'' Hite said.
``This will be an opportunity for everyone in Austin to take an
arts trip abroad, and for free.''

 &HT;    UT regents expected to OK health center in Rio Grande Valley
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Approving a plan they called historic, University of
Texas System regents agreed Wednesday toinject $50 million into
medical education, research, and public health programs in the Rio
Grande Valley, a region marked by poverty and high rates of
tuberculosis, diabetes and childhood diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is $20 million more than the Legislature set aside
for the UT System to create a Regional Academic Health Center in
the four-county lower Rio Grande Valley. Harlingen beat out McAllen
and Brownsville for the center in a fierce competition, but the
added money will give the two losing cities and Edinburg their own
medical projects.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million will come from the Permanent University Fund,
which mainly finances construction projects at 17 schools in the UT
and Texas A&AMP;M University systems. UT-Austin president Larry
Faulkner said he supported the Valley initiative and did not expect
his campus to suffer financially.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Eddie Lucio, the Brownsville Democrat who carried the
health center legislation, said he couldn't be happier to see his
region get a share of the coveted money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely historical and I'm pleased to be here to be
a part of it,'' he told the board of regents. ``This issue really
is about fairness, about equity for all Texans . . .I think you've
proven today that you care, that you care for people all over the
state, including the Rio Grande Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The regents voted to spend $25 million rather than $30 million
to build the center in Harlingen for educating third- and
forth-year medical students and training medical residents. The
regents also put $15 million into building a medical research
facility at UT Pan American in Edinburg, $5 million for a public
health program at UT Brownsville and $5 million for a medical
education building in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   The regents will ask the Legislature to earmark $5 million from
a huge tobacco industry lawsuit settlement to add to the public
health program at Brownsville. And they specified that McAllen will
have to come up with $5 million in matching money for its program.
</P>
<P>
   The regents cautioned that the projects would be doomed if the
Valley cities fail to negotiate acceptable contracts and land
donations for the new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a united effort behind it,'' said board
chairman Don Evans of Midland.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Tony Sanchez of Laredo, who was heavily involved in the
negotiations, said he did not expect any major problems.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if spreading the wealth was an attempt to make everyone
happy, Sanchez said not everyone was pleased, nor was that the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the cities competed fiercely. . .I felt all along
that it was important to establish the framework for a Regional
Academic Health Center which would include the entire Valley,'' he
said. ``This is going to be the first medical research division of
any medical school along the U.S.-Mexican border from San Diego to
Brownsville.''
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take about two years to build the center in
Harlingen, which is expected to create 300 to 400 jobs, Sanchez
said. The projects are expected to attract pharmeucetical
companies, medical suppliers and other health care industries to
the Valley, in addition to bringing new health care practioners.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of the projects is not known, but a previous
study estimated that the center alone could generate as much as
$100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some local doctors, fearing competition from the center,
objected and said they saw the center as a ``predator of private
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlingen attorney Randy Whittington, president of the
foundation that was created to aide the Valley in its quest for the
health center, said he thought the doctors' concerns were subsiding
and expected the losing cities to be on board as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely fantastic,'' Whittington said. ``What the
university has done today has changed the entire complexion of
higher education, particularly medical education, and health care
in the Rio Grande Valley from here on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a once in a . . . forever opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The regents delayed a decision on where to build the health
center in August, saying they wanted the cities to refine their
proposals. Kaludis Consulting Group of Washington, D.C., hired to
evaluate the plans had recommended Harlingen as the site.

 &HT;    Investigator cracks case of master scam artist
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Charles Kelvin Smith was a lot of things to a
lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, law officers say, Smith was a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   A world-champion bull rider and celebrity mullett-tosser named
Dusty Rhodes, an Episcopal priest named Jeremiah Micah Rhodes IV, a
motor home dealer named Daniel David Johnston _ all were Smith,
police say.
</P>
<P>
   They should know. The FBI and agencies in five states have
warrants for his arrest, and with the help of a Williamson County
deputy sheriff and a rodeo association that had made a project of
catching Smith, he is now in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Arkansas state police and U.S. Marshals,
working on a tip from a confidential informant, arrested the
45-year-old high roller from Baton Rouge, La., on charges he faked
his identity to swindle expensive boats and vehicles from
Jollyville to Tennessee. A Williamson County investigator, Sgt.
Jerry Worrell, helped crack the case after a local man identified
Smith as the person who used a counterfeit certified check to steal
his $176,000 motor home in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he has done a similar scam in numerous states _
about every state in Dixie,'' Worrell said. Worrell has been
tracking Smith since he visited the Austin area earlier this year,
allegedly posing as Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was arrested Monday night at a liquor store after officers
spotted him at a Little Rock-area RV park, Worrell said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who has represented Smith, David Mooney of Baton Rouge,
said he is unfamiliar with any evidence the police have against his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard lots of those stories from the police. I know
nothing about it,'' Mooney said. ``I know of no facts to
substantiate the charges the police have told me have been made
against him. . .This is something any attorney would say about any
client.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooney said he recently represented Smith in a sales tax dispute
with the state of Louisiana, which claimed Smith owed the state
about $25,000. With Smith now in police custody, Worrell and other
investigators from throughout the Southeast plan to interview the
alleged scam artist who Worrell said is wanted by authorities in
Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee and the FBI.
Smith's arrest warrants include a felony forgery charge out of
Jefferson Parish, La. and a parole violation with the U.S. Marshals
Service. In Tennessee, Smith is accused of stealing a motor home
worth $240,000, Worrell said and in the North Texas city of
Cleburne Smith allegedly stole a high-dollar boat.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Smith became a near obsession for Worrell, who
contemplated calling the America's Most Wanted television program
about the fugitive only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took it as a personal challenge,'' Worrell said. ``I
knew if I kept after him awhile I'd catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to this point was very difficult because the guy kept
changing his identification. We just kept pounding,'' Worrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Smith used the motor homes to travel the South
posing as a Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) world
champion bull rider named Dusty Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   PRCA officials in Colorado Springs, Colo., said Wednesday they
have been aware of Smith's claim to the bull riding title for some
time and have been passing tips on to police each time the
pseudo-cowboy blows into a small southern town in his flashy tour
bus to hand out glossy autographed photographs and rub elbows with
local big wigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not one of our world champions,'' said Kay Bleakly, PRCA
director of rodeo administration. ``We know about him because he's
popped up all year long. We've been working with law enforcement
agencies and giving them information.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at one of Smith's stops last summer near the
Florida-Alabama border that Charlotte Paterson met the flamboyant
bull rider while vacationing on the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a neck brace and a colorful ``Garth Brooks-type''
button-down western shirt, Smith told her he was recently injured
in a bull riding accident. Large letters splashed across the motor
home proclaimed the man inside was Dusty Rhodes, ``world champion
bull rider,'' said Paterson, who lives in Fairhope, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The pair dated about two months, and in that time the Orange
Beach, Ala. community embraced Smith as a celebrity, Paterson said.
A local bar called the Flori-Bama, which Paterson described as
being ``like a Gilly's in Texas,'' invited Smith to participate in
their popular mullet-tossing contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the first one out,'' Paterson said. Such fish hurling
honors are typically given to big-time celebrities, she said _
``People like Ken Stabler and Dale Earnhardt; those kinds of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith helped organize a miniature rodeo to benefit children with
disabilities in Gulf Shores, Ala., where he signed autographs and
posed for pictures, Paterson said.
</P>
<P>
   About that same time, while dining at a Waffle House restaurant,
Smith showed her an Arkansas identification card with a picture of
himself wearing glasses and a priest's collar. The name on the card
was Jeremiah Micah Rhodes IV, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was an Episcopal priest,'' Paterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson said she began questioning the cowboy's identity when
she noticed discrepancies in the myriad stories he would tell her
about his exploits in riding competitions. She and a friend checked
with the PRCA, and were told the cowboy they had met was most
likely an impostor, Paterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a little kid with costumes,'' she said. ``I just
kept thinking this guy has never been on a pony before.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterson said the relationship ended in late July when Smith
told her he was leaving town to pick up a new touring bus. She
hasn't seen him since.

MILTON HANDLER, 95, IS DEAD: ANTITRUST EXPERT WROTE LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor Milton Handler, a leading antitrust expert and drafter
of some of the nation's best-known laws, died on Tuesday. He was
95.
</P>
<P>
   Handler suffered a stroke on Thursday, said his daughter, Carol
E. Handler.
</P>
<P>
   Handler, who taught at Columbia University Law School for nearly
half a century, ranged far beyond the classroom. He was President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's chief adviser on antitrust matters, served
as the first general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board
and helped to draft such landmark statutes as the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, the National Labor Relations Act and
the GI Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, he became one of the top antitrust
litigators in the country.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent Zionist, he was close to the founders of the Israeli
state and participated in the legal brief submitted to the United
Nations in support of the 1947 partition plan. His proudest legal
achievement, he often said, was securing Albert Einstein's papers
for Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the realm of trade regulation he was a colossus and in all
respects he lived grandly in the law,'' said Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsberg of the United States Supreme Court, who is among the many
prominent jurists who studied under Handler and later became
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of seven children, he was born in the Bronx in
1903. His father died when he was 2, and the family moved to
Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia College in 1923 and briefly
dreamed of teaching literature before he became captivated by the
law.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1926 with top honors.
For one year he was a clerk for Justice Harlan Fiske Stone of the
Supreme Court, for whom he developed a lifelong admiration, and
then was invited by the dean of the Columbia Law School to teach
trade regulation in the summer session. That marked the beginning
of a 45-year teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first assignments at the Supreme Court had been to
help Stone draft his landmark opinion in Trenton Potteries vs. the
United States, a ruling that held that price-fixing agreements
always violated the Sherman Act, whether or not the prices charged
were reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Handler focused his intellectual energies on
antitrust issues, a scholarly endeavor that became, as he later put
it, ``the essence of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher who taught by the Socratic method, he was diligent,
even daunting. ``By working day and night I was able to amass
enough knowledge for each class session, generally being one day
ahead of the class,'' he later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, while still in his 20s, Handler was drafted by the
Roosevelt campaign to work on the Democrats' antitrust message and
stayed on as the administration's chief antitrust adviser. In 1937,
he helped create the Temporary National Economic Committee. The
summary of antitrust law that he wrote for the committee has since
because part of the legal canon.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Handler served on the Lend-Lease
Administration. He was also a key organizer of a government
emergency board to rescue Jews from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1944, Handler drafted the executive order creating
the War Refugee Board, but only after an uphill battle for support.
``One cannot but wonder how many lives might have been saved if the
board had been set up in the early war years,'' he later said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Handler prepared amendments to the Social
Security Act that later became the foundation for Medicare. He was
especially proud of his role in creating the GI Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important than providing people with the
skills that they get from an education,'' he later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, Handler was developing one of the most successful
private antitrust practices in the country. He became a partner in
a leading New York law firm, Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP;
Handler.
</P>
<P>
   As counsel and litigator, he represented some of the nation's
biggest corporations, including Xerox, Pepsico, the American
Tobacco Co. and Texaco, and he argued many cases before the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Handler's reputation as a scholar was so stellar that
judges, many of whom had been his students or were devotees of his
published lectures, frequently consulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an extraordinary presence in the courtroom,'' recalled
David Klingsberg, chairman of Kaye, Scholer, who worked closely
with Handler starting in the early 1960s. ``Judges listened to what
he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Prolific well into his 90s, Handler published numerous articles,
casebooks and texts, including classics on trade regulation, labor
law and antitrust. His annual series of antitrust lectures,
published in three separate collections, have long been considered
required reading for anyone interested in the field.
</P>
<P>
   On antitrust matters, Handler's philosophy was distinctively
centrist. ``He stood for balance,'' said his daughter, who is also
an antitrust lawyer. His philosophy was that the principle of
economic competition was as fundamental to American democracy as
the freedom to express competing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``big is bad'' 50s and 60s, Handler criticized the
government control of business issues preferred by Justices William
O. Douglas and Hugo L. Black. But in the 80s, he also said the
Reagan and Bush administrations brought too few antitrust cases.
Human nature had not changed, he liked to point out.
</P>
<P>
   Handler was granted numerous prizes and honorary degrees. Last
May, he received the prestigious John Sherman Award from the
antitrust division of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant and urbane, Handler lived on Park Avenue and had a
second home in Palm Beach and closets so full of suits and elegant
shoes that house guests were hard pressed to find an empty hanger
or shelf.
</P>
<P>
   A lover of music, interesting people and dinner parties, he
could talk intelligently on subjects ranging from the law and
politics to philosophy and biography.
</P>
<P>
   Handler enjoyed excellent health until almost the end. Indeed,
he had just been host at a dinner for some of New York's leading
legal lights at the Four Seasons a few nights before he suffered a
stroke, dominating the conversation with witty anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Handler's first wife, Marion Winter Kahn, whom he married in
1931, died in 1953. His second wife, Miriam Adler, whom he married
in 1955, died in 1997. In addition to his daughter, he is survived
by two granddaughters, Alisa Marion Schoenbach and Ilana Abigail
Schoenbach.

PERSISTENT MEXICAN AGENT FINALLY LANDS HIS MAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Colo.)   (jw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It began as one Mexican detective's dogged but
lonely search for an elusive banker who was wanted on 21 charges of
financial fraud amounting to at least $170 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-year international manhunt for the banker, Carlos
Cabal Peniche, finally succeeded, Mexican officials said, after top
American authorities recently decided to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal, who was on the short list of men most wanted by Mexican
justice, was arrested on Tuesday afternoon at his tree-shaded
beach-front mansion in Melbourne, Australia, where he had been
living with his family for about a year posing as a merchant from
the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials moved Wednesday to seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal's capture gives a boost to cross-border cooperation
against crime, which faltered earlier this year after U.S. Customs
disclosed that it had conducted an undercover money-laundering
investigation of Mexican banks without informing Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno gave new
support to the pursuit of Cabal after Mexican investigations turned
up signs that he was running a secret financial empire that reached
to the Caribbean, South America and Asia with a major base of
operations in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Cabal, 41, was a political success in the short
term for the Mexican government's financial officials, who have
been accused by the opposition of protecting corrupt bankers. But
if he is brought back to Mexico for trial, Cabal could add
explosive new fuel to several scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Bank documents recently unearthed by opposition leaders in
Congress show that he contributed at least $14 million during the
1994 election campaign to the political party that brought
President Ernesto Zedillo to power. And Raul Salinas de Gortari,
who is a brother of the former president and is under investigation
on suspicion of narcotics money-laundering, used accounts in
Cabal's banks to make secret transfers of at least $67 million,
according to an investigation by the police in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal had a meteoric rise from a small-time shrimp exporter to
one of Mexico's wealthiest and most prominent financiers during the
presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The Salinas government
sold him two banks, Banca Cremi and Banca Union, and Salinas once
singled him out as a model Mexican business executive.
</P>
<P>
   Through his banks Cabal started agricultural businesses across
the Yucatan peninsula. In 1992, he organized a group of Mexican
agribusiness families to help him buy the Florida-based Fresh Del
Monte Produce Co., one of the world's largest fresh food companies,
for $535 million. Cabal also tried to close a $1 billion deal to
buy another branch of Del Monte in 1994, but it fell through when
he was indicted for fraud in Mexico and fled.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Cabal moved to the center of power in Mexico,
hobnobbing with President Salinas and top leaders of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, whose dominion over Mexico was
then unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   A federal investigation revealed that Cabal had set up a fund in
1994 to channel $4.5 million in illegal funds to the gubernatorial
campaign of a PRI candidate, Roberto Madrazo, a friend of his.
</P>
<P>
   The federal inquiry showed that Madrazo had spent more than 30
times the legal limit to win that race, although the case was
dismissed two years later on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican regulators charged in 1994 that Cabal lent hundreds of
millions to himself from his banks through a network of phantom
companies he set up.
</P>
<P>
   Standing eye-to-eye with Cabal as Australian police officers
took him prisoner was Juan Miguel Ponce Edmonson, head of the
Mexican branch of Interpol, the agency that links federal police
forces around the world. Ponce had made it a personal mission to
track down Cabal, but for years he felt he was getting indifferent
treatment from the American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Melbourne on Wednesday, Ponce said
he could not help but smile when Cabal, his hair now gray and his
face slightly disguised with a close-trimmed goatee, opened his
door to the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was joyful, joyful,'' Ponce said.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce was able to crack the case after American authorities
started to help monitor Cabal's movements in earnest about four
months ago. That produced a pattern of information that always
seemed to lead back to Australia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Ponce contacted the Australian police three weeks
ago, they turned up the immigration documents of a Dominican man
who nominally ran a business importing Italian wines but seemed to
be an intermediary for Cabal. Ponce noticed that the Dominican had
given the same birth date as the fugitive financier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I said I have to see this guy's face,'' Ponce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce said he had noted ``a radical change of attitude in the
American bureaucracy'' after Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo
provided his American counterpart with details of ``the enormous
network Cabal had in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabal was able to elude capture for so long because he had
enough cash to buy false documents for himself, his wife and four
children from several countries, and to set himself up in regal
style wherever he settled. In 1995 Ponce just missed nabbing Cabal
at a 12-bedroom mansion in a Madrid suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal continued to travel regularly to the United States
throughout his years as a fugitive, Mexican officials said. His
most recent trip ended when he left Los Angeles on Aug. 24.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   FBI agents discovered that Cabal owns a mansion in the ski
resort of Aspen, Colo., which he put up for sale for $12 million.
Mexican officials said they were working with the FBI &UR;  &LR;  to obtain a
search and seizure warrant for the home.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence from Mexico, Cabal became a central figure in the
scandal surrounding the privatization of the Mexican banks in the
early 1990s and their $65 billion bailout by the government in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   His downfall and flight caused many Mexicans to wonder why the
government sold him two banks in the first place. The sales were
handled by a committee headed by Guillermo Ortiz, a widely
respected economist who was Zedillo's first finance minister and is
now head of Banco de Mexico, the central bank. In recent weeks
opposition lawmakers have mounted a campaign to force Ortiz to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz has said that his committee was forced to make decisions
about the sales of state-owned banks based on limited information
that was available at the time under Mexican law about potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers in the Mexican Congress have also charged
that the government spent vast sums of taxpayer money to pay for
the corrupt loans in Cabal's banks. Government regulators seized
Cabal's banks in 1994. They sold the healthy part of Banca Cremi in
1996 to Banco Bilbao-Vizcaya, a Spanish bank.

ZAMBRANO'S CONFIRMATION GOOD NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to blame the Galaxy's new owners for taking the
time to review every aspect of the club Coach Octavio Zambrano
included before determining what would stay and what would go.
That's how Philip F. Anschutz and his deputies do business, and
it's been a successful method.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Zambrano should have been confirmed as coach the
moment Anschutz took possession of the Galaxy last month. That
confirmation didn't arrive until Monday, but its sweep was such
that President Tim Leiweke acknowledged he no longer is seeking a
GM who'd be the team's director of player personnel, merely one who
would handle the team's business operations, deal with Major League
Soccer officials, and provide a bridge between the soccer side of
the organization and the suits in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano's record 24-8, with an MLS-record 85 goals scored an a
league-low 44 allowed his eye for talent (think Clint Mathis, Joe
Franchino, etc.) and the vibrant style his team exhibited was
evidence enough that he should remain in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news, tremendous news,'' said Galaxy captain Dan
Calichman, who downplayed reports of players' discontent with
Zambrano. ``You can't blame him for the year we had (not reaching
the final); you can only congratulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of talk in the past few weeks about players'
unhappiness, including some that several players including some of
the team's most important had told Leiweke that they'd prefer
Zambrano not return. Leiweke admitted there were ``concerns'' about
Zambrano, but they weren't strong enough to force him out.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman swears there are no troubles between Zambrano and his
players. ``A lot's been said about Octavio, and 90 percent of it
has been positive with only 10 percent, maybe, negative,'' he said.
``That's a pretty good ratio. ... All the players realize the grass
isn't always greener (elsewhere). Listen, he does a good job, and
this is a great decision.''
</P>

<P>
   Southern California's favorite club sorry, Galaxy will be
playing for a trophy tonight in L.A.: Guadalajara takes on
Argentina's Gimnasia y Esgrima in the Coliseum Cup final at the
Coliseum at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy forward Cobi Jones, D.C. United defender Eddie Pope and
Leicester City goalkeeper Kasey Keller are finalists for the 1998
Honda Player of the Year award, which will be presented Dec. 14 in
Los Angeles. Pope won the award American soccer's greatest honor
last year, and Keller is one of the top three for the third
successive year. Jones, the top American in MLS this year, is a
first-time finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Mathis will be wearing San Jose Clash uniforms Nov.18,
supplementing their rival's roster for an exhibition against
Mexican champion Toluca.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. national team's 1999 schedule is far from settled, what
with FIFA now considering moving the eight-nation Confederations
Cup scheduled Jan. 8-20 in Guadalajara and Mexico City back to
August. It's a move the Mexicans suggested after World Cup champ
France pulled out because its best players, competing in Europe's
top leagues, wouldn't be available for the event. Neither would
Brazil's, and so a switch to August would enable both to compete
with first-rate rosters. If the tournament is delayed, the
Americans will make their debut Feb.6 against Germany in
Jacksonville. The Germans will play Colombia on Feb. 9 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Arena's final assignment as D.C. United coach begins Saturday at
RFK Stadium when his soon-to-be-former club, the reigning CONCACAF
champions, takes on South American titlist Vasco da Gama of Brazil
in the first leg of the Interamerican Cup. The second leg Arena's
D.C. finale will be Dec.5 in Ft. Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   USC's women's soccer team takes a seven-game winning streak into
its NCAA Tournament debut this afternoon at the Coliseum, but the
Women of Troy (13-6-1) must wage battle against Washington (10-8-1)
without All-American Kim Clark
</P>
<P>
   (10 goals, 6 assists), who suffered a broken right leg in USC's
win 10 days ago over UCLA. USC is led by forwards Isabelle Harvey
(8 goals, 11 assists) and Courtney Barham (7, 4).
</P>
<P>
   Also in the postseason are UCLA's women (at home vs. Stanford or
Brigham Young on Saturday), Cal State Dominguez Hills' women
(Division II, at Sonoma State on Saturday), and Chapman's men
(Division III, at Cal Lutheran today).
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayfair High standout (and valedictorian) Dolores
Browning wrapped up a phenomenal career at Cal State Fullerton last
weekend in possession of every significant Titan offensive record,
single-season and career. In four years, Browning netted 61 goals
and dished out 18 assists for 140 points all Titan bests. She owned
the goal and point record by the end of her freshman season she got
the assist mark this year and has 37 more goals and 89 more points
than Amber Dickey, No.2 on both lists.

`MARY' ENJOYING ITS OWN TITANIC SUCCESS OVERSEAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``There's Something About Mary'' is becoming a
major hit in foreign theaters despite its gross-out humor,
underscoring the pervasive influence of American culture in
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   The lowbrow satire will likely top its $170 million domestic
take by the end of its recently launched foreign run. It already
has gone past $67 million in 24 territories and has yet to play in
several major markets, including France, Japan and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The overseas performance of ``Mary,'' starring Cameron Diaz and
Ben Stiller, is impressive because the 20th Century Fox release
lacks the key ingredients of typical international hits _ major
stars, special effects and nonstop action.
</P>
<P>
   It collected $22 million in gross receipts in the United Kingdom
in six weeks, $10 million in Australia, $8 million in Italy in
three weeks, $5 million in Brazil and $4.2 million in its opening
week in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   `` `There's Something About Mary' was not supposed to be a $170
million film domestically, so I'd have to give it the benefit of
the doubt in overseas markets,'' said Barry Hyman, an analyst with
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. ``Overseas box-office
grosses are now an important part of the equation when it comes to
deciding which films are being made. Those revenues are the only
way studios can justify the prices they pay for stars and films.''
</P>
<P>
   Given its bargain-basement production cost of $23 million,
lucrative prospects as a home video and strong probability of a
sequel, ``Mary'' will be the single most profitable movie property
debuted this year. With box-office receipts generally split 50-50
with exhibitors, Fox parent News Corp. will see nearly $200 million
in profit from its theatrical run alone.
</P>
<P>
   A top Fox executive recently told the weekly Variety that
``Mary'' could reach $175 million overseas. That would place it
among the six highest-foreign-grossing comedies, led by the $211
million total from ``The Flintstones'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The take for comedies is dwarfed by action films, led by the
massive $1.2 billion gross for ``Titanic,'' since concepts like
shipwrecks, explosions and car chases can be easily understood by
foreign moviegoers. In contrast, ``Mary'' features
pushing-the-envelope jokes about the disabled and zipper accidents
that may offend or not make sense to foreign crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based analyst Tim Baskerville said the ability of a
nonaction film to succeed overseas, particularly if it already has
been a hit in U.S. theaters, stems from the growing popularity of
new multi-screen cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiplexing creates more capacity and opportunity for movies
beyond the top three,'' he said. ``Most of the screens will be
filled with the best-performing American movies because exhibitors
are going to want to offer staggered start times of the top films
rather than show every film that's available.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville estimates the foreign box office will rise from 60.8
percent of worldwide revenues ($10.96 billion) to 65.6 percent
($15.37 billion) in 2007. In nine years, the number of screens will
grow 22 percent to 132,804 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' ran into censorship in Malaysia and Singapore, where
several risque scenes were cut, but the film has managed to gross
$1.9 million in South Korea and $1.1 million in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine that this type of film will go over in the
more Westernized countries,'' Hyman said. ``I think they're getting
used to our product and they're becoming more Americanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are greater opportunities to see our movies in theaters
and through videocassettes. It's one world now.''

CADE McNOWN: KING OF TOUGH LUCK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was somewhere around the fourth quarter of the 1996 USC game
that one concluded Cade McNown was going to be a great college
football quarterback, assuming he survived.
</P>
<P>
   Many can recall that McNown and the Bruins rallied from a
17-point deficit in the final seven minutes and won in overtime,
48-41. It is harder to remember that McNown was sacked, tackled,
battered, hammered and blasted by a Trojan defender on virtually
every play.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted a career high 47 passes, completing a career-high
29, and ran the ball another 10 times, accounting for 57 of UCLA's
68 snaps during a four hour and 23 minute game. Bob Toledo's
offense has matured since that raw 5-6 season, most thankfully for
McNown's personal well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But statements and reputations are made in games like that, too.
As its harrowing 1998 ride to 8-0 and a shot at the national title
has indicated, toughness and resilience are UCLA's best traits, and
McNown is by far its toughest character.
</P>
<P>
   And he's had to be. His plate in '98 has been buffet-sized.
</P>
<P>
   He has had to deal with the mental fatigue of being a Heisman
candidate. Even if one believes him when he says ``I stopped
worrying about (the hype) before the season began,'' he's still had
to answer all of the questions. No other Heisman candidate out
there has had to deal with that and a run at the national title.
</P>
<P>
   As the team's leader, he has had to face the now weekly
inspection of the team's title worthiness. McNown and the Bruins
have spent the last month apologizing for finding new and exciting
ways to win football games.
</P>
<P>
   Few quarterbacks have had to deal with as impressive a gauntlet
of opponents, like back-to-back games against unbeatens like
Arizona and Oregon. Certainly not Michael Bishop at K-State or Tee
Martin at Tennessee. McNown is UCLA's go-to guy, and every Pac-10
defense has known this for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   And even fewer quarterbacks have had to shoulder as much
leadership. McNown is one of just seven senior starters at UCLA,
and the only senior at a skill spot. ``We have a lot of guys on
this team who were high school juniors or seniors in 1996,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Borges, the Bruins' offensive coordinator, can tell you when
McNown's mental toughness became apparent. It happened the day
McNown realized he didn't have to touch the ball on 57 of 68 plays.
``Some of his best games will be those when his stats do not
standout,'' Borges said back in September.
</P>
<P>
   Cade may have some of the most paltry stats ever for a
Heisman-worthy quarterback. He has made 40 starts in his career,
but only six times has he completed more than 20 passes in any
game. He has been asked to throw more than 30 passes in a game only
13 times.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty for 30 is a good half for Kentucky's Tim Couch, or for
Florida's Danny Wuerffel when he won the award in 1996, or for any
of BYU's half-dozen Heisman candidates of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   After running for 311 yards as a freshman in 1995, McNown's
rushing stats have dwindled, too. Now, it's quality over quantity.
He has 104 net rushing yards this season, but you can isolate three
runs as critical to UCLA's 8-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   There was that 25-yard run against Oregon, the sprint that led
to his leaving his pregame snack at midfield; a 34-yard third down
run against Cal; and 30-yard run against Oregon State last week
that launched UCLA's comeback from a 24-17 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   McNown is doing more with less, which is splendid for unbeaten
teams but work against Heisman credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McNown cares. One fancies he'd be more flattered
getting a Lombardi or Butkus vote than winning the Heisman.
Physical toughness comes natural for McNown, an intangible he
doesn't spend much time thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up in Pop Warner football, I played
everything, defensive line, offensive line, fullback, safety,''
said McNown, who had 55 tackles and four interceptions to go with
2,432 offensive yards as a high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not run as much today as I did (as a freshman or
sophomore), but when I get in the open field, I revert back to what
I know about real football. In the open field, you can brace for a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a quarterback can not concentrate on protecting himself in
the pocket. If you do, your throw will be affected. I've been hit
enough to the point where I don't dread it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a pole vaulter in track, the sport's high-flying act, and
he also wrestled. For fun, he snowboarded whenever he could and
climbed a few mountains. But this does not make him UCLA's resident
extreme athlete. ``I was doing that stuff when they didn't have a
name for it and ESPN2 wasn't following you with a camera,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He could use a old-fashioned breather this week against
Washington. But he doesn't expect it. Frankly, he isn't sure he or
his teammates would know how to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to score every time we have the ball, and that's
not lip service. I try to approach every drive the same. But there
are times when I like the play-calling more when we're tied or
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the urgency of the situation makes us play
better.'' For both UCLA and McNown, you can call it Tough Luck.

ONLY AGREEMENT WITH HBO NEEDED TO MAKE HOLYFIELD-LEWIS A REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Don King has signed contracts with Lennox Lewis and
Madison Square Garden on a heavyweight unification bout between
Lewis and Evander Holyfield, he has to reach an agreement with HBO
Sports, which will broadcast the fight on TVKO, before the fight
can become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, will earn
between $8 and $10 million for the fight. Holyfield, the
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association
champion, will earn $20 million. Madison Square Garden will pay $8
million for the bout, which is scheduled for March 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very satisfied with the deal,'' said Milton Chwasky,
Lewis' New York-based lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   King's contract with Lewis gives the promoter options on a
rematch with Holyfield and a title defense against Henry Akinwande,
the WBA's No. 1 contender, if Lewis defeats Holyfield and becomes
the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. King already
promotes Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   King met with executives from HBO Sports and TVKO, HBO's
pay-per-view outlet, Wednesday. A possible unification bout was
scuttled last year when King and HBO couldn't agree on the number
of pay-per-view buys that the fight would do. Also, King said that
HBO wouldn't meet Holyfield's salary demands and wouldn't let him
take the fight to Showtime, HBO's major cable rival where King's
bouts are broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   TYSON ANNOUNCEMENT TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, will announce his
first bout since the Nevada State Athletic Commission gave him his
license back on Oct. 19 in Manhattan next Tuesday. Tyson had his
license revoked for biting Evander Holyfield's ears and being
disqualified during a heavyweight championship fight on June 29,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Tyson will meet Francois Botha of South Africa
at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Jan. 16. Botha has not signed a
contract and the MGM Grand has not signed a contract, although both
are close to agreeing to deals with Tyson. The bout will be
broadcast on pay per view by Showtime Entertainment Television.
Tyson has been working out in Phoenix, but hasn't set up his
training camp yet.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVYWEIGHT HOPEFULS
</P>
<P>
   Some promising young heavyweights will headline a show at
Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan on Dec. 8 in a card promoted by
Cedric Kushner. Shannon Briggs, Kirk Johnson, Ike Ibeabuchi, Obed
Sullivan and Alonzo Highsmith, the former National Football League
running back, will all be fighting on the card, which will be
broadcast on pay-per-view by USSB and Viewers Choice.
</P>
<P>
   No opponent has been scheduled for Briggs, whose last bout was a
world title fight against Lennox Lewis on March 28. Briggs had
Lewis in trouble early in the bout before Lewis rallied to score a
technical knockout in the fifth round. Briggs has been mentioned as
a possible opponent for Mike Tyson in his second fight. &QL;

AS TRADEMARKS MULTIPLY, INFRINGEMENT DOES, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ At first glance, Frederick Mostert appears to be a
typically staid corporate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in dark, conservative suits, Mostert on most days goes
to his office here at the Richemont group, the owner of such elite
brands as Alfred Dunhill luxury gifts, Cartier jewelry, Montblanc
pens and Rothmans cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But Mostert sometimes leads another life, one that involves what
he calls ``undercover work'' _ dressing in blue jeans and posing as
a tourist _ in search of information.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is no secret behind Mostert's actions. The
reason is as prominent as Richemont's brands: Mostert, 38, is the
intellectual property counsel for Compagnie Financiere Richemont
AG, working with a staff of 30 people to make sure no one steals or
imitates the names, shapes or slogans of the Swiss-based company's
products.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since May he has been the president of the
International Trademark Association, so he keeps his eye on other
companies' products as well in such faraway places as Cyprus,
Brazil, Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's globalized economy, trademark protection is serious
money,'' Mostert said. ``When a pirate moves in to copy a Coca-Cola
can, shape or color, it is like placing a bet on a horse after the
race is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand names like Coca-Cola, IBM and McDonald's are so valuable
that even approximating their advertising slogans to sell similar
products can mean millions of dollars in lost sales to the
manufacturers of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Mostert has helped pursue trademark thieves
who used the Pizza Hut name to sell frozen pies in Cyprus and chase
after others who used Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse to promote a
golf game in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   He also testified against an engineer who registered a trademark
he dubbed ``Pentenium,'' deliberately blocking Intel Corp. from
registering its famous ``Pentium'' brand name in the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating his job is the fact that trademarks are multiplying
at a dizzying pace as the world's economy expands, increasing the
temptation to steal brand names and designs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, an
affiliate of the United Nations, the number of brand names
registered as trademarks exceeds nine million, more than double the
number in 1974. But trademark protection has lagged far behind this
growth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no global system for protecting trademarks, said
Geoffrey Yu, the director of global communications at the
Geneva-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has created even more opportunities for trademark
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``International treaties simply don't match the explosion of
digital communications,'' Yu said. ``It takes years, maybe decades,
to formulate an international treaty. The Internet explosion has
created a situation that was never foreseen.''
</P>
<P>
   Trademark hijacking on the Internet is growing in countries
where brand-name protection laws are weak. Mostert spends hours
surfing the Internet, following a growing population of what he
calls ``global pirates'' who have registered Internet addresses for
themselves that look identical to real trademark names.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the problems have become particularly widespread in
the last 15 years as advances in communications, including
satellite television and the Internet, bring instant images, sports
and world events to billions of viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, trademark was a territorial concept,'' Mostert
said. ``Now it's what I call a cross-border phenomenon.'' He said
that it was relatively easy to track people producing counterfeit
products within a specific region like North or South America or a
single country. But now, trademark infringements are occurring
throughout most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these problems, multinational corporations like
Pizza Hut, Intel, Coca-Cola and scores of others are acting on
their own, hiring legions of lawyers and investigators to pursue
pirates, including those registering a brand name or an
approximation of it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The International Trademark Association estimates that some
large multinational companies may have as many as 15,000 conflicts
of varying seriousness at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   The trademark association itself is an outgrowth of a group of
12 merchants in New York City who sought protection for their
brands 120 years ago. Today the group includes 3,500 companies in
120 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of counterfeiting has also grown. The association
estimates that businesses lost sales of $2.1 billion to trademark
pirates last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the option for the legal owner of the trademark
is often lengthy and uncertain legal wrangling. In the absence of
an international body of laws that can settle matters swiftly, most
companies prefer to settle privately.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, anyone searching the Internet
for information on elephants could find a Web site,
www.ringlingbrothers.com, that belonged not to Ringling Brothers
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus but to the animal rights group People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The group had registered the Ringling domain name in February to
lodge a protest accusing the circus of mistreating its animals.
Feld Entertainment, owner of Ringling, responded with a threat of a
trademark infringement lawsuit. The group then surrendered the
domain to the circus.

   GLENBROOK, Nev. _ He called it his ``impossible dream'' _
building a footpath encircling Lake Tahoe that would cross two
states, six counties and 150 miles of unspoiled Alpine territory.
</P>
<P>
   What was Glenn Hampton's vision in 1977 just got a whole lot
closer to reality after the last major hurdle in completing the
Tahoe Rim Trail was overcome.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. Forest Service signing off Oct. 27 on a proposal
to scratch out the trail's final 10-mile stretch near Mount Rose,
the course's keepers can move forward with their goal of finishing
the project in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep saying, `Done by 2001,' '' said Lynda McDowell,
executive director of the Stateline, Nev.-based Tahoe Rim Trail
Association. ``We are close to closing the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Final permission to complete the project should come this winter
from the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, overseer of the area's
development standards, which, McDowell said, has ``approved
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The news couldn't come too soon for Hampton, 65, who teaches
forest ecology, natural history and survival skills at two colleges
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of getting to the end of my trail, and it's a
wonderful feeling that the Tahoe Rim Trail that was my dream so
many years ago is going to come true,'' he said. ``It will be my
legacy. Nobody will ever take that from me.''
</P>
<P>
   A former recreation officer for the Forest Service's Lake Tahoe
Basin Management Unit, Hampton took an early retirement in 1984,
handed off his project to the Tahoe Rim Trail Association he
founded three years earlier and promptly moved east. He hasn't seen
the trail or the lake since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they invite me to the ribbon-cutting. I guarantee you I
will hike the whole thing,'' said Hampton, who was an Angeles
National Forest ranger in Pearblossom before transferring to Tahoe.
``That's a promise.''
</P>
<P>
   From the scenery available to hikers who travel the trail's
12-mile Nevada section from Spooner Summit on Highway 50 south to
Kingsbury Grade along Highway 207, it's easy to understand
Hampton's passion and the zeal with which the association has
carried his torch.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at an elevation of 7,200 feet, the segment climbs to
about 7,750 in less than two miles and begins to serve up expansive
views. To the east is arid Carson Valley; to the west lies
6,229-foot Lake Tahoe, dubbed a gem by some and ``the eighth wonder
of the world'' by no less an authority than renowned boxing
referee, television judge and lawyer Mills Lane of nearby Reno,
Nev. To call it simply beautiful is certainly an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation point on one recent hike was a six-pack of
black-tailed mule deer that showed little fear as two-legged
visitors approached.
</P>
<P>
   Still farther westward are the peaks and valleys that compose El
Dorado National Forest's Desolation Wilderness and neighboring
Granite Chief Wilderness in the Tahoe National Forest. To witness
the verdant vastness of Tahoe's west side eases the eyesore of so
much treeless turf on its east side. Felled by design, the tall
timbers were victimized by drought and, later, by beetles that
infested their dry, compromised barks.
</P>
<P>
   Stunning vistas aside, the Tahoe Rim Trail is admired by
backpackers for being a rare, mammoth loop course _ finishing at
its point of origin. Most treks that long are linear, meandering
from point A to point B.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of cool. In most of my hiking, you go 15 to 20 miles
and can't see where you've been,'' Steve Andersen of Mill Valley
said. ``The Tahoe Rim Trail is the only hike I was able to look
back on at the end of the day and see my progress. You can actually
stand up, turn around and say, `Oh my God, I was there yesterday.'
You are always able to get a reference of where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen and his hiking partner, Art Presser of La Selva Beach,
tackled the track in August and are credited by the Tahoe Rim Trail
Association as the first to complete the trail in its entirety. The
team trekked for 16 days and took three layover days _ fly-fishing
for more than 100 rainbow trout at Star Lake to the southeast, then
repeating the angling feat while day-tripping to the Rubicon River
to the southwest. They bushwhacked through the incomplete sections
_ two miles in the Page Meadows area near Tahoe City (to be
finished in 1999) and the 10 miles from Nevada's Mount Rose to
California's Martis Peak (``Done by 2001'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most fun I'd had in 20-plus years of backpacking,''
said Andersen, who undertook the Tahoe odyssey after unseasonably
late snow pack in the High Sierra ruined plans to challenge the
John Muir Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was an air of celebration Saturday during Tahoe
Rim Trail Association's annual meeting as members marked the Forest
Service's OK to construct the trail's last section.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to building and maintaining the 24- to 36-inch-wide
pathway over the ridge tops surrounding Lake Tahoe, the 700-member
nonprofit volunteer group's funds are derived primarily through its
Adopt-A-Mile program. For a $5,000 donation, the group shepherds
one mile of the trail; 106 of its 150 miles are registered to
foster hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even after the Tahoe Rim Trail is completed, its namesake
association's work won't be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge now is to put in place a club to
maintain that trail in the condition they want it to be,'' Hampton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to finally move into the preservation
stage,'' echoed McDowell, who had waited her entire eight years as
the association's executive director to see the track's last
segment approved by the Forest Service.

PROSECUTORS BEGIN INQUIRY INTO CONTRIBUTIONS TO VACCO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into
a series of political contributions that state Attorney General
Dennis Vacco's campaign received from donors linked to a large
car-leasing company on Long Island, lawyers involved in the
investigation said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn issued a subpoena late
last month to the company, Oxford Resources, seeking documents
related to $46,000 in contributions that Oxford executives and
subsidiaries gave last year to the Vacco 1998 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco conducted an inquiry last year into the business practices
of the company after receiving complaints that it was overcharging
customers.
</P>
<P>
   He settled the case through mediation, declining to force the
company to pay restitution or face other penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last month that during the inquiry,
Oxford executives and a company subsidiary gave $8,500 to Vacco's
re-election campaign, according to campaign records. And less than
three weeks after Vacco closed the inquiry on Nov. 4, 1997, his
campaign received an additional $37,500 from nine Oxford
subsidiaries on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that prosecutors are trying to determine whether the
campaign contributions played any role in how the attorney general
handled the case, lawyers involved in the investigation said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on the subpoena,
saying that it has a policy of not confirming or denying
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday about the subpoena, Oxford's lawyer, Gerald
Walpin, a senior partner at the firm of Rosenman &AMP; Colin, read a
statement: ``Oxford has complied with the law in all respects. If
there is any governmental inquiry, Oxford would provide any
information that is requested.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been a big donor to Republican causes in recent
years, but had not contributed large amounts to Vacco before the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now owned by Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and
is called Nationsbank Auto Leasing.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday whether the attorney general's office
had received a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Carey, a spokesman for Vacco, was asked on Tuesday whether
the office had, and he said he would check. Carey did not respond
to two subsequent messages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn is pursuing at least two
other investigations involving campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   One is examining whether donations to the Republican State
Committee influenced the awarding of a $97 million transportation
contract by the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   The other is focusing on whether contributors to the campaign of
Gov. George Pataki were promised favorable treatment in cases
before the State Parole Board.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides have called those two investigations
politically motivated, noting that the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn,
Zachary Carter, was appointed by President Clinton. Carter has
declined to respond to that criticism.
</P>
<P>
   State election authorities have not yet determined whether Vacco
won a second term in the election on Nov. 3 against his Democratic
challenger, Eliot Spitzer. The tally on voting machines showed
Spitzer leading by less than 10,000 votes, but more than 200,000
absentee and other paper ballots have not been counted.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's inquiry into Oxford's practices was not the first by a
New York attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, his Democratic predecessor, Robert Abrams, also
investigated the company, and ended up accusing it of deceptive
practices. Oxford settled by issuing refunds, paying a $10,000 fine
and promising to overhaul its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Both inquiries examined whether Oxford was assessing excessive
charges for damage to vehicles when leases expired.
</P>
<P>
   And the complaints have continued. Vacco's office received 48
complaints about the company in 1997, including the 10 that touched
off his inquiry. This year, with the investigation closed, the
office has received at least 45.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco and his aides repeatedly said last month that there was no
connection between the Oxford donations and his inquiry. The aides
acknowledged that Oxford had a higher rate of complaints than other
car leasing companies in the state, but they said Vacco had
concluded that Oxford did not break the law, so he was limited in
the actions he could take.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the people who complained about Oxford last year
and then went to mediation under the auspices of the attorney
general's office had received money back from the company.

ISRAEL'S CONDITIONAL YES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 12: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was no small achievement for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to obtain Israeli Cabinet approval of the Maryland peace
agreement with the Palestinians. But yesterday's decision was
hedged with unnecessary and disruptive conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In nine days of hard bargaining at Wye Mills, Md., last month,
Netanyahu won agreement to all the terms he then considered
necessary to insure that the Palestinians lived up to their
obligations to combat terrorism. Israel got an American-monitored
security plan. It won a hard commitment from the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, to eliminate all references to Israel's
destruction from the Palestinian national charter. Since the peace
conference, Israel has seen Arafat's Palestinian Authority crack
down hard on Hamas terrorism after two abortive attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for internal political reasons, Netanyahu delayed cabinet
ratification of the agreement and then attached a series of
complicating conditions. These include spelling out the internal
procedures the Palestinians must use to revise their charter and a
declaration that Israel will annex parts of the West Bank if the
Palestinians declare an independent state next May. The essential
terms for changing the charter were agreed to by both sides in
Maryland. Any early declaration of independence by Arafat would
clearly rupture the Oslo peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli conditions, including a mischief-inviting commitment
to resubmit each phase of the agreed 12 percent Israeli military
pullback for separate cabinet ratification, may be meant to
reassure Netanyahu's restive right-wing cabinet partners. But they
threaten to undermine substantive understandings with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling is Netanyahu's newly reaffirmed intention to
strengthen Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, along with plans to approve new construction on the disputed
Har Homa project in East Jerusalem. Negotiations with the
Palestinians are now set to enter their delicate final stage, with
the future of Jewish settlements and competing claims in Jerusalem
two of the most sensitive issues. The United States has repeatedly
asked Israel to call a temporary time-out on new settlement
activity as these negotiations move forward. Netanyahu must surely
know that any new push on settlements now could endanger the
revived momentum toward peace that Washington has worked so hard to
achieve over the past 19 months. &QL;

COS JUST WANTS TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The player's physique and mannerisms suggested his
identity, but his presence on the practice field confounded most
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl,'' he said. ``Today, I'm Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl?
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Cos Abercrombie, Cal State Northridge's middle
linebacker sidelined since the second week of the season with a
broken jaw. Indeed, it was Abercrombie going incognito _ back at
practice for a day but without contact, awaiting doctor's clearance
for contact. He expects that to come, after which Abercrombie and
CSUN coach Ron Ponciano will have a difficult decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   After saying Abercrombie, a sophomore, would redshirt this
season, Ponciano might bring his best linebacker to Southwest
Missouri State as the 24th-ranked Matadors make a postseason run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're sitting (in my office), and he comes in (and
says), `Coach, I have to play, I need to play,' you see what the
doctors say and it becomes an option,'' Ponciano said. ``The only
thing that matters is if Cos can go without being a high-risk guy.
. . . But we'd definitely get better the second he steps onto the
field. If he can't go this week, he's going to get the medical
redshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a decision is reached, though, Abercrombie must weigh the
options.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN could win the Big Sky Conference, grab a playoff berth and
make this the most memorable season in the program's history.
However, the Matadors (6-3) could lose at Southwest Missouri State
or Idaho State and not make the postseason. Thus, Abercrombie would
give up his redshirt season for two meaningless games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the only thing I can say about me coming back is
that I love it. I love it,'' Abercrombie said. ``I know it's a big
move and I might not be 100 percent for two games, but I love it. I
feel if I come back and I'm not the person they put in there, then
it doesn't make sense. But playoffs, that's something most people
never see.''
</P>
<P>
   Health is THE issue. At 209 pounds, Abercrombie is 11 pounds
lighter than he was Sept. 19, when he broke his jaw at Northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors cleared him medically to return, Ponciano is
concerned about the bullet lodged in Abercrombie's jaw _ an inch
from the break _ from a drive-by shooting that kept him out of the
1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie's path from Verbum Dei High, where he was the El
Camino Real League's Most Valuable Player as a senior, is filled
with unforeseen detours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he gets cleared, there's some common sense a coach has
to use,'' Ponciano said. ``What if he makes three great plays and
gets his jaw broken again? That would be pretty sad to see. This
guy is a high-collision guy playing a high-collision position. But
if his body is sound, we'll let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: CSUN wide receiver Anthony Ramos isn't expected to
practice much this week because of sore legs but is expected to
make the trip. . . . Wide receiver Mike Ogas (elbow) and defensive
back Donnell Day (hand) returned to practice. . . . Ponciano said
he'll decide today whether place-kicker Manny Marquez (quadricep)
will make the trip.

EARLY VOTES KEY TO GOP VICTORY IN UTILITY PANEL RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
Republican Tony West's eleventh-hour victory in the Corporation
Commission race affirms the in creasing power of Arizona's
vote-by-mail program.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both sides in the contest say early voting made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the early ballots that put (West) over the top,'' state
GOP Chairman Mike Hellon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did much better among the early ballots than he actually
did on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP spent about $250,000 this year on an aggressive
vote-by-mail program, sending absentee bal lot requests to every
Republican household in the state weeks before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The investment paid off: In Mari copa County, absentee balloting
from Republican voters led Demo crats by a 2-1 ratio. In all, more
than 195,000 early ballots were cast in the state's largest county,
elections offi cials said.
</P>
<P>
   That lopsided margin nudged West past Democrat Paul Newman as
Maricopa County elections workers tallied 49,000 early ballots that
ar rived too late to count Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose by 2,000 votes to Tony West, (early balloting)
certainly did pay off'' for the GOP, state Demo cratic Party
Chairman Mark Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said Newman, a state law maker, picked up steam too
late in the campaign, when he began a scathing media attack against
West. The negative salvos hurt the Repub lican, but West had banked
a sizable bloc of early votes that cushioned him against the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Newman) peaked Election Day. That's not the way
campaigns work any more. You have to peak the whole three weeks
before,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, vote-by-mail has dramati cally changed the dynamics of
cam paigning in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates and political parties that once focused all their
efforts on getting the vote out on Election Day now expend large
amounts of energy and money on capturing votes cast by mail.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state's Republican and Democratic parties mailed
out early-ballot request forms to more than 1 million voters
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said the Democrats spent about as much as the GOP on
the program. An attorney general's in vestigation into the party's
solicita tion of corporate funds did not damage the vote-by-mail
effort, but hurt its get-out-the-vote program, Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about a quarter of the vote in Arizona this year was
cast by mail in the weeks leading up to Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, the trend is even stronger. On Tuesday, Oregon
be came the first state in the nation to retire traditional voting,
passing a measure to conduct all elections by mail, 57 percent to
43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To exploit the early-voting bloc, campaigns are spending heavily
on literature, television advertisements and fliers early in the
election season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do you get a higher percentage of high-efficacy
voters, but it also has developed into a voter-recruitment tool,''
Phoenix GOP political consultant Chuck Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually get new voters who probably otherwise
wouldn't have voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1991, vote by mail has paid off for many
cam paigns:
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Gov. Fife Symington's campaign waged a successful
effort to court voters before Election Day. Symington picked up
75,000 votes in early balloting even before results from polling
places began trickling in.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, wealthy publisher Steve Forbes used early balloting to
help him overcome a crowded field to win Arizona's first GOP
presidential pri mary. His campaign mailed out 165,000 early-ballot
requests, while other Republican presidential cam paigns fell
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's campaign not only targeted Republicans, but
sent absentee-ballot requests to thousands of independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hull, the governor's son and campaign manager, said
vote-by-mail was crucial to Hull's lopsided vic tory, allowing Hull
to ``put votes in the bank early,'' before Democrat Paul Johnson
could pepper the governor with negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive, but it's worth it,'' Hellon said. &QL;

A HERO IN HIS OWN BACK YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just after 11 a.m. Wednesday, a member of the color guard from
American Legion Post 115 pushed the ``play'' button on the tape
recorder he'd set on the ground near one of his shiny black boots.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   The small crowd gathered in the back yard of Aldoph ``Doc''
Wussow stood in silence, waiting. Television cameras from four
local stations pointed at Doc or at members of the color guard,
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold this,'' the guard member said, handing his rifle to the
flag-bearer next to him. He carried the tape player to an outlet
near Wussow's back door, plugging it in near a table where Doc's
wife, Joy, had set trays of cookies and a big pot of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   A recorded version of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' boomed forth.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Wussow's final flag ceremony had begun.
</P>
<P>
   In all the other places Doc and Joy lived, it was only family at
the flag raisings he'd stage on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, the
Fourth of July and so on. That's how he expected it would be when
he moved into the Del Webb development called Terravita, in north
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The Wussows have always had a flagpole in the backyard. Doc
served in World War II. His brother, Robert, was killed during the
war in a bombing mission over Germany on Oct. 8, 1943.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fly the flag for my brother and for all the boys who died,
in all the wars,'' Doc said. ``I never expected it to be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was. Shortly before Wussow signed a contract with
Terravita, the development decided to ban flagpoles. Doc figured he
was covered by the old rule and installed a skinny, 20-foot pole.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners association went after him. They took him to
court, saying, essentially, that the flagpole was a nuisance and an
eyesore. Doc fought back.
</P>
<P>
   He is in his 70s and has a heart condition. One of his adult
children is in a care facility for a brain injury. The stress was
terrible, but he fought back.
</P>
<P>
   And he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Wussow agreed to pay the homeowners
association $20,000 to drop its suit against him. In return, he is
permitted to fly his flag eight days a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, this is it,'' Doc said Wednesday. ``After today, I won't
do it any more. It's just too much for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wussows have paid half their debt to the association.
There's a $10,000 lien on their house for the other half. A fund
has been set up at Norwest Bank to help them, Account No.
1272705885.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony in his backyard Wednesday, Doc lowered the
flag to half-mast. Some of those in attendance read poems and
patriotic passages.
</P>
<P>
   It was cloudy. The wind picked up enough to lift the flag. The
rustle and pop of fabric was more eloquent than the words being
spoken.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:15, taps was performed and Doc raised the flag to the top
of the pole.
</P>
<P>
   The tape player was switched on again, this time with Kate Smith
singing ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it.
</P>
<P>
   Doc thanked everyone for coming, choking back tears as he spoke.
This happens, sometimes, to old soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if his struggle with Terravita was worth it,
considering the toll it has taken on his health and his pocketbook,
all for a flagpole that disappears in the rolling desert like a
toothpick in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it all over again,'' he said. ``Not for me, but for all
the boys we remember on days like today.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for us, even World War II couldn't scrub away the grit
from men like Doc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes wonder if people know what this country is all
about any more,'' he said. ``I'm not sure I know myself,
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows this much, however. If you're not willing to fight the
battles on the home front, then all those soldiers who didn't make
it back died for nothing. &QL;

BONILLA BURDEN LIFTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Bobby Bonilla, who rarely provided the leadership
or left-handed power the Los Angeles Dodgers were seeking after
getting him last May in the Mike Piazza trade, was sent Wednesday
to the New York Mets in exchange for reliever Mel Rojas and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Bonilla, who will be 36 in February, returns
to New York, where he spent 3{ stormy seasons in the early '90s
after signing one of baseball's biggest free-agent contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But it could not have been much worse than his half-season in
Los Angeles, where he struggled after undergoing surgery last
winter on his left wrist and left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries especially hurt his mobility at third base and left
field, where his fielding mistakes often made him a target of
Dodgers fans.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla finished with a .249 average, 11 homers and 45 RBI in
100 games, his worst production since his rookie year in 1986. With
Bonilla's $5.9 million salary for each of the next two seasons and
a strained relationship with new Dodgers manager Davey Johnson from
two seasons in Baltimore, new general manager Kevin Malone made
trading him an offseason priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that his injuries hurt his effectiveness, but we
also thought we needed to move forward,'' Malone said. ``We are
prepared to go with Adrian Beltre at third base. He showed us last
year he is ready to play in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Dodgers are out from under half of Bonilla's $11.8
million salary for the next two seasons, giving them room to pursue
free-agent pitchers Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson. They also are
expected to go after Mets catcher Todd Hundley, who became
available after New York recently signed Piazza to a seven-year,
$91 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, often struggled after being called up to the majors
in July from Double-A San Antonio. He batted .214 in 77 games with
seven homers and 22 RBI. He also committed 13 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Dodgers hired Johnson, who battled with Bonilla
about using him as a designated hitter, Malone began discussions
with the Mets during the World Series. Talks, however, stalled late
last week when New York general manager Steve Phillips was forced
to take a leave of absence after a former Mets employee threatened
legal action on a sexual-harassment charge.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was replaced by former GM Frank Cashen, architect of
the powerful Mets club of the 1980s that was headed by Johnson.
Malone and Cashen spoke repeatedly this week in Naples, Fla., where
baseball general managers are holding their annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve set most of the groundwork and Frank and I were able to
finish it up today,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, who turns 32 next month, is reunited with Malone, his
general manager in Montreal when he appeared ready to become one of
baseball's top relievers. His best year was 1996, when he went 7-4
with a 3.22 ERA and 36 saves for the Expos. That season led to a
three-year contract with the Cubs, but Rojas never pitched well for
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas quickly lost his closer spot to Terry Adams and was traded
Aug. 8 after going 0-4 with a 4.22 ERA and 13 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for me because I was used to pitching a
lot,'' Rojas said Wednesday from his home in the Dominican
Republic. ``I enjoyed pitching for (manager) Felipe (Alous) in
Montreal and it was a big adjustment. It just never worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were hoping Rojas would return to form and eventually
replace veteran closer John Franco. Instead, Rojas went 5-2 with a
6.05 ERA and just two saves in 1998. There were reports he had
trouble keeping his weight down and maintaining his focus on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   With the cross-town Yankees winning the World Series, the Mets
had no choice but to search for quick fixes. They re-signed Franco
for two more seasons and aggressively shopped Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla has 273 career homers, including 34 for the Mets in
1994. He rose to stardom with Pittsburgh in the late 1980s and
early '90s when the Pirates won three consecutive National League
East titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was traded to Baltimore in the middle of the 1995 season
and signed with Florida as a free agent in 1997. He drove in 96
runs the first year and helped the Marlins win the World Series.

 &HT;    Tuskegee Airmen speak at Southwest Texas for Veterans Day
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ When they finally got the opportunity, they
proved that they could do the job, two former members of the
Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American flying units in the
Army Air Corps, told an audience here Wednesday at Southwest Texas
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardship helped me to be more durable. This is a country
where opportunity is as great as the will,'' said Albert Whiteside
Jr. of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my wings were pinned on, it represented that I had
overcome; I had conquered my frustration and done the job I was
supposed to do,'' said Melvin P. Sikes of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were members of the 477th Bomber Group, who trained in
Alabama during World War II to be fliers in an Air Corps which up
until then had offered African-Americans only menial positions.
Their lecture at Southwest Texas State was one of many Veterans Day
observances around Central Texas Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside said he'd had all of farmwork he wanted in the little
town of Jones Prairie, in Milam County. He'd heard that President
Franklin Roosevelt had created an all-black flying program, and the
17-year-old made his way to San Antonio where he passed the
flight-program admission test. He spent 18 years in the service and
later was a civilian employee of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Sikes, who ``all my life wanted to fly,'' followed the path of
another youth in his hometown of Gary, Ind., which led to the
Tuskegee program in Alabama. He left the Air Corps in 1946, became
a clinical psychologist, taught at the University of Texas and
retired in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of Tuskegee airmen were fighter pilots, who
blazed a stellar trail in the Mediterranean and Europe, flying
escort duty for bombers. No bomber under their protection was ever
shot down.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the success of those fighter pilots made life even
more difficult for the African-American bomber crewmen who came
after them, Sikes said. ``There was a lot of resentment because
(the fighter pilots) did make it,'' he said, in the face of an Air
Corps attitude that African-Americans weren't capable of being
pilots. ``The attitude became, `If we can't get them in one place,
we'll get them in another.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We always carried the weight of the race on our shoulders. It
was, `No one thinks we can do this, so we're going to have to do it
no matter what it takes.' I think we had no idea this was going to
happen . . . that we would be honored or be part of history and all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most people in the audience lined up to get the two men's
autographs, Sikes told them: ``Don't honor us per se, but in terms
of what we tried to do. We need you to do that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience were several members of the San Marcos High
School Junior ROTC. One of them, 17-year-old Robert Gutierrez, said
``I was extremely impressed that they never referred to themselves
as victims. They simply said, `This is what was wrong; this is what
we did, and look how we succeeded.' They're leaders. They lead by
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ROTC member, Brandon Carroll, also 17, said, ``They
never complained or used their color as a crutch. If you have to
work twice as hard as the next person, well, life isn't fair. Don't
look for any handouts, because they didn't and look where they are
now.''

MEANING GOES BEYOND WHAT IS, OR ISN'T, SAID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the quote-driven world of the morning sports page, what the
jock-populace has to say doesn't necessarily matter.
</P>
<P>
   But why it was said, when it was said, or maybe what was never
said _ all of that requires serious reading between the lines.
Which is often followed by something being lost in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brett Hull. Or Ken Hitchcock. Or Joe Brodsky. Or
Chan Gailey. It's a diverse group, but they all fit into that
why-when-mum pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Hull came to Dallas with a marked tongue. His reputation arrived
before he did. When the Hull mouth opens, anything may tumble out.
In his St. Louis past, those loose lips were sometimes considered a
source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars knew this when they laid nearly $6 million a year at
Hull's free-agency doorstep. But the sonic boom from Hull's scoring
stick was what owner Tom Hicks wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness _ or unfairness _ to Hull, all of us in the local
media have been hanging on his every word, sitting on pounce for
something controversial to be uttered. Hey, it's all about
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hull cracked this week. Or so it seemed. He commented
on lack of minutes played in the Stars' game on Saturday in Los
Angeles. ``There's no possible way Brett Hull can do anything in 11
minutes \Ractually it was nearly 12\S,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that game, Hull had been averaging 18 minutes. He would
like to have over 20. But the Stars won in LA, so his comments came
across as selfish, particularly after a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But was it selfish?
</P>
<P>
   Hull knew that a penalty binge had often left the Stars'
short-handed in that game, limiting his ice time. He also knew that
by playing on the Joe Nieuwendyk line, minutes might be reduced
because Nieuwendyk is still playing himself back into shape after
double knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, Hull's comments could have been placed in another
context. If Mike Modano had said the same thing, a different
meaning would have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Brett Hull, and this was the first chance locally to
link him with a controversial comment. Then again, Hull knows all
this, so why did he leave the outhouse door open? No matter his
intent, Hull knew there were some who would blow up the wording,
and did.
</P>
<P>
   So was Hull purposely trying to get a message across to the
coach about minutes? Why did he say what he said?
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is a coach who knows only one message. If a player
wants to tell him something, do it face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's reaction to Hull was also interesting. He gave his
player some mild defense, believing the comments were overblown.
But Hitchcock then took the opportunity to publicly and strongly
remind Hull that this kind of stuff isn't tolerated around here.
</P>
<P>
   Had Hitch been waiting patiently for the first chance to deliver
that reminder? He could have gone easier on Hull, but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It all led to this kind of column, with questions being asked
about who meant what and why? Plus, let's also not assume something
wasn't lost in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   No translation is needed, however, for the Joe Brodsky quote
from Chicago. Brodsky hung out forever at Valley Ranch as the
Cowboys' offensive backfield coach before moving to the Bears for
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky confirmed yesterday what he had told the ``Chicago
Tribune'' last week: ``If you think every team in the league plays
hard every week, you better look around. We packed it in last year
in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us in the local media were writing and saying from
November on that many on the Cowboys had quit on the owner, the
head coach, and themselves. Ironically, Brodsky was the biggest
media critic in the locker room, chastising those who said then
what he says now.
</P>
<P>
   Honesty is good. In this case, it was a matter of ``when''
honesty would surface. For Joe Brodsky, it took a while and a job
change.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when credit is not given for saying nothing.
Which brings us to Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   The one major crisis Gailey has faced in his short Cowboys' head
coaching tenure came at Wichita Falls in August.
</P>
<P>
   The neck-slashing incident in the dorm now seems a long, long
time ago. Except it was hard on Gailey at the time _ for several
weeks he took a daily hammering of media questions.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, to some of us, looked bad publicly because he refused to
come clean with details. But he only did his talking about the
incident to the players, particularly the core of team leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One of those players mentioned last week that the key to
Gailey's gaining the full confidence of the team was largely due to
his public handling of the neck-slash.
</P>
<P>
   There were those of us in the media who didn't agree in Wichita
Falls, but hindsight does indicate mum was magic for Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little something for Brett Hull to consider, although
don't count on it.

SAY IT AIN'T SO! JESSE A GOVERNING `BODY?'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere, Fritz Von Erich is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   This was what he had in mind when he developed the dreaded Iron
Claw years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Domination. Not just of the ring, but of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz was ahead of his time. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura,
governor-elect of Minnesota, is right on time.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know whether to laugh, cry or tear up our Social
Security cards and flee to Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Ventura by Minnesota, a state whose inhabitants
have clearly spent too much time inside those little ice-fishing
shanties sniffing paint fumes, has put a whole new spin on sports,
actors and politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's a joke, right? Somebody's kidding here. It's one thing to
put the co-star of Bedtime for Bonzo in the White House, but to put
a man who has spent most of his life referring to himself as ``Mr.
Body'' in charge of a whole state? This borders on lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody tell me we've disarmed all our nuclear missiles in the
silos up there. Please, Mr. and Mrs. Olaf, keep Mr. Body away from
the red phone, whatever you do.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the ramifications here. Now how do we keep Dennis
Rodman under control? Or Charles Barkley, who already has his eye
on Alabama. Or Will Clark, for God's sake. Clark is already the
self-proclaimed sheriff of ``Ballpark County.'' He runs the place.
Just ask him. You think for a minute he would hesitate to go
national?
</P>
<P>
   Or what if Michael Jordan decides he wants to be president
(though I doubt he could accept the pay cut)? I mean, he does have
a little free time on his hands right now.
</P>
<P>
   You think Jordan couldn't win the presidency if he wanted to?
Better think again.
</P>
<P>
   If Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura can talk about legalizing drugs
and prostitution and be elected governor of Minnesota, Jordan can
cakewalk into the Oval Office and do a 360-degree slam dunk in the
Lincoln bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's Middle East policy: ``Get that guy Hussein on the
phone. Tell him we're gonna play a little one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse ``The Body'' _ Mr. Body to you and me _ was once a skinny
Minneapolis Roosevelt High School defensive end named Jim Janos. He
left town, bulked up and came back in the early '80s as the bad guy
in one of Verne Gagne's local wrestling shows at the St. Paul Civic
Center. Not many knew that Janos and Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura
were one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis Star-Tribune sports columnist Pat Reusse remembers
the review in the next day's St. Paul newspaper going something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been made of our society's inability to bring
together this tapestry of humanity that is America, and this is why
it was such an affirming experience to be at the Civic Center last
night as Caucasians, blacks, Asians, Arabs, Hispanics and American
Indians, Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Lutherans, Baptists,
Methodists, Presbyterians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, followers of
Judaism, agnostics and atheists, Republicans, DFLers, independents,
Libertarians, Greens, Socialists and Communists, heterosexuals,
homosexuals, asexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals, feminists and
misogynists, pro-choicers and pro-lifers, wealthy, middle-class and
poverty-stricken, all of these people rose as one _ brother and
sister _ to shout `Jesse sucks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Minnesotans have changed their opinion of Mr. Body,
who hosts a local sports talk show on KFAN AM, a gig he'll
apparently swap for the state's highest political office.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't, you understand, make him a politician.
</P>
<P>
   When Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor, among others, phoned in
congratulations on Ventura's radio show after the election, the new
governor cut right to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the hell are we gonna see some basketball?'' he growled
at Taylor, which brought forth the usual hemming and hawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give me no political answer,'' Jesse snapped. ``I've had
enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another horrifying thought: What if Ventura's
upset victory, instead of inspiring another run of ex-athletes into
politics, is the vanguard of a spate of talk-show hosts running for
office?
</P>
<P>
   Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern? Galloway and The Hardline?
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, George W., laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They ain't laughing any more in Minnesota.
</P>

LOOKING AT POLLOCK

   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Nov. 12: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Each age finds its own technique,'' Jackson Pollock said in
1951. The question remains whether each age also finds its own
means of sight, the tools for witnessing a technique and a body of
work as permanently startling as Pollock's. Pollock has been a
given for nearly half a century, and yet to look back at the
rapidity of his ascent during the late 1940s and early 1950s is to
wonder about the velocity of our culture. It moves so fast,
half-digesting everything in sight, abruptly shifting the terms in
which Pollock's art, for instance, can be viewed. What hangs
invisibly beside the canvases in the Jackson Pollock retrospective
at the Museum of Modern Art is the legacy of response. It has yet
to catch up with the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   A retrospective naturally follows a developmental line, the
movement, in this case, of Pollock's work from that first muddied
self-portrait to a final 1955 canvas, aptly called ``Search'' _ a
portrait, in a sense, of self-abandonment. The sequence of
paintings that hang on MOMA's walls form a declarative ``what,''
but we read them as an interrogative ``how'' or ``why.'' We trace
the obvious narrative lines in the life and in the life's work, the
steady dissolving of figure, the expansion of Pollock's ``drip''
techniques. When Pollock enters his greatest period, with ``Number
1A, 1948,'' his achievement is almost obscured by the fact that it
is easier to talk about how he works than what, in fact, he
achieves. The Hans Namuth photographs of Pollock painting in his
East Hampton studio, wonderful as they are, capture a cultural
fascination with Pollock's technique _ the painter as dancer _
leading the viewer stealthily away from the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   But there, in midtown Manhattan, hangs the work, not the
choreography for the work, not its psychological or biographical
underpinnings, but a gathering of paintings that stand apart from
the artist and are, at the same time, intimately (italics)of(end
italics) him. As viewers, we know only too well the way cultural
artifacts stand apart from us and are made, in fact, to stand apart
by the cultural apparatus that devours them. The trick is to make
these works intimately of us as well. How Pollock got to these
paintings is an interesting story. But what remains is what he saw
there, as each painting arose, layer by layer, pigment by pigment,
into what is both an ideal geography and a miracle of esthetic
turbulence. What remains is to see them with the confidence that
they repay all the looking in the world. &QL;

TIME TO RETHINK BUCKLEY VS. VALEO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Nov. 12: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to decide this week whether to
accept a Cincinnati case that challenges the Court to rethink its
disastrous ruling 22 years ago in Buckley vs. Valeo. The nation's
political system has suffered ever since from that decision, which
held that mandatory limits on campaign spending unconstitutionally
limit free speech. The decision did much to promote the explosive
growth of campaign contributions from special interests and to
enhance the advantage incumbents enjoy over underfunded
challengers. The court can now correct its original error.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is defending limits on spending for city council
elections that were invalidated by a federal appeals court, relying
on the Buckley decision. The case may not be the ideal vehicle to
challenge Buckley _ the factual record is rather sketchy _ but it
is still an opportunity for the court to right an obvious wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Buckley, the court drew a distinction between campaign
contributions and expenditures that does not stand up. It correctly
allowed limits on individual contributions _ to prevent the
appearance and reality of corruption _ but not on expenditures,
which the court mistakenly held do not create the same risk. That
set the stage for an escalating campaign arms race that has made
the political system increasingly vulnerable to favor-seekers who
can deliver badly needed campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the narrow corruption rationale, the court also found
no basis for limiting what a wealthy candidate may spend on his own
campaign. That has produced two terrible results. It has permitted
rich candidates to drown out candidates with fewer resources, and
it has made the money hunt by those non-wealthy candidates even
more desperate. In deciding Buckley, the court's aim was to protect
free speech. What it produced in practice is an untenable
distortion of the First Amendment and the democratic process.

THE FOOD STAMP FRACAS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Nov. 12: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York City's diminishing welfare rolls are a point of pride
with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. When he boasts around the country of
his good deeds, the drop in welfare recipients rides triumphantly
up there with a decrease in crime and a rise in civility. So it
caused considerable consternation at city hall when federal
officials questioned whether welfare applicants in the city were
being told quickly enough that they could apply for food stamps and
Medicaid, raising the possibility that the city was unjustifiably
holding back federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's welfare administrator quickly responded by asserting
that the city had now taken an ``extra precaution'' by giving out
applications for food stamps and Medicaid on the first day someone
walks into a city welfare office asking for help. But the mayor
just as quickly denied that such a statement had ever been made or
such an action taken, implying that there was no problem to fix.
Now the mayor's advisers are saying that federal officials have
basically given them a pass on their welfare plan _ an assertion
that is news to those in Washington trying to figure out whether
New York's downsizing of welfare rolls follows federal laws on food
stamps and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Into this muddle come the city's 200,000 welfare applicants each
year who are learning firsthand that for the poor, at least, Mayor
Giuliani's New York offers no easy, free lunch. Welfare offices are
being converted into job centers where applicants are encouraged to
find work, become independent or take shelter with their relatives.
At the new centers, a person who wants help is interviewed by a
``financial adviser'' who is supposed to help figure out any way
possible to keep a welfare applicant off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that under even the new federal welfare
law, when this applicant walks in the door on day one, the city
should hand over applications for food stamps and Medicaid, two
benefits that can be available even if welfare ultimately is not.
Giuliani's aides say that, under current practice, the applicant
might simply be told the benefits exist, not automatically handed
applications on the first visit. This policy, which still gives
benefits from day one if the applicant ultimately passes the needs
tests, triggers federal concerns about whether some New Yorkers are
failing to apply for benefits they are entitled to by law.
</P>
<P>
   Although destroying the culture of dependency is an admirable
end, for the working poor especially, food stamps or Medicaid can
often provide the boost that keeps them from falling back onto
welfare. The mayor's welfare program has already succeeded on the
stump. Now he has to make certain that it is humane enough for
those in need throughout the city.

 &HT;    Today's the day for Barnes to get some players
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Majestic Mapp, a point guard whose game is as
strong as his name, severed the St. Raymond's, N.Y., pipeline that
delivered Reggie Freeman and Terrence Rencher to Austin and signed
with Virginia on Wednesday. Hollis Price, a blur of a point guard
at New Orleans, turned down the Longhorns and became an Oklahoma
Sooner. Texas Coach Rick Barnes got his foot in George Williams'
door, before Coach Clyde Drexler slammed it on him and lured the
Missouri City forward to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told no before,'' Barnes shrugged. ``My wife told me
no three times before I got her to marry me.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't all say yes, but the first-year basketball coach's
honeymoon goes on after signing three versatile prepsters _ two
forwards and a combo guard _ on the first day players were allowed
to sign national letters of intent. At least, it reverses the
latest trend of attrition, considering Texas seems to lose almost a
player a week. If the season doesn't start soon, Barnes will have
to appeal to the NCAA to play make-it, take-it, half-court ball.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes might sign two more recruits, preferably a point guard
and a post player, but not until next spring. Clyde can't sign 20,
can he?
</P>
<P>
   The Texas head coach has only been here eight months and gets
credit for enticing 6-foot-8-inch transfer Chris Owens from
Duncanville via Tulane for next season. Besides, UT signee William
Wyatt might have been the best player in the state before his knee
injury and the South Grand Prairie forward is still a strong enough
prospect to make Final Four team Stanford offer him a scholarship.
By Barnes' comments, future Horns Chris Ogden and Roosevelt Brown
are more versatile than a Swiss army knife.
</P>
<P>
   A true point guard by April would be nice. UT hasn't had one
since Roderick Anderson in 1995 and hasn't had a great one since
Johnny Moore in 1979. Barnes wouldn't mind one either, but he knows
how inexact recruiting can be.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time in 1980 that he was dispatched by the Davidson
head coach to Scarsdale, N.Y., to check out a player named Johnny
Revelli. The kid had 11 shots blocked, testimony that Barnes shared
with his boss. The heck with Revelli, who's the guy guarding him?
Tall, lanky sort, who's not being recruited by anybody, Barnes
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse was mildly interested in the shot-blocker, but North
Carolina signed Sam Perkins at the last minute. Of course, even
Revelli panned out, winning Pacific-10 freshman of the year honors
at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Ohio State basketball camper who wowed a Barnes
assistant so much that Dennis Felton called Barnes and told him to
get on the next plane. Barnes, then head coach at Providence,
complied and quickly fell in love with an athletic chap named Tim
Duncan, but the strict school administration wouldn't allow Barnes
to offer a scholarship even though he said he'd have two available
the following spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tim had signed with Providence,'' Barnes sighed, ``I'm not
sure I'd be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tim Duncan-long and short of it is that the
6-foot-9-inch-and-growing center enrolled at Wake Forest, and
Barnes was soon headed to Clemson, where he waged annual recruiting
battles with the likes of North Carolina and Duke. At Texas, he'll
have to pick his spots _ and fights _ against Drexler, Melvin
Watkins, Texas A&AMP;M's new coach, and others.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen overnight, but it's got to get easier for Barnes
here than at Clemson, where last year he lost two players who had
committed _ Louisiana point guard Brandon Dean and Kentucky guard
Todd Tackett _ to Arkansas and defending national champion
Kentucky. Another point guard, Steve Francis of Maryland, signed
with the Terps because Clemson didn't offer a big enough national
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball isn't all about tapping into the premier
blue-chippers and rolling out the ball. Barnes was successful at
attracting top-drawer talent to Providence, where there is a dearth
of in-state players. He signed only two in his six years. But he
opened eyes by signing future NBA players, such as Michael Smith
and Dickie Simpkins and Austin Croshere, the last of whom he lured
from his Southern California roots after he'd been turned down by
Stanford and UConn. And Maryland Coach Gary Williams has given
Barnes much of the credit for signing All-American Jimmy Jackson as
a Buckeye when both coaches were at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has shown a knack for mining nuggets such as then-unsung,
5-8 point guard Terrell McIntyre, whose 160 treys are No. 2
all-time at Clemson. He also had a roster sprinkled with players
from Lithuania and the Ivory Coast, which are not in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He says he'll do the same here and go anywhere an interested
recruit takes him or assistants Ricky Stokes and Brian Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at foreign players,'' he said with a gleam.
``Besides, if there's some guy in France, that's my trip.''

Electric Company: The Cowboys players with the light stuff 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ You'd have thought Emmitt Smith was having
convulsions. He was asked to name the most exciting players in
Cowboys history, and he broke out into a dance that was part funky
chicken, part Irish jig and part Michael Jackson. He shook his
legs. He gyrated his hips. Then, like some kind of dime-store
cowboy, he pretended to pull out two guns and stick them into
imaginary holsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he said at a reporter who looked at him with amusement,
``this is what Butch Johnson used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Johnson might have California Quaked when he was a Cowboys
wide receiver from 1976-83, but it takes more than just a dance to
crack the ``Star-Telegram'''s list of the 10 most electrifying
players in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   Smith makes the list, placing fifth after breaking Tony
Dorsett's club record for career rushing yards Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star-Telegram'' Electric Company is purely subjective and
was concocted after talks with several past and present Cowboys
players, one of whom voted _ unsuccessfully _ for ``himself.'' ``I
have to come to mind because of all the things I did,'' said former
linebacker Thomas ``Hollywood'' Henderson (1975-79), one of the
league's first glamour defensive players who dunked over goal
posts, but couldn't stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Electric Company includes players who could score from
anywhere on the field at any time in the game, of players who could
take your breath away and not give it back, of, Smith said,
``people who charged the crowd, and made you get off the bench and
say, `Gawd Dog.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrifying means something that moves me, something that
excites me,'' added Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders, an obvious
choice to top the list. ``Michael Irvin does that with his game and
with his charisma. Tony Dorsett did that for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Electrifying does not necessarily mean best ever. So, the list
does not include Troy Aikman, who has been as consistent as a
humdrum Texas sunrise. Yet, all quarterbacks are not excluded.
Roger ``The Dodger'' Staubach (fourth) had many hearts pumping as
he passed and ran the 1970s Cowboys to all those last-minute
victories.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Electric Company is nearly exclusive to
offensive players, for it's fairly difficult to be electric without
the ball in your hands. Hall of Fame defensive tackles Bob Lilly
and Randy White might have hit with the force of lightning, but
what makes one jump out of your chair more and shout, ``did you see
that?'' Sacks or touchdowns?
</P>
<P>
   We like touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's the juice, from Deion to Dorsett, from Herschel to
Hill. The 200-Watt Spotlight Club
</P>
<P>
   1. Deion Sanders, 1995-present: With an unequalled knack for the
dramatic, the speedy Sanders has scored via punt, fumble and
interception return, as well as a receiver and a rusher in his
Cowboys days. ``You can just feel it in the air when he gets the
ball,'' Preston Pearson (1975-80) said. ``The other team is going,
`Oh God, Oh God. Get him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks are afraid to throw at his side. Punters won't punt
to him. Those brave enough to challenge him sooner or later get to
watch him high-step the other way for six.
</P>
<P>
   And when they do, Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett wants a
good seat for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you catch yourself trying to get a good spot on the
sidelines to see what he's going to do,'' Lett said.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bob Hayes, 1965-74: Zone defenses did not exist before this
Olympic sprinter came to the Cowboys. But defensive coordinators
had to do something to stop him, thus the double-team was created.
One defensive back would cover him short and another would line up
20 yards off the line to cover him deep. He has the highest
yards-per-catch average in team history (20.0). He also returned
three kicks for touchdowns. ``Nobody ever knew how fast he really
was because we'd have 40-yard sprints and he'd never burn off any
4.1s,'' said Tex Schramm, former Cowboys general manager
(1960-1988). ``All he would do was beat the guy he was running
against. And that was everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Tony Dorsett, 1977-87: People still tell him what they were
doing on that night in Minnesota when he reeled off a 99-yard
touchdown run. Dorsett's only regret: He didn't keep the ball. ``A
lot of people have called and said they'd send me the ball if I'd
send them some cash,'' he said. Dorsett was a money player who used
speed and shifty moves to run his way into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame. Said Schramm: ``Tacklers thought they had him and he'd just
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100-Watt Hall Light Club
</P>
<P>
   4. Roger Staubach, 1969-79: Before there was John Elway, there
was Staubach. ``Captain Comeback'' scrambled his way past would-be
tacklers to rally the Cowboys from behind 23 times in the fourth
quarter, including 14 in the last two minutes. He made fans believe
``Hail Marys'' could happen every game.
</P>
<P>
   5. Emmitt Smith, 1990-present: He isn't the fastest player, but
he has the now-you-see-me-now-you-don't moves that has him gaining
on the top five NFL rushers of all time. In Atlanta in 1992, he cut
back so deftly that one would have thought the Falcons defenders
would blow out their knees trying to tackle him. He did the same
thing on that 15-yard touchdown run in Philadelphia on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   6. Drew Pearson, 1973-83: Every time a Cowboys quarterback
needed a miracle, there was Drew. He answered Staubach's 1975
prayer in Minnesota. He ran down Clint Longley's bomb to beat the
Redskins in 1974. He caught two last-minute Danny White touchdowns
to beat the Falcons in 1980. ``Drew was the greatest pressure
clutch receiver that I've ever known,'' Schramm said. The 60-Watt
Porch Light Club
</P>
<P>
   7. Mel Renfro, 1964-77: He was so fast and elusive that the
Cowboys considered making him a running back before an injury
forced his move to cornerback and safety. He is the club's career
leader in interceptions (52) and interception return yardage (626).
``When Mel played, he was looked upon like Deion is now,'' Schramm
said. ``He was an unusual athlete for his day, but he didn't have
the flair for the dramatics like Deion has.''
</P>
<P>
   8. Michael Irvin, 1988-present: Not necessarily known for his
speed, the brash, trash-talking Irvin still runs for big yardage
after the catch as well as most. Then he signals ``first down,'' as
a way to get the fans juiced up. He holds most of the Cowboys'
notable receiving records and should finish among the NFL's top 10
in receptions before he retires.
</P>
<P>
   9. Herschel Walker, 1986-89, 1996-97: He remains the only player
to ever put Tony Dorsett on the bench. He had sprinter speed and
brute strength. He was so good at everything that no one could ever
figure out what he was best at. He ran from scrimmage, caught
passes, and returned kicks for four different teams, and is No. 2
on the NFL's all-time combined yards gained list with 18,168 total
yards.
</P>
<P>
   10. Tony Hill, 1977-86: Alvin Harper might have been more
acrobatic, but Hill was more dramatic and more consistent when it
came to getting deep. His two long touchdown receptions in 1983
gave the Cowboys a come-from-behind victory in Washington. The
speedy Hill retired with a 16.7 yards per catch average, second
only to Bob Hayes and Frank Clarke (1960-67).

   NEW YORK _ ``War and Peace'' or ``Tristram Shandy'' they are

   ``The Century'' by Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster, described
on its picture-packed jacket as ``a magnificent chronicle of the
extraordinary 20th century,'' weighs 5 pounds, 1.2 ounces. As it
happens, that is exactly the same as another recent book _ which
will probably still be on coffee tables long after the millennium _
``The American Century,'' by Harold Evans, the editorial director
and vice chairman of The Daily News, U.S. News &AMP; World Report and
The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the paper in ours is better,'' Jennings joked
Wednesday, noting that his book had 606 pages while Evans' had 722.
Jennings' book costs more, with a list price of $60; Evans' goes
for $50.
</P>
<P>
   As heavyweights go, they are well ahead of ``Bruce Springsteen:
Songs,'' which went on sale Wednesday. It weighed in at 4 pounds,
1.9 ounces and a mere 306 pages. But like ``The American Century,''
it costs $50.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Tom Wolfe's 742-page, $28.95 novel ``A Man In
Full.'' David Letterman, who had the white-suited Wolfe as a guest
on his talk show Tuesday night, held up the book and said: ``I
think this ought to be the size you should shoot for. I'm telling
you, this feels and looks like, well, gosh darn it, here's a book,
for heaven's sake.'' (This was after Letterman admitted that he had
not yet read it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never reached three pounds before,'' Wolfe said. ``I
figured it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfe fell short: ``A Man in Full'' weighs only 2 pounds 9.4
ounces in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps he handed in a 3-pound book and they edited it down,''
a spokeswoman for Wolfe, Amelia Durand, said. ``Who likes to read a
heavy, heavy book?''
</P>
<P>
   The Art of Bowling
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs at the Frick are the paintings everybody sees.
Downstairs is Henry Clay Frick's private bowling alley, which only
museum directors see.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sachs II, the director of the Frick, invited a dozen or
so heads of other New York museums to a bowling party to welcome
Maxwell Anderson, the recently appointed director of the Whitney.
Although he did not choose the old-style ball with two _ that's
right, two _ holes, Anderson said, ``I actually know how to bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Sachs may have been the only two in the room who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sams are perfect bowlers,'' said Rosetta Miller, whose
husband is the retired director of the Newark Museum. ``Sam Sachs
bowled two perfect strikes, and Sam Miller bowled two perfect
zeroes.'' (Miller eventually knocked down five pins.)
</P>
<P>
   Beth Sachs, the director's wife, said that this was only the
second time the two-lane bowling alley had been used since it was
restored last year. ``In fact,'' she said, ``I think we are the
first people to use it since Frick.'' He died in 1919, and his
daughter had the lanes covered and turned it into a storage area.
</P>
<P>
   Private Screening
</P>
<P>
   Only in New York could a celebrity doctor demand _ and get _ a
new movie for a benefit screening, in this case a
$150-a-person-and-up showing of Woody Allen's film ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed a plastic surgeon's office,'' recalled the doctor,
Richard Coburn. ``I said, `You've got to do a screening for the
National Hypertension Association.'' (He is a longtime board member
of the group.) ``They hemmed and hawed for a few minutes and gave
it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Celebrity'' does not contain all the film that Allen shot
in Coburn's brownstone on the Upper East Side. A bedroom scene with
the nebbishy, Woody Allen-like character (Kenneth Branagh) was
filmed in Coburn's living quarters, above his office. ``They did
the scene and it didn't go well,'' Coburn said. ``They did it over
again.'' Somewhere else.

ADVERTISING: GERMANS DO BEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Who ever said you couldn't score points with a client by making
fun of his heritage?
</P>
<P>
   That was the formula settled on by a creative team from the
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC when they sat down
to figure out how to sell more Beck's beer for Brauerei Beck &AMP; Co.,
the German brewery. After flopping badly in the early 1990s, Beck's
has recovered enough to become the No. 5 imported beer in the
United States last year, according to sales data recorded by
Impact, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Beck's beer rose 11 percent last year, to 7.4 million
cases from 6.7 million, said Frank Walters, director of research at
Impact. That is still lower than the 8 million cases sold in 1990,
the peak year for Beck's in the United States, he noted, but the
brand is on the upswing, partly because of a new management team
and sales force. The brand is also buoyed by the growth of imported
beers in the United States in general. Sales of imported beers
increased by 12 percent a year in 1997 over the previous year and
left the flat domestic beer business in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Beck's, based in Bremen, knew they wanted to
extend their turnaround. They were prepared to spend a lot of money
by their standards: $20 million, twice the size of any previous
U.S. advertising budget for the company, in the belief that more
advertising would add momentum to sales. ``We are totally committed
to the states,'' said Axel Meermann, Beck's global marketing
director. ``We want to double our business in six years, and we are
in year two right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite possessing normal amounts of patriotic pride,
somehow the company was also prepared to accept the recommendation
of the Saatchi team that the new ad campaign be centered on
commercials that poke fun at German stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The Saatchi executives, Tod Seisser and Jennifer Laing, found
after conducting focus groups and what Miss Laing, chairwoman and
chief executive of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi North America, called
``psychological probes'' that the Germanic associations of Beck's
were what its drinkers _ described as males ages 19 to 35, well
educated, into sports and achievement of all kinds _ most admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boy brand,'' Miss Laing said. ``German is the ideal to
the American male. It's strong, and it's all about precision and
expertise. We said: `If you leverage your German-ness, that's
really potent for this particular target audience. It just triggers
all the things they want to think about themselves.''' But, Miss
Laing added, the brand lacked easy recognition, which means a lot
in the world of commercial buzz. Some people even have trouble
distinguishing it from Heineken, which comes in a similar green
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   After exploring a handful of options, she and Seisser concluded
that the best way to both capitalize on the Teutonic qualities and
appeal to potential Beck's drinkers was to take a humorous view of
certain German propensities. ``This one got ticks on all the
dimensions we cared about,'' Miss Laing said of the final campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which will be broadcast during sports events
and late-night shows starting next Wednesday, make fun of a certain
Teutonic obsession with control, using various scenarios whose
humor would come through whether it was a beer ad or a late-night
comedy skit. They were heartily endorsed by Meermann, who might
have been a bit puzzled at first about what made them so hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a blond actor struggles to get comfortable on a couch
for a relaxation session. He is wearing a stiff white shirt and tie
and is listening to a compact disk titled ``Das Kalm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Commence relaxation now,'' an offscreen voice commands. It
does not work out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans don't do laid back,'' the announcer intones in an
unmistakable German accent. ``They do beer.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, two actors are playing a key scene from ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' The dialogue is in German, and the actors are in
brittle-looking, larger-than-life costumes that Seisser, the chief
creative officer at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi New York, said were inspired
by archival photographs of a Bertold Brecht play from the 1930s.
The actors lack any semblance of passion. ``Germans don't do
romance,'' the announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   And in a third, Michael Schenk, a German actor, plays a comedian
whose delivery and brand of humor fail to connect with his
audience. The room is almost empty, and Schenk's jokes, complete
with references to Berlin, fall flat. ``Thank you,'' he says, to a
smattering of hollow applause. ``I'll be here all ze week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans don't do comedy,'' the announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rich area,'' Seisser said. ``It could go on for
10 years. There are certain things Germans are very, very good at,
and certain things they're not good at, just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   References to old Beck's advertising were incorporated in the
new commercials. In all three spots, a bottle of Beck's is slammed
down on a counter for emphasis, just as in earlier Beck's ads. But
there is a new slogan this time: ``The best of what Germans do
best.'' As Seisser put it, ``It reinforces our superiority within
that set, and it sounded good.''
</P>
<P>
   Print ads are also scheduled to appear, along with billboards
and radio spots. And the humor, while it may have taken some
getting used to, is thought to be right for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's hard,'' Meermann admitted. ``I can smile, but
it's hard to think about whether that stereotype is realistic.''
But he added, ``As long as you, as a German, make a joke at your
own expense, it's OK''

VAUGHN `TO PLAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE,' RED SOX SAY 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-WRITETHRU-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ The Red Sox' protracted, often acrimonious bid to
re-sign slugger Mo Vaughn ended for all intents and purposes
Wednesday night when general manager Dan Duquette said the free
agent first baseman had rejected the club's latest offer and
decided to look elsehwre.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the general managers' meetings here, Duquette _ who
earlier in the day had sweetened Boston's offer, according to the
Vaughn camp _ said, ``It looks like he's going to play for someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That someone else is not necessarily the Anaheim Angels, who
gave the Sox a lofty target to aim at when they offered Vaughn a
guaranteed six-year, $72 million package last Friday when all clubs
became eligible to bid for free agents, not just the players'
present employers.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn did not indicate where he'd be heading, Duquette said
Wednesday night. ``He's going to put his efforts somewhere else,
and we are, too. We're going to look at some other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Other options for the Sox apparently involve Yankees center
fielder Bernie Williams, the American League batting champion, and
tempestuous Chicago White Sox slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gammons of ESPN, a Globe columnist, reported that Williams
will be in Boston next Thursday, and Duquette sounded enthusiastic
about the possible addition of Belle despite his notorious
off-field reputation. However, Williams reportdely is being heavily
courted by the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, it seemed the Sox' chances of retaining
Vaughn had improved. In the wake of Anaheim's offer, they had come
up with a five-year, $60 million proposal _ in the neighborhood of
what they gave pitcher Pedro Martinez last December (six years, $75
million) when they made him the highest-paid player in baseball at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette indicated that the Sox had increased their offer in
terms of length Wednesday when they met twice with Vaughn's agents,
Tom Reich and Mark Gillam.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was not setting a deadline for Vaughn to make a
decision on the Sox offer, Duquette said he planned to leave the GM
meetings here this morning, not to return to Boston but to meet
with prospective free agent signees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to our fans to present good players,'' Duquette
said, ``and there are a limited supply of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette did not reveal his destination, but it was a clear
signal that he expected a definitive response from Vaughn.
Wednesday Duquette said he met twice with Vaughn's agents, Tom
Reich and Mark Gillam, and as he left for dinner with the Red Sox
contingent attending meetings here, he said he expected to have
further contact Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about at that point where we're going to find out if
there's a deal,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Sox ``were making progress on some issues important
to Mo Vaughn.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated Wednesday night that the Sox do not place no-trade
provisions in their contracts but questioned why that should be a
deal-breaker for Vaughn. He referred to the provision in baseball's
Basic Agreement that stipulates a player with 10 years of big
league service and at least five years with the same team has veto
power over any trade.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn will attain 10-5 status in another three seasons, he
noted. ``To me, it's not a big issue,'' Duquette said. ``If Mo
Vaughn wants to stay in Boston, he will be in charge of his career
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' original offer, averaging $12 million a year, is
equal in annual value to the original proposal made to Vaughn by
the Angels, who were said to be willing to increase their offer if
it would expedite Vaughn's signing. For the moment, those are the
only two deals on the table for Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was asked if the Red Sox might offer a sixth year as a
club option, meaning the team would have the right to decide
whether to exercise the option for an extra year or give Vaughn a
sizable buyout if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Structuring the contract in such a way would give the Red Sox
protection in the event Vaughn's skills eroded by the end of the
deal, while Vaughn would be assured of receiving at least some
compensation for not taking the guaranteed six years offered by
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette did not answer the question directly, saying only that
some ``challenges'' remained to closing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, the Red Sox made a minor deal with Arizona
for righthanded pitcher Bob Wolcott, who made a brief splash three
years ago when he was a surprise Game 1 starter for Seattle in the
1995 American League Championship Series against Cleveland. Wolcott
won that game, but his career has spiraled downward since.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took him in the second round of the expansion
draft last year, but Wolcott was unable to hold a spot in their
rotation, going 1-3 with a 7.09 ERA in six starts. Duquette said
the 25-year-old sinkerballer pitched well against the Sox, with a
career record of 4-1 and a 4.34 ERA, but even those numbers are
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two appearances against the Sox, Wolcott gave up 17
hits and 10 runs in 8 2/3 innings. The Sox reportedly will give up
a pitcher from the lower minors in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also officially lost lefthanded reliever Greg Swindell,
who signed a three-year contract for $5.7 million with Arizona. The
Red Sox had offered Swindell a two-year extension during the
season, but he turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As a Class A free agent, Swindell, who cost the Sox three minor
leaguers in a trading deadline deal with Minnesota in July, will
net them an additional first-round sandwich pick as well as a
second-round choice in compensation.

 &HT;    Proposed road test for elderly draws fire
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A state lawmaker said Wednesday it is time for
Texas to force older drivers to prove they are roadworthy.
</P>
<P>
   A bill filed by Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, would order the
Texas Department of Public Safety to come up with a way _ perhaps a
road test _ to make sure drivers 75 and older can ``exercise
ordinary and reasonable control in the operation of a motor vehicle
of the type that the license authorizes the person to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby said he knows he is headed into a gray area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to penalize anybody,'' said Goolsby, 65.
``We are trying to make the roads safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative effort comes in the wake of two highly
publicized highway incidents involving older drivers. In June 1997,
Raymond and Lela Howard of Salado were killed when their car
plunged down a 20-foot ravine into a shallow Arkansas creek. The
Howards, with Lela at the wheel, were heading to a festival in
Temple but somehow wound up in Arkansas, 500 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, concerned about Lela Howard's deteriorating
medical condition, had considered taking away her driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, five women were killed near Giddings when the van in
which they were traveling was struck by a car driven by Elsie
Nitsche, 84, of Giddings. She was indicted on a charge of
criminally negligent homicide. Investigators said she failed to
yield the right of way to the van.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Public Safety statistics for 1996, the most recent
complete data available, do not indicate that older drivers are
involved in a disproportionate number of wrecks. But the numbers do
not reflect the fact that older drivers tend to drive fewer miles.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby said most older drivers do just fine behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's touchy,'' he said of his proposal. ``But I don't think
anybody could say there is not a lot of good logic to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again, Mr. Goolsby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Association of Retired Persons strongly
disapproved of that legislation being filed,'' said Candice Carter,
AARP's Austin lobbyist. ``It is discriminatory in all senses of the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   But Homer Lear of San Antonio, who has been speaker of the
Silver-Haired Legislature, said the idea has merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with it,'' said Lear, 78, who drives about
25,000 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lear noted, however, that the state-sponsored advocacy group for
the elderly has not addressed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Sun City, a Williamson County enclave of active senior
citizens, Goolsby's idea got, at best, a yellow light. Proceed with
caution, said Charles Barnes, 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of older folks who do cause big problems,'' he
said, adding he would not mind taking a test as long as it was
convenient. ``I don't want to go through a tremendous amount of
trouble to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Coffman, 66, said the state should not set an arbitrary age
at which everyone would have to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see maybe a physician exam, and a doctor would say
this guy doesn't have good eyesight or physical reflexes,'' he
said. ``Then you would bring that to the DPS.''
</P>
<P>
   Several states require mandatory testing only for older drivers
with physical conditions or who rack up a series of wrecks or
tickets. Several other states require mandatory testing for every
driver above a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   The Goolsby plan is not supported by insurance industry
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, older drivers are considered preferred drivers
because they drive fewer miles, they drive when traffic is not
quite as heavy and their driving record is usually very good,''
said Jerry Johns, president of the Southwestern Insurance
Information Service.
</P>
<P>
   Johns' organization is declaring neutrality on the Goolsby bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be helpful to everyone, because what it would do is
eliminate those drivers who don't possess the skills'' needed to
drive, he said. ``But you could make that argument for any age
group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, in a 1997 national
study, reported that elderly people have higher rates of fatal
crashes per mile driven than any group other than drivers under 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``A problem is that elderly drivers don't deal as well as young
ones with complex traffic situations, and multiple-vehicle crashes
at intersections increase markedly with age,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation reports that older drivers
have fewer accidents than other age groups but have higher rates of
fatal accidents. And, the agency reports, the number of over-70
drivers has increased 47 percent in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby said he understands what a car and a driver's license
mean to older Texans, even after they've stopped driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst mistakes I made with my own mother was I had
her sell her car,'' he said, convinced now that the vehicle offered
her a sense of independence, even if she never drove it. ``That
thing should have stayed in the garage and disintegrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby said he handled the situation differently with his
mother-in-law, who cherished her 1978 Cadillac long after she no
longer could drive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would start it up and let it run a while,'' he said. ``It
meant everything in the world for her to have her driver's license
and have that car out there.''

HARRY MARKSON, 92, COLORFUL BOXING DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harry Markson, a soft-spoken and scholarly type who
spent 40 years in Madison Square Garden's often garish and
turbulent boxing world, presiding over it for a quarter-century,
died on Tuesday night at Riverview Hospital in Red Bank, N.J. He
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   When Markson was made director of boxing in 1948 by James
Norris, the late financier who controlled the promotional
organization known as the International Boxing Club, the sport had
a strong underworld influence. As Norris explained the appointment,
``There's got to be somebody around here with clean hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing's buccaneering image flourished at the Garden, then at
Eighth Avenue and 49th Street, almost from the time the sport
became synonymous with the famous arena. But in the haze of clouds
of cigar smoke, Markson was a becalmed pipe smoker.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Garden as a boxing publicist in 1933 under Mike
Jacobs, a promoter who made Joe Louis more or less the arena's
house fighter.
</P>
<P>
   As a publicist and then the boxing director, Markson was
involved in more than 2,000 bouts. Perhaps his most famous was the
1971 extravaganza in the present Garden that pitted Muhammad Ali
against Joe Frazier, both undefeated, for the heavyweight
championship. The ringside celebrities included Frank Sinatra, who
was taking photographs for Life magazine; Col. Sanders of Kentucky
Fried Chicken, decked out in his signature white suit, and the
author Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Markson was proud of the Garden and its place in history. He
liked to recall his meeting with Pope Paul VI in 1967, when he flew
to Rome to try to sign the Italian boxer Nino Benvenuti. When the
pope was told what kind of work Markson did, he held up his hands
in the classic boxer's pose and said, ``Ah, Madison Square
Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when the Garden was becoming more corporate and
businessmen were running the operation, he was shocked when the new
president, Alan Cohen, said he was considering dropping boxing as a
cost-cutting measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a bottom-line man,'' Markson told Cohen at a luncheon,
``and I'm a boxing man.'' From then on, the Garden president was
known as Bottom-Line Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Markson was born March 10, 1906, in Kingston, N.Y., and
graduated from Union College in 1927. He was a boxing reporter for
The Bronx Home News before joining the Garden, where Jacobs'
Twentieth Century Sporting Club held sway. In 1937, Markson became
the head of publicity for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed keeping track of the fractured phrases he came across
in the rich diversity of managers and trainers. His orderly notes
included these nuggets:

<P>
   _ ``I don't believe anything I see unless I see it with my own
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``This kid, punches roll off his chin like a duck takes to
water.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Look,'' said the manager, beseeching Markson for more money,
``I'm in a terrible squandry. I just gave my daughter $400 for
intuition at college. The tax people want me to atomize expenses,
and my home was ramshackled by burglars.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Markson became the general manager of boxing under
Norris, whose International Boxing Club had a stranglehold on
championship promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Norris had a propensity for hanging out with gamblers and
gangsters. He was investigated by a Senate committee, and in 1959,
when the courts ordered his organization dissolved, the Garden took
control of boxing in its building and made Markson the director.
Each night, Markson would leave the hurly-burly of his sport
behind, go home to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and listen to a
prized collection of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he and his wife of 68 years, the former Rachel
Karpet, lived in Middletown, N.J., with their son, Robert, and his
wife, Stephanie. Markson is also survived by a granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After 1973, although Markson continued as a consultant, he had
little influence over boxing in New York. With the rise of gambling
casinos, there were few big fights left for New York, but he still
followed the sport closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watched all the important fights on cable television,'' his
daughter-in-law said. ``And television reporters visited him and
got him to tell stories of the old days. That kept him young.''

KOKANEE: SPECTACULAR SPAWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP RICHARDSON, Calif. _ Brilliant scarlet hues. Humped backs.
Hooked jaws. The salmon's spawning characteristics are
unmistakable. But this isn't Alaska or Canada or the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe Lake Tahoe?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the kokanee _ the lake's landlocked population of red,
or sockeye, salmon _ are running in Taylor Creek on Tahoe's south
shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are amazed. It's fish-watching at its finest. You get
to actually see the whole spawning phenomenon right there in front
you without traveling a great distance,'' said Jackie Faike, an
interpretive specialist with the U.S. Forest Service's Lake Tahoe
Basin Management Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as a game fish in 1944, the kokanee thrived with
little competition and lots of habitat. Today it has a
self-sustaining population. However, unlike their cousins to the
northwest who spawn in freshwater but live most of the time in the
brine, these specimens reside only in sweetwater.
</P>
<P>
   The kokanee have traditionally spawned in 2-mile-long Taylor
Creek, which is regulated by a dam at its source _ Fallen Leaf
Lake. The fish know where to find the creek because its scent is
imprinted on them at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe's other inlets are controlled only by nature's whim, and
in autumns following mild winters they often don't have enough
volume to satisfy the 40,000 to 60,000 kokanee that spawn for six
to eight weeks, usually starting in late September or early
October.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the creek is enjoying the kokanee's largest spawn
with an estimated 80,000 of the 18-inch, 3-year-old fish heading up
the creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why that is we're not sure,'' said Jeff Reiner, a Forest
Service fisheries biologist who also tends the dam to ensure proper
flows for the spawning process. ``It could be more favorable
conditions _ increased lake levels that supplied more shore-zone
habitat for younger kokanee. It probably relates to more of their
prey species _ zooplankton. And everything tiered off that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Reiner said, the kokanee had an excellent spawn three
years ago and that year class is spawning now. The evidence is
clear by the stench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for folks to go down the creek now because it's
very smelly,'' Faike said.
</P>
<P>
   As is the way of the salmon, to reproduce it must die, and there
are more expired fish in the water now than live ones. In short,
they expend all their energy spawning and afterward their body
mechanisms shut down. The final days are spent guarding their nests
as a fungus takes over their rotting bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is wasted in nature, and today's loss is tomorrow's
bounty for the coyotes, raccoons, crayfish and occasional bald
eagle that scavenge the carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask, `Do you clean up the creek?''' Faike said. ``I
tell them that just becomes food for somebody else. Those fish that
remain are flushed out in the high, heavy stream flows the
following spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, recycling at its finest.

VAUGHN `TO PLAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE,' RED SOX SAY 
</HEADLINE>

 (Edits, new information)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ The Red Sox' protracted, often acrimonious bid to
re-sign slugger Mo Vaughn ended for all intents and purposes
Wednesday night when general manager Dan Duquette said the free
agent first baseman had rejected the club's latest offer and
decided to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the general managers' meetings here, Duquette _ who
earlier in the day had sweetened Boston's offer, according to the
Vaughn camp _ said, ``It looks like he's going to play for someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That someone else is not necessarily the Anaheim Angels, who
gave the Sox a lofty target to aim at when they offered Vaughn a
guaranteed six-year, $72 million package last Friday when all clubs
became eligible to bid for free agents, not just the players'
present employers.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn did not indicate where he'd be heading, Duquette said
Wednesday night. ``He's going to put his efforts somewhere else,
and we are, too. We're going to look at some other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Other options for the Sox apparently involve Yankees center
fielder Bernie Williams, the American League batting champion, and
tempestuous Chicago White Sox slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gammons of ESPN, a Globe columnist, reported that Williams
will be in Boston next Thursday, and Duquette sounded enthusiastic
about the possible addition of Belle despite his notorious
off-field reputation. However, Williams reportdely is being heavily
courted by the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, it seemed the Sox' chances of retaining
Vaughn had improved. In the wake of Anaheim's offer, they had come
up with a five-year, $60 million proposal _ in the neighborhood of
what they gave pitcher Pedro Martinez last December (six years, $75
million) when they made him the highest-paid player in baseball at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette indicated that the Sox had increased their offer in
terms of length Wednesday when they met twice with Vaughn's agents,
Tom Reich and Mark Gillam.
</P>
<P>
   That offer proved unacceptable, but in the final analysis, the
hostility that punctuated the 1 1/2-year negotiations may have been
the determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   During those talks, Vaughn had claimed to be insulted by several
Red Sox offers, most recently a four-year, $37.5 million proposal
at the All-Star break. He also had been miffed that the team
seemingly took care of other key players _ such as second-year
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra _ while keeping him dangling. And after
he indicated he was on the verge of re-signing in December, the Sox
gave their blockbuster package to Martinez, and all bets were off.
In January, Vaughn was charged with drunken driving after his truck
overturned late one night while he was returning from the Foxy Lady
strip club in Providence. Vaughn eventually was acquitted of the
charges, but in the meantime, the team insisted that he submit to
alcohol evaluation as a condition for getting a new offer, and from
there, relations deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   While Duquette told Gammons Wednesday night, ``You never say
never,'' seemingly keeping the door ajar for a change of heart by
either the player or the team, chances for that appear
infinitesimal.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the 1995 AL Most Valuable Player who this past season
batted .337 (second to Williams) with 40 homers and 115 RBIs, told
Channel 4's Steve Burton Wednesday night outside his Easton, Mass.,
home, ``I'm not moving, I'm just going somewhere else to work. I
think it's just a situation where people didn't see eye to eye.
You've got to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take our time and weigh it out and do the right thing
when the time comes. I don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette now will leave the meetings here this morning, not to
return to Boston but to meet with prospective free agent signees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to our fans to present good players,'' Duquette
said, ``and there are a limited supply of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   In other business, the Red Sox made a minor deal with Arizona
for righthanded pitcher Bob Wolcott, who made a brief splash three
years ago when he was a surprise Game 1 starter for Seattle in the
1995 American League Championship Series against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also officially lost lefthanded reliever Greg Swindell,
who signed a three-year contract for $5.7 million with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   As a Class A free agent, Swindell, will net the Sox an
additional first-round sandwich pick as well as a second-round
choice in compensation.

PENALTY SHOT SPARKS DEVILS OVER MONTREAL, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In a hockey rarity, the New Jersey
Devils wound up turning a two-man disadvantage into a score
Wednesday night that sparked New Jersey to a 3-0 victory over the
Montreal Canadiens at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were down two players when Scott Niedermayer broke
away down the middle of the ice and was tripped. He was awarded a
penalty shot that he converted with a crafty move from right to
left and back to right before a crowd of 14,017, and Montreal never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's penalty shot was not the only highlight for the
Devils. Krzysztof Oliwa scored his first goal of the season and
third in 87 career games, and Sergei Brylin scored his first of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of offensive success _ and with Martin Brodeur
playing brilliantly in goal _ the Devils emerged with a victory,
even though they played without the suspended Bobby Holik and the
injured Dave Andreychuk, two of their biggest and most physical
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   It was New Jersey's first shutout of the season at Continental
Arena. The victory was the fifth in the last six games for the
Devils. It improved their record to 8-5-0 and gave them a share of
the Eastern Conference lead with the Penguins, who visit the Devils
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer was awarded the penalty shot after he broke away on
the left while the Canadiens had a two-man advantage and was
tripped by Patrice Brisebois, who dived at the Devils' skater with
his outstretched stick in a desperate attempt to thwart the speedy
Niedermayer just a few feet from the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty shot, 64 seconds into the middle period, was the
first for the Devils since John MacLean, now with the Rangers, beat
Dominik Hasek of Buffalo in a 4-1 victory here Feb. 2, 1997. It was
the 13th penalty shot in the history of the team and the second for
Niedermayer, who failed on his first attempt, against Ken Wregget
of Pittsburgh, on Feb. 7, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa's goal in the opening period was a gift from Jose
Theodore, the Canadiens' goaltender, who left his crease to control
Lyle Odelein's dump pass behind his net. When Theodore missed the
puck, Oliwa gained control, went around the goal from right to left
and deposited the puck into the unguarded net with 7 minutes 48
seconds left in the first period.

   This was the fourth consecutive start for Theodore, who came
into the game with three consecutive victories in which he had
allowed only four goals. The Canadiens, meanwhile, scored 13 in
those victories.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadiens had trouble finding the target against
Brodeur, who played all four games against the Canadiens last
season and registered a 1.72 goals-against average in three
victories and a loss. Brodeur looked sharp throughout the game, in
particular on shots by Shayne Corson midway through the second
period.

RANGERS FALL EASILY TO PANTHERS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ After scoring 16 goals in their last two games,
the Rangers made people wonder if they were simply two-game wonders
or a juggernaut in the making. Wednesday night's evidence points
toward the former.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were handcuffed by a motivated Florida Panthers team
and fell limply, 4-1, at the National Car Rental Center.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the 22-year-old Dan Cloutier stop 26 shots in a
10-2 rout of Tampa Bay on Tuesday, Mike Richter returned to the
Ranger goal Wednesday night. That brought to the surface a flood of
bitter memories from the Panthers' management.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bryan Murray was convinced he had secured
Richter as a free agent in the off-season, but Richter made a late
decision to stay with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was assured when I made the offer that there was no right to
match as far as the Rangers were concerned,'' Murray said. ``But
the second I got off the phone, the first thing he did was run to
Neil Smith with my offer,'' he said, referring to the Rangers'
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Murray clearly remains angry about Richter changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told Mike afterward at the time, I didn't think he
showed very much character or honor by doing that,'' Murray said.
``Mike came to me with a proposal he liked, but all he did was use
it as a way to drive the price up for the Rangers. Mike had all the
leverage, and that's the way he decided to conduct his business.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, Richter, for the most part, showed why the Panthers
were so eager to part with $31 million over six years _ even facing
a Florida team playing as if Murray had promised extra cash for a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Richter played steadily if somewhat unluckily through two
periods. He was victimized 21 seconds from second period's end by a
30-foot shot from defenseman Ed Jovanovski. The puck hit an
unidentified Ranger near the net and bounced over Richter's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Yet luck had nothing to do with a goal 3 minutes 23 seconds into
the third that gave the hosts a 3-1 bulge. Defenseman Robert Svehla
received a pass from center Dave Gagner on the right side and
rocketed a 10-footer by Richter and into the net's left corner.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it have anything to do with Florida's fourth goal _ a
breakaway by wing Ray Whitney at 11:44 of the final period.
Whitney, heading in from the left, faked Richter into diving, held
the puck for an instant and then scored easily from an open right
angle.
</P>
<P>
   Just as coach John Muckler had feared after the rollicking
domination of Tampa Bay made scoring look so elementary, the
Rangers did not display the same early grit or aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And that enabled the Panthers to seize early control.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2:57 into the game, Florida broke through on Richter. Johan
Garpenlov's shot was blocked, but the puck skidded back to fellow
wing Oleg Kvasha near the net. He slammed it between a scrambling
Richter's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida also built a 10-3 shot advantage in the period, before
the Rangers closed to 12-7 by the period's end. Defenseman Ulf
Samuelsson, who had two goals the night before, almost slipped a
25-footer by goalie Sean Burke at 15:42.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous thing about the period was the absence of
penalties, considering the National Hockey League was using dual
referees: Kevin Maguire and Dan Marouelli. Previous Panthers home
games this season with two referees have averaged nearly 30
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the game's first penalty did not come until 7:06 of the
second period. It was against Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom for
his tripping of Panthers wing Dave Nemirovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers evened the game at the 16:14 mark of the second
period, thanks to Adam Graves' persistence around the net. Graves
jumped on defenseman Peter Popovic's deflected shot, which was set
up by a close-range, behind-the-net feed from Wayne Gretzky. It was
Graves' fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a case for the Rangers of not enough offensive
firepower. Center Marc Savard, who had totaled a goal and five
assists in his first two games since being called up, was among the
Rangers being shut out.
