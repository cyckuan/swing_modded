<HEADLINE> Croatia Halts Oil Supply to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Croatia has halted its oil supply
to Yugoslavia since NATO started air strikes on Yugoslavia on
Wednesday, the evening newspaper Vecerni List reported.
</P>
<P>
Adria Oil Pipeline Company of Croatia was quoted by the paper
published here as saying on Sunday that it had stopped supplying
oil to Serbia and it would not resume the supply in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian company had a contract with Serbia Oil Company of
Yugoslavia to supply 2.5 million metric tons of oil in 1999. But
less than 350,000 tons has been sent to Serbia so far in the first
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Loss of Plane Will Not Affect NATO's Air Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The loss of a stealth F-117A
fighter in Yugoslavia would not affect the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) air campaign against the Serbian government as
the attacks widen to target Serb forces in Kosovo, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to move into a wider array of targets including
not only those dealing with command-and-control structures,
ammunition dumps, but also start to go after the forces in the
field as such," Cohen said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the stealth fighter that went down west of
Belgrade Saturday was in "good shape" after being picked up by a
NATO search and rescue team, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Henry Shelton,
also on NBC, said they still could not say whether the plane was
shot down or suffered a mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
Shelton stressed that despite four days of punishing strikes on
Serbia's air defense system, "the skies are very dangerous, they
have a very well integrated, multilevel robust air defense system.
We are working on it but it is still a dangerous environment to
fly in."
</P>
<P>
NATO pledged to continue airstrikes against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's forces until he halts his "attacks on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo," which are reported to have increased since
NATO launched the air campaign Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President bill Clinton said in a statement Saturday that
he strongly supported the decision by NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana to move into a second phase of the air campaign to
include a wider range of targets that will focus more on Serb Army
and police facilities, troops and weapons.
</P>
<P>
Most targets in four nights of attacks have been against the
Serb's robust air defense system, especially radar and
communications sites that if taken out can "blind" anti-aircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Serb military claimed that one of its missiles had shot
down the F-117A Nighthawk, whose stealth technology makes it
almost invisible to enemy radar. Serb television showed flames
rising from the downed aircraft several hours before the Pentagon
and NATO confirmed it was lost.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense officials, however, said it wasn't yet clear
whether the F-117A had been shot down or whether it had mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
The stealth fighter's loss was the first by NATO in the Kosovo
operation. NATO, however, claimed that it has shot down five
Russian-made MiG-29 jet fighters, including two that had flow over
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Wins Again to Top League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Striker Qu Shengxin scored a
spectacular goal to gave the newly-promoted side Liaoning Fushun a
2-1 victory over Shenzhen Ping'an for the second straight win in
the Chinese soccer league on Sunday in Fushun, Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted the former China's soccer powerhouse to the
leading place with the maximum six points from the past two rounds.
The team produced its more shocking 1-0 triumph over defending
champion Dalian Wanda in the season's opening match.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an coasted past Shenyang Haishi with a 4-0 thrash
at home to climb to second place with four points, followed by
Sichuan Quanxing, who drew a perfect 3-0 victory over Wuhan Heart
K in away match, on goals difference.
</P>
<P>
Wanda drew with Tianjin Taida in a goalless match in Tianjin,
scoring no goal yet and collecting only one point after two games
to moan at 12th place in the 14-team tournament, the worse start
for the three-time champion in the five-season league.
</P>
<P>
Qu's goal came in the 66th minute when midfielder Li Tie
sparked a counter attack with a back-over-shoulder pass after he
intercepted Ping'an's pass in the front court.
</P>
<P>
Qu, who scored the only goal in the defeat of Wanda in the
first-round match, which ended Wanda' five-season undefeatable
record at home court, dribbled the ball into the box before he
beat two defenders and the goalie to strike.
</P>
<P>
Losing starting striker Zhang Yuning, Fushun, who was relegated
in the 1995 season to the second division league, made it 1-1 on
the goal from the replacement Bai Guangping in the 43ed minute in
the Leifeng Stadium, three minutes after the visiting side took a
lead.
</P>
<P>
In Jinan, Shandong Taishan surrendered its home side advantage
and two-goal lead with 35 minutes left, losing 3-2 to Guangzhou
Songri.
</P>
<P>
Li Ming found the target twice in the 39th and 55th minutes to
put the home team in the driving seat in the 40,000-packed
Shandong Sports Center.
</P>
<P>
But Li tackled Songri's striker Wei Yimin in the penalty area
in the 62nd minute. Zhao Changhong scored and took the visiting
side into the game.
</P>
<P>
Wei scored a 76th-minute goal to level the scoring before Zhao
shot his second and winner on a header with one minute to play.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other matches, Shanghai Shenhua drew with Jilin
Aodong 1-1 at home and Qingdao Hainiu was held to a 1-1 draw by
Chongqing Longxin.

<HEADLINE> NATO on Brink of Civilian Disaster, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Sunday that the
allied forces was on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"On the political front, we are very concerned about the
security and stability of the neighboring countries to Yugoslavia,
particularly partner countries of this alliance," Jamie Shea, the
spokesman, told a news briefing at the NATO headquarters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO chief Javier Solana had long discussions with prime
minister of former Yugoslav republic Macedonia, and he also
talked yesterday evening with the Albanian prime minister. "With
both prime ministers, he discussed deteriorating humanitarian
situation in and around Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shea said this was the most significant development of the past
few days. "Whether we like it or not, we have to recognize that we
are on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, which
had not been seen in Europe since the closing stages of World War
Two."
</P>
<P>
He also said the estimated number of people who are now
displaced from their homes in Kosovo has outnumbered half million
mark, which is well in access of 25 percent of total population of
Kosovo. "That number is increasing at a rapid pace."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that just over the last few days,
50,000 people were trying to seek shelters wherever they can while
about 20,000 people fleeing form fighting in the northern and
central areas of Kosovo trying to get into Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government had informed the NATO that in last few
hours alone, it had accepted between eight to ten thousand of
these refugees, many of them were still on the border, the
spokesman told reporters, adding that this is a new situation
created on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK Is Bound to Cut Basic Rate Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON March 28 (Xinhua) - Expectations of another cut in UK
interest rates have heightened after a series of official figures
released recently by the Office of National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The UK's economy grew in the final quarter of 1998 was revised
downward from 0.2 percent to just 0.1 percent; its trade position
is worsening and inflation in February fell to lowest level in
more than four years.
</P>
<P>
The revised figures took most economists here by surprise, and
raise fears that the UK could be heading for another downturn,
increasing the chances of further interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said: "The inflation figures confirm our view that
inflationary pressures on the economy remain negligible."
</P>
<P>
"The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee should cut
interest rates by a half percent when it next meets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller, UK economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
the GDP numbers would "rekindle hopes of a further rate cut in the
fairly near future."
</P>
<P>
The British government has forecast that the UK will avoid
recession in 1999, continuing to grow at between 1 percent and 1.5
percent. However, the forecast was dented by all the above revised
figures.
</P>
<P>
The UK's trade gap increased to a new record in January as the
strength of sterling and a collapse in demand from countries hit
by the global economic crisis sent exports plunging.
</P>
<P>
Its deficit in goods expanding from 2.2bn pounds (3.52 bn US
dollars) in December to 2.8bn pounds (4.48bn US dollars) in
January.
</P>
<P>
Britain's traditional strength in services helped offset the
problems in the goods sector. But, even there the surplus has
fallen steadily from the 1.1bn pounds (1.75bn US dollars) recorded
last August to 0.8bn pounds (1.28bn US dollars) in January.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the unexpected fall in inflation leaves the
economists in the City believe that the Bank of England will cut
rates agains next month.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments,
climbed by 0.3 percentage points in February, compared with
January, to leave the annual rate down from 2.6 percent to 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid decline in inflation and the weaker than expected GDP
data by the ONS, revived calls for the Bank to cut rates by up to
half a point.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest decline was welcomed by Chancellor Gordon
Brown. He said the inflation should remain on target throughout
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor also insisted that recent economic figures
suggested that the Government's forecast of growth between 1
percent and 1.5 percent was "reasonable".
</P>
<P>
"The economy is performing better than some people imagined
some months ago. And I think you'll find that independent
assessments are moving again closer to our figures for next year,"
Brown added.
</P>
<P>
The British economy has so far avoided plunging into recession
partly thanks to aggressive interest rate cuts by the MPC since
last October.
</P>
<P>
Rates have fallen by 200 basis points to 5.5 percent, and look
set to come down even further, possibly to 5.0 percent, in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund recently praised Britain for
its "skillful management" and said prompt monetary and fiscal
policy responses should ensure that the economic slowdown would be
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's annual report concluded that there is room for
Britain to cut basic rate further.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Aoshen created more
chance to make it into the finals of the Chinese basketball first-
division league in its first year as the team upset the Shandong
Flaming Bulls 115-86 in the first of the best-of-three playoffs on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Aoshen, who lost in the two encounters to the fourth-placed
Flaming Bulls in the preliminary rounds, could qualify for the
finals with a victory on the away games in the series.
</P>
<P>
The next two games, if necessary, will play in the home court
of the Flaming Bulls, who had better finishing in the preliminary
round than the Aoshen.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the Shanghai Sharks were another surprise as they
crushed Guangdong Tigers 101-79 in the first game of the series.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 46-48 at the interval, the Sharks used a second-half
surge to handle off the third-placed Tigers of the previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, leaders Bayi Rockets left no chance to the
Zhejiang Cyclone with a 135-91 thrash in Hangzhou, Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Ducks lost 112-83 to the Liaoning Hunters, almost
out of the contention for the finals hopes.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other playoffs for 9-12 places, the Jilin Northeast
Tigers defeated the Jiangsu Dragons 100-92, and the Sichuan Pandas
beat the Jinan Army 107-89.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Austrian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
his Austrian counterpart Thomas Klestil here Sunday, with both
sides speaking highly of the relations between China and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state agreed that friendly cooperation between
the two countries has been progressing and the frequent exchange
of visits between their leaders are conducive to pushing forward
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Klestil said there has been an upsurge of capital
flows from Austria to China, and that bilateral cultural exchanges
have been active.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China would work hard with Austria to keep up the
good momentum of friendly exchanges in various fields between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kosovo, Klestil expressed his worry about the
crisis, adding that Austria only joins peacekeeping programs
sponsored by the United Nations, so it has not allowed NATO
fighter planes to fly over its territorial air space.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's stance on Kosovo, Jiang said China believes
many problems this world is faced with should be solved through
negotiations rather than by resorting to force, and the strong
should not bully the weak.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the five principles of peaceful coexistence
should reign over state-to-state relations, with the non-
interference in each other's internal affairs at the core.
</P>
<P>
He said sincere consultation should govern relations between
states, rather than a conclusion made by one country in advance
and imposed on the other.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that at the turn of the century, all countries
should work together to make the world of the next century one of
peace, friendship and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian president praised China's signing of two
international convenants concerning human rights, saying that the
European Union's decision not to raise the motion against China is
a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reaffirmed China's principle and position on human rights,
stressing that dialogue is the best way to deal with different
views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters after the meeting that China and Western
nations share common views as well as different ones on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
People of Western Europe have less understanding of such a
distant country as China, which has a population of 1.2 billion,
and they have less understanding of the problems it is facing and
the great achievements it has scored in various fields, including
human rights, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China welcomes people from all walks of life come to
visit the country and see with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
As for disputes and different views, Jiang said China proposes
to increase mutual understanding through dialogues.

Organization", and "Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair, god will punish
you for your sins in yugoslavia", among others.
</P>
<P>
Some could not hold back their tears at the gathering while
condemning the strike.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the yugoslav community Kosta Jeremic said at
the gathering that "NATO bombing of Yugoslavia is pure aggression
with the pretext of preventing a humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
it is a cynical excuse for forcefully occupying a sovereign
country -- cynical because NATO and its gauleiter U.S.A. created
a humanitarian catastrophe in kosovo and Metohija, where both
Serbs and Albanians die for NATO's dominance in the Balkans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jeremic said that the Yugoslav army in Kosovo and Metohija is
not an occupying army, since Kosovo and metohija is an integral
part of Yugoslavia,
</P>
<P>
the same as the British army in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Ground Operation in Yugoslavia too Risky: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said on Sunday a land operation to be staged by NATO forces
against Yugoslavia will be too risky.
</P>
<P>
"NATO aims at weakening Serbia's offensive capacity with the
air strikes. I do not think that a land operation is required for
the time being, " said the Turkish minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), supports the military bloc's ongoing air strikes against
Yugoslavia which were launched Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will not be such a requirement in the future. My
concern is that the conflict may spread to neighboring
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "if the conflict spreads to Albania, Macedonia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, it will cause a grave disaster."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Serb-led government in Yugoslavia
will come to a compromise with NATO before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ecevit Sunday met with Albanian Ambassador Saimir
Bala and discussed with him NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia
and the latest developments in Kosovo, a southern province of
Yugoslavia where majority ethnic Albanians have been fighting for
independence.

<HEADLINE> Solana Does Not Foresee Sending of Ground Force to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said on Sunday that NATO does not plan for the moment to
send ground forces to Kosovo, despite increasing reports on
atrocities committed by Serb forces against Albanians.
</P>
<P>
``We don't think at this moment of deploying ground forces in
the field, '' said Solana in an interview with the French
television channel TF1.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the NATO countries, including France, have
decided not to deploy a ground force unless a political agreement
is reached with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
``So, this will be a force for implementing the political
agreements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On the reported atrocities being committed by Serb forces
against Kosovo Albanians, Solana said that it can be called
``ethnic weeping up.''
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO is waiting for the results from the Phase II
airstrikes against Serb forces, which extended from Saturday
bombing operations to Serb ground forces, before deciding whether
to start a Phase III.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said earlier on Sunday
that the hypothesis of a ground war in Yugoslavia does not stand.
</P>
<P>
He said that one forth of the Albanians in Kosovo are driven
out of their homes in a tragic situation.
</P>
<P>
``According to the figures have have now, it is more or less
than 27 percent of the population of Kosovo are driven out of
their homes. We can imagine the tragedy for this part of Serbia,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that more than half a million
Kosovo Albanians have been driven out of their homes by Serbs
since NATO started bombing Yugoslav targets on Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
Klima first of all briefed Jiang on the process of European

</P>
<P>
He believed that the 21st century will be one of

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Sunday that he strongly support the decision made by Javier
Solana, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), to move to a new phase in the planned air
campaign with a broader range of targets, including air defenses,
military and security targets, and forces in the field in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the key NATO allies, including British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, share the
U.S. determination to respond strongly to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's "continuing campaign of inhumane violence
against the Kosovar Albanian people," Clinton said in a brief
speech at the White House.
</P>
<P>
NATO has pledged to continue airstrikes against Yugoslav
President Milosevic's forces until he halts his "attacks on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo," which are reported to have increased since
NATO launched the air campaign Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen also said
that the United States and its allies are going to move into a
wider array of targets including not only those dealing with
command-and-control structures, ammunition dumps, but also start
to go after the forces in the field as such.

PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said on Saturday that Yugoslavia's military power is being
weakened by NATO airstrikes.

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to strengthen his power.
</P>
<P>
``If we let Milosevic to have three and six more months to
continue methodically the violence and aggression against the
Kosovo people, would that weaken his dictatorship?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Serbian people, despite ``a gaging of
information,'' would understand that NATO is only attacking
military targets instead of resorting to ``carpet bombing.''
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the sending of a NATO ground force to Kosovo,
unless within the framework of a political agreement with
Yugoslavia.

MOSCOW -- Belgrade is prepared to solve the Kosovo issue
peacefully but will not return to the negotiating table when NATO
airstrikes are underway, said Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vok
Draskovic on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic told the Russian Nezavisimoye Televideniye (
Independent Television Station) that the Yugoslav leadership is
prepared for talks on granting the Kosovo residents with extensive
autonomy, but such talks should be held only after NATO ceases its
air raids over Yugoslavia. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo-Statement)

BERLIN -- German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Sunday
that "the path to peace" remained open to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic but Belgrade must first stop "the policy of
violence" in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a political solution. We are still asking
Milosevic to follow the path of peace," Fischer said during a
Europe-Asia foreign ministers meeting in Berlin. He also ruled out
the deployment of allied ground forces to deter Serb military
presence in Kosovo. "There is already a war on the ground and I
see no prospect for the dispatch of Western troops." (Germany-

<HEADLINE> Forum on Renewable Energy in Africa Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A three-day business and
investment forum on renewable energy in Africa started here Monday
to look at effective financing mechanisms of renewable energy
projects in African countries and other developing countries of
the world.
</P>
<P>
About 150 delegates to attend the forum will discuss the
transfer of energy technology, global climatic change, global
renewable energy education and training program, opportunities for
bilateral cooperation within the global renewable energy and the
World Solar Program (1996-2005).
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
who is chairman of the World Solar Commission, said investment in
renewable energy is of critical importance to the development of
Africa and other developing regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Today, over two billion people in developing countries have no
source of energy available to them other than the traditional
firewood and other forms of biomass... This situation is likely to
remain so in the foreseeable future due to the excessive costs of
extending the grid system to needy areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe believed that the situation can only be rectified
through the adoption of an energy supply mix in developing
countries. In this regard, he said, the role of renewable energy
is pivotal in achieving the appropriate mix so that energy supply
is extended to areas of greatest need and where the impact would
be salutary in terms of overall national development.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president also urged all countries to adopt
industrial policies that favor the promotion, market penetration
and technology transfer of renewable energy systems.

PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- France said on Monday that it is
encouraging Germany, which is serving as the rotating presidency
of the European Union (EU), to call for an international
conference to coordinate humanitarian aid for Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Membership and participants in the conference should consist of
the EU, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (
OSCE), the member countries of the Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia, and humanitarian organizations such as the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees, said the French Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The German government said on Sunday that it will contact other
Western countries to discuss the provisioning of aid to the
refugees from Kosovo and also suggested an international
conference in the event of a "humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Since NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia last week,
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have left their
homes and entered neighboring countries such as Albania and

Li said he believes that differences can be reduced or removed,
and difficulties overcome gradually in the spirit of equality,
friendliness, mutual respect and seeking common ground.
</P>
<P>

WTO needs China more. China's entry into the WTO is beneficial for
both, he noted, adding it is unjust that the WTO has blocked
China's entry for so long.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made great efforts in its bid for WTO
membership, and on this issue China has been active, principled
and patient.
</P>
<P>
He said complicated and profound changes are taking place in

just and rational order in international politics and economy as
soon as possible to provide human beings with a peaceful and equal
environment.

<P>
He stressed that an important step was taken in developing
democracy and a legal system in China when the latest NPC session
added to China's Constitution the principle of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-U.S. relations, Li said that it is natural that
some differences exist between China and the United States since
the two countries differ in social systems, historic background
and the level of economic development.

The question is how to regard and approach these differences,

<HEADLINE> Japan Offers 88 Billion Yen of Assistance to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan has agreed to provide Vietnam
an official development assistance (ODA) worth 88 billion yen (734
million U.S. dollars) in the 1998 fiscal year, according to a
press release issued by Vietnam News Agency Monday on the
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai's visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Khai, who arrived in Japan Sunday for a three-day official
visit, met with the Japanese emperor and had talks with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi over a wide range of issues on
bilateral relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Obuchi reiterated Japan's
commitment to helping Vietnam implement reform and renovation.
</P>
<P>
Khai highly valued Japan's unceasing assistance to Vietnam and
affirmed that Vietnam will continue efforts to renovate its
economy.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, the Japanese government decided to
provide an official development assistance (ODA) worth 88 billion
yen in the 1998 fiscal year to develop Vietnam's infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side also considered a special soft loan in yen
to Vietnam which was announced by Prime Minister Obuchi in Hanoi
last December.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to take some measures to tackle with the
declining of Japanese investment in Vietnam in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
the two prime ministers have suggested the application of
most-favored-nation tariff rates for each other on a reciprocal
basis. The two countries would take into due consideration the
need to sign a bilateral trade agreement at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese prime minister is scheduled to end his visit to
Japan Tuesday. He will visit Australia from Wednesday to Saturday.
</P>

<P>
NICOSIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Cyprus
Georgi Mouradov on Monday called on the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization not to adopt a "double standards" policy.
</P>
<P>
"Let them think about what they are sacrificing in the name of
so-called humanitarian aid which they do not offer to other parts
of the world where similar situations exist," said the Russian
ambassador after a meeting with Cyprus House of Representatives
(parliament) President Spyros Kypirianou.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said he does not advocate a similar reaction in
other parts of the world but added "double standards must be not
be applied."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Russia will exhaust all diplomatic means to
resolve Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov described the situation in Yugoslavia as "very
worrying which endangers the world peace and the existence of
humanity".
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's intervention is "a blatant violation of the
international law and the U.N. Charter".
</P>
<P>
"If we move on to military means, we will be faced with grave
dangers for humanity and Russia will not jeopardize the world
peace and will not act in the same irresponsible manner that NATO
countries apply," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov also said Russia is a nuclear power and remains
an important factor in the world stage and its opinion should
be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces have launched daily air attacks on Yugoslavia
since last Wednesday after Belgrade refused to sign a peace deal
with Kosovo Albanians which would allow NATO troops to be deployed
on Yugoslav soil.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Sentiment Index in U.S. Falls During March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The index reflecting consumer
sentiment fell to 105.7 this month following a 108.1 reading in
February, reflecting concerns about higher interest rates, the
Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the index in a survey conducted by the University of
Michigan, remains high and indicates that consumers remain
confident about the economy's performance.
</P>
<P>
Half of all households surveyed reported that their financial
situation recently improved, while only 6 percent expected
financial conditions to worsen later this year. The survey also
showed that consumers, spurred by discounting and low interest
rates, are still eager to buy cars, but their enthusiasm for
buying homes has slipped, partly because mortgage rates have
inched up recently.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the majority of participants in the survey
expect interest rates to creep up a bit, but they say it won't
stop the economy from growing over the next several years.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Urged to Start Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's pro-British
Ulster Unionists issued a firm statement Monday urging Sinn Fein
to demonstrate their commitment to the peace process by obtaining
a start to decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein must show their commitment to the word and spirit of
the agreement by removing the implicit threat of violence that the
IRA presents," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of a fully armed and active IRA, without so much
as a credible and verifiable start to a process of decommissioning
is an obvious sign of this lack of commitment."
</P>
<P>
"We are acutely aware that there are many people out there
hurting as a result of prisoner releases. Well over half the
prisoners have been released and still not a single bullet or
ounce of Semtex has been handed over," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued as the province's political leaders
started a new round of talks less than a week ahead of the
deadline for a deal.
</P>
<P>
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, will join the talks later in the day to discuss how to break
the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has suggested Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
might allocate places on the assembly's executive without a start
to arms disposal by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The British government has set a 2 April deadline for an
agreement between the parties over the disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria not to Join Military Action in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will not be involved,
either directly or indirectly, in any military action in
Kosovo crisis, visiting Bulgarian Parliament Speaker Jordan
Sokolov said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sokolov, who arrived here Sunday on a two-day visit, said
Bulgaria hopes to see an end to the conflict as it is facing the
gravest economic risks.
</P>
<P>
Sokolov said air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia are unwanted but necessary.
</P>
<P>
"We view the involvement of NATO as the ultimate undesired but
unfortunately necessary way to make one of the sides, that is the
regime in Belgrade, accept the proposed arrangements by the
contact group," he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, he said, provide "good foundation for finding a
solution to the problem in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
NATO started its air strikes against Serb targets last
Wednesday after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to
accept a West-proposed agreement over Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between the Serb-led government and
independence-seeking Kosovo ethnic Albanians have been raging
since early last year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral relations, Sokolov described them as
traditionally friendly and said these can be improved.
</P>
<P>
"We share our European orientation and we decided to join our
efforts and help each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cypriot Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou said
this visit signals the start of a new and closer cooperation
between the two parliaments in view of their European orientation.
</P>
<P>
"There is great scope to improve our cooperation," he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Troops Sent When Deal Reached, Spokesman Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Monday that the
ground troops of the alliance will be sent only when a peace
agreement is reached about the future of Kosovo, the southern
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the alliance has any plan to send ground troops
or some early contingency forces, Jamie Shea, the spokesman, said
NATO's policy remains unchanged. What NATO is doing now is for a
political solution to the autonomy in Kosovo, he told reporters at
a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Shea said the ground troops will play a peacekeeping role in
Kosovo after both sides agree to a deal. "The ground troops will
be sent when, only when, a peace agreement is concluded," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, NATO chief Javier Solana said that the alliance was
not planning to send ground troops into Kosovo at present, but he
did not ruled out such option in the future.
</P>
<P>
"At this time, deployment of ground forces in Kosovo is not
being considered," he told the Spanish television station
Telecinco. But when asked about future deployment, he said: "I
don't known how events will develop."
</P>
<P>
In another development, Russian Prime Minister Evgueni Primakov
is reportedly going to Belgrade Tuesday morning for a peace
mission to persuade the Yugoslav leadership to accept a deal while
trying to halt NATO air strikes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Shea said it will be welcomed if Primakov can convince
Milosevic to go back to the negotiation table.

TAIYUAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 volunteers from the
Beijing-based Green Home organization planted hundreds of pine
trees along the Yellow River near Hukou Waterfall Sunday, marking
the start of a series of ecological and environmental tourism
activities in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River is the second longest river in China after the
Yangtze, and its basin is regarded as the birthplace of Chinese
civilization.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Yellow River has been running dry for
longer and longer periods because of ecological deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Among Sunday's volunteers, the oldest was 73 and the youngest
only seven. Many of the planters are Chinese and foreign
journalists and experts working in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Time for New WTO Chief From Developing World: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- It is time for a candidate from
the developing world to take the top post of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a report from Thailand's permanent delegation
to the Geneva-based organization quoted several WTO members as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, available here Monday, also urged all members of
the world trade governing body to exercise more accommodation so
that a consensus could emerge around a sole contender.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi is enjoying a lead in the race for the WTO top post.
But his only remaining rival now, New Zealand's former prime
minister Mike Moore, is narrowing the gap.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Chairman of the WTO's ruling General
Assembly Ali Said Mchumo from Tanzania also urged consensus among
members on one of the two remaining competitors.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the report as saying that he hoped the
selection process for the organization's new chief could be
completed by the scheduled March 31 and could be formally
announced at the next meeting of the WTO General Assembly on April
14.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have expressed their views that a consensus
should emerge around Supachai due to his lead in all the soundings
over the past five months and that it was time the WTO should have
director-general from the developing world after the rich
countries had controlled the seat for half a century, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Supachai left Bangkok late Sunday for Geneva to seek last-ditch
support from WTO members, especially those that are yet to declare
their clear stance in the ongoing race.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that he will meet U.S. envoy to the WTO to seek
Washington's clear position for the matter.

<HEADLINE> Tax Law Stressed by Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
released an open letter urging that taxation departments at all
levels enhance their efforts to publicize the tax laws in order to
raise the tax-paying awareness of the public and create a better
social environment for tax-collection.
</P>
<P>
April will be a month specially designated for publicizing
taxation, as it has been since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier, who is also member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China, said in his letter that over 90 percent of all
government revenue comes from taxation.
</P>
<P>
Officials should view taxation work as an important political
issue, one that is closely related to the maintenance of state
power, the stability of social order, the improvement of people's
living standards, the progress of the current reform and opening-
up, and the normal operations of government departments, the vice-
premier said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that for various historical and social reasons,
the public's awareness of taxation is relatively weak throughout
society, the collection of taxes has not been going as smoothly as
possible, and there is still a long way to go to raise taxation
awareness in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that publicizing tax laws has a special meaning for
China this year as the country resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao, celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China, and furthers reform and economic
development.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After four nights of air attacks focused on wearing down
Yugoslav air defenses, U.S. and allied aircraft moved into a
campaign aimed more at cutting off Yugoslav supply lines to Kosovo
and obliterating storage and staging areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- As NATO stepped up its bombing in Yugoslavia, it faced a new
challenge: how to prevent a flood of ethnic Albanian refugees from
Kosovo from destabilizing the fragile governments of Albania and
Macedonia -- and possibly the rest of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Sloboden Milosevic, defiant as ever and proud of his
nation's resistance to NATO's air attacks, staged a rock concert
on Sunday in the center of Belgrade to show solidarity with the
soldiers facing down the allied assaults.
</P>
<P>
-- Cuban President Fidel Castro met in Havana on Sunday with
Baltimore Orioles players, the first U.S. major league team that
visited the Caribbean nation in 40 years, just before the game
started. Baltimore beat the Cuban team, 3-2, in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- European government bonds fell and Hungary postponed a 750
million dollar bond offering amid war in Yugoslavia, while the
euro hit a new low against the dollar.
</P>

-- CBS is in talks to buy King World, a production and
distribution company, for as much as 3 billion dollars, looking to

<HEADLINE> NATO Campaign Will Intensify: British PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Monday said the NATO campaign in Yugoslavia should intensify to
make President Slobodan Milosevic pay a heavy price in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"In my view we have to intensify it and we have to see it
through," Blair said in an interview with BBC World Service radio.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the Serbs who support Milosevic would not do
so if they could see what he was doing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister alleged that Milosevic and his forces are
committing "atrocities" against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Blair dismissed suggestions that NATO attacks had helped
provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo instead of preventing
one, arguing the latest wave of ethnic cleansing by Belgrade was
already under way when the first bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the idea that the bombing campaign should stop
after only a few days.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Blair said that despite the contempt and
revulsion he felt for the Yugoslav president, he still favored a
political solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Proposes Debt Reconciliation Meeting with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has proposed a round-
table discussion on debts with its creditors to reconcile
conflicting figures on the country's external debts.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is to be represented at the meeting by Head of State
General Abdulsalami Abubakar, president-elect Olusegun Obasanjo,
the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Ministry of Finance,
the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alhji lsmaila Usman said the meeting would be
held before Abubakar hands over power to a democratically-elected
government on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and the World Bank have for years been engaged over
the country' s actual external liabilities to external creditors.
While Nigeria said the debt should be about 28 billion U.S.
dollars, the World Bank has put it at about 32 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
ln 1997, Nigeria sent a delegation abroad to vet creditors'
claims and reconcile the accounts, an exercise that informed
Nigeria's endorsement of about 28 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Nigerian government has begun a
process of determining the nation's actual external indebtedness,
which is expected to be completed by July this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the proposed round-table discussion was to
explore ways and means of either writing off or granting a
moratorium or both of the outstanding total debts yet to be paid.

MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia has decided to recall a
group of officers based at NATO in protest over air strikes
against Yugoslavia, a senior defense ministry officer announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
General Leonid Ivashov of the Russian Defense Ministry told
ITAR-TASS that Russia's military chief of staff will recall
Russian officers now working in NATO-led peacekeeping forces in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as soldiers now in NATO countries for
long and short-term training.

General Anatoly Krivolapov, Russia's military representative
in NATO, was recalled by Moscow last week just before the air
raids began.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said the officers were instructed earlier by the
defense ministry to follow orders given only by Russia's chief of
staff.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Close 3 Palestinian Offices in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel decided on Monday to
close three Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a high-level meeting of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by the Prime Minister's Office did not give the
names of the three offices to be closed, but said Israeli security
forces will implement the decision.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as an apparent attempt to thwart the
increasing political and diplomatic activities by Palestinians in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Minister for Jerusalem Affairs of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Faisal Husseini said Monday that no
matter what happens, the Orient House in East Jerusalem will
function as usual and remain open to the public.
</P>
<P>
Last week, foreign diplomats based in Jerusalem were invited
to a briefing in the Orient House on the current developments in
the Mideast peace process in spite of Israel's strong objections.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Palestinian officials expressed gratitude to
diplomats of the European Union (EU) nations stationed in
Jerusalem for EU's support to the right of self-determination of
the Palestinian people in declaring an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
EU has rejected Israel's claim that Jerusalem is its sovereign
capital, saying the Jerusalem issue, under relevant resolutions of
the United Nations and the Oslo accords, should be settled through
final-status talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting, the Israeli government also agreed to
free 14 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

<HEADLINE> 189 Tamil Rebels Surrender to Sri Lankan Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 189 Tamil rebels
surrendered to government troops by Sunday evening in the Northern
Province of Sri Lanka after the troops' operation Ranagosa (the
Sound of War), military sources here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said more than 100 rebels of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) indicated their willingness to surrender to
the troops last week. The number is expected to increase further
because of the efforts taken by the government and the troops
towards their welfare.
</P>
<P>
Another group of LTTE members are also awaiting surrender with
their weapons. There are five LTTE women among those who
surrendered, including a Sinhalese woman married to a LTTE cadre,
the sources said,
</P>
<P>
The troops have already started projects to educate and
rehabilitate them in the area, they added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Sri Lankan government troops launched the
Ranagosa operation to expand the security force-controlled region
in the northern Wanni area.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting against the government since
1983 for a separate state of their own in the north and east of
the country.

president of the Royal-Dutch Petroleum Company.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed gratitude for Bergh's contribution to the growth
of Sino-Dutch and Sino-European relations and to the cooperation
between the Shell Group and China, adding that he expects
bilateral cooperation to score even more successes in the future.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Shell Group boasts advantages in energy and

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshis Celebrate Muslim Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Muslims across Bangladesh Monday
celebrated the Eid-ul-Azha, one of their major religious
festivals, sacrificing animals and seeking divine blessings for
the emancipation of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier declared a three-day Eid holiday
beginning Sunday and took up elaborate programs on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The capital city has largely thinned out with the departure of
people for celebrating the Eid at their village homes with their
dear and near ones, and the rush of home-going people at bus
terminals and railway stations during the past few days was gone.
</P>
<P>
Trading of cattle in Dhaka before the festival was dull this
year, mainly due to slump in economic activities following a
devastating flood hitting the country last year. Many families had
to do without a cattle either because there were not enough
animals in the market or because they could not afford it.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
greeted the people and wished them happiness in separate messages
delivered on the eve of the festival.
</P>
<P>
The main essence of the festival is to establish social
harmony, unity and understanding, said the president. "I convey my
heartiest felicitations to the countrymen on the occasion of the
Eid-ul-Azha... Let the Eid-ul-Azha usher in well-being and joy for
all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Urging the people to uphold the sanctify of the festival,
cooperate with each other and to share the joy of Eid with the
poor and the destitute, Hasina said: "The path directed by Allah
Almighty is not the path of indulgence, greed, lust and creating
anarchy, but honesty, renunciation, and welfare of the common
people."

<HEADLINE> China to Open More Fields to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
said here today that China will adopt a series of measures this
year to expand the use of foreign investment in order to offset
the repercussions of the financial crisis engulfing Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), said at a press conference today that China
will keep its policy on overseas investment basically unchanged
amidst uncertainty in the international environment this year.
</P>
<P>
She is optimistic about China's use of overseas investment in
1999, saying that China is enjoying a favorable situation
characterized by a political stability and various reforms are
being carried out successfully.
</P>
<P>
Since a set of regulations were issued on the establishment of
joint travel agencies in January by MOFTEC and the National
Tourism Administration, MOFTEC has been working with several other
relevant departments to soon open other areas such as retail sales
and finance and insurance to overseas investors, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, MOFTEC will hosts a series of investment promotion
events this year to brief overseas investors on China's investment
environment, policies, and prospects.
</P>
<P>
The Third China Fair for Investment and Trade, an annual event
which will be held in the coastal city of Xiamen in southeast
China's Fujian Province between September 8 and 12, will be part
of the promotion efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China will seize the opportunity now that other
Asian nations are recovering from the crisis, and seek to attract
more investment from Asia, the leading source of China's overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Investors in North America, Europe and other parts of the world
will also be targeted.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that greater efforts will be made to improve
China's investment environment, including putting an end to
illegal levies and inspections that now harass overseas-funded
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of contracted overseas investment in China
jumped 17.52 percent during the first two months this year as
compared with the same period last year, hitting 5.51 billion U.S.
dollars, with 4.21 billion dollars already in place.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,230 overseas-funded projects were approved during
January and February this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China approved more than 20,000 overseas-funded
businesses and the total volume of pledged investment was 52.1
billion U.S. dollars, up 2.2 percent over the 1997 figure, and a
total of 58.9 billion U.S. dollars of the pledged investment
arrived and were actually used.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Environmental Protection Hotline Keeps on Ringing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in about a year,
Zhang Yuhuan, a 72-year-old woman who lives in downtown Jinan,
capital of eastern China's Shandong Province, opened her window
this morning without having to hold her breath.
</P>
<P>
The chimney of a nearby hotel had stopped belching out smoke
when Zhang and her family had had enough and dialed 6925081, the
number of the Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection
Bureau's environmental complaint line.
</P>
<P>
Chen Fang, the head of the Jinan Environmental Protection
Supervision Detachment, and three other environmental protection
workers went to have a look at the problem and told the hotel to
solve the problem within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect such a swift response," Zhang says, "Next time,
I won't wait so long to ring them up."
</P>
<P>
This was Chen's third response that day to complaints from
local people. He had already stopped construction work on an
unlicensed boiler and ordered a company to repair a chlorine
container leak that posed a threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has received more than 300 complaint calls about air,
water, and noise pollution, 70 percent of which have been solved,
since the phone number was publicized on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The city's environment is under state inspection, along with
that of Beijing, Lanzhou, Chongqing, and four other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Chen's bureau started the hotline initially to see to it that a
pollution control project on several rivers work, but people kept
phoning in about many other environmental problems, prompting the
bureau to make the line more widely used. More than 10 prefectures
and cities outside Jinan have also established similar hotlines.
</P>
<P>
The hotlines are open 24 hours a day. Staff members respond
immediately to callers' complaints. People are now much more
concerned about the environment, and that has caused an increase
in government efforts to bring pollution under control while
maintaining rapid economic growth, said Zhang Xiaodong, deputy
director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Jinan's air now has 74 percent less sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide and 48 percent fewer suspended particles partly as a result
of increased supervision by the public, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong was the first province in China to have such a hotline
in many localities, but the cities of Xiamen and Zhangzhou in
Fujian Province and Hengyang City in Hunan Province have announced
special phone numbers for environmental complaints as well.
</P>
<P>
Because of state policy, the Chinese now have higher
expectations about the environment, said Yang Shanmin, an
associate professor of sociology at Shandong University. But even
greater effort needs to be made by everyone, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Ends in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A four-day nationwide public
sector strike in Israel ended Monday after the Israeli government
reached an agreement with the trade federation over a wage
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Following all-night marathon talks, the Histadrut Trade
Federation and the Finance Ministry signed a deal granting public
workers a 4 percent wage increase retroactive to 1997 and 1998 and
a cost-of-living increase, the Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Histadrut promised that it will not threaten to
strike or demand contractual changes until October 1999, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut had demanded a 7 percent pay rise each year for
1998 and 1999 to compensate the wage erosion by inflation, but the
Finance Ministry only offered a 3.1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders claimed victory at the end of the strike, but a
Finance Ministry official told Xinhua that "both sides win when
you work out an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Some say that labor leaders have shown flexibility in the
negotiations to quench the surging public complaints over the
chaos caused by the strike on the eve of the Jewish holiday of
Passover, which begins Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Government departments, hospitals, post offices and state-run
companies were closed during the strike. Garbage piled up on
streets and flight departures were delayed at the Ben-Gurion
airport.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the strike, which began last Wednesday and
resumed Sunday after a suspension over the weekend, has cost the
government 130 million shekels (about 32.5 million U.S. dollars).

CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's population reached
18.8 million in September 1998 thanks to a 30-percent increase in
net migration although the birth rate decreased, official figures
showed Monday.
</P>

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said the population
grew by 62,000 people since June 1998 and 232,400 since the

</P>
<P>
The national growth rate jumped during the year to September

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has postponed his first visit to France due to
differences between the two sides over protocol arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The visit, originally scheduled for April 12, has been put off
to an unspecific time, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a
press release from the presidential office as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tehran had asked Paris to cross out some protocol procedures,
which are considered as against Islamic rules.
</P>
<P>
Since no agreement has been reached yet in this regard between
the two sides, Khatami's visit to Paris cannot be made as
scheduled, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The visits by Khatami, also current chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to foreign countries,
require that Islamic rules be observed, Khatami's office said.
</P>
<P>
However, the amicable and historical relations between Iran and
France would continue to be broadened in the future despite of the
delay in Khatami's visit, said the office.

<P>
VIENNA, March 29 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Austrian counterpart Thomas Klestil Monday called on
the peoples of both countries to help boost economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal Monday morning at the presidential palace
during a meeting with people from the Austrian economic and trade
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Klestil said his country attaches great importance to
developing trade and economic ties with China. In addition to the
traditional sectors, he said, the high-tech sector could be a new
link for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He promised that industrial and commercial sectors of his
country will continue to make contributions to economic
development, industrial modernization and environmental protection
in China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Exchange Fund Assets Rise in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced today that total assets of the Exchange
Fund amounted to 921.3 billion HK dollars (118 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a rise of six billion HK dollars (769
million U.S. dollars) from that at the end of January, according
to the Abridged Exchange Fund Balance Sheet published today by the
HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets
increased. The growth in foreign currency assets was mainly funded
by an increase in note issuance, and the increase in Hong Kong
dollar assets reflected mainly the appreciation in market value of
the Hong Kong equities held by the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA also published the Currency Board Account, which
showed the monetary base at the end of February was 203 billion HK
dollars (26 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 6.5 billion HK
dollars (833 million U.S. dollars) or 3.3 percent from a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Issuance of Certificates of Indebtedness contributed to much of
the increase, reflecting the seasonal demand for bank notes around
the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of the currency board system,
the growth in the monetary base was fully backed by changes in the
backing assets.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said today that the HKMA started to publish
these accounts from February on a monthly basis to increase
transparency.

<HEADLINE> SKorean President Warns of Intervention in Corporate Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said on Monday that his government will intervene if family-owned
conglomerates, or chaebols, failed to restructure their businesses.
</P>
<P>
"If conglomerates do not restructure themselves voluntarily,
the government will have no choice but to intervene," Kim said
while reporting on attempts to boost corporate competitiveness of
South Korean products in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
In a report on its reform programs to President Kim Dae-jung,
the South Korean Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman
Lee Hun-jia said his authorities will force the top five chaebols -
-Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK -- to bring their debt ratio
below 200 percent in real terms by the end of this year, while
banning them from equity reappraisal and investment.
</P>
<P>
The top five chaebols will have to stand by earlier commitments
to lower their debt ratio in real terms by getting rid of excess
capacity within their business units, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will closely monitor the chaebols' effort to
reduce their debt ratio on a quarterly basis. The FSC will not let
them get away with asset reappraisal, or investment in kind, in a
bid to manipulate the debt ratio," said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
The nation's five largest conglomerates saw their debt to
equity ratio fall by a significant portion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo has the highest debt ratio of 385.82 percent, followed
by Hyundai with 330.21 percent, LG 355.21 percent, Samsung 214.05
percent and SK 225.16 percent. And yet rather than selling off
their inefficient units and losing redundant capacity, all five
chaebols reduced their liabilities and increased equity values by
asset reappraisal and investment in kind.
</P>
<P>
"The government is not going to let them get away with
fabricating book values to meet the targeted ratio," the FSC
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The insurance market will be the next target of financial
reform.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the costs of insurance market restructuring, merger
and acquisition of insurance firms will follow, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of banking sector restructuring by
selling off the Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank to foreign
investors, the FSC has been working on reorganizing the insurance
market.
</P>
<P>
A number of large insurance companies are expected to be either
merged or sold to overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Public Confidence Up Slightly: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A government survey published
today shows a slightly more buoyant mood among Hong Kong people
who remain concerned about the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The bimonthly telephone opinion poll, conducted in the second
week of March by the Home Affairs Bureau, indicates that the
proportion of respondents who mentioned economy-related problems
dropped from 61 percent in January to 54 percent. A total of 1,647
respondents were successfully interviewed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the bureau said: "We believe this shift could be
attributed to the financial secretary's morale boosting budget
speech."
</P>
<P>
The new budget unveiled early this month contains a number of
proposals welcomed by the public, particularly the tax rebate,
plans for a cyberport and the possibility of a Disney theme park
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"All these taken together would result in more business and job
opportunities for all," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Among those who mentioned economy-related problems, 81 percent
said that the government had exerted efforts in solving these
problems.
</P>
<P>
After economy-related problems, labor and housing came to be
the second and third most often mentioned in the survey, which was
the 81st in the series started in January 1983.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Overseas Insurers Against Unauthorized Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance watchdog, the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), today issued a stern
warning to overseas insurance companies against getting involved
in unauthorized business.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC said that overseas insurance companies have to get
approval before doing business in China and warned overseas
insurance companies that they risk of having their offices closed
for good if they are found to be doing unauthorized insurance and
other intermediary business in China.
</P>
<P>
CIRC officials explain that unauthorized business by overseas
insurance companies or their representative offices is not only
illegal but also harms the interest of policy holders.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities have given about 200 overseas insurance
companies the go-ahead on setting up businesses or representative
offices in China, but CIRC sources say that some overseas firms
are now doing underground business in China.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the move by the CIRC is part of a
national campaign to bring order into the insurance business and
would be a prelude to a further opening-up.
</P>
<P>
A top CIRC official hinted last week that China may give
licenses to more overseas insurance firms in the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China's insurance business had
120 billion yuan in premiums in 1998, up 15 percent from 1997.
Some estimate that the figure will hit 250 billion yuan by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Australian Minister Calls for Retaining Older Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia needed to change its
culture of retiring people from the workforce at age 65 because
experience, wisdom and knowledge was being lost, Aged Care
Minister Bronwyn Bishop said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The fastest declining group in the Australian workforce is men
aged 55 to 59 (and) we can't afford for that to continue," Bishop
was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international Homecare Conference of 1,000 delegates
from seven countries and regions in the east city of Brisbane,
Bishop said that, in Japan, 93 percent of men and 59 percent women
aged 55 to 59 were in the full-time workforce.
</P>
<P>
Bishop said the Australia federal government had started to
break the culture that "marginalized older Australians," by
removing barriers that enforced retirement at 65.
</P>
<P>
In the area which allowed frail aged people to remain at home,
Australia was a world leader, she said. However, the government
needed to better target and to expand its Home And Community Care
programs, she added.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch Explore India Millennium Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- India's Ministry of Tourism has
declared the year 1999-2000 as "Explore India - Millennium Year"
from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000 in a bid to enhance the
country's tourism.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of Explore India implies a deeper and more
complete experience of the country and the different attractions
it has to offer both to domestic and overseas tourists," an
official press release said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange earnings from tourism is 117.44 billion
rupees (2.82 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 and for India it is the
second largest net foreign exchange earner. India's share of
tourism, however, has remained static over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Tourism has taken steps to rapidly develop the
tourism industry in the country: declaring tourism as an export
industry making it eligible to all those incentives which are
currently available to export houses, declaring Explore India
Millennium Year which will gear into action the different segments
of the tourism industry into presenting the best of the country's
tourism product, and the concerned central ministries are being
motivated to improve the services and facilities at airports,
railway stations, customs and immigration.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S. Official's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has slammed warnings by a
U.S. State Department official that Iraq will make a "great
mistake" if it tries to challenge the U.S. while the western
countries are preoccupied with airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indik said on Sunday
that it would be misleading "if Iraq believes that we do not
possess the ability to confront any challenge it constitutes
against us while we are preoccupied with crisis in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Information Ministry spokesman was quoted by the
Iraqi News Agency on Monday as saying that Indik's arrogant and
brazen statement further showed the aggressive mentality the
U.S. harbors against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The "arrogance of power" motivated the U.S. official to make
such remarks, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He added that "Iraq had not been scared by the U.S. threats."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been vehemently condemning NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia and called on the international community to confront
such raids against a sovereign country in NATO's fifty-year
history.
</P>
<P>
Before NATO began its air strikes on Yugoslavia on Wednesday
evening, U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in
Iraq had clashed regularly with the Iraqi air defense units.
</P>
<P>
In the past five days, no new incidents were reported in the
no-fly zones imposed by the U.S.-led western allies in Iraq with a
claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that the Iraqi people have set a model
to all peoples struggling against the U.S. tyranny and hegemony.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
called for an immediate halt of military action against Yugoslavia,
saying that political negotiation is the only way to settle the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The military action against Yugoslavia has caused loss of
people's lives and property, Zhu noted, adding that it will not
help solve the problem, but will lead to serious historical
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a meeting with visiting U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that political negotiation will be resumed as soon as
possible because only in this way will the problem be solved," the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China is "worried and disturbed" by the military
action against Yugoslavia, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin had
made comments on the issue on three different occasions during his
current European visit.
</P>
<P>
This shows the Chinese people's concern and the clear stance of
the Chinese government on the issue, he added.

<HEADLINE> International Court Rules Against Nigeria on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ICJ declared at the weekend as "inadmissible" Nigeria's
request for the interpretation of its July 11, 1998 judgment, in
which Nigeria challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear
the case.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in favor of Cameroun, saying that it has the
right to determine to whom Bakassi and the lake Chad area belong,
</P>
<P>
The judges at the U.N. court voted 13 against three not to
admit Nigeria's request while the court unanimous rejected
Cameroun's request that Nigeria should bear the additional costs
to Cameroun by the request for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the court is being called upon to rule
on a request for interpretation of a judgment on preliminary
objections, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Bakassi Peninsula has been a subject of dispute between
Nigeria and Cameroun not only in the court of law but also in the
public court.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have been claiming ownership, thus prompting a
circus of reprisals in recent years, and Cameroun dragged Nigeria
to the world court in 1995 after the two countries began military
hostilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
 All mediation attempts by France, Britain and other countries
were in vain.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Red Cross Heals Refugees!/ Reproductive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Red Cross
Society (TRCS) has launched a project on reproductive health for
the refugees sheltered in western Kigoma Region.
</P>
<P>
The project, sponsored by the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) with
507, 000 US dollars this year, is also intended to focus on gender
and sexual violence and adolescent reproductive health, local
newspaper The Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the project over the weekend in Kigoma, the Kigoma
Regional Commissioner Ukiwaona Mzuzuri said the influx of
refugees has caused local residents inconveniences in social
services including schools, water and health.
</P>
<P>
!0Lack of medical supply to meet the increasing demand is among
the causes of epidemics such as cholera, diarrhea and sexually
transmitted disease (STDs) in the region,!1 Mzuzuri said.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA Deputy Representative to Tanzania Arthur Erken said
the majority of reported cases of sexual violence among refugees
involved female victims and male perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The consequences, including unwanted pregnancies, unsafe
abortions, STDs such as HIV, trauma and infections, were often
severe and traumatic for the victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
!0I can assure you that because of this project, fewer women
and girls will die or experience permanent damages to their
health due to the fact that they will now have access to these
service,!1 Erken said.
</P>
<P>
According to other reports, there are more than 230,000
Burundian and Congolese refugees in eight camps in Kigoma region
fleeing from political instabilities and rebel fighting.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended down
nearly half a U.S. cent Monday, after falling gold prices and a
weaker Japanese yen eroded the unit during weekend offshore
dealings.
</P>
<P>
NM Rothschild &AMP; Sons senior manager foreign exchange Paul
Macarounas noted that trading had been orderly after the weekend
slippage.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly taking its leads from the soft gold and a weak
yen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 63.33 U.S. cents, from
Friday's close of 63.78, after spending the day between 63.27 and
63.50.
</P>
<P>
"It had the initial spurt lower on Friday night as gold broke
280 U.S. dollars per ounce," Macarounas said of the domestic
currency's decline.
</P>
<P>
"Also the fact that U.S. dollar/yen has held about 120 for the
bulk of the day has also aided the weakness of the Australian
dollar," Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
At the close here the Australian dollar was buying 0.5889 euro
from 0.5882 Friday, while the local unit was trading Japanese yen
at 76.13 from 75.74 Friday.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says "Path to Peace" Still Open to Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said Sunday that "the path to peace" remained open to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic but Belgrade must first stop
"the policy of violence" in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a political solution. We are still asking
Milosevic to follow the path of peace," Fischer said during a
Europe-Asia foreign ministers meeting in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Air strikes against Yugoslavia by North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) "won't last for too long", Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the deployment of allied ground forces to
deter Serb military presence in Kosovo. "There is already a war on
the ground and I see no prospect for the dispatch of Western
troops."
</P>
<P>
Germany has already deployed 3,000 servicemen in Macedonia,
Yugoslavia's neighboring country. But the German government has no
plan to send more soldiers there, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of participating in any ground military actions, the
troops will carry out the mission of monitoring the implementation
of peace agreement as part of the international peace-keeping
forces, he added.

<P>
PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A humanitarian catastrophe is taking place in Kosovo, where
the Serb military and paramilitary forces are engaged, according
to NATO, in operations of ethnic sweeping against ethnic Albanians
as NATO refuses to send ground troops. Within five days of NATO
airstrikes, 50,000 Albanians have been driven out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
-- France has called on Russian Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov
to go to Belgrade personally this week to make Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to return to the negotiating table. French
President Jacques Chirac has made the proposal to Primakov during
a telephone conversation Saturday night, estimating that this
would be the only chance to put an end to NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While NATO launched on Sunday the Phase II of Operation ``
Deliberate Force'' against Yugosalvia, testimonies by witnesses
have raised fear about an ethnic sweeping in Kosovo. NATO said
that a humanitarian catastrophe is taking place in Kosovo, while
German Defense Minister Rudolph Sharping said that a ``genocide''
has already begun.
</P>
<P>
-- Former commander of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia,
British general Michael Rose, said in an interview with Le Figaro
that NATO has made a strategic mistake in the on-going operation
against Yugoslavia. He said that the war cannot be ended without a
sending of ground troops, and NATO could lose its credibility in
this conflict.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kowloon-Canton Railway
Corporation (KCRC) Monday signed two major systems contracts
mainly for West Rail with Japanese and Canadian companies at a
total value of more than 3.48 billion HK dollars (446 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The IKK consortium of Japan, comprising Itochu Corporation,
Kinkisharyo corporation ltd., and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, will
supply the KCRC with 250 Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) cars under a
contract valued at more than 3.1 billion HK dollars (397.43
million U.S. dollars).

With these new train cars, the KCRC's total EMU fleet will be
increased by more than 70 percent to 600 cars.
</P>
<P>
The other contract signed between KCRC and Alcatel Canada is
valued at 383 million HK dollars (49.10 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Offers Five Key Areas for Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China will put five major areas
up for overseas investment this year at an annual trade fair,
according to Ma Xiuhong, assistant foreign trade and economic
cooperation minister.
</P>
<P>
Mobile telecommunications, power equipment, automobiles,
construction materials, and light sensitive materials will be the
five investment areas at the fair, which is China's only national
fair for overseas investors, Ma told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The '99 China Fair for International Investment and Trade is
slated for September 8-12 in the eastern port city of Xiamen,
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
There will be about 10,000 projects for overseas investors at
the fair, Ma said, adding that 1,000 major projects have been
selected.
</P>
<P>
Investors, traders and intermediate and financial institutions
worldwide will be invited to participate in the fair, she said.
</P>
<P>
A high-level symposium on "international investment and
cooperation in the 21st century" will be held during the fair
along with workshops on development of related industries.
</P>
<P>
All the 31 provincial localities, some leading Chinese cities,
State Council departments, and national economic organizations
have applied to participate in the fair. China's private companies
have been invited for the first time to participate.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China had approved more than 324,000
overseas-invested companies, with a total contracted investment of
572 billion U.S. dollars. The investment actually used had
amounted to 267 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Supreme Court: President to Decide Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The final decision on banning
ministers from participating in political campaign in the run-up
to the June 7 general election is in President B.J. Habibie's
hand, the Indonesian Supreme Court's ruling said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was read by Coordinating Minister for Political and
Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung at the Merdeka Palace here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The General Election Commission (KPU) last week ruled that
cabinet ministers and all-level government officials are barred
from taking part in election campaign. However, leaders of the
ruling Golkar strongly opposed the decision because most of the
ministers belong to Golkar.
</P>
<P>
The decision also runs counter to Habibie's earlier statement
allowing all cabinet ministers -- except five, among them the
defense and security minister and ministers dealing with foreign
affairs and justice and the attorney general -- to participate in
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the General Election Commission Rudini said last
week that the body's decision to bar cabinet ministers from
joining the election campaign was reached democratically and any
effort to change it would show a lack of respect for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
He said section 19 of the commission's regulation clearly bans
political parties from appointing cadres who are also state
official to hold campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Facing with the situation, late last week, the president
referred the contentious issue to the Supreme Court (MA), which is
expected to come up with a definitive ruling this week.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruling said the General Election Commission
could not make a decision on the position and the role of
ministers or of other government officials.
</P>
<P>
KPU's members cannot be appointed as members of a legislative
body nor can they hold political campaigns, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
KPU was set up early this month as an independent body tasked
to hold the general election. The commission's duty will finish in
2004.

MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua)-- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Monday that Moscow would shortly take "additional
steps" to halt NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<P>
"In the coming days Russia will take additional steps towards
ending NATO air raids against Yugoslavia," the ITAR-TASS news

</P>

However, Ivanov did not say what kind of additional steps
Moscow would be taken in the coming days.

<P>
 Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Monday that some
1,000 civilians had been killed in NATO's five-day air raids on
Yugoslavia.

<P>
Five days of air strikes had killed "1,000 civilians, 10 times
more than the number of military" casualties, the ITAR-TASS news
agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said NATO warplanes had carried out 750 sorties over
Yugoslavia, adding that the U.S. radar-evading F-117 Stealth, had
been downed by Yugoslav air defense forces equipped with Russian-
made surface-to-air-missiles.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Israelis Favor Pullout From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll conducted in
Israel showed that 55 percent of respondents favor an immediate,
unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon, a
local daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since 1985, when Israel carved out the
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon, that a majority in
surveys had emerged to support a unilateral pullout, the
Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies at the Tel Aviv University, a prestigious think-tank in
Israel, between January 25 and March 7.
</P>
<P>
During this period, seven Israelis, including a
brigadier-general, were killed in the border zone in south Lebanon
in two accidents in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
The killings sparked a large-scale Israeli retaliatory air
strike against Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrilla targets in
Lebanon and provoked a hot debate among the Israeli public over
how to end Israel's military presence in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its northern areas from cross-border attacks, but the
move has triggered a war of attritions launched by Hezbollah
guerrillas, who are fighting to oust Israeli troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has conditioned a withdrawal on a
security guarantee by Beirut that it will deploy government
troops in the areas Israel vacated and disarm the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, its main power broker, have rejected the
Israeli proposal, insisting that Israel should withdraw
unconditionally under United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Previous polls showed that most of the Israelis thought the
government had not done enough to safeguard Israel's northern
areas and prevent heavy losses of Israeli soldiers in the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
The polls also showed that more and more Israelis support a
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon, but they had never
constituted a majority.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 51 percent of the Israelis believe a
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon will help move forward
the Israel-Arab peace process, compared with 35 percent in a
similar poll conducted last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey polled 1,203 adult Israelis with a margin of error
of 3 percent.

technology. They propose turning straw into fodder through micro-
organic technology, for example.
</P>
<P>
China produces about 500 million tons of straw a year, a fifth
of which could be made into 40 billion kilograms of fodder, or a
third of the country's total fodder output, according to
agronomists.
</P>
<P>
They explain that "white agriculture" mainly includes the
sectors of micro-organic fodder, fertilizers and pesticides,
foodstuffs, and agents for ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion is for developing water-saving farming.
Agronomists believe that it is a new direction for China, which is
one of the world's water-poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Ways to save water include changing irrigation by ditches into
irrigation with pipes and stopping seepage from irrigation ditches.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists also suggest improving the accuracy of sowing and
fertilizer application to improve efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Egypt Endeavor to Improve Ties: Sudan's FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail has said that Sudan and Egypt have been conducting
contacts to further improve bilateral ties, an Egyptian national
newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Al-Ahram daily published Monday,
Ismail expressed dissatisfaction with the current level of
bilateral ties. But he said that efforts are being made to enhance
them.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two Arab neighbors soured in 1995
after Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination
attempt on President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Islamic militants, who
staged an insurgency in 1992 in an attempt to topple Egypt's
secular government and install a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has repeatedly denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
A thaw seems to have emerged in the Sudanese-Egyptian ties in
recent years after the two sides expressed readiness to improve
them and took steps in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"There are constant contacts" between the two countries'
foreign ministries on reverting Egyptian property in Sudan to the
Egyptian government, Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
Sudan announced last year to return to Egypt the properties of
Cairo University in Khartoum and houses along the Nile for the
Egyptian hydrologists, which were confiscated after Sudan's 1989
coup.
</P>
<P>
On the civil war in southern Sudan, Ismail said the Sudanese
government is about to reach an agreement with the rebel groups in
the south during the upcoming talks in the Nigerian capital of
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The rebel factions, led by the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
in southern Sudan have been fighting since 1983 against the Muslim
government in the north for greater autonomy for the southern
states, which are mainly Christian, animist and African.
</P>
<P>
Several rounds of peace talks between the two sides have ended
in failure due to disputes over the issue of autonomy in the
south.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Makes Significant Progress in Wiping Out Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has made significant
progress in wiping out polio over the past four years with joint
efforts by the Cambodian Health Ministry and the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Officials of the WHO and the Cambodian Health Ministry
confirmed Sunday that this month is the two year anniversary of
the discovery of the last known case of polio in Cambodia, the
Cambodia Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
If it was confirmed by the National Certification Commission
for Polio Eradication as true, it would mean that Cambodia has
caught up quickly with all of Southeast Asia in being polio-free,
it was said.
</P>
<P>
A WHO official said that Cambodia still has one more year to go
before it can be internationally declared polio-free after three
years without a new discovery.
</P>
<P>
But at least one health expert believes that new cases of polio
still exist in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to achieve a worldwide eradication of
polio by the year 2000, the Cambodian Health Ministry, WHO and the
United Nations Children's Fund have planned a series of the
national immunization days in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia had the highest rate of child polio sufferers in the
Western Pacific region in 1994, which recorded 300 new cases of
polio that year. Before documentation, the number of cases could
have been as high as 1,000.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the first annual immunization drive began, which
eventually spread to more than 90 percent of the country. Each
year, the immunization drive involves 40,000 health workers and
volunteers who vaccinate more than a million children.
</P>
<P>
An immunization drive scheduled for late this year hopes to
vaccinate children in remote areas like Anlong Veng.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Kristine Lilly scored twice in
the final six minutes as the United States blanketed Mexico for a
3-0 victory in a women's soccer tie in California on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had a 42-1 edge in shots and 20-1 in shots on
goal, but were stopped by Mexican goalkeeper Linnea Quinones for
most of the match.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Quinones, a San Diego resident who plays for
San Diego State, saved 16 shutouts in her sixth international
match.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team took a 1-0 lead in the 38th minute when Julie
Foudy headed Shannon MacMillan's pass past Quinones. The scoring
sequence began with Lilly's short corner kick to MacMillan.
</P>
<P>
Lilly scored her first goal in the 85th minute, putting a shot
from the right corner of the penalty area inside the left goalpost.
Three minutes later, she scored her second as she put in a rebound
from 10 meters after Mexican defender Susie Mora headed out Mia
Hamm's shot.
</P>
<P>
Maribel Dominguez took Mexico's only shot, receiving a long
pass, dribbling past U.S. captain Carla Overbeck and shooting from
just inside the penalty area, but American goalkeeper Briana
Scurry snatched her shot.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. squad has never lost to Mexico, winning the inaugural
match 12-0 in 1991, followed by 9-0 victories in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the Americans' team-record domestic
unbeaten streak to 49 matches since a 2-1 loss to Norway on
February 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The match, which was the Americans' first of nine in
preparation for the Women's World Cup later this year, will resume
with a match against China in Pennsylvania on April 22.
</P>
<P>
The Women's World Cup final will be played from July 10 at the

"We will face challenges from the domestic and international
oil markets and will stress economic results and the commercial
value of oil deposits in both exploration and exploitation," said
Liao, adding that "developing the Tarim oil base will help China
reduce its reliance on oil imports and increase exports in the
future."
</P>
<P>
The China Oil and Natural Gas Corporation initiated its oil
exploration effort in the Tarim Basin in April 1989.
</P>
<P>
A modern oil exploration system has formed in the basin in
spite of difficulties resulting from sandstorms which hit the area
every four days on average and the fact that oil reservoirs are
usually found at depths over 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Facilities that have been built to support the Tarim effort
include oil pipelines stretching over 1,000 km, an advanced
telecommunications network and a 522-km desert highway running
from the south to the north.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of large oil platforms and the use of advanced
drilling technology have continuously reduced operating costs in
the basin. The current drilling rate has doubled the level in the
early 1990s to stand at 1.6 meters per hour, according to the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Related highly efficient efforts have created sound conditions
for further development of the oil fields," said Liao.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Tazhong No. 4 Oil Field in the Taklamakan
Desert, the world's second largest in the center of the basin, was
discovered in 1992. The field's current oil output accounts for 22
percent of the basin's total.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, three oil and gas zones with combined natural gas
deposits of 420 billion cubic meters have been found in the basin,
making Tarim one of the nation's three largest gas producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 20 million tons of crude oil
have been produced in the Tarim Basin over the past decade.

<P>
URUMQI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to develop the
Tarim Basin in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region into
a major oil and gas production base by early next century.
</P>
<P>
"Large-scale development of oil and gas fields is proceeding
smoothly," according to Liao Yongyuan, director with the Tarim Oil
Exploration and Development Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, geologists have discovered 13 fields in the basin
with combined deposits of some 300 million tons of oil and 220
billion cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Plans for 1999 call for verifying additional 40 million tons of
oil and 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the basin,
which covers an area slightly larger than France. Verified oil
reserves are expected to reach an accumulated one billion tons by
the end of next year, with verified natural gas deposits hitting a
total of 500 billion cubic meters, said Liao.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin, an area known as the "Sea of Hope", offers
potential oil reserves of over 10.7 billion tons and natural gas
reserves of over 8.4 trillion cubic meters, accounting for about
13 percent and 25 percent of the current total respectively,
according to an official resource assessment report.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan sugar refineries face
imminent collapse with some 100,000 tons of locally-produced sugar
lying idle in four major factory stores following renewed dumping
to the sugar-rich country.
</P>
<P>
Errol Johnson, chief executive of Mumias Sugar Company in
Western Province, revealed at the weekend that his company was
holding 74,000 tons of sugar, while the rest was at other three
sugar refineries.
</P>
<P>
The total value of sugar stock is valued at 3.6 billion
shillings (about 57 million U.S. dollars), media reports said
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson urged the government to impose duty on imported sugar,
saying un-restricted imports threatened the lifeline of some
60,000 Kenyans who directly or indirectly depended on the
industry.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Mexican sugar which enjoys high subsidy was in
the high sea heading for Kenya, and urged the government to
increase prices of imported sugar from 70 percent to 140 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic sugar, sold at an average of 597.35 U.S. dollars per
ton, could not evenly compete with the import, he added.

WELLINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. giant discount Internet

</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the New Zealand InfoTech

E*Trade is formulating plans to start trading New Zealand shares
as a
result of the decision of the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE) to

alternative,
ASTS, which features an "open interface." ASTS is supplied by
Australia's
Computershare.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Criticizes US for Restricting Lamb Imports </HEADLINE>

<P>
WELLINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Food and Fiber
Minister
John Luxton Monday criticized the United States International
Trade
Commission's (ITC's) moves to restrict imports of New Zealand lamb

through protectionist tariffs and even quotas, labeling them a
smoke
screen for the real issue.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the ITC has recommended a range
of
"safeguard measures" to protect the U.S. sheep meat industry,
including a
tariff of around 20 percent on all lamb imports over the 1998
level and
a quantitative restriction of 52 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is the American sheep industry's problems are
internal not external. New Zealand farmers should not be penalized
for
being more efficient than their American counterparts," Minister
Luxton
said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
He added that New Zealand and Australia, the major lamb
suppliers to
the U.S., argued vigorously against the U.S. industry's submission
at the
ITC hearing.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the New Zealand government will closely
work
with the NZ sheep meat industry and the Australian Government on
the case.
</P>
<P>
"We will be doing all we can to avoid trade restrictions that
would
hurt all concerned," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- An abandoned People's Liberation
Army (PLA) military base at the foot of Mount Helan in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has been converted into
factories and farms operated by laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Mount Helan, which sits on the border between Ningxia and Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, had served as a strategic military
outpost since ancient times. The base was once home to a field
army of over 10,000 officers and men.
</P>
<P>
The garrison was downsized in 1980s and completely disbanded in
the 1990s as part of two rounds of disarmament undertaken by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shuiying, director of the garrison's real estate
management division, noted that the "major downsizing effort
enabled the PLA to release a number of military installations for
civilian use." He noted that the PLA is simply fulfilling its
Constitutional obligation to support the country's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
"The garrison has relinquished control of its headquarters
barracks, a telecommunications company, a military supply center
and various other facilities to the local government", according
to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yufei, a 27-year-old laid-off worker, built a coal washery
on the former site of the telecommunications company. He also
rents the barracks compound and a military training area for an
annual fee of 8,000 yuan. Wu has hired 20 laid-off workers for his
various ventures.
</P>
<P>
"The abandoned site is ideally located next to a coal mine and
provides access to highways and railway lines," said Wu, adding
that "the complex also features water, power and various other
infrastructure facilities."
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-sq.m. plant produces 60,000 tons of washed coal
annually. Wu said he fully expects the plant's total assets to
grow from two million to five million yuan over the next two years.
We expect to become the largest private firm in the region, said
Wu.

Zhao's brother-in-law, Yang Duo, was stationed at the military
supply center. Yang retired from active duty several years ago and
currently works for a local oil company.
</P>
<P>
"I fully understood the government's decision to downsize
during peacetime, but was nonetheless was reluctant to leave the
army. It's good that the camp is being used to help people," said
Yang.
</P>
<P>
The former military complex has been transformed into a farming
base which provides the mountainous mining zone with 50,000 kg of
eggs, 2,000 chickens, 300 pigs and large volume of vegetables
annually, according to Wang Kangning, deputy director of the
Shitan regional non-state economy office. The complex will be
built into a non-government economic park with a total annual
output value of 100 million yuan within three years.
</P>
<P>
China has downsized its armed forces by seven million personnel
since the founding of new China in 1949, according to one senior
PLA officer.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government announced a unilateral 1985 decision to
reduce its troop strength by one million active duty personnel,
with the actual reduction reaching 1.039 million by 1990.
</P>
<P>
The ninth reduction in 49 years was initiated in September 1997.
Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission,
announced that that the PLA would further downsize its forces by
500,000 personnel over a three year period.
</P>
<P>
The current reduction is scheduled for completion in the year
2000. The PLA's active personnel, including non-military personnel,
will fall to 2.5 million, or 0.21 percent of the nation's total
population.
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable and streamlined scale of the armed forces will
help improve the environment for international arms control and
disarmament, benefit the establishment of an atmosphere of mutual
trust between countries and enable China to focus on economic
development," according to one senior PLA officer.

<HEADLINE> Ice Cores Reveal Increasing Industrial Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists claim that ice
cores from the Himalayas, the world highest mountain range,
indicate a significant increase in industrial pollution over the
past few decades.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ninglian, an associate researcher with Lanzhou Institute
of Glaciology and Cryopedology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), told Xinhua that six ice cores were removed from a
glacier on Mount Xixabangma which is located in the central part
of the Himalayas 7,100 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The ice cores from the remote mountain area are believed to
offer an accurate record of atmospheric conditions over tens of
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the samples indicate that industrial development,
especially the increasing number of motor vehicles, resulted in a
substantial increase of the lead content in the glacier.
</P>
<P>
The research effort has also revealed that the density of
methane in the glacier in Xixabangma is substantially higher than
that of ice cores from polar regions.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the increasing volume of methane results
from rising surface temperatures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Wang said scientists have discovered more than 120 organic
compounds in the ice cores.
</P>
<P>
The ice cores, ranging from six to 164 meters in length, have
been deposited over the past 20,000 to 30,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The samples also contain the residue of oil fires ignited
during the Gulf War in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Index Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Index of Consumer
Expectations (ICE) grew 0.4 points on a monthly basis to 93.6
points in February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics
(NBS).
</P>
<P>
The NBS reported that the rise indicated growing consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indexes, including the ICE, Index of Consumer
Sentiment (ICS) and Index of Current Economic Conditions (ICC),
are used internationally as indicators of economic situations and
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The February ICC stood at 87.1 points, down 0.2 points on the
January figure, with the ICS growing 0.2 points to 91 points.
</P>
<P>
The NBS noted that a series of policies the Chinese government
adopted in 1998 to promote investments in infrastructure
construction will remain in effect over the next nine months.
However, the bureau pointed out that slumping consumption and
falling export will quite likely offset part of the effort.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the government should adopt measures
to expand consumption along with proactive fiscal policies and
measures to encourage private investment.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 4,200 consumers nationwide indicated that
40 percent of respondents foresee improving overall economic
conditions, with only 10 percent of respondents holding
contradictory opinions.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six percent of respondents expressed confidence that the
Chinese economy will maintain stable growth over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nice percent of respondents commented that current
economic conditions have improved on the same month last year,
with an equal number pointing to worsening conditions.
</P>
<P>
 China's Economic Monitoring and Analysis Center under the NBS
established its Consumer Survey System in December 1997 and lists
the monthly ICE on a base of 100 points. The random selection
method was to gather 4,200 samples in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Chengdu, Wuhan and Xi'an.

Advertising of any form for the promotion of smoking had also

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Crack Down on Illegal Currency Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities are planning a
crackdown on illegal currency traders said to be cheating people
out of three billion baht (81 million U.S. dollars) a month,
Monday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Bank of Thailand as saying that three
or four complaints are received each day from people who claim to
have been cheated.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown will target companies that use currency trading
as a front for other businesses and lure customers by promising
easy profits.
</P>
<P>
New graduates and unemployed people desperate for money are
seen as likely recruits for the companies' sales teams.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal operators is growing, with a total of 24
so far identified in Bangkok, according to the Bank of Thailand
and the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Customers are usually asked to invest an initial 200,000 baht
(5,400 dollars) for the purchase of foreign currency, but the
companies keep the lot and tell investors that their money was
lost.
</P>
<P>
The companies fake currency transaction documents and display
apparent trade details on a large electronic board.
</P>
<P>
Employees of the companies would face fraud and deception
charges if caught, and any hopes of a career in the financial
sector would be ruined, regulators warn.
</P>
<P>
Currently, penalties are too light to deter the operators.
Offenders can be fined 20,000 baht (540 dollars) and/or be jailed
for up to three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A large number of refugees has
poured into Albania and Macedonia from the neighboring Yugoslav
province of Kosovo over recent days after NATO launched air

<P>
From the miday of Saturday to the same time on Sunday, some 25,
000 refugees reached Kukes, about 250 kilometers from the Albanian
capital, according to the national news agency, ATA, Sunday.

In Macedonia, the number of refugees exceeded 20,000, reported
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government set up a committee on Sunday headed by
Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta to deal with the refugee affair.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian Foreign Ministry had to urgently call on Albania,
Greece and Bulgaria to discuss the issue and find a solution,
besides asking for help from the European Union and the Office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>

It is believed that the exodus of refugees from Kosovo will
continue as NATO intensifies its airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Paper Questions NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- There arises the question of the
rights of a sovereign state in the case of NATO bombing on
Yugoslavia, a local Sri Lankan newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial titled "New World Disorder," the Island said
NATO's military intervention has no approval of the United Nations
Security Council as Russia and China oppose the bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the case of fighting moves to form a separate state, the
newspaper said, Sri Lanka is facing a similar crisis. Sri Lankan
Tamil rebels have been waging a war against the government since
1983 for a separate state of its own in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
To countries like Sri Lanka, the newspaper said, attention
should be paid to this feature of military alliances attacking
sovereign states without the sanction of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that only time will tell what the outcome of the
NATO military adventure might be and that it will probably give an
indication of the direction in which the New World Disorder is
moving.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Watchdog to Overhaul Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) will overhaul the property market by unifying
vehicle insurance clauses, policies and premiums, according to
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Major insurers are making full preparation for the launch of
new policies on April 1, which will first take effect in the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
"Vehicle insurance occupies 65 percent of the total property
insurance market and the Beijing market is the biggest in the
country with 1.4 million cars," said Guo Shengchen, general
manager of the Beijing Branch of People's Insurance Company of
China.
</P>
<P>
However, most worrying is the fact that the insurance industry
has adopted a mentality which stresses high commissions, high
returns and low premiums, according to Luo Peng, general manager
of Ping An Insurance Company in Beijing, another insurance company.
</P>
<P>
"So it's necessary that we all keep to the given rates
stipulated by the CIRC even at the expense of losing business, and
anyone who raises or lowers the rates without permission should be
punished," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have demanded the CIRC to be resolute in
carrying out the new regulations.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 28 (Xinhua)-- Paraguayan President Raul
Cubas resigned on Sunday and Senate president Luis Macchi will
constitutionally take over the presidency, news reports from
Asuncion said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, amid an on-going impeachment procedure against
Cubas for abuse of power and violation of the constitution, was
confirmed by Walter Bower, head of the Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
Cubas and the military were blamed by the opposition on the
assassination of Vice President Luis Argana on Tuesday, which
flared up five days of clashes and street violence that left at
least four dead and more than 30 injured.
</P>
<P>
After Argana's death, Congress on Wednesday rushed through
Cubas' impeachment and an inquiry hearing was held on Saturday. A
voting was scheduled for next Tuesday, though the Senate had
reportedly already secured a two-thirds majority of the votes on
the removal of Cubas.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear when Macchi would take office, as Congress was
to convene an urgent session on Sunday morning on the issue.

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Rising Reemployment Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
recently predicted the number of Chinese workers laid off in 1999
will remain below last year's figure and more people will be
reemployed.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, noted that China recorded positive progress in
reemployment efforts and guaranteeing the basic living standards
of unemployed people during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ranks of unemployed from state-owned enterprises hit 6.1
million people by the end of 1998. Some 90 percent of unemployed
workers registered with reemployment service centers nationwide,
with 6.09 million laid-off workers finding jobs, according to
Sheng.
</P>
<P>
The expanded reform of state-owned enterprises is expected to
result in further staff reductions, said Sheng, adding that the
basic living expenses of unemployed workers will be covered by
enterprises, society and state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Today's edition of People's Daily quoted Sheng as saying that
the government plans to expand the role of reemployment service
centers and accelerate efforts to provide training and alter
outdated concepts in order to ensure more people will be
reemployed.

Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon announced that more American

At the White House, Clinton met with his top national security

"All of them share our determination to respond strongly to

"That is what we intend to do." Clinton said he strongly supported
NATO's decision to step up its air campaign in Kosovo.

Without specifically mentioning Saturday's loss of an F-117A,

underscores the need for NATO to persevere," he claimed.

<HEADLINE> France Hopes Russia Will Pressure Yugoslavia to Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed its hope that
Russia would come out to pressure Yugoslavia to compromise and
accept the peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac called Russian Prime Minister
Yvegeni Primakov Saturday evening calling on him to ``do all his
possible to work in favor of peace.''
</P>
<P>
French diplomats said on Sunday that ``the small door giving
access to the narrow road of peace has only one key, which is in
the hands of the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
Only the Russians are capable of obtaining from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ``a sufficiently strong and clear
signal which would lead to a stop of NATO strikes and a resumption
of talks, they said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the French presidential office said that one of
the objectives of France's diplomacy is to make Russia intervene
after Belgrade and help obtain a compromise from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Primakov that Moscow has a chance to become ``a
peace-maker'' and suggested that he go to Belgrade to make a
``dramatized explanation'' to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly condemned the NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia and has expressed its support to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
For several times since NATO began bombing Yugoslav military
targets, France called on Yugoslavia to return to the negotiating
tables to conclude the peace agreement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
France has ruled out the possibility of a ground war in Kosovo
despite increasing reports on a civilian catastrophe in the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Sunday that France
would not let itself be dragged to where it does not want to go.''
</P>
<P>
France has also reaffirmed its commitment to the political
agreement on Kosovo presented by the six-nation Contact Group,
which plans substantial autonomy but excludes independence of the
province.
</P>
<P>
In the military field, French Defense Minister Alain Richard
said on Sunday that France will continue joining NATO raids
against Yugoslav military targets ``to crush a repressive military
machine.''
</P>
<P>
A poll published on Saturday said that a majority of the French
people support French participation in the NATO operation against
Yugoslavia, although they also fear a spillover of the war to the
whole Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Dolly The Cloned Sheep to Give Second Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Dolly the sheep, the world's first
mammal cloned from an adult cell, is about to be mother for the
second time, the BBC reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The birth is due "in a few days", scientists at The Roslin
Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said "appropriate information" would be made available in
due course, but added they expect less public attention on the
birth this time around.
</P>
<P>
Dolly was born in July 1996 at the Roslin Institute after being
cloned from a breast cell taken from an adult ewe. Her first lamb,
Bonny, was born on 13 April last year after Dolly was mated the
previous November with a Welsh Mountain ram called David.
</P>
<P>
Dolly's creators said it is important to breed from cloned
animals to check for any unexpected changes in their offspring.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ian Wilmut at the institute said none has so far been
detected in Bonny, who is a "perfectly healthy" animal.

<HEADLINE> "Gifts" Sent to World Cup Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's representative on
international football's governing body Fifa has revealed he was
given gifts by countries competing to stage the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
David Will said he and other members of Fifa's executive
committee received gifts in 1995 from Japan and South Korea
seeking to influence their votes on the hosting of the competition.
</P>
<P>
The two countries won the vote and will jointly stage the 2002
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Will reported the gifts to Fifa and then contacted the bidding
bodies for both countries, urging them to stop the practice -
which they did.
</P>
<P>
Since then a new code of conduct has been introduced by Fifa,
banning gifts totalling more than 60 being made to those who are
entitled to vote.
</P>
<P>
Will explained: "Going back about four years these gifts
suddenly appeared out of the blue, delivered to the front door.
</P>
<P>
"There was no accompanying note or letter, but it was obvious
what this was all about.
</P>
<P>
"There are 24 of us who have the vote, and they targeted us.
</P>
<P>
"It was an attempt to influence us, and I - and other Europeans
on the committee who received gifts - immediately reported it to
Fifa.
</P>
<P>
"I then contacted the bidding organising committee people for
Japan and Korea and said `This must stop' - which it did."
</P>
<P>
Will, a vice-president of Fifa and former president of the
Scottish Football Association, was among the campaigners who
helped bring about the reform of the governing body's code of
conduct.
</P>
<P>
And he is happy that enough action has been taken to tackle the
problem: "There is now a written set of regulations in place to
prevent this from happening."

<HEADLINE> Fulham Owner Ready to "Let Keegan Go" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Fulham soccer club owner Mohamed
al-Fayed is willing to release England caretaker coach Kevin
Keegan from his contract with the runaway second division leaders,
according to reports in a Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Keegan originally agreed to take the England job on a short-
term basis because of his contract with the Craven Cottage outfit,
which runs for a further 18 months.
</P>
<P>
But al-Fayed has made it clear that he will let the former
Newcastle manager go if he wishes.
</P>
<P>
The Egypt-born tycoon, who is battling to be given a British
passport, said Keegan would be his "gift to the nation".
</P>
<P>
He told the Sunday Mirror: "If the nation wants Kevin, the
ordinary person wants Kevin and the FA wants Kevin then I will
give him to England, no problem.
</P>
<P>
"The nation comes first, the glory of the country - and that's
the sacrifice we will make at Fulham.
</P>
<P>
"If the FA can't find a replacement at the time his four-game
run ends and he wants to go he can leave with my blessing," added
Mr al-Fayed.
</P>
<P>
Keegan's reign as England coach began with Saturday's 3-1
victory over Poland at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
But he immediately confirmed that he would not seek to continue
in the post past the agreed four match period.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said he had enjoyed his first taste of international
management, but would not reverse his decision to take the job on
a caretaker basis.
</P>
<P>
"I've got four games and that's the deal," he said. "I'm going
to do the four games, then I hope I'm going to leave the new
manager in a position I would like to be left for me. Then I'm
going back to Fulham."
</P>
<P>
England now have a chance of qualifying for Euro 2000 - but
Keegan said if they do he would only be there as a TV commentator.
</P>
<P>
"This turns it round a bit but there is a lot of football left,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
"We all want to be in the European Championships. I want to be
there with the TV people, the fans want to be there, but most
importantly the players showed today how much they wanted to be
there," he said.

Games Village which is the brain child of the Nigeria '99 Local
Organization Committee (LOC).
</P>
<P>
Obi Asika, managing director of Storm Production which is one
of the village sponsors, was quoted as saying that "the whole idea
is to show that beyond football there are other things in Nigeria
that are worth doing."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the concept could be likened to the NIKE Park in
Paris during the last France '98 World Cup, adding that the
village would be a major attraction during the championship.
</P>
<P>
"What you are gonna see at the village is a reflection of our
culture," the managing director of the Storm Production which has
been active in the Britain and Nigeria since 1990, engaging in
nightclub promotion and show business.
</P>
<P>
During the championship which is scheduled to open on April 3,
cultural carnival and musical concert will be organized for the
global sporting event.
</P>
<P>
The cultural carnival scheduled to be held at the external
grounds of the National Theater in Lagos on April 2 will feature
up to 60 cultural troupes and masquerades from all over the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Some of these masquerades and the dances, according to sponsors,
have not been seen in their original form for about 20 years and
the troupes which will perform them would be from the communities
where the arts emanate from.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the culture list for the championship are
dances from South Africa, Sudan, Ethiopia, Central Africa, Ghana,
Brazil, France and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The musical concert is to be held more than one place in the
most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
It will start on the eve of the opening ceremony of Nigeria '99
on April 2 at the Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos, move to Port
Harcourt Civic Center on April 4 and Kaduna on April 10 before it
returns to Lagos on April 24 for the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fourth edition of the All Nigerian Food,
Beverage, Arts and Culture Festival will be staged this year at
the National Stadium Complex, venue of the Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
The festival is expected to kick off on April 3 immediately
after the grand opening ceremony of the championship and run
concurrently with the hosting of the Nigeria '99 throughout its
duration for 21 days.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, the festival is designed to
showcase the rich, excellent cuisines of Nigerian foods, beverages,
fashion, arts, crafts and music for export to the horde of foreign
visitors to the championship.
</P>
<P>
The festival is equally directed to facilitate the vital
projection of Nigerian rich cultural endowment and values to the
international community for the purpose of creating a new trend in
remoulding the country's battered image.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Beats Sister to Win Lipton Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- In an unpredecented WTA final
of sisters, Venus Williams outpowered kid sister Serena in three
sets to take the Lipton Championships in Florida on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Venus, 18, took eight of the final nine points to seal the
sensational championship match 6-1, 4-6 and 6-4 against her sister
one year junior.
</P>
<P>
The Williams sisters walked off the court without jubilation as
the two staged the first all-sister women's final in 115 years.
</P>
<P>
"It's not too big," Venus said, "In the end we go home, we live
life. You have to be happy after that. You have to remind yourself
it's a game, and there's only one winner. Next week there will be
another opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Their father Richard Williams watched most of the match from
the stands, holding up signs for the crowd "Welcome to the
Williams show" time and again.
</P>
<P>
Venus won her second consecutive Lipton title by putting an end
to Serena's 16-match winning streak.
</P>
<P>
Venus dominated the first set, with Serena rarely able to hit a
ball beyond her sister's reach. Serena was inconsistent from the
baseline throughout the match and had a whopping 66 unforced
errors, to 41 for Venus.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 4-3 in the second set, Serena rallied and won four
straight games. But she couldn't sustain the surge, and after
falling behind 2-1 in the final set, she flung her racket across
the court in frustration.
</P>
<P>
Serena broke serve with a backhand passing shot to even the
third set at 4-4, but she had seven unforced errors in the final
two games.
</P>
<P>
Venus now leads the sibling rivalry 3-0 and will remain No. 6
in next week's rankings, while Serena will climb to a career-best
11th.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTA Tour, the only other all-sister women's
final took place at Wimbledon in 1884, when Maud Watson beat her
older sister Lilian.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel defeated Cyprus three
goals against nil in a Group Six qualifier for the European
Championship 2000 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the Ramat Gan stadium, the Israelis dominated the pitch,
almost scoring twice in the opening minutes while Cyprus barely
staged one worthwhile attack and spent much of the game massing
its defense.
</P>
<P>
After his long-range shot was tipped over the bar, Israeli
captain Tal Banin, who plays for Brescia Italy, put the hosts
ahead with a powerful left-footed drive from 25 meters from the
ensuing corner.
</P>
<P>
Together with goalkeeper Nicos Panayiotou, the Cypriot defense
worked tirelessly to keep Israel's attacks at bay, as Eyal
Bercovic of England's West Ham United and Haim Ravivo of Spain's
Celta Vigo repeatedly prompted their forwards with accurate passes,
while Banin controlled the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
Israel's second goal came through half-time substitute striker
Alon Mizrachi of France's Nice in the third minute of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Bercovic dribbled passed two players and laid the ball to
Ravivo and on to Mizrachi who shot home with his first touch of
the ball.
</P>
<P>
Mizrachi scored again in the 51st minute after Bercovic cheated
defender Dimitris Ioannou in the penalty box and slipped the ball
to Mizrachi, who fired home.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold and silver
medalist Gary Hall Jr. has been diagnosed with diabetes and is
thinking retiring from swimming.
</P>
<P>
Hall withdrew from this week's U.S. national championships
after being warned by a family physician that diabetes was the
reason for his fatigue and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
"I'm considering retirement at this point," Hall was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Hall saw his physician after feeling weak in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"My arms would shake, and I thought that maybe it was just from
hard training," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hall finished second to Russia's Alexander Popov in the 100-
meter freestyle at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, then anchored two
gold medal in the relays.
</P>
<P>
He was suspended for three months last summer by the
International Olympic Committee after allegedly testing positive
for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
He competed September in a World Cup meet in Texas, where he
took the 50-meter freestyle title.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Hall plans to think through his options in the
upcoming weeks.

"I'm going to retreat, look at the future and try to come up
with a strategy," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A top political adviser in the
Chinese capital has urged the local government to establish a new
administrative system to treat urban waste in a more efficient and
useful way, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Such a system should help the sanitation and environmental
protection departments to meet the demands of a market-oriented
economy, He Shengtao, who is member of the Beijing Municipal
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increasing urban garbage treatment problems
in Beijing mainly to poor management and backward techniques,
although the lack of funds and policy support is also an important
factor.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the municipal government invested more
than 14 billion yuan (1.68 billion U.S. Dollar ) to control the
city's pollution.
</P>
<P>
However, the capital's environmental quality, including the air
pollution index as well as the state of solid garbage treatment,
is still bad.
</P>
<P>
Local government should encourage more enterprises or
institutes to participate in the industry of environmental
protection by developing new technologies for garbage
classification, burning, recycling, according to Peng Feixiang, an
engineer from the Environmental Protection Department of the
Beijing Chemical Institute.
</P>
<P>
Some engineers and experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences
have developed a small incinerator for burning solid garbage in a
northern Beijing suburb.
