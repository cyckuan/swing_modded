<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Yankees were here on the day before the
July 31 trade deadline, when Joe Torre told George Steinbrenner on
a conference call that he wanted to keep Andy Pettitte, rather than
trade him to Philadelphia. Torre cited Pettitte's penchant for
winning big games.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner went along with the recommendation of Torre and
general manager Brian Cashman, making it clear they would be held
responsible if Pettitte floundered. But Sunday night, Torre and
Cashman have the right to smugly offer I-told-you-so's, after
Pettitte and the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 9-2, in Game 4 of
the American League Championship Series. The Yankees, who blew open
a tense game with six runs in the ninth, lead by 3-1 in the
best-of-7 series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees do not want this series to reach a seventh game;
they do not want Pedro Martinez _ against whom they have five hits
and 35 strikeouts in their last 61 at-bats _ to get another chance
to pitch, in what would be the deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees now have two opportunities to clinch this series
before a seventh game: Orlando Hernandez, their best pitcher, will
face Boston's Kent Mercker Monday in Game 5, and if the Red Sox win
and extend the series, then David Cone would throw against Ramon
Martinez in Game 6 on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 3-2, in the eighth, and blew a great scoring
chance in the top half of the inning: They had second and third and
nobody out and could not push across a run. But Boston couldn't
score in the bottom of the eighth, and in the top of the ninth, the
Red Sox made two of their four errors and Ricky Ledee bashed a
pinch-hit grand slam off Rod Beck, and the Yankees could breathe
easy. Pettitte surrendered two runs on eight hits in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, the game was delayed for about five
minutes because of disruptive fans. When the teams returned to the
field, the Yankees closed out the game. The fans were upset about
two contested calls in consecutive innings that had gone against
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, sternly moved around
his team's clubhouse after Game 3s blow-out loss, and then again
before Sunday night's game, a living reminder of consequences. A
phone rang in the press room while Torre spoke with the media after
Game 3, and Torre asked if the phone was for him, adding, ``You
never know'' _ and everybody laughed, knowing what he meant.
Steinbrenner is omnipresent, especially in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre felt his team was relaxed, confident and fully aware
of the importance of Game 4. Torre shook up his lineup a bit,
replacing left fielder Ricky Ledee with Chad Curtis, and inserting
Darryl Strawberry as his designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry came to bat for the first time, the Fenway Park
fans offered a new and different chorus for the slugger with the
history of drugs and alcohol abuse _ ``Just Say No,'' they cried.
``Just Say No,'' the mournful chant, louder and louder. Boston's
Bret Saberhagen threw a high fastball and Strawberry rattled a high
drive two-thirds of the way up the right field foul pole, a solo
home run. It was the last time the hearty singers serenaded
Strawberry on this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive Pettitte, too, was hearing it _ Andy, Andy, they
called _ and the Red Sox tied the game in the bottom of the second.
Butch Huskey slamming a double into the left-field corner, but
appeared to pull a leg muscle as he came out of the box. When Troy
O'Leary singled to Bernie Williams in center field, however,
Huskey's slogging limp did not deter Wendell Kim, the Boston third
base coach, from waving Huskey around third in a direct challenge
of Williams' weak throwing arm. Huskey scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   That success may have led to a poor decision by Kim in the next
inning, when the Red Sox assumed a 2-1 lead but lost an opportunity
for more. Damon Buford singled, stole second and scored when Jose
Offerman rolled a base hit through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin smacked a long drive to left, where Curtis _ who
started, in part, because of his defensive familiarity with
Fenway's 37-foot high left-field wall _ misjudged the flight of
Valentin's shot. He was too close to the wall when the ball hit,
and it ricocheted off Curtis and behind him. Williams moved to back
up the play, and Boston's third base coach waved frantically,
beckoning Offerman around third base, sending him home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a serious miscalculation. Williams made a quick and short
throw to the shortstop Derek Jeter, and with his powerful arm,
Jeter relayed a rocket to catcher Joe Girardi; the ball arrived at
the plate in plenty of time for Girardi to reach and slap a tag on
Offerman _ the second out of the inning, with Nomar Garciaparra,
Boston's best hitter, due to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made more mistakes in the top of the fourth, and it cost
the Red Sox their lead. One out into the bottom of the fourth,
Bernie Williams rolled a grounder to the right of Garciaparra, and
the Boston shortstop hurried, gloved the ball, fired sidearm _ and
high, the ball sailing well over the outstretched mitt of the first
baseman Mike Stanley and into the Red Sox dugout. Williams was
allowed to take second on the fourth error of the series by
Garciaparra, who is one short of the AL championship series record.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen fell behind in the count by three balls and no
strikes to Tino Martinez, fought back to 3-2, then threw a pitch
right over the heart of the plate; Martinez whacked it, the ball
short-hopping off the base of the low wall in right-center field.
Williams trotted home with the tying run, Martinez pulled into
second base with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen intentionally walked Strawberry _ just say no, as far
as Saberhagen was concerned _ then struck out Scott Brosius and
appeared to be out of the inning when Chad Curtis hit a sharp
grounder toward Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston first baseman backed up to glove the ball, and
Saberhagen quickly moved to cover first base, Curtis running hard
down the line but well behind Saberhagen. Stanley's throw, however,
reached Saberhagen about thigh high, so that the pitcher had to
draw up his hands awkwardly to attempt the catch. The ball fell out
of his mitt and rolled away, and Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first
base coach, whirled and waved his right arm frantically, signaling
to Martinez to keep running, keep going home, and Martinez crossed
the plate standing. Yankees 3, Boston 2, and Steinbrenner, sitting
adjacent to his team's dugout, was laughing openly and appeared to
be jockeying playfully with Red Sox fans sitting nearby.

BULLFIGHTS IN NOGALES DISMAY ANIMAL ACTIVISTS

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOGALES, Sonora _ Mario de la Fuente knows that many Americans
abhor blood sports, so he suggests they stay home when bullfighting
returns to this border city next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very respectful of the American culture and I ask the
same respect when people come to my country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ``we'll sell the bulls' bodies to a local butcher
shop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will make good hamburgers the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; De la Fuente is banking on Americans filling most of the 5,000
seats in his new round, very red arena with aluminum siding and
clear acrylic top.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 14, he will bring bullfighting back to Nogales after a
nearly 30-year absence, with events twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Bullfighting enjoyed its heyday in Nogales in the 1950s and
early '60s, when such celebrities as John Wayne, Gary Cooper and
Sonny Liston regularly attended Sunday afternoon ``corridas'' at an
outdoor stadium decorated with matador frescos.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente got his start in the business there; his family
owned the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 90 percent of our customers came from Arizona,'' he
said. ``We would have 400 to 500 people come down from Phoenix for
our events.''
</P>
<P>
   The old stadium, which closed in 1973, fell into disrepair and
was condemned by the city, so de la Fuente built anew.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks matadors will find his domed venue very attractive,
because there will be no wind to interfere with cape movements.
</P>
<P>
   But the dome isn't the only amenity. There will be box seats at
ground level, where patrons can come almost eye to eye with the
bulls. Concession stands will sell mixed drinks along with beer,
tacos and hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente envisions other sporting events held at his grand
arena. He said he has talked with cockfight promoters about staging
fights in Nogales, now that Arizona has banned their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Television exposure is guaranteed. De la Fuente said he owns 18
cable companies in northwestern Mexico and will broadcast his blood
sports in the Nogales market.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to stage concerts, boxing and wrestling matches at
the arena, near the industrial district of Nogales, about three
miles south of the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this my own little BOB (Bank One Ballpark),'' said de
la Fuente, who owns a minority interest in the Arizona
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights activists call it a den of cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, there's not a damn thing we can do about this,'' said
Kim Hicks, spokeswoman for the Arizona Humane Society. ``But we are
terribly disappointed that they are going to be making money at the
expense of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that, as we approach the new
millennium, . . . people act like it's still medieval times. But we
hope that people in Nogales will just drive right by that place.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Nichols-Young, a Phoenix attorney active in animal
protection causes, also is sorry to hear that ``cruel blood sports
which should be long gone'' are being resurrected in Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is an animal-rights movement beginning in Latin
America,'' she said. ``It will be interesting to see what happens
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said sensibilities have changed since the last time
fighting bulls died in Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what happened when we rescued six Jersey bulls from the
back of a car,'' she said. ``This community went berserk. Our
donations went way up. That strikes me as the mentality which is in
the Valley now.''
</P>
<P>
   But De La Fuente said they shouldn't impose their values on
their neighbors south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people try to pull any shenanigans, I must warn them that
the Nogales police can be very tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In recent years, however, bullfighting has surged in popularity
in Tijuana, Juarez and other border cities. Noting that, de la
Fuente broke ground on his domed arena last year.
</P>
<P>
   At first, de la Fuente intended to offer a hybrid sport in which
matadors would simply tease bulls with their capes, followed by
bull wrestlers on horseback. But that didn't sit well with
bullfighting purists in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The association of matadors and picadors said that we would
have to comply with their regulations or they wouldn't work with
us,'' de la Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the traditional bullfighting.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente has an abundance of bulls to choose from. One of
the largest ranches in Mexico for production of purebred Iberian
fighting bulls is near Trincheras, Sonora, 80 miles south of
Nogales. De la Fuente said he will buy all the bulls that the ranch
produces.
</P>
<P>
   Four animals will likely be ready for the butcher shop after
each Nogales bullfight, which will last about three hours. Tickets
will cost $16 to $25 for the events.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente said ground also will be broken next year for a
2,000-seat outdoor bullfighting ring in Puerto Penasco, Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market definitely is there and we are going to put on an
entertaining product,'' he said. &QL;

HIGHER EDUCATION SHIFTS FOCUS: TEACHERS NOW `GUIDE ON THE SIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A University of Arizona junior learns biology and
psychology by talking to a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona State University student masters English composition,
not from a book, but from teaching disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors at Northern Arizona University learn business by
advising a Flagstaff music store on marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   They're all part of a trend sweeping higher education called
learner-centered education _ a shift from passive learning in
lecture halls to active learning through independent discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental change in the role of the faculty. They
are increasingly the guide on the side rather than the sage on the
stage,'' said Peter Likins, president of the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The switch, Likens said, is the most profound change he has seen
in 35 years as a professor.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is filtering through all levels of the state's three
universities, and has become the central focus of a yearlong
examination by the Arizona Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Guskin, former president of Antioch University and a
national expert on learner-centered education, said institutions
across the country are grappling with the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense about Arizona is there is a lot of exciting ferment,
a lot of interesting ideas going on,'' Guskin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a very big jump to go from teacher-centered learning
to student-centered,'' he added, ``in which students learn in many
different venues, the classroom being but one.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true of Robert Sandefer, a University of Arizona junior
majoring in biology and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He's among 140 students in the UA's undergraduate biology
research program, designed to teach students science by involving
them in projects that once were done only by graduate students. &QL; 
`INTENSIVE' LEARNING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very intensive, very personalized way of learning for
the student,'' said Carol Bender, program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are learning how to apply everything from their past
experience to a problem that has not yet been solved.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given afternoon, Sandefer conducts experiments on
cognition with an African grey parrot named Alex, who is presented
with two stacking cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick up the yellow cup,'' Sandefer says.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, Alex walks over the table and picks up the yellow
cup. He is rewarded by a nut that lies beneath.
</P>
<P>
   When Alex makes the right choice 16 out of 20 times, Sandefer
puts out a new cup in an unfamiliar color next to the yellow cup,
and instructs: ``Pick up the cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandefer is waiting for the moment Alex turns and asks: ``What
color?''
</P>
<P>
   Alex will then prove he knows he needs more information, and is
therefore self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Some techniques derived from such research have been applied to
developmentally delayed children, Sandefer said. Other findings
could help neurologically impaired people use alternate structures
in their brains to learn tasks. &QL; 
LEARNING BY TUTORING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Meghan Ederle is learning English composition by tutoring
kids at the Salvation Army's South Mountain Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experiences I have at this site I reflect back on paper,''
Ederle said. South Phoenix's cultural diversity and economic
challenges are fodder for essays that earn her English course
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 ASU students have participated in the tutoring
program, which has helped 7,679 children in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Students like ASU education major Kristy Kay Stover get to
observe youngsters learn rather than simply read textbooks about
how kids process information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned what kids know and what their troubles are,''
Stover said. &QL; 
HELP BUSINESSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, students in Northern Arizona University's Small
Business Institute and Students In Free Enterprise program are
gaining knowledge by helping small businesses with real-world
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Ochsner and Martha Memmer, owners of Cedar Music, turned to
NAU students for help. Within a year, they had a 200-page report
packed with ideas for improving the bottom line, plus a $25,000
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Borstadt, an NAU finance professor, said the students ``are
developing leadership, teamwork and communication skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the soft skills employers are really after,''
Borstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   The same skills are honed through Students in Free Enterprise, a
national organization. NAU's chapter has completed 64
entrepreneurial projects and 378 presentations, Borstadt said, as
well as working with K-12 students in 38 schools and 38 businesses
in northern Arizona. &QL; 
PROCESS LESS EFFICIENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to individual student learning styles is the faculty's
focus, Likins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning through discovery, as opposed to learning through
authority is a less efficient process,'' he said. ``It may take you
longer to get to the truth because there is an element of trial and
error. But it produces a deeper, more enduring kind of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Book-learning and lectures are still part of the process. But so
are conducting independent research, working in teams, learning
from colleagues, and scouring the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Gignac, immediate past president of the regents, said the
movement is ``catching fire'' and could lead to profound changes in
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the student calls the current system of
degree-preparation into question, she said. Rather than have
everyone complete a set number of credit hours for a degree, should
individual programs be crafted, based on each student's knowledge
base?
</P>
<P>
   The cost effectiveness of learner-centered education has yet to
be quantified. Charles Bantz, senior vice provost at ASU, noted
that there will be additional short-term costs for training,
developing materials and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Are the payoffs worth it? Small-scale studies indicate students
learn more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time now for the board and the universities to define
more clearly what we view as measurable outcomes,'' ASU President
Lattie Coor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where the board will turn _ how to define it and
measure it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gignac said the issues also will be aired before the Governor's
Higher Education Task Force and at a town hall scheduled for May in
Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's enough enthusiasm generated for this kind of
change, do what you love and the money will follow,'' she said.
``That may be the case with this. Who knows?'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TORRE TURNS A HUNCH INTO A SURE THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joe Torre had nothing to go on, choosing Darryl
Strawberry over Chili Davis. As far as he knew, Strawberry had
never batted against Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chili's struggling right now,'' Torre said. ``The one thing
Darryl gives you is the threat of a home run, and we may need a
boom here tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry came to bat in the second inning on Sunday night, the
Yankees already trailing the Red Sox by a run. The Fenway Park fans
_ many of whom would later disgrace themselves by making the
Yankees live, fleeing targets of their anger and frustration _
chanted ``just say no.'' The count went to 2-2. Strawberry just
said boom, homering off the screen of the fair pole in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rhyme or reason,'' said Torre, the untouchable. ``Just a
feel thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a feel-better night for Torre, for the Yankees, after
Saturday's brief derailment along the way to another World Series.
Torre was right on Strawberry, who also walked in the middle of a
two-run fourth inning that gave the Yankees two unearned runs and
the lead for good. He was on the money with Andy Pettitte,
left-hander on the loose in a park known to devour them.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte rewarded Torre for his faith with seven and one-third
gritty innings. Torre pulled more ninth-inning strings and the
Yankees ran away from the Sox to win Game 4 by 9-2 and take a
three-games-to-one lead in the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, in all likelihood, is the Game 7 sword over the Yankees'
heads known as Pedro Martinez. Torre had said he was never worried,
anyway, after 21 Red Sox hits in Game 3. There was, he would have
said, no reason to consider rearranging his pitching plans because
of the Roger Clemens fiasco, to overreact too soon. With the Yankee
bats sickly all series, he stuck with light-hitting Joe Girardi on
Sunday night, and refused to move the ailing and slumping Paul
O'Neill down in the order. On cue, the Red Sox helped out with
pitiful infield play and four badly timed errors, and also ran
themselves out of a potential big inning in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Some things don't change. Torre, as usual, came up smelling
roses. After the Yanks broke it open, he didn't have to sweat out
the ninth inning, or any more ground balls to Chuck Knoblauch. Only
the sight of sad-sack fans heaving plastic soda bottles and debris
on the field, briefly halting the game two outs from its
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   That ugliness aside, Torre continued to enjoy life in pinstripes
in a way few men have before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you do this, the more fun it is,'' he said. ``For
sure last year, after winning 114 games, you felt sort of obligated
to have to go to the World Series and win. Otherwise people would
have downplayed what you accomplished. This is more fun, and maybe
I have approaching it that way because where I was six months ago
and knowing what was going on in my body and my life.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when baseball hysteria rules, Torre is the calm,
paternal face of New York sports. That has always been his nature,
and has been his approach since he took managerial control of a
team long fueled by panic and fear. Now he works a few months
removed from believing he had been handed ``a death sentence'' upon
learning he had prostate cancer last spring. He operates in his
fourth Yankee season with the capital of two World Series
championships, the perfect steward for a team that has won with
style and class.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the season of second-guessing, Torre floats
above the jerking knees, not having every decision analyzed like a
nuclear arms treaty. Everyone else is always one move away from
facing the tribunal of baseball geniuses. Bobby Valentine's woes
have been well documented. What a winter Bobby Cox will be in for
should the Braves ever lose to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been Valentine _ who invites second guesses the way
politicians do soft money _ who had sent an anxious Clemens into
Fenway for such disastrous results Saturday, he would surely have
been subjected to 24 hours of hell. Fair or not, this is how it is.
</P>
<P>
   Torre shrugged it off, and even seem to enjoy a rare Yankees'
moment of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That for me?'' he said when a cell phone rang during his
post-game news conferecnce. Assured it was not, he said: ``You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee manager knows how many native New Yorkers and a
certain Ohio-born Floridian react when the other team gets noisy
and palms get sweaty in the midst of a baseball playoff series.
Vinny from Queens and Mike from Montclair and George from Tampa
start dialing respective outlets, making a show of their
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' owner, in fact, planted himself in a box seat
alongside the dugout, ducking out in the ninth only when the game
was safe, and the playing field wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very compassionate man when you do lose,'' Torre said.
``I think he's a tougher taskmaster when you're winning, to keep
you from taking your eye off the finish line. When you lose, he's
there to support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Torre could believe this. But then, based on the results,
we always believe Torre, too.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BROTHERS'' &QL; 
(Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

SCOTT TUROW LOOKS AT JUSTICE SERVED IN `PERSONAL INJURIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic

<P>
   ``Personal Injuries'' &QL; 
By Scott Turow &QL; 
(Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many lawyers publishing novels these days, but there's
no one better than Scott Turow. He doesn't just churn out
bestsellers. He WRITES them, with intelligence and depth and a feel
for our fascination with the nether regions of the law _ those back
rooms and muted conversations in which the truth comes out, deals
are struck and destinies, however illustrious or tawdry they might
be, are made.
</P>
<P>
   Turow finishes a book like clockwork, every three years:
``Presumed Innocent (1987),'' ``The Burden of Proof
(1990),''``Pleading Guilty (1993)''and ``The Laws of Our Fathers
(1996).'' Now, we have ``Personal Injuries,'' a novel meant not so
much to entertain as to make us think about ambition and
compromise, and their affect on how justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most layered and introspective book Turow has written.
That doesn't mean it's his best _ there are whole chapters that
will try a reader's patience _ but it's certainly his most
ambitious. And in Scott Turow, ambition can be a mighty impressive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The character at the center of ``Personal Injuries'' is Robbie
Feaver (pronounced ``favor''), a personal-injury lawyer who with
his partner has been caught shortchanging the IRS. In this
instance, tax evasion is less a crime than convenient leverage _ on
the heels of the IRS agents comes U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who
offers to keep Feaver out of jail if he will provide evidence
against judges suspected of taking payoffs from lawyers (Feaver
among them) in exchange for favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are several judges in question, but the one Sennett really
wants is the powerful Brendan Tuohey, the man most likely to become
chief judge of Kindle County, the fictional setting of Turow's
novels. In his effort to get Tuohey, Sennett sets up an elaborate
ruse that includes fake lawyers, fake clients and fake
personal-injury cases. Project Petros, as the sting is called, will
go on for months, with Robbie Feaver attempting to record judges as
they sniff at, then swallow, his bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Turow uses these circumstances to create some memorable
characters, all laden with contradictions. Stan Sennett is an
ambitious man whose righteous convictions are served by devious and
often cutthroat tactics. Evon Miller, the FBI agent brought in to
pose as Feaver's associate and latest lover, grapples with her own
secrets (she is a poor imitation of Thomas Harris' Clarice Starling
in ``The Silence of the Lambs'') while she tries to fend off
Feaver's amorous attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The crooked judges are colorful even as they flirt with disaster
on Robbie Feaver's surveillance tapes. Barnett Skolnick is a
rambling but likeable dimwit (``There are dead men,'' Feaver says,
``who are not as dumb as Barney Skolnick'') who owes his place on
the bench to the tactics of his brother, a thug named Knuckles.
Sherman Crowthers is a huge and powerfully spoken Black man, once
one of the best defense attorneys in the county, now a judge who
rules his courtroom with rough eloquence and intimidation. And
Brendan Tuohey, the biggest prize, hides his avarice under a veneer
of serenity, protected by the loyalty of the lackeys around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the real enigma is Feaver himself, a pretty boy who appears
to have slept with every woman he has ever met (he would have sex
with a spoon if it seemed willing), yet remains devoted to his
wife, who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Feaver starts the book
as a sleazy yukster, a used-car salesman in an Italian suit and a
perpetual tan, but grows in substance and stature until we almost _
ALMOST _ understand what women see in him. By the end, he is the
novel's symbolic Good Man, and he deserves the emphasis. Caught
among the criminals, the cops and the lawyers, he is the key to all
of their ambitions, but is left with nothing to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having created such a dense abundance of character, Turow tells
his story with a surprisingly heavy hand. This is his most
descriptive book, and that's not such a good thing. He gives us the
details of everything _ rugs, desks, buildings, courtrooms,
clothing, people and, most annoyingly, the minutiae of surveillance
(it seems as if we receive an inventory of Robbie's cameras and
microphones every time he approaches a judge over the long months
of Project Petros). Once, when Robbie walks through an innocuous
patch of woods on his way to a golf-course meeting with Brendan
Tuohey, Turow describes not only the trees and the land around him,
but the settlers who had walked that way a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some slow going, and that, unfortunately, is one of
the lingering impressions of this book: ``Personal Injuries,''
which is 400 pages long, could have lost 50 and been better for it.
There's also the matter of its narrator. George Mason, who is
Robbie Feaver's attorney, begins the novel in the first person,
establishing himself as the teller of the story. His voice fades in
and out, however, giving way without warning to an omniscient
narration in the many scenes during which George is not present
(private conversations between Evon and Robbie, for example, or
between Evon and Robbie's dying wife).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your mood, you'll think this reappearing ``I'' is
arty or distracting. Or maybe, if you're feeling very generous,
you'll choose to look at it as a lawyer's tactic. After all, as
George tells us from the start, ``This is a lawyer's story, the
kind attorneys like to hear and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want action, look elsewhere. But if you want a glimpse of
the legal profession through one of its own (Scott Turow still
practices in Chicago), this is not a bad place to be. His mistakes
are a writer's mistakes, something most lawyer-novelists don't have
the talent to make. If you want proof, just wait three years. &QL;

 &HT;    'Curse of Bambino' looms large as Yankees take game 4 of ALCS
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The light is dimming in New England, the Curse ever
more apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees pushed Boston to within a game of ALCS
elimination Sunday night, blowing apart a tense evening with a
disputed umpire's call and a pinch-hit grand slam by Ricky Ledee in
a 9-2 runaway that put the Red Sox down three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which had averaged 15 runs a game in three postseason
dates at Fenway Park, was blanked over the final six innings by
starter Andy Pettitte (7 1/3 innings, one earned run) and closer
Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Just for a little Bambino Curse spicing, Boston's Jose Offerman
was called out by umpire Tim Tschida in a disputed play for running
out of the base line during an inning-ending double play in the
eighth. On cue, New York put up six runs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   After a close call against Boston brought a shower of debris in
the bottom of the ninth inning, umpires cleared the field for eight
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 33,586 already was angry, having seen
second-base umpire Tim Tschida call out Jose Offerman in the eighth
inning _ replays indicated second baseman Chuck Knoblauch missed
the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee's grand slam in the top of
the ninth broke it open and gave the Yankees a 9-2 lead, the real
trouble began.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra opened the bottom half with a grounder to
third baseman Scott Brosius and was called out by first-base umpire
Dale Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams ran on the field to argue and
threw his hat. Williams was ejected, and the fans went crazy.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a few plastic water bottles were thrown on the field.
Glass bottles followed, with several of them barely missing Scott's
head.
</P>
<P>
   With security personnel rushing on the field, first baseman Tino
Martinez and other Yankees also had to duck flying objects as they
went scurrying for cover in the third-base dugout. New York
relievers also ran out of the right-field bullpen as umpires waved
them off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd continued to chant profanities, and the public-address
announcer was forced to urge fans to halt, saying the Red Sox might
be forced to forfeit the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees waited safely in their dugout, order was
restored and the game resumed.
</P>
<P>
   A home run by Darryl Strawberry and error by Boston pitcher Bret
Saberhagen had given the Yankees a 3-2 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As in the series' first three games, Boston posted an early
lead, Jose Offerman breaking up a 1-1 tie in the third inning with
an RBI single bringing in Damon Buford. The lead might have been
two runs, but Offerman was thrown out on Derek Jeter's relay home
when he attempted to score from first on John Valentin's double off
the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   That play became important in the fourth, when Boston gave away
its 2-1 lead. An error by Nomar Garciaparra and a more painful
bobble by Saberhagen opened the way, Garciaparra first allowing
Bernie Williams to reach second on a wild throw. Williams came
around to tie it 2-2 on Tino Martinez's double.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later with two out, Saberhagen appeared to be out of
it when Chad Curtis grounded to first. But Mike Stanley's potential
inning-ending throw to first base was low and Saberhagen dropped
it, allowing Martinez to score, giving the Yankees the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boston tied it 1-1 in the second, despite Butch Huskey's balky
knee. The Red Sox DH was able to leg out a double running with a
heavy limp but barely scored on Troy O'Leary's bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre played a hunch with his choice of
starting Strawberry as his DH, saying, ``To me, Darryl is a force.
The one thing Darryl gives you is the threat of a home run ...''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry needed only one at-bat to fulfill that trust with a
drive off the right-field foul pole in the second inning for a 1-0
lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robin Ventura was waving his hand wildly, pushing his
long ball back as he neared first base and, with it, pushing the
National League Championship Series into pandemonium and a return
to Atlanta. Ventura's ball cleared the right-field wall, but he
never made it around for his grand slam. Ventura was mobbed by his
teammates near second base, his shot having driven in the winning
run in the bottom of the 15th inning for a stunning 4-3 Mets
victory over the Atlanta Braves in Game 5 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The victory cut the Braves' lead in the four-of-seven-game
series to 3-2, and forced the series back to Atlanta, where Game 6
will be played Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The longest game in post-season history, at 5 hours 46 minutes,
and one that continued the life of the Mets' season came down to a
player who was just 1 for 18 in the series when he came to the
plate with one out and the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   After Ventura sent the ball sailing over the wall against the
Atlanta reliever Kevin McGlinchy, he rounded first and saw his
teammates running across the field at him. Ventura was mobbed
before he reached second base, but by that time Matt Franco had
scored the winning run. Although the ball cleared the fence,
Ventura was credited with a single and only one run scored.
</P>
<P>
   The long single completed an extraordinary inning and continued
an increasingly improbable run in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are only the second team _ the Braves were the first
last year _ to come back from a 0-3 deficit to win two games in a
seven-game series, but now they must try to accomplish a much more
unlikely feat: becoming the first team to come back from 0-3 to
win. And after what took place at Shea Stadium on Sunday night _ it
was reminiscent of the Mets' 7-6 victory in 16 innings over the
Astros in the NLCS in 1986 _ only someone who had not paid
attention for the last month could doubt that the World Series was
still beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
   As they had so many times this season, the Mets looked finished
in the top half of the 15th. The teams had played to a 2-2 tie by
the fourth inning and then had stayed there, squandering
opportunities, shuffling players, stretching the patience and
endurance of the rain-soaked fans. The Braves alone stranded 19
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, with the Mets' ninth pitcher of the game, the
rookie Octavio Dotel, on the mound _ only Al Leiter, the Game 6
starter, and Rick Reed, who pitched Game 4, were left _ Walt Weiss
led off the 15th with a single. Dotel got the next two batters out,
but when Keith Lockhart smashed a triple to right center to score
Weiss and give Atlanta a 3-2 lead, Dotel was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were on the brink of going to their fifth World
Series of the 1990s and the Mets were on the verge of a devastating
end to a remarkable month. Dotel struck out the dangerous Brian
Jordan to escape the inning, and when he went to the dugout, he was
met by a group of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation for a kid to come in when we're down to
the last game,'' Darryl Hamilton said. ``We said, `Kid, we're going
to get a run and you're going to be in this game and you're going
to win this game.'''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Hamilton was right. Shawon Dunston led off the
bottom of the 15th with a remarkable at-bat: nine minutes, 12
pitches, six pitches fouled off after the count reached 3-2.
Finally, he singled up the middle. Matt Franco pinch-hit for Dotel,
meaning that if the game had continued, Manager Bobby Valentine
would have nearly needed volunteers from the crowd to take the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Franco set a major league record this season by drawing 19 walks
as a pinch-hitter and so, naturally, after Dunston had already
stolen second, Franco drew another walk. Edgardo Alfonzo sacrificed
the two runners ahead, and McGlinchy, the Braves' sixth pitcher,
intentionally walked John Olerud, who had hit a home run in the
first inning to score the Mets' first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded, Roger Cedeno, who had been held out with
back spasms, came in to run for Franco, and Todd Pratt came to the
plate. He had replaced Mike Piazza as catcher in the 14th inning,
after Piazza strained his left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   All the pressure was on the young reliever and he wasn't
throwing strikes. The count went to 3-0 and Pratt faked the bunt.
``I was trying to put another tool into the mix,'' Pratt explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Pratt took ball four to walk home the tying run and bring
Ventura to bat. Ventura, hampered by a bad knee, had seemed
terribly uncomfortable at the plate during this series and he, in
particular, had struggled all season against the Braves. But he
knew well that McGlinchy was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different when the bases are loaded and the guy has
already walked a guy,'' Ventura said. ``He can't really fool around
and throw a bunch of pitches in the dirt. So I'm just trying to get
a ball in the air so the guy can score.''
</P>
<P>
   He did more than that. He took the count to 2-1 and then
launched the ball in the air. Valentine did not know if it would
clear the fence, and it hardly mattered, since even a sacrifice fly
would win the game. ``He scalded that ball,'' Pratt said. ``I knew
we had won the game just the way the ball came off the bat. It was
just classic for him to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   The other comebacks that had brought the Mets to this point had
seemed improbable. This one was insane. The series now moves to
Atlanta, where the Mets have won just once in eight tries this
season. Of course, for the Mets, that's probably the good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like this team responds to dire situations,''
Ventura said. ``We just play another day. It seems like we've been
saying that for about a month and a half now. We can't lose another
game. We're happy to just be playing.'' &QL;

SPORTS WORLD OUT OF ORBIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's oversaturated edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the millennium, maybe it's aftershocks. Whatever the
cause, the sports world is seriously out of whack at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are the only unbeaten team in the NFL. The World
Wildlife Association has just placed quarterbacks on the endangered
species list. The Pac-10 may send an unranked team to the Rose
Bowl. The Hokies may play for the national title. New York baseball
fans are calling their team with a $65 million payroll a
``miracle.'' The Red Sox are still playing, and the first BCS poll,
a sure sign of armageddon, is due next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's Y2Krazy. ...
</P>
<P>
   So what are the chances of the Los Angeles Rams -- I've
reclaimed them on the behalf of our chagrined citizenry --
finishing the season unbeaten?
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, especially since the 49er era has officially ended.
After next week's win against Cleveland, the Rams play at Tennessee
and Detroit. If they're 8-0 at that point, they'll have
home-and-homes left with Carolina and New Orleans and a game at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, their biggest challenge will be staying awake with
season ending games against the Giants, Bears and Eagles. Here's
hoping Georgia Frontiere lets the Super Bowl Trophy spend a weekend
in L.A. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Raiders -- I've reclaimed them on behalf of the
six people who send me letters calling for their return -- are 3-3
after six tough weeks, and they have home games coming up against
the Jets and Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   But if they can stay upright, they could steal a playoff berth.
They'll have six games left against AFC West rivals, including two
versus the Chargers, whom they own, and games against Tennessee and
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   With the Broncos and Jets demised and the Jags struggling, the
AFC is a raffle. Picking any one team to survive at this point is
foolish conjecture. Why not the Raiders?
</P>
<P>
   And the real advantage for L.A. Raider fans with frequent flier
miles is that plenty of good seats are available in the Oakland
Mausoleum. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's the latest installment of ``They're Killing the Great
Quarterbacks of the NFL,'' a thrilling breakdown of all the bad
breaks at the most important position:
</P>
<P>
   Teams forced to change QBs Sunday due to injuries: Arizona (Jake
Plummer), Detroit (Charlie Batch), Jacksonville (Mark Brunell),
Miami (Dan Marino).
</P>
<P>
   Teams previously forced to change QBs due to injuries: Atlanta
(Chris Chandler), Chicago (Shane Matthews), New York Jets (Vinny
Testaverde), San Diego (Jim Harbaugh), San Francisco (Steve Young),
Tennessee (Steve McNair).
</P>
<P>
   Teams changing QBs Sunday, coach's decision: Minnesota (Jeff
George for Randall Cunningham), New Orleans (Billie Joe Tolliver
for Billie Joe Hobert), New York Jets (Ray Lucas for Rick Mirer).
</P>
<P>
   Teams previously changing QBs in 1999, coach's decision:
Cincinnati, Denver, Philadelphia, New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Teams starting rookies: Cincinnati (Akili Smith), Chicago (Cade
McNown), Cleveland (Tim Couch).
</P>
<P>
   Teams starting sophomores: Denver (Brian Griese), Detroit
(Charlie Batch), Indianapolis (Peyton Manning).
</P>
<P>
   Teams with first-year starters, non-rookies: Baltimore (Stoney
Case), Philadelphia (Doug Pederson), St. Louis (Kurt Warner), San
Francisco (Jeff Garcia).
</P>
<P>
   Teams starting '98 reserves: Carolina (Steve Beuerlein), New
Orleans (Billie Joe Whoever), Oakland (Rich Gannon), San Diego
(Harbaugh/Erik Kramer), Tennessee (Neil O'Donnell).
</P>
<P>
   Teams starting ex-CFL stars: Buffalo (Doug Flutie).
</P>
<P>
   Teams whose fans want a change at QB: Pittsburgh (Kordell
Stewart), Tampa Bay (Trent Dilfer).
</P>
<P>
   QBs who should buy more insurance: Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe,
Brett Favre, Elvis Grbac and Brad Johnson. ...
</P>
<P>
   Considering the shape of the Pac-10 this season, let's answer
this question before anyone asks: No, there's never been a Pac-10
champ with three conference losses.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as 1983, the Pac-10 sent an unranked team to the
Rose Bowl. The Bruins started 0-3-1 but rallied under quarterback
Rick Neuheisel to go 6-1-1 in the conference and win the Rose Bowl
invitation. And once there, they routed No. 4 Illinois, 45-9. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's play this year is indefensible, but I refuse to
believe there are seven Big Ten teams better than any one Pac-10
team, which is the case poll-wise. In the current coach's poll, 42
different teams received at least one vote, and only two were from
the Pac-10 (Arizona and Stanford).
</P>
<P>
   That's taking things a bit far. Oregon lost to Michigan State by
a touchdown. Any single loss isn't as bad as Wisconsin losing to
Cincinnati (other than Arizona State losing to New Mexico State).
And Minnesota and several other Top 25 teams have played the
football equivalent of Grenada. ...
</P>
<P>
   My greatest desire is to see three or more teams finish the
season unbeaten and throw the BCS into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is 7-0 and No. 1, but three of the 'Noles four
remaining games are on the road -- at Clemson, where Poppa Bowden
meets Sonny Bowden Saturday; at Virginia, where the Seminoles lost
their first ACC game ever; and at Florida and Steve Spurrier,
Bowden's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State is 7-0 and No. 2, but they still have road games left
at Purdue and Michigan State, plus a home date against Michigan. If
the Big Ten is as good as the pollsters would lead you to believe,
no one will go unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is 6-0 and No. 3, but the four toughest games of their
1999 schedule lie ahead, at Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, Kansas State and at
Colorado, plus the Big XII title game.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech is 6-0, ranked No. 4, and plays cheese wiz the
rest of the season -- Pitt, West Virginia, Miami, Temple and Boston
College. The Hokies thus have the best chance of playing their way
into the title game, assuming it isn't vanquished by a computer
virus. ...
</P>
<P>
   Marshall of the Mid-American Conference is also unbeaten and has
played its toughest games already, but it would take severals Acts
of God to get them into the BCS picture. Kansas State and
Mississippi State are also unbeaten but longshots to run the table.
...
</P>
<P>
   The best possible prognosis for USC and UCLA is a trip for two
to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   That's where a bowl doubleheader will be played Christmas Day.
But the 3-4 Bruins need to win three of their last four games to
qualify, and they still have Arizona, Washington and USC left.
</P>
<P>
   USC, 3-3, needs to win four of their remaining six, since the
bowls require at least six Division 1-A wins and a winning record.
In this case, the scheduling of a 12th game can work against the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   As poorly as USC has played lately, I wouldn't call anyone on
their remaining schedule unbeatable: Stanford, Cal, Arizona State,
Washington State, UCLA and Louisiana Tech. ...
</P>
<P>
   Only New York could throw words like ``miracle'' around a team
that won 95 regular season games and has a $65 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine horribly over manages his team. Any manager who
uses seven pitchers in a 2-2 game through nine innings, and who
puts a shortstop in center field deserves to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the Mets are still alive is because Braves
manager Bobby Cox is a notorious overmanager himself, especially
when it comes to selecting his relievers. ...
</P>
<P>
   Separated at birth: Raider fan, Met fan.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ A rules technicality robbed Robin Ventura of what should
have gone down as one of the greatest home runs in playoff history.
But nothing could stop the New York Mets from stealing a victory
that appeared safely tucked into the Atlanta Braves' back pockets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ventura's game-winning hit _ a grand slam that was ruled a
single because he didn't circle the bases _ capped the longest
playoff game (by time) in major-league history and lifted the
resilient Mets to a 15-inning 4-3 victory in Game 5 of the National
League Championship Series on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the Mets staved off elimination in
the best-of-seven series. Game 6 is set for Tuesday at Atlanta's
Turner Field, and after playing for five hours and 46 minutes, both
teams could use the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was playoff baseball at its best,'' said Braves starter
Greg Maddux, who pitched the first seven innings. ``That's probably
as good a game as anyone has seen since (Game 6 of the 1986 NLCS
when the Mets eliminated the Astros in 16 innings). This was a heck
of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in two weeks the Mets won a game that
would have ended their season had they lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were thinking, they were pulling, they were believing
the whole time,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``They came up
big. When players come up big and do the right things, you're able
to play a great team like Atlanta tough as long as we played them
until they cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   A playoff-record 45 players were used in the game, and the Mets
used nine of their 11 pitchers. Al Leiter, who will start Tuesday's
game for the Mets, was warming up along with Game 4 starter Rick
Reed when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Braves manager Bobby Cox, who has shown a
willingness to use his starters in relief when the game is on the
line, kept his biggest guns in the holster, apparently saving them
for a non-rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cox put his team's fate in the hands of seldom-used
rookie reliever Kevin McGlinchy, who created the 15th-inning mess
by allowing a single and three walks (one intentional) before
serving up Ventura's bullet over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was demoralizing, to say the least, for the Braves, who
had taken the lead in the top of the 15th on Keith Lockhart's RBI
triple. Within a matter of minutes, McGlinchy gave it back. The
question on almost everyone's mind was why Cox didn't use Kevin
Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to use Millwood in that stuff,'' Cox said in
reference to the wet and muddy conditions. ``(McGlinchy) is a
big-leaguer. He should be able to throw strikes and get them out.
We thought he would.''
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who was 1-for-19 in the series before Sunday's heroic
at-bat, rewrote the script with one swing. As he rounded first
base, his teammates poured from the bench and created a mob scene
in the middle of the diamond. That's as close as Ventura would get
to home plate, thus the odd ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it go over (the fence), and then I ran to first,''
Ventura said. ``As long as I touched first base, we won, so that's
fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the thrill of victory; the agony of defeat rested in
the gut of a rookie pitcher down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it right on the chin,'' McGlinchy said. ``That's pretty
tough to take. That situation was about as pressure-filled as it
gets, but my job is to go out there in pressure situations. I
really wanted the ball, and I really wanted to get guys out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept getting behind in the count, and it's tough to pitch
from behind. At some point, the game was going to end; I just hated
being the guy who had to walk off the mound when it was over like
that. It's very discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   There was action in the beginning and major drama at the end,
but not much in between. For about 10 innings, home plate might as
well have been under quarantine. The Braves left 19 runners on
base, and the Mets stranded 12, or one more than the Braves left in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed way too many opportunities,'' Cox said. ``We should
have scored many more runs. We had a few more chances than they did
and swung at a lot of bad balls. It was not an easy way to lose a
ballgame, but in Kevin's defense, the mound was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to throw strikes off that mound, and your shoes
were stacking up with clay underneath them. I don't care who you
would have brought in, they probably would have walked them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's two-run homer put the Mets on the board in the
first inning. The Braves tied the score at 2 in the fourth on Brian
Jordan's RBI single, which followed doubles by Bret Boone and
Chipper Jones.

Texan Ray claims IRL title at home 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the moment after he took the checkered flag
Sunday as the new champion of the Pep Boys Indy Racing League, Greg
Ray said his thoughts turned immediately to donuts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hadn't had the chance to do donuts in this car this year,''
said Ray, referring to the celebratory spins that have become
commonplace by race winners. ``I was looking for a place big enough
to do it. I'm going to have to practice that.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that Plano resident Ray executed two crisp
donuts at both ends of the front-stretch dogleg at Texas Motor
Speedway, in a salute to his team, his Lone Star fans and
ultimately to himself. On a damp and long day that began with three
drivers in contention for the 1999 driver's championship, Mark
Dismore emerged as a first-time IRL winner at the conclusion of the
Mall.com 500.
</P>
<P>
   And Ray emerged as a first-time IRL champion, who can spend the
off-season refining his donut delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't sink in for a while,'' said Ray, whose third-place
finish behind Dismore and Davey Hamilton was enough to hold off
title-contenders Kenny Brack and Sam Schmidt for a $1 million
championship bonus. ``I know when I did my first Indy 500 it didn't
sink in for months after that. To win the championship and win it
here, that's big. That's going to be real big.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray finished one lap down to Dismore in the 208-lap event around
TMS' 1.5-mile quadoval. On other race days this season, that would
have been unacceptable for the aggressive Ray and team-owner John
Menard. Sunday, pole-sitter Ray raced safely and smartly on a track
where ambient temperatures in the mid-50s at the start of the race
and track temperatures only in the 60s made traction-control a key
element of the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The championship, of course, is more important than winning
one race,'' said Ray, 33, who was making his 24th IRL start. ``It
doesn't matter what your game plan is. It's a game of technology
and dealing with what is in front of you. We thought we could win
the race and the championship here in Texas. We would have liked to
have won here, almost as much as Indy. But the championship was the
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray began the race _ which rolled off 3 hours, 55 minutes past
its scheduled 1 p.m. start time because of rain _ with a 16-point
lead over Brack. And Ray was 33 points up on Schmidt, winner of the
previous race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sept. 26 and the only
other title contender.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's shot at the title ended when he and Scott Sharp
collided on a restart down the frontstretch on Lap 126. The crash
punted Schmidt into the outside retaining wall, causing heavy
front-end damage to a car he was fighting to keep in eighth place.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said that as concerned as he was for Schmidt, his friend and
weekend houseguest, he had to refocus on Brack, who was leading the
race. Ray was running second at that point, with Dismore in third.
When the race went back to green on Lap 140, Brack, Ray and Dismore
held their positions as the only drivers on the lead lap until
Sharp's blown engine brought out the day's fifth yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   On Lap 154, Brack pitted for tires and fuel and handed the lead
to Ray. Dismore made his final stop on Lap 161, allowing Brack to
recycle his way into second behind Ray. The Texan was working on a
1.333-second lead on Lap 182 when Brack's car, owned by four-time
Indy 500 champion A.J. Foyt of Houston, slowed dramatically down
the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over for us,'' Foyt said as his crew hustled to
replace a broken right rear wheel bearing. ``Hopefully, we can
salvage a second in the points.''
</P>
<P>
   With both his championship contenders disabled, Ray turned his
attention to a front nose section damaged by debris from Schmidt's
crash. Ray pitted for tires and fuel and the reassurance from
Menard that the flapping carbon fiber would hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Ray went down a lap during that stop, allowing Dismore and
Hamilton to move past him. Ray's fourth victory of the season was
not going to happen here. But his championship celebration was
about to begin. The title also was the second in three seasons for
Team Menard, which won with driver Tony Stewart in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that point in his IRL career, Ray and underfunded team-owner
Thomas Knapp were wondering if they ever would get the chance to
run with the IRL's big boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a part of this team and win a championship here at my
home track is a dream come true,'' said Ray, who signed on as
driver of the No. 2 Glidden-Menards Dallara/Aurora in October 1998.
``I questioned why we didn't win the championship last year and
also the Indy 500 this year. You just have to be patient and work
hard and give it your all. You have to make sacrifices to reach a
goal.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge basketball teams, both of
which have realistic goals of winning the Big Sky Conference this
season, officially started fall practice on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The men worked for three hours, then gave the court to the
women, who are the defending conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a more exciting day than the first day of practice,'' said
men's head coach Bobby Braswell, who enters his fourth season with
a team picked to finish second or third in the Big Sky in most
preseason publications.
</P>
<P>
   Frozena Jerro, who took the Matadors women to the NCAA playoffs
as the interim head coach in March, said it was easy to see the
difference between last year's opening day and this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have eight veterans that went to the NCAA Tournament,'' she
said. ``They made it, I wouldn't say easier, but smoother. It was a
good day. I was anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell emphasized defense through most of his practice. Even
though the Matadors return four starters, more than any team in the
conference, CSUN got bounced from the Big Sky Tournament by Montana
State in a 91-90 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be one of the best defensive teams in the
country,'' Braswell said. ``In the past, our guys have had the
mentality, `If we don't stop them, we can still score.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who were 17-12 last year and 9-8 in the Big Sky,
recruited three quality guards: Lionel Benjamin, Craig Calloway and
Marco McCain. Calloway, a freshman, and McCain, a junior, were
teammates at Jordan High in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro spent most of the first practice on offensive drills. CSUN
(21-8 last season, including 13-3 in Big Sky) had the conference's
best offense last year, but Jerro wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is going to be our mainstay,'' Jerro said.
``Eventually, it's going to be an issue for us, being able to
execute offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the rise: Despite a recent slump that includes a
disappointing 3-2 loss at Pepperdine, the women's soccer team is on
pace to set a school record for victories. The Matadors haven't
finished above .500 in their five-year history, and they've gone
8-29 the last two seasons. Sophomore forward Erin Broadwell (La
Canada High) has eight goals, setting a single-season school
record.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a hit: CSUN athletics' home page, www.gomatadors.com, is
getting more hits than usual when the radio broadcast of a football
road game is accessible on the site.The home page averages 350 hits
on those days, and the normal rate is 220 per day.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rare opportunity: Tickets are available for the men's
basketball ``tipoff banquet'' on Nov. 1. John Wooden, who recently
turned 89, is the guest speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for the 6:30 p.m. banquet, which is in the grand salon
in the student union, is $100 per person, $1,000 to reserve a
nine-person table. Information: Mike Johnson, (818) 677-3994.

HIDDEN BILLS ADD MILLIONS TO BELMONT PRICE TAG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ The Belmont Learning Center _ the nation's most
expensive public high school _ has racked up at least $33.5 million
in encumbrances above the costs previously disclosed by Los Angeles
Unified School District officials.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to invoices and other public documents that school
administrators attempted to keep secret, the district owes the
additional millions to contractors, consultants and investigators
working on the public works fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden bills bring the ``official'' cost of the Belmont
project to $159 million, about twice the district's original
guaranteed maximum price. The school, which is slightly more than
half-completed, sits downtown atop an oil field plagued by
potentially deadly and explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   The final price tag will likely surpass $200 million when
environmental mitigation costs, construction delays and additional
consultant fees are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, district officials had reported the
cost of the complex at $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure comes amid an investigation into the finances of
the environmentally troubled project by LAUSD auditor Don Mullinax
and three weeks after a Los Angeles Daily News investigation
revealed the ``guaranteed maximum price'' of the complex was a
sham.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, has told a
panel of civic leaders weighing the fate of the school that the
district will not receive any state money to offset the exorbitant
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is not going to put one penny into Belmont,''
Villaraigosa told the Belmont Commission last week.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker stopped short of telling the commission to recommend
abandoning the project. Villaraigosa said he believed the public
would support completing construction if costs to mitigate methane
and hydrogen sulfide gases at the site could be held to under $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, however, said he has no faith in the district's
ability to operate a mitigation system and believes an independent
panel would have to be set up to handle that crucial task.
</P>
<P>
   Following Villaraigosa's comments, a district-hired
environmental consultant presented four potential mitigation
systems to the Belmont Commission. The least expensive would cost
the district between $14.1 million and $20.4 million. The price for
the most expensive system with the most safety precautions would be
$35.2 million to $50.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those mitigation costs, however, have been disputed by lawyers
representing O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, the law firm Los Angeles Unified is
suing for malpractice over advice it doled out with regard to
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Mitigation specialists hired by Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher contend
even the most elaborate system, as described by the LAUSD
consultants, would cost $13.7 million, about one-third of the price
quoted to the Belmont Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is scheduled to conclude its 60-day evaluation of
the project Wednesday. The panel will meet three more times,
beginning Monday, to hash out a recommendation for the school
board. All the proceedings will be held in public, with the
exception of a short session Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If the project is scrapped, the district has pledged to expedite
construction of a high school in the neighborhood to relieve
overcrowding. If the school board signs off on finishing Belmont,
the school is expected to open in three to four years with a
mitigation system in place.
</P>
<P>
   After initially refusing to comply with a Daily News public
records request for a list of bills the district owes on Belmont,
school officials backed down last week.
</P>
<P>
   The $33.5 million in encumbered costs is distributed among 21
parties and includes $350,000 approved by the school board for the
Belmont Commission's review.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk, $29.2 million, is owed to the developer, Temple
Beaudry Partners, a consortium led by Kajima Urban Development. The
payment has been approved by the board; however, the district and
developer are in negotiations over how much of the bill will be
paid if the complex isn't completed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $29 million is a reservation of funds for the unexpended
portion of the guaranteed maximum price contract,'' said LAUSD
spokesman Erik Nasarenko.
</P>
<P>
   Amid criticism from the Belmont Commission, investigators and
the press about the district's consistent practice of withholding
public documents and mismarking material as ``confidential'' or
``privileged,'' officials vowed to be more forthcoming in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The district complied with the Daily News' records act request
for the encumbered costs after consulting with Ward Benshoof, a
lead partner from the firm McClintock, Weston, Benshoof, Rochefort,
Rubalcava &AMP; MacCuish.
</P>
<P>
   Benshoof, whose firm has been handling negotiations between the
district and Temple Beaudry Partners, said there should have been
no delay in releasing the information to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing (in the Daily News request) that is anything
other than the district's normal accounting records, which are open
to the public,'' Benshoof said. ``Releasing that information does
not hurt our negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will re-emphasize (to LAUSD bureaucrats) that
confidentiality is important to us and our negotiations with Temple
Beaudry Partners, but it should not be overdrawn,'' he said. `What
should be public is public. What should be confidential is
confidential.''

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S (ONLY) TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.1999 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Chargers, L.A.'s team?
</P>
<P>
   If they're not, who is? See anybody else within 300 miles?
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League is not coming to the Los Angeles
Basin; Houston won the expansion chase, and the league may not add
another franchise in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   No existing team is going to come to L.A., Orange County of the
Inland Empire until a stadium is built, and that's about as likely
as snow at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The only team in all of Southern California, the only NFL
franchise within commuting distance of the Southland ... is right
here at Qualcomm Stadium. The Chargers. The Bolts. Which makes them
ours, too, by default.
</P>
<P>
   At least the timing is felicitous.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers have stunk it up in recent years, when Angelenos
still entertained the fantasy of getting their own team. Stunk it
up to the tune of 8-8, 4-12, 5-11 since 1995, the last year they
made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the Chargers been bad, they've been boring, and
that's a deadly combination in the L.A. market; good thing we
weren't paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers are no longer awful, but they're still tedious. All
defense and special teams, and incomplete passes and 2-yard runs by
Natrone Means. They entered Sunday's game with Seattle with the
NFL's 29th-best offense. In a 31-team league.
</P>
<P>
   But they're winning. Somehow. They defeated the Seahawks 13-10
Sunday on a 41-yard field goal on the last play of the game to
improve to 4-1 and (true story) take the lead in the AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   John Carney's decisive field goal had hardly split the goal
posts when the announcer at Qualcomm intoned, ``We'll see you back
here next week when the first-place San Diego Chargers take on the
Green Bay Packers.''
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff. A Super Bowl preview?
</P>
<P>
   Means, the beefy running back, concedes these Chargers won't be
confused with the Air Coryell team of Dan Fouts, Charlie Joyner and
Kellen Winslow. Or even the Bobby Ross/Stan Humphries team that
reached Super Bowl XXIX.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a great game,'' Means said. ``If I was watching it
at home, maybe I'd be bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll take first place any time.''
</P>
<P>
   These Chargers actually are a team a fan might come to admire.
Yes, they're faceless once you get past linebacker Junior Seau, but
they play with enthusiasm. Their defense keeps them in games. Coach
Mike Riley is a low-key, friendly guy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Chargers can scrape up a couple of touchdowns every week,
they could be playing in January.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem here is the quarterback situation. Ryan Leaf
was supposed to solve that, but you know what happened to him. Can
you say, ``major bust?''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Chargers with a quarterback controversy pitting
career mediocrities Erik Kramer and Jim Harbaugh. Throwing to as
undistinguished a receiver corps as exists in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory was a good example of what the 1999 Chargers
are about. Staying close, hanging around until the offense stumbles
into some points.
</P>
<P>
   Interceptions set up a touchdown for each team, then the
Chargers won it in the final five minutes by forcing Seattle's
seventh and eighth punts and patching together two 45-yard drives
to Carney field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are games that we are going to win that aren't pretty,''
Kramer said. ``But there will be games coming up that are going to
be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. What's most attractive about the Chargers to L.A. fans is
that they play in the NFL. Makes them pretty unique.

Dismore got more than a win at TMS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ In addition to a trophy that was, by rough
guess, the approximate weight of Idaho, driver Mark Dismore finally
got his say Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He hasn't got anything to blame me for,'' Dismore offered.
</P>
<P>
   The ``he'' in question happened to be the same ``he'' who, at
that very moment, was being toasted as the man of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray was crowned the 1999 Indy Racing League
champion Sunday, despite finishing a comfortable third in the
Mall.com 500. The championship comes with a bonus check for $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   But it apparently won't come with anything from Mark Dismore.
</P>
<P>
   With his mind on his ailing father and his right foot pressed,
at long last, on an IRL victory, Dismore rode smartly, patiently to
his first series checkered flag Sunday. On the IRL's longest day,
it seemed fitting that the 75-pound stone trophy went to the driver
who had waited the longest.
</P>
<P>
   Dismore provided the lightning, while Ray stole the thunder.
</P>
<P>
   But after 29 career starts, the second-longest vigil for a first
victory in IRL history, Dismore wasn't about to downplay anything.
</P>
<P>
   In Victory Lane, his tears flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking about things,'' explained Dismore, who
turned 43 last week. ``My dad has cancer, and it's been on my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't need that reason to win a race. I've been ready
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three years on the IRL circuit, Dismore had never
finished higher than third. At the Colorado Indy 200 at Pikes Peak
in August, Dismore had led the field heading into the final 19
laps.
</P>
<P>
   He was passed by Ray, of all people.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Dismore. Dismore and Ray. The two names, like their Indy
cars, kept bumping into one another during this IRL season.
</P>
<P>
   An incident on pit row between the two cars knocked Ray out of
the Indianapolis 500. The two brushed again on lap 105 at Las Vegas
last month, after which Ray disparaged Dismore's driving pedigree
on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got pretty brutal on me in the media, I thought,'' Dismore
said after Sunday's win. ``At Indy he ran up the side of me at a
point where I had been running well, and it just broke my heart and
shut my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Greg to come back and unload on me in Vegas was uncalled
for. I thought it was pretty stupid for him to go where you
couldn't fit a go-kart, let alone an Indy car. I think Greg has to
take some responsibility for that, for where he put his car.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents, both drivers say, are over. Ironically, Ray could
have clinched the IRL season championship a month ago, if the two
cars hadn't bumped in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Greg,'' Dismore said. ``I think he respects me. We get
along fine. It's all behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Dismore gave a spirited description of the two incidents
and the fallout that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't got anything to blame me for,'' he repeated. ``In
fairness, he did apologize. But he hasn't gone out of his way to
make that very public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in calling people names or saying stupid
things. You've got to think about things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismore and Ray. Ray and Dismore.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the same Sunday as, say, Foyt-vs.-Luyendyk, 1997, but
it added a touch of spice to a day when two drivers were named
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Dismore admits he is emotional and driven. Team owner Tom Kelley
of Kelley Racing calls Dismore and teammate Scott Sharp,
``caffeinated and decaffeinated,'' respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, Dismore had the patience to work his way back
from serious injuries suffered in 1991 at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubted myself after that accident,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Dan Gurney said the next spring that he would give
Dismore a chance if he was healthy enough to drive at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down there to talk to him on crutches, but I left the
crutches in the car,'' Dismore said. ``I got in the car and cried.
I had this burning desire to drive that car as fast as I could
drive it.''
</P>
<P>
   His career started over that year. And Sunday, thinking about
his dad, Emerson, who is fighting prostate cancer, Dismore cried
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty emotional, I guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the IRL's longest day, he had been the one who got the
checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't going to apologize for anything. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  SAN DIEGO _ Junior Seau isn't claiming the San Diego Chargers
are world-beaters just yet. But he likes where they're at after
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``First place,'' the veteran linebacker said Sunday. ``I can't
emphasize how big that is. We haven't won anything yet, but we're
setting ourselves up for some big games down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   John Carney kicked a 41-yard field goal as time expired to give
San Diego a 13-10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday
before 59,432 at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-1, the Chargers are alone atop the AFC West standings, a
game ahead of Seattle and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a special team,'' said Mike Riley, the Chagers'
first-year coach. ``We've got some high standards here set by
people like Junior. It's very early, but I wouldn't trade places
with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers survived four interceptions of quarterback Erik
Kramer by blunting the Seattle offense; the Seahawks managed only
201 yards, 54 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer came through with some key completions in the final five
minutes, when the Chargers twice drove 45 yards to set up Carney
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Erik Kramer a lot of credit, because a less tough guy
could've folded,'' said Riley, who conceded he thought of benching
his quarterback. ``He just stayed with it and made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest was a 41-yard pass to Jeff Graham to set up
the tying field goal. Moments later, Kramer completed four
consecutive passes before the decisive field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, an 11-year veteran out of North Carolina State, said age
and experience allowed him to avoid mental meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I wouldn't have had the patience to
overcome'' the four interceptions, he said.

DEVELOPER PROPOSES USING BELMONT SITE FOR $3.6 BILLION PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GRET GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ The Los Angeles Unified School District could be
saved by an angel _ but it needs to have a little faith.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly three months ago, the district received a confidential
proposal from the developer of a curious angelic monument to buy
the tainted Belmont Learning Center property downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The school board dismissed the idea in private without taking a
vote and has not notified an advisory commission weighing the fate
of the public works fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   But the developer says the offer still stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angel City project is expanding, and I'm extremely
interested in the Belmont Center if it can't be completed as a
school,'' said developer Brett-Livingstone Strong, an
Australian-born sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am indeed interested in acquiring it for use as park land,
which my project needs,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont, the nation's costliest high school, sits atop an oil
field plagued by potentially deadly and explosive gases. State
toxics officials are investigating whether the half-completed
complex can ever be used safely as a school.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by funding from the Bank of New York and CNB Capital,
Strong has been snatching up land all around the stalled high
school to build a tower topped by a bronze, sword-wielding angel.
The Gothic celestial figure would be about twice the size of the
Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   While skeptics smirk at the idea, Strong has financing in place
to purchase more than 80 acres for the tower, park land, art
galleries, restaurants, hotels and a museum for the city's
entertainment industries.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 12 letter to school officials, Strong's lawyer
detailed the financial backing behind the $3.6 billion Angel City
project and offered to buy the Belmont site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Strong wishes to acquire the site of the Belmont Learning
Center so that the site may be used primarily for park and open
space in conjunction with the Angel City project,'' wrote attorney
Timothy Lappen from the law firm of Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &AMP;
Marmaro.
</P>
<P>
   `EVERYONE JUST LAUGHED'
</P>
<P>
   Key players in the preliminary negotiations said that board
member Julie Korenstein presented the proposal to her colleagues in
August but couldn't get them to seriously consider the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korenstein was verbally beaten up for even suggesting the
board talk to the guy,'' said a school official who asked not to be
named. ``Everyone just laughed at her.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Korenstein said she was stunned that
the board had no interest in investigating the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the board to consider every option, including selling
the property if it couldn't be used as a school or administrative
offices because of the environmental problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were and still are at a very critical point in the
decision-making process. It was a very logical proposal. I wouldn't
want it to go away without serious discussion. That would be an
enormous mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Fields was the only other board member who responded to
questions for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Fields said she hasn't seen a proposal from the developer.
``There is nothing in writing that I've seen that indicates there
is a serious interest to buy the land,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the confidential letter from Angel City to Chief
Administrative Officer David Koch explicitly offers to buy the
Belmont site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Strong requests that the district obtain the necessary
consents to sell the Belmont site to him with an escrow period of
nine months, during which time Mr. Strong would complete all due
diligence,'' Lappen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that the district is not yet in a position to
discuss the possible price of the site but will be able to do so
once the appropriate parties have reviewed the letter. We welcome
that discussion when the district is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Erik Nasarenko, a spokesman for the district's
facilities division, said Koch and other LAUSD administrators only
had one meeting with representatives from Angel City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exploratory and informal in nature,'' Nasarenko said.
``Until the Board of Education determines the disposition of the
site, any consideration of alternative proposals is premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong, however, said his offer came after several meetings
between school officials and his advisers. Strong added he
personally spoke with LAUSD Superintendent Ruben Zacarias on one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I've heard from the school district since
August,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, others have been taking him seriously. Angel
City has approximately $180 million of property adjacent to Belmont
under contract, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The developer also has received letters of support from Mayor
Richard Riordan and the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   KEPT IN THE DARK
</P>
<P>
   A panel of civic leaders appointed by the school board is
scheduled to conclude its 60-day review of the Belmont debacle
Wednesday. Led by former District Attorney Ira Reiner, the Belmont
Commission will advise the school board to either complete or
abandon the construction project.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission was asked to weigh the environmental, legal
and financial ramifications of completing or abandoning the
complex, it has not been notified that Strong wants to buy Belmont,
Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong said he'd be willing to speak to the commissioners this
week before they hand over a recommendation to the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at L.A. and compare it with other cities around the
world _ Sydney, Tokyo, Chicago and New York,'' Strong said. ``All
those cities have beautiful large parks downtown. L.A. doesn't have
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the person who stops a much-needed school
for the neighborhood. But if they can't go forward, I want to buy
the property. Here's a chance for Los Angeles to have many acres of
park land right downtown. It would be spectacular.''

CHASEN'S AUCTIONS OFF ITS HOLLYWOOD HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 BC- -LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   West Hollywood _ &UR;  &LR; About 300 people paid $300 each for the
opportunity to scoop up a piece of history at Sunday's
everything-must-go auction at the historic Chasen's restaurant in
West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers, some motivated by personal nostalgia and others by
collector's savvy, paid from $10 to thousands for furniture,
photos, and dinnerware at the restaurant that served as a haunt for
movie stars for decades before closing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Collector Dennis Vacca, who owns Authentic Autographs and
Photos, called the auction ``one of the most important of the
year'' for his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to walk out of here today with as many of these
priceless things as I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were at the auction to pick up items out of pure
nostalgia, including former 20th Century Fox President Harris
Katleman, who said some of the photos had sentimental value for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Out of dozens of photos and letters framed in the historic
restaurant, some fared better than others at the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-by-17-inch autographed photo of Clark Gable drew $825,
while others went for as low as $10.
</P>
<P>
   Other items for sale included the favorite booths of such actors
as Jimmy Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Jack Nicholson, Alfred
Hitchcock, Anthony Quinn and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ronald Reagan booth, which was set aside for his
presidential library in Simi Valley, the former president and film
actor reportedly proposed to his wife Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was a hot spot since 1936, when vaudeville comic
Dave Chasen opened a chili stand on Beverly Boulevard at the corner
of Doheny Drive. When Chasen died, his wife, Maude, kept the
restaurant going until its closure.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition of the restaurant will start next month, but part of
the restaurant will be preserved within the Bristol Farms market
going up in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Esbrant, a longtime waiter at the restaurant took one last
look around Sunday during the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see the place close,'' he said, recalling the times
he served Jimmy Stewart, Jack Nicholson and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   The place was so popular, he said, there was even a documentary
made during the three months before it closed in 1995 called ``Off
the Menu: the Final Days of Chasen's.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE METS TEND TO WIN THESE CLASSIC GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the 10th inning, Mookie Wilson started having
flashbacks, that strange feeling that sometime in another life he
had witnessed a wild game like this.
</P>
<P>
   It is not very often that one classic ball game induces memories
of another classic ball game, but Mookie was onto something, and he
was not about to give up his train of thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were different, but they were the same,'' the Mets' first
base coach, a hero of an October 13 years ago, would decide later,
in the delirium of the Mets' 4-3 victory in 15 innings that
prolonged the National League Championship Series by at least
another game.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator was that the Mets won. They also won on
Oct. 15, 1986, when they beat Houston, 8-7, to avoid an encounter
with their nemesis, Mike Scott, in a seventh game that never
happened. And they won on Sunday, to send the series back to
Atlanta and all those yawning seats. The seats were not empty in
Shea Stadium on Sunday. With all of New York holding on to their
Metrocards in anticipation of a Subway Series, the Mets fought for
their lives in a persistent drizzle. They held off disaster time
and again, but then again, this has been their style over this
exciting but turbulent season.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Mets limped into extra innings in a 2-2 tie.
Their catcher, Mike Piazza, and their third baseman, Robin Ventura,
were walking wounded. But Mookie had his memory of 1986, when the
Mets scored three times in the ninth inning just to get into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody mentioned it on the bench,'' he said, but most of the
Mets are too young to have any framework for the cumulative
mystique that now sends the Mets soaring to Atlanta on their own
personal tail wind.
</P>
<P>
   He has been there. In the Astrodome in 1986, he and Lenny
Dykstra wound up playing the outfield at the same time as the Mets
scored in the 14th and the Astros scored in the 14th, and the Mets
scored three in the 16th and the Astros scored two before Jesse
Orosco (under a death threat by Keith Hernandez to throw his best
pitch) finally shut down the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored, we scored, they scored, we scored, they scored,
we scored,'' Mookie recalled. ``This game had more pitching.
Different but the same.''
</P>
<P>
   He is too gracious to inject his own unforgettable at-bat in the
sixth game of the 1986 World Series when he managed to levitate
above a wild pitch as one run scored, and then tapped the grounder
through Bill Buckner's gnarled ankles that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is no connection from one decade to another, but
there is a gathering fascination to the way the Mets have endured
the intrigues and psychodramas of the Bobby Valentine regime and
came back from a seven-game slump in the final two weeks of the
season. Valentine added to his own troubles by volunteering the
observation that if the Mets did not get into the playoffs that he
``probably should not be back.'' It has been ``Perils of Pauline''
all along.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was more of the same. With the season getting away,
Valentine called in Orel Hershiser, who 11 years ago terrorized the
Mets in the 1988 league series. His manager at the time, Tommy
Lasorda, loved to introduce Hershiser to the press as the Bulldog,
because of Hershiser's 1950s hall-monitor smile that belied the
existence of an inner bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, now 41, had a bulldog moment in the sixth when he had
to guard the plate as Ryan Klesko steamed home in a rundown. The
willowy senior citizen caught the toss from Ventura as Klesko came
in standing up, throwing an elbow sideways, not dirty, but hard.
Hershiser planted the ball in his glove, braced both hands
together, and made the tag. The Bulldog held on. The Mets went on.
Something was happening on this damp day in Flushing. Mookie had
seen things like this 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So did the fanatics who stayed for all of this long, wet
evening. Many of them had witnessed the 1969 miracle and the 1986
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Shawon Dunston about that. He's from Brooklyn, and he
understands the psyche of the Shea Stadium crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston had not been able to catch a triple by Keith Lockhart
that put the Braves ahead in the top of the 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came running in after the inning, the fans were
screaming positive things,'' Dunston said. ``It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunston promptly produced one of the great at-bats since Mookie
stood in against Bob Stanley in the desperate moments of 1986.
Dunston worked Kevin McGlinchy until he could slap a single up the
middle. Then he stole second, setting in motion the bases-loaded
walk to Todd Pratt and the wallop over the wall by the hobbling
Ventura that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets mobbed Ventura between first and second, so he lost a
grand slam and three runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had enough,'' Ventura would decide.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have not had enough. They now go to Atlanta for a sixth
game. Mookie has seen a couple of them in his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing like this for two weeks,'' Mookie said in
the frantic clubhouse. ``This is what we've been doing. I see no
reason why it can't continue.''

Red Sox's blunder aids Yankees 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
BOSTON _ It might be February before Boston's Bret Saberhagen
covers first base again, and it will be a winter of torment for the
35-year-old pitcher should the Red Sox lose this American League
Championship Series. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saberhagen and Mike Stanley butchered one of baseball's
fundamental plays involving the pitcher and first baseman on a
ground ball hit to the right side of the infield, and the New York
Yankees escaped Fenway Park with a 9-2 victory during Game 4 of
this best-of-seven series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outcome leaves the Yankees one victory shy of their 36th
World Series appearance and the Red Sox on the brink of elimination
after unraveling defensively during the fourth and ninth innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Controversial calls during the final two innings by second-base
umpire Tim Tschida and first-base umpire Dale Scott _ both of which
went against the Red Sox _ sent spectators at Fenway Park into an
uproar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spectators littered the field with objects thrown from the
stands after Scott ejected Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, who
argued that shortstop Nomar Garciaparra reached safely on a
ninth-inning ground ball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inexcusable,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said of
the spectators' actions. ``To have people throw stuff on the field,
that's disgraceful. I know it's not an indication of Boston,
Massachusetts. Tonight was a bad mark against a very good team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Rick Reed stopped play at 11:16 p.m. ET and removed
both teams from the field. The hooliganism forced an eight-minute
delay before play resumed, and Yankees closer Mariano Rivera
recorded the final two outs to put an end to an ugly sight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his players refused to attend the postgame media
conference, and the Red Sox manager issued only a one-sentence
statement that read: ``It's the first one to win four, and it's not
over yet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tschida blew a call with the Red Sox trailing, 3-2, with one out
during the eighth inning, but Boston's Jose Offerman reached on a
one-out single. Red Sox third baseman John Valentin then hit a
ground ball to Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who
attempted to tag Offerman between first and second before throwing
to first to complete a double play. Replays, though, revealed that
Knoblauch never tagged Offerman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the best position I could on that play,'' Tschida said.
``It's very difficult to get the angle you want without getting in
the way of the play.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tschida's position forced him to ``look through the runner'' and
make his call based on the players' reactions, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to me that he got him,'' Tschida said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tschida saw a replay afterward, though, and said, ``No, I didn't
make the right call.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a 2-1 lead into the fourth inning on the strength of
a run-scoring, third-inning single by second baseman Offerman, but
it would be the only advantage the Red Sox experienced before
imploding in the field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams reached safely on a
one-out infield single and advanced to second on the throwing error
by shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez delivered a game-tying double on the
next at-bat and scored what proved to be the winning run minutes
later. Saberhagen issued an intentional walk to the
left-handed-hitting Darryl Strawberry with first base open before
retiring third baseman Scott Brosius on strikes for the inning's
second out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen then induced what appeared to be an inning-ending
ground ball from left fielder Chad Curtis. Stanley fielded the ball
cleanly, but Saberhagen could not handle the first baseman's
knee-high throw at first. Martinez scored from second on the play
with the second of two unearned runs during the inning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees erupted again during the ninth after Offerman failed
to start what appeared to be an inning-ending, double-play ground
ball. The Yankees took advantage of Offerman's throwing error and
parlayed it into a six-run inning. Pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee
finished the carnage with his one-out grand slam off right-hander
Rod Beck. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Giants are glad they won't see
Dallas receiver Michael Irvin tonight. But they probably would be
more pleased if running back Emmitt Smith were out of the lineup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By all indications, Smith will have a big night when the Giants
and Cowboys meet on Monday Night Football. That Irvin is out
indefinitely with a spine injury only makes Smith's job that much
more important. And he thrives under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants learned that last year. Smith carried the ball 29
times for 163 yards the last time the teams met. It was Smith's
best rushing performance in his last 60 regular-season games,
leading the Cowboys to a 16-6 victory at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still good,'' Giants defensive end Michael Strahan
said. ``They're better with Michael Irvin, don't get me wrong. But
without him, they are still a good offense. The key is stopping the
running game, and with Dallas that means Emmitt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something teams have been unable to do this season. The
Cowboys (3-1) have the NFC's No. 1 ground attack, thanks to Smith's
three 100-yard performances in the Cowboys' four games. Smith needs
only 25 yards to rush for 13,000 in his career. Barring injury, he
should hit that milestone in the first half tonight, becoming only
the fourth NFL player to reach that mark.
</P>
<P>
   Of Smith's 12,975 rushing yards, 1,541 have come against the
Giants, including seven 100-yard games. Not surprisingly, the
Giants (2-3) will try to stop the run first, then take their
chances with quarterback Troy Aikman's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not one-dimensional,'' safety Percy Ellsworth said.
``We can hold Emmitt to 60-some-odd yards and still lose because
Troy can throw for 300. But we have to at least get them to the
point where we know they will pass and then see how we match up.
We're a solid group in the secondary, so if we can stop the run and
force them to pass, we should have some success.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly without Irvin. The Cowboys are confident Ernie
Mills, Wane McGarity and Jeff Ogden can fill in adequately during
Irvin's absence. But clearly, a Rocket Ismail-Mills tandem doesn't
instill in defenses the same respect Ismail-Irvin brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in the guys that are going to be in there,''
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``But at the same time, any time
you lose a player of Michael's stature you lose something off your
football team. It will have an impact. How much of an impact
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important will be how the Dallas defense fares against
the woeful New York offense. The Cowboys have surrendered only
three touchdowns in their last 13 quarters (plus overtime of the
Washington game) and have allowed only one touchdown per game in
their last three contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have scored only six offensive touchdowns in five
games. Their biggest problem has come on third down, where they
rank 29th after converting only 18 of 70 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has kept the Giants in games, only to end up losing
because the offense can't find the end zone. It has been enough to
reportedly cause problems between the offensive and defensive
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said. ``I don't
coach the offense, so I don't know what the solution is. I know
something has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The stats say it won't happen tonight. The Cowboys have
dominated the series, 46 wins to the Giants' 25 (with two ties).
The Cowboys are 6-0 against the Giants on Monday Night Football. &QL;

FOR THE BRAVES, A TOUGH ONE TO LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the cramped visitors' locker room, the Atlanta
Braves players tried to dress quickly, grabbing their clothes from
lockers that had tatters of plastic still stapled to the wood. The
sheets of plastic that were there to protect their clothes from the
anticipated champagne bath had been torn down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the corner of the room, sadly recounting his part in
the abrupt cancellation of the celebration, was the 22-year-old
rookie pitcher Kevin McGlinchy, still in his uniform which was wet
from the rain and sweat, not champagne. McGlinchy had moved from
anonymity to a place in baseball lore by surrendering the decisive
runs in the Braves' 4-3 loss to the Mets in 15 innings at Shea
Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He had made it off the field as the Mets celebrated so madly
that Robin Ventura could not make it around the bases, turning the
game-winning grand slam into a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy was oblivious to the players rushing onto the field,
the fans shouting louder than the jets flying over the stadium and
the now-familiar strains of the Doors song ``L.A. Woman,'' with its
ominous chant of ``Mojo rising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't hit me until I came in here and it's probably
one of the worst feelings I've ever felt,'' McGlinchy said softly.
``This is a game, but this is my livelihood. This is my job and if
you don't do your job, then you don't feel good. If you do, you
feel good. We could easily be celebrating in here, but we ain't.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have spent a decade at the top of the National
League, battling for a World Series berth every season with superb
pitching and lineups filled with fearsome bats like Chipper Jones,
Andruw Jones and Andres Galarraga. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the 15th inning, the game was left in the hands of the
22-year-old rookie who had not appeared in the series and had
thrown just one-third of an inning in the divisional series.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy dug himself a nervous hole, struggling with his
control until he had to come over the plate, and he paid dearly for
it. After he worked his way through the 14th inning, the Braves
staked him to a 3-2 lead in the top of the 15th and were just three
outs away from heading back to the World Series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But after Shawon Dunston battled his way through an epic at-bat,
eventually singling and then stealing second, Matt Franco drew a
pinch-hit base on balls. A perfect sacrifice bunt by Edgardo
Alfonzo sent the tying run to third and the winning run to second,
so Manager Bobby Cox elected to have McGlinchy intentionally walk
John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy could not find the plate now, walking Todd Pratt to
tie the game. Then, when he grooved a fastball to Ventura, the
veteran slammed it over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted the ball out there,'' said McGlinchy, who was
7-3 in 64 games as a reliever this season after jumping from Class
AA ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make great pitches,'' he said. ``It was on the
line and everybody wants the ball when the game is on the line. I
wanted to get guys out and come in here and celebrate. But
unfortunately, things didn't turn out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crazy game tonight. At some point in time, there's
got to be an end to it. I hate to be the guy to have to walk off
the field and lose this game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Braves leave this season's ace, Kevin Millwood, in
the bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   Cox said: ``We could have done a lot of things differently, but
I didn't want to do it. Just the weather and the one-run lead, it
wasn't worth bringing in Millwood and moving the rotation around.
I'd rather be given the opportunity of being on our own field with
a good mound.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a hard loss and lesson for a young player to
absorb, and McGlinchy tried to use the kind words of the more
experienced pitchers to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGlinchy was the best man to be out there tonight, without
question,'' said Greg Maddux, who had started this 5 hour and 46
minute game. ``You don't want to use your Game 6 pitcher. Had we
been in their shoes, yes, you would have seen our starters out
there. We've got tomorrow and the next day. It's not do or die for
us. That's why I don't think you use those pitchers there. You
stick with McGlinchy. He's thrown great for us all year and there
was no reason to not have confidence in him going out there. We all
did. It just didn't work out for us.'' &QL;

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ORLANDO, Fla. _ Little was working. Free throws had become an
adventure. The Magic was scoring as if the Rockets weren't there,
which made sense because for most of the night they weren't.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it is the preseason, time to work on things, experiment,
prepare. So with little to lose with the Magic on its way to a
114-105 win Sunday, the Rockets tried something that had not come
up almost all night. They dusted off one of the old standbys. They
gave the ball to Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon hardly changed the game with a few fourth-quarter
touches. And he was not forgotten to that point. But he had been
de-emphasized to a non-factor, outscored by Orlando's Michael
Doleac, a condition he understood in the preseason but expected to
be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we said we were going to run, that doesn't mean you
neglect the post,'' Olajuwon said. ``Most of the game, the guy
guarding me was just relaxing. I was not a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was not concerned. He laughed when he talked about
Doleac relaxing on the defensive end. He described finding his
place in the evolving offense as a process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a time when I need to get more touches,'' he
said. ``But it's too early to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday at Orlando Arena, he struggled to find his touch when
so rarely getting his hands on the ball. Olajuwon made just two of
eight attempts for eight points. When he went to the line for the
first time in the fourth quarter, he missed both. But with eight
points, he had his most prolific game of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   When he grabbed an offensive rebound and nailed a jump hook,
though, he inspired Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich to go to
Olajuwon in the post four times in the next three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get him going,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He had just
gotten the jump hook on the offensive rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon was fouled on each subsequent touch in the low post.
But he became more active and involved in every part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we rebound and run in the flow, we'll get a running
game,'' Olajuwon said. ``But in basketball, you have to use the
post as an advantage. The coach is now trying to get everybody
adjusted to the system. In time, he'll want me to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were other opportunities for Olajuwon to become
involved. If they were not obvious when the Rockets had the ball,
the Magic offered a clear picture from the outset. Running a
pick-and-roll similar to the one the Rockets tried, the Magic found
Doleac outside, dropping back after setting a pick.
</P>
<P>
   Doleac made 10 of 15 shots for 21 points in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy, you have to give him a lot of credit,'' Olajuwon
said. ``I ran out on him, and he made some big shots. I can do
that, but we have a lot of face-up guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets' outside guys continued to be plagued by
turnover problems, committing 25 for the third consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five's our magic number,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We're
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they got their scoring from Steve Francis, who made
eight of 11 shots for 27 points. Carlos Rogers had 20 points in 20
minutes, and Kelvin Cato, starting at forward in Charles Barkley's
absence, had 15.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets also knew their offense would not be in gear
until it includes Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that happens, it will be hard to stop us,'' Francis said.
``They are triple-teaming every game. It's hard for him to get
shots when people are running three or four guys at him. But once
the outside guys get respect, Dream will get his shots and his
points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also must adjust to rules changes. With a zone
allowed on the strong side, they often went away from Olajuwon when
faced with a legal zone in front of him. Walt Williams said they
will be able to defeat that defense but that officials must improve
at calling the zones that are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a definite process to try to get a feel for each other,''
Williams said. ``Whenever he touches the ball, he's a threat. We
just have to get our spacing down. Today, we were all clumping
together. And the officials also have to adjust. They (the Magic
defenders) were illegal a lot. But it's a process for everyone.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ The Braves and the Mets are no strangers to games such
as these, and both had a track record for winning them.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   But something had to give, and ultimately it would be both kids.
The Mets' star of tomorrow, Octavio Dotel, who found himself on the
spot Sunday, blinked first. Then Atlanta's alleged next great arm,
Kevin McGlinchy, blinked worse.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel, 23, surrendered the would-be losing run in the top of the
15th inning of the longest postseason game _ 5 hours, 46 minutes _
in baseball's very long history. But McGlinchy, 22, subsequently
walked home the tying run in the bottom of the 15th, then
surrendered the longest game-winning single in baseball's very long
history to Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's shot cleared the fence in right field, but because he
never bothered to finish running around the bases with all hell
breaking loose, what he did went into the scorebook as a single.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of game, one that went on and on and on in an
irritating drizzle and one that neither side appeared to want to
win, given what was either one of the greatest playoff pitching
displays on record or the sorriest example of clutch hitting
imaginable. The Mets' 4-3 (7-3) win has been certified a classic,
but that's more for its quantity than its quality.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, the affair was exhausting. Way more exhausting even
than Game 6 of the 1986 NLCS, when the Mets needed 4 hours, 42
minutes to eliminate the Astros in 16 innings 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 of the ALCS in Boston, which started 3{ hours later, was
in the seventh inning by the time Roger Cedeno danced across the
plate to put the Mets on a chartered flight back to Dixie for Game
6 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston, who had walked leading off for the Mets after
fouling off five full-count pitches and clearly flustered young
McGlinchy, must be allowed to share the hero's honors with Ventura,
heretofore a complete bust in the NLCS. After going 0-for-16, he
was Robin as in stealin' the Mets money.
</P>
<P>
   But, likewise, McGlinchy must not be made to stand alone in the
fall-guy department. That old codger in the dugout, the most
experienced postseason manager ever, deserves co-goat honors for
leaving McGlinchy in a situation he wasn't up to handling.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox's only viable defense for not yanking McGlinchy was
Atlanta's obvious sense of urgency. The Braves, who once led the
series 3-0 and still lead it 3-2, have two more second chances. Cox
had not hesitated to pitch his fabled starters in relief, so why
wasn't Kevin Millwood, warming up, called upon to save the day?
</P>
<P>
   Guess Cox was trying to assure his boss, Ted Turner, of an extra
home gate.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the Braves' history of blowing up this time of
year, Cox would have been better served to drive a stake through
the Mets' huge hearts right here and right now. If anybody can
become the first club in baseball's very long history to cough up a
3-0 lead, you suspect it might be the Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's beleaguered counterpart, the ever-popular Bobby Valentine,
called New York's victory, and particularly Ventura's surprising
role in same, ``poetic justice,'' although he probably had no idea
how accurate an assessment that was.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Cox won the 12-inning Division Series Game 3 beauty
against the Astros, an instant classic in its own right? Sure you
do. The Astros had the bases loaded in the 10th with one out and
Tony Eusebio at bat. Cox inexplicably pulled in his middle infield
instead of playing for the inning-ending double play, which put
Walt Weiss in the right spot to snare a shot and get the forceout
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, then, deserved exactly what he got from the Amazins, whose
season has had several ``endings'' wiped from its script. When a
Todd Pratt keeps coming up big, you suspect a higher force at work.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a journeyman catcher who has been in organized ball for
15 years with just 610 major-league at-bats to show for his
patience, beat Arizona in extra innings with a home run. This
night, it was his walk that forced in Dunston and set the stage for
Ventura to finally _ well, awrighty then _ act like an ace.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the Braves, though, you can argue that it should not
have come down to a boy-wonder pitcher being in the wrong place at
the wrong time. From Brian Jordan's tying RBI single in the fourth,
which scored Chipper Jones after he had doubled in Bret Boone _
through Keith Lockhart's triple in the 15th that plated Weiss,
Atlanta went an embarrassing 0-for-14 with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would leave 19 stranded. They would botch decent to
excellent chances to break the stubborn deadlock in the sixth,
seventh, eighth, 10th, 11th and 13th innings.
</P>
<P>
   But of course. They are the Braves, and, yes, it is October.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR A HURTING PIAZZA, WINNING'S THE ONLY THING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was well into the evening after the longest game
in post-season history, and Mike Piazza was the last Met to come
out of training room and join the interviews. Shawon Dunston had a
cluster on the other side talking about his great at-bat in the
15th inning. Robin Ventura, who like Piazza had had a woeful series
until the 15th, was now mobbed by cameras and talking about his
miraculous game-winning run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Piazza emerged. The Mets' battered catcher, in a span of
48 hours, had been bowled over, run over, hit on a backswing by two
different batters on the same spot on two different days. He came
to his stall not quite oblivious to the swirl of excitement in the
Mets clubhouse but with arms, legs and torso ensconced in a world
of pain that seems peculiar to catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for me are my hands,'' he said. ``When I'm
constantly getting injuries to fingers wrists and forearms, it
comes to a point when you hit the throttle and there's nothing
there. But the bottom line is to do anything I can to help this
ball club win. We're finding ways to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all beat up, not just me. There's a lot of guys who are
sore, but we go out and give it all we have. Guys have 90 percent
and they're giving 100 percent. We keep pushing the dirt off us;
everyone's trying to put us under.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said he had jokingly told the trainer to ``give me some
heart tablets'' for the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th inning, Piazza said he was praying. ``That's what
it's come to,'' he said. ``You should pray all the time, but now
it's like, do You have a win up there for us?''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night there was a miracle, though Piazza was on the
fringes of it. Piazza was forced to leave Game 5 in the 14th inning
with a strained left forearm. He was injured on a play at the plate
in the 13th inning, when he tagged out the 170-pound Keith Lockhart
trying to score from first on a double by Chipper Jones. Piazza
applied the tag but paid the price when Lockhart collided with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chipper hit the ball hard _ Larry, Chipper, not sure what to
call him,'' Piazza said. ``When I saw that third base coach waving
him in, I knew he was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in the game for the bottom half of the inning, when he
struck out against John Rocker, and then left the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the last swing and I just told Bobby I couldn't go,''
Piazza said, referring to his manager, Bobby Valentine. ``There
comes a line that you cross where your heart wants to go out there,
but you might be a detriment to the team if you do. We have so many
capable guys coming off the bench and doing the job, and everybody
feels a part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The forearm was the latest. Piazza missed the last two games of
the division series against Arizona with a sprained and swollen
left thumb. In Game 3 of the current series on Friday, Piazza
sustained a mild concussion in a collision when he tagged out Bret
Boone bearing down on home plate attempting to score.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, whose dressing stall is next to Piazza's, has watched
in amazement at the punishment the 31-year-old catcher has taken.
``There's some little part of you that feels sorry for the guy,''
he said. ``He gets banged up every game. He's not a guy who takes
days off during the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone brought up Piazza's $91 million package the Mets
rewarded him with during the off season. ``I don't feel that sorry
for him,'' Leiter said, smiling. ``He's still doing all right and
he's got a pretty good living.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have a pretty good living, too. Living for another game
in Georgia, with their tank of a catcher, Piazza, emboldened for
more. ``No matter what happens from here on out it's a great
feeling knowing we were down 3-0 and now we have a chance to tie
the series,'' Piazza said. ``Those guys have been through the wars
before, but now maybe there's a little bit of pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue for another day is how long the Mets can afford
to keep Piazza behind the plate, taking the pounding, the abuse,
the wear and tear that eventually might diminish the offensive
capacity that made the Mets pay so many millions for his services.
For the next week, at least, that's irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're pulling out all the stops,'' Piazza said.
``We're just flying by the seats of out pants, and it doesn't
matter whose doing it just so long that someone's doing it.''

`JEOPARDY' SCORES TKO IN THEATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ Moviegoers chose revenge over romance and mayhem as
``Double Jeopardy'' edged ``The Story of Us'' and ``Fight Club''
for the nation's top box office spot with an estimated $10.5
million at 2,936 theaters during a moderate Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, any of the trio could wind up on top today when final
weekend totals are tabulated. In one of the closest races in
several years, ``The Story of Us'' performed as expected with $10.4
million at 2,136 theaters in its opening weekend while the
much-discussed debut of violence-laden ``Fight Club'' finished well
under forecasts with $10.3 million at 1,936 sites.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Double Jeopardy'' wins, it will mark its fourth consecutive
victory _ a feat achieved only by ``The Matrix'' and ``The Sixth
Sense'' this year. Paramount's Ashley Judd thriller lost only 22
percent from the previous weekend and has grossed an impressive
$80.6 million in 24 days.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing strength of ``Double Jeopardy'' may have hampered
Universal's ``The Story of Us,'' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle
Pfeiffer as a couple in a disintegrating marriage, and 20th Century
Fox's ``Fight Club,'' with Brad Pitt as a psychotic mastermind
provoking brawls and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The new entries drew mixed reviews, and a number of critics
bashed Fox and director David Fincher over what they perceived as
the gratuitous use of violence in ``Fight Club,'' which had been
delayed from a mid-summer release following last spring's shootings
at Columbine High School that left 15 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``Fight Club'' performed poorly outside major cities. ``No one
in Middle America wanted to see this movie,'' he added, noting that
media coverage of the film's violence, the relatively long running
time and competition from Major League Baseball playoffs probably
held down business.
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell said he was surprised that
``Fight Club'' had not generated better numbers. ``It could be that
there's too much violence in it and that the female audience was so
turned off by it that they absolutely refused to see it,'' he
added. ``Anything that's this overdone tends to have these sorts of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' easily topped all movies on Friday with $3.8
million but ran into serious trouble Saturday when its total rose
just 10 percent to $4.2 million in an indication that the first
wave of customers were not issuing positive recommendations to
friends. By comparison, ``The Story of Us'' rose 37 percent on
Saturday and ``Double Jeopardy'' gained 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Rocco, Universal's distribution chief, said ``The Story of
Us'' drew audiences that were older than average with more females
than males and an interest in seeing Willis and Pfeiffer. Bucksbaum
noted that the drama-comedy is the fourth among current movies
portraying marriages in trouble, including ``American Beauty,''
``Random Hearts'' and ``Double Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So much for Ozzie and Harriet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Three Kings'' led the rest of
the pack with $7.3 million at 2,942 theaters to pass $43 million,
beating DreamWorks' fifth weekend of ``American Beauty'' with a
solid $6.8 million at 1,350 theaters for a $5,035 per-theater
average. ``Beauty,'' which has posted the highest per-theater
figure among major releases since it came out a month ago, has now
drawn over $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``Random Hearts'' skidded from second
to sixth with $5.8 million at 2,697 theaters as the Harrison Ford
vehicle left a wake of disappointed fans with a stunning 55 percent
plunge from its opening weekend. ``Hearts'' barely edged
Paramount's second weekend of ``Superstar'' with $5.7 million at
2,016 locations, which lost 36 percent by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's 11th weekend of ``The Sixth Sense'' finished eighth
with $5.2 million at 2,682, leaving it $100,000 short of becoming
the 15th movie ever to gross one-quarter of a billion dollars
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense'' should become 13th on the all-time list on Tuesday or
Wednesday when it passes ``Men In Black'' at $250.1 million and
``Batman'' at $251.2 million. ``Jaws,'' No. 12 at $260 million, is
likely to be eclipsed by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fifth weekend of ``Blue Streak'' continued to show some
drawing power in ninth with $3.8 million at 2,353 theaters to go
past $60 million overall. Providence, a recently formed
distributor, took 10th with its opening of religious thriller ``The
Omega Code'' with $2.4 million at 305 sites to beat Fox's third
weekend of ``Drive Me Crazy,'' which has a tepid $15 million total
in 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of David Lynch's ``The Straight Story,'' a
much-acclaimed true-life tale of a man's 350-mile journey on a
tractor-mower, generated strong response with $96,000 at seven
theaters. Disney will add 23 theaters next weekend and launch
another expansion Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled about $80 million, down 4 percent from
the same weekend last year. Year-to-date business remains about 7
percent ahead of last year, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a strong market for what audiences perceive as
quality films like `Double Jeopardy,''' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive weekends of only two new movies coming into
the market, next weekend will see half a dozen _ Warner's romantic
comedy ``Three to Tango,'' Universal's wedding comedy ``The Best
Man,'' Paramount's drama ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' New Line's
mystery ``Body Shots,'' Sony's comedy-drama ``Crazy in Alabama''
and start-up Destination's horror project ``Bats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, we were going to get a lot of new movies, so
the market is going to be pretty crowded,'' said Bucksbaum. ``Three
to Tango,'' starring Neve Campbell, has the best prospects of the
newcomers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Final results for the Friday-Sunday period will be released
today.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With his arms wrapped tight at the end of the
Los Angeles Galaxy bench, the frustrated glare on Sigi Schmid's
face was understandable, considering the situation in which his
team found itself.
</P>
<P>
   With the home team up 1-0 early over Colorado, midfielder Simon
Elliot drew his second caution of the game in the 18th minute,
sending him off the pitch and forcing his team to play more than
half the match with a man down.
</P>
<P>
   But as Elliot worked in the weight room to vent his frustration,
the Galaxy outhustled and outplayed Colorado with its best
collective effort of the season, walking away with a 3-0 victory in
front of 16,307 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout extended the Rapid's scoreless streak to 589 minutes
and gave Los Angeles a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three Western
Conference semifinal series. Game 2 is set for Sunday at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot, who watched the rest of the match on a 13-inch
television, stood at the end of the tunnel as his team walked off.
He received a hug from defender Paul Caligiuri and another from
Robert Fraser. Then came Schmid, who locked his arms around the
Canadian International as well.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team felt for Elliot, whose penalty for an
innocent-looking tackle on Colorado's Marcelo Balboa seemed more
like a Balboa con job than a cautionable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the happiest man at the moment because I thought I let
everyone down,'' said an emotional Elliot, who will miss Game 2
because of the ejection. ``I think the referee should have realized
it wasn't a foul at all. But it was brilliant the way the boys
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who has done his share of arguing with the officials,
refrained from getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reserve all comments on the referee tonight,'' Schmid said.
``Normally when a person gets red-carded, I'm usually upset with
that player because it's usually a dumb foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't be upset with Simon. There were other fouls on the
field that were comparable to the one he's committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-half goals from Cobi Jones and Greg Vanney sealed the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That s lot of hard work, to play with 10 men for seventy
minutes,'' Schmid said. ``So I couldn't be prouder than I was
tonight. The effort they put in, especially the second half, was
flat-out superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos played a brilliant ball
wide to defender Ezra Hendrickson in the eighth minute. Two steps
into the penalty area, Hendrickson beat Colorado goalkeeper Ian
Feuer to the far left for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney gave the Galaxy a 2-0 lead on a penalty kick in the 52nd
minute. Jones, scoring the first postseaon goal of his career, gave
the Galaxy the 3-0 cushion in the 57th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a total team effort,'' said defender Danny Pena. ``It
looked like it would be a rough time after Simon got ejected, but
we came out in the second half and told ourselves it would take
everything we had and to leave it on the field. I can't tell you
how proud I am of these guys. This was a guts-win. This is what
it's all about in the playoffs.''

LOS ANGELES CONSIDERS CONDITIONAL TOBACCO LICENSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOMINIC BERBEO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ In a bold move to stem the sale of tobacco to minors,
Los Angeles is considering issuing revocable licenses to all
stores, supermarkets and gas stations that sell cigarettes, cigars
or chewing tobacco.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The City Council has approved spending some of the $1.5 million
from settlements with the tobacco industry to enforce the licensing
program, and the City Attorney's Office is drafting the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to tobacco vendors is if you violate the law and
sell to minors, you can have your license suspended,'' said City
Attorney James Hahn, a mayoral candidate. ``After three strikes,
we'll revoke your license. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said the proposed law will be drafted by January for City
Council action.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners contend the plan is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be a free country, but that's a hell of a
lot of control over businesses,'' said Roy Canada, the owner of
Edward's Pipe and Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous how many people listen to the scare tactics of
the government,'' he said. ``This won't stop kids from smoking. The
more a thing is prohibited, the more attractive it is to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers also are concerned they could lose their license
because of an errant employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is unfair and not responsible to penalize a
large retailer for the mistake or bad intentions of one employee,''
said Todd Priest, a spokesman for the California Grocers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Los Angeles plan, an estimated 11,000 tobacco
retailers would be issued sales licenses. The licenses will be
issued free of charge, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The city would join the ranks of 14 states and 258 cities and
counties nationwide that have similar programs, according to the
Public Health Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing programs were adopted last year in Contra Costa and
San Mateo counties, where retailers may be suspended from selling
tobacco products for as long as a year.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Freestone, a spokeswoman for the Contra Costa County
Tobacco Prevention Project, said no licenses have been revoked but
a dozen businesses have been warned.
</P>
<P>
   In King County, Wash., a licensing program resulted in 51 fines
and temporary suspensions last year. But no company has so far been
issued the maximum penalty of $1,500 and a five-year suspension,
said Colin Jones, the project coordinator for the Seattle-King
County Public Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, a program established in 1997 has led to eight
one-week suspensions and 107 warnings, said Kevin Kroner, who
directs the Boston Tobacco Control Program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law proposed for Angeles, businesses that violate the
law would be issued two warnings before their licenses were
suspended, Hahn said. The length of the suspensions has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that 280 children started smoking or
chewing tobacco every day last year in California. They say half of
all smokers started using tobacco before they were 15 and nine of
10 by 18.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, business owners are fined $250 by the state for
the first violation of selling to minors and up to $6,000 for
additional violations, which Hahn called a slap on the wrist even
if enforced, which he said it rarely is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember one single instance in the city of Los
Angeles where the law against selling to minors has actually been
effectively enforced,'' Hahn told members of the San Fernando
Valley Alcohol Policy Coalition at a meeting in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Quintana of the Los Angeles regional branch of the the
Tobacco Control Community Linkage Project said she believes a
city-licensing program will make a big difference in reducing
tobacco use by minors.
</P>
<P>
   But Margaret Chabris, a spokeswoman for the 7-Eleven chain, said
there should be ``responsibility on both sides of the counter'' _
penalties for minors who buy cigarettes as well as clerks who sell
them to minors.

CITY LAW LIMITS OUTDOOR ALCOHOL ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOMINIC BERBEO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ A half century after Prohibition failed, Los Angeles
is in a pitched battle with beer, wine and liquor companies over a
law designed to keep alcohol ads and billboards out of sight from
minors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Saturday, a city law will take effect to force companies to
remove alcohol billboards, storefront advertisements and neon signs
from within 1,000 feet of places frequented by minors, including
schools, residential zones, religious institutions, parks and
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the city is scheduled to go to federal court in an effort
to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a group of advertisers, grocers and
alcohol companies that are trying to block the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol and tobacco advertising contribute to illegal
consumption of these products by minors,'' said City Councilman
Mike Feuer, who sponsored the law. ``The city now has the tools to
address that problem, and I'm confident the courts won't take them
away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of alcohol companies disagree, claiming in their
lawsuit the law violates free-speech rights and will unfairly hurt
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles ordinance seriously hinders the ability of
businesses to communicate with adults about lawful products,'' said
Steven Brody, an attorney for the plaintiffs. They include the
Korean-American Grocers Association, Mexican-American Grocers
Association, California State Package Store and Tavern Owners
Association, California Beverage Merchants, California Beer and
Beverage Distributors, Outdoor Advertising Association of America,
Beer Institute and Wine Institute.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn said he expects the law will stand up
against any First Amendment challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are being bombarded by messages from the alcohol and
tobacco industries using cute animals to feel positive toward a
product we're telling them is bad, and that's wrong,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on this issue, but federal
courts have supported regulation of advertising aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   A similar law in Baltimore withstood a legal challenge by the
alcohol industry in 1995, said Deputy Los Angeles City Attorney
Mike Klekner, who is handling the case.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by the 4th District Court of Appeals in the
Baltimore case held the decision ``conforms to the Supreme Court's
repeated recognition that children deserve special solicitude in
the First Amendment balance because they lack the ability to assess
and analyze fully the information presented through communications
media.''
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs argue in the lawsuit that city council has
produced no scientific proof that advertising for alcoholic
beverages on publicly visible media causes minors to purchase or
consume alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Another key argument against the law is that the city failed to
try other methods of keeping alcohol away from minors before
restricting speech, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to restrict advertisements, the government has to
show there is a strong public interest that can only be remedied by
controlling advertisements, and they haven't done that,'' said
Kelli Sager, another attorney for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already a state law that bans advertisements aimed at
minors, and all the city has to do is enforce it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The city, along with a grass roots coalition of community
organizations, argues the advertisements have increasingly been
aimed at minors, who cannot legally purchase tobacco or liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has knowingly and with clear intent, targeted
their product for consumption by minors,'' said Pueblo y Salud
director Xavier Flores, whose group has formed the San Fernando
Valley Alcohol Policy Coalition, with about a dozen other community
organizations, to support the law.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Karst, a UCLA law professor specializing in First
Amendment issues, said children have historically been given
special protection (by the courts) from media content in literature
and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ordinance, the new rules are intended to help
reduce the illegal consumption and purchase of alcoholic beverages
by children and minors by limiting their exposure to the
advertising of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 nationwide survey by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 50.8 percent of high school students
reported using alcohol, and 36.4 percent said they smoke
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in
1994 found children who are more aware of alcohol advertising tend
to be more knowledgeable about beer brands and slogans, have more
favorable attitudes toward drinking and report a greater intention
to drink as adults.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Building and Safety Department is in charge of
enforcing the new law. Violations are considered a misdemeanor with
a maximum fine of $1,000 and probation, and each violation of the
ordinance will be treated as a separate offense.

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe sat on the bench near his
locker, his head buried in his hands, devastated by yet another
late-game loss. In many ways this one, Sunday's 31-30 defeat to the
Miami Dolphins, hurt much more. This was one of those divisional
matchups, an arm-wrestling match if you will, for supremacy in the
AFC East. And the Dolphins had played without Dan Marino (right
trapezius spasms) for the final 3 1/2 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bledsoe's ``electric'' offense was on the field for
only 19:53. The Patriots made only 14 first downs, converted only 2
of 11 third-down conversions, ran for only 46 yards, and did not
complete a pass to Terry Glenn. Their fatigued defense, which spent
40:07 on the field (and scored two touchdowns), watched almost
helplessly as backup quarterback Damon Huard picked them apart with
a 59-yard drive on 14 plays in the final 2:10. When backup fullback
Stanley Pritchett caught a 5-yard touchdown pass on the left side
away from Larry Whigham, the Patriots were sent into shock.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet crowd of 60,006 _ five more than Marino has career
passing yards _ was even more stunned. The Patriots, who were
heading to 5-1, now find themselves 4-2, in a second-place tie with
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your defense scores twice, there's no way you should lose
a ballgame,'' said Bledsoe. ``They came out and spotted us 14
points and then offensively we can't put up enough, or hold the
ball long enough, to come away with a victory. And that never
should have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Never.
</P>
<P>
   Like there's no mistaking his hits, there was no mistaking
Lawyer Milloy's anger after the game, fingering his teammates and
the fans for a lackluster effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the game I look on our sidelines and all the
people on the bench on offense, special teams players, and even
defensive guys in the huddle, just looked like they were going
through the motions. Our fans weren't into it. It was pretty dead
out there,'' Milloy said. ``The whole atmosphere wasn't a
championship-caliber atmosphere all around. It really made me sick
to my stomach. Other teams aren't supposed to be able to make
checks at the line. Our fans are noted as some of the craziest
fans. Maybe they were upset because of the way we were playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest had led a defensive assault against Huard that
produced nine sacks, one short of the Patriots' record and the most
sacks ever recorded against the Dolphins. Yet McGinest said the end
of the game made him ``sick to my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say. I need to get better, make more
plays, cause more turnovers,'' he said. ``I'm not going to go bitch
at the offense for what they're doing over there. It's not their
fault. We win as a team and lose as a team. We have to look at what
we do individually. Are you doing your job? Are you creating
pressure? Are you stopping the run? We need to look at each other
and say, `Pick it up, start fast, and finish strong.' What's
frustrating is we lose two games by 2 points. The good teams, the
championship teams, the ones that go to the Super Bowls and win
divisions, they finish games. They do what they're supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots lost for a number of other reasons besides lack of
offense. For one, losing six players to injuries on special teams
caused huge field position problems that enabled Miami kicker
Olindo Mare to boot six field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were playing what some Dolphin players considered a
very intricate version of a zone blitz defense on third down,
making it difficult for the Dolphins to read. But for some reason
on the final drive, the Patriots went to four down linemen and
changed their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bringing guys into different gaps and different
angles and it was very difficult to have to make a read in a split
second,'' said Dolphins right guard Kevin Donnalley. ``You think
you're making the right read and all of a sudden your guy drops
back and someone else is rushing at you and you have no time to
pick him up. On the last drive we saw a lot of four-man line. When
they do that, everything becomes clearer. It's as if the clouds
part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots got two great interception returns for touchdowns
in the first quarter. At 12:06, Milloy stormed in and hit Marino as
he threw a dying quail into the middle of the field that rookie
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer picked off and ran 57 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Two series later, on Huard's first pass, more pressure forced a
bad throw intended for Tony Martin that Ty Law picked off. He
returned it 27 yards for a 14-0 lead at 8:04.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots couldn't stand prosperity, allowing the
Dolphins a couple of Mare field goals and a 69-yard touchdown pass
from Huard to Martin. As Huard scrambled, Martin put a huge fake on
Chris Carter and got wide open to make it 14-13 at 7:48 of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, who completed 24 of 42 passes for 240 yards and two TDs,
impressed all with his scrambling ability (6 carries, 54 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Milloy, who played with Huard at the University of Washington,
said, ``I was surprised he was as mobile as he was, because in
college he wasn't. He showed a tremendous amount of poise. I played
with him two or three years and I never saw him move around like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After Adam Vinatieri and Mare exchanged field goals, the
Patriots opened up a 24-16 lead on Bledsoe's 29-yard touchdown pass
to Tony Simmons with 23 seconds to play in the half. The young
receiver did just enough pushing off not to get caught and create
enough separation from corner Sam Madison. The 80-yard drive
featured throws to Shawn Jefferson and Vincent Brisby down the
field.
</P>
<P>
   A delay penalty, a short kickoff in a strong wind to the 24, and
a 19-yard return by J.J. Johnson got Miami started at the 43. After
Huard scrambled 25 yards to the Patriots' 27, Mare hit a 45-yard
field goal to make it 25-19 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots extended their lead to 8 points twice, 27-19 and
then 30-22, but couldn't do what good teams do at the end: work on
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' three-and-out offense enabled Mare to hit a
53-yarder to make it 30-25 with 2:45 remaining. But even at that
point, the Patriots couldn't keep the ball.
</P>
<P>
   On a third and 9 from their 21, Bledsoe threw it to Ben Coates,
who dropped it. After Lee Johnson's punt, Miami moved the ball with
short passes to Pritchett _ six of them during the drive _
including the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots got the ball back with 23 seconds left, and after a
21-yard pass to Jefferson, the Patriots simply ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Ending with Bledsoe's face buried in his hands.

HERMOSILLO SITS, WILL BE READY NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo
sat in the press box in street clothes during the Galaxy's 3-0
victory over Colorado on Sunday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old warrior bruised his left knee in the season
finale at Kansas City last week, but a week of treatment wasn't
enough to convince Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid to give him the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``His knee responded fairly well, but there is still some
swelling that gave us a concern,'' Schmid said of Hermosillo. ``We
expect him to be able to play by next weekend, that was the reason
for not playing him tonight. If we tried to play him tonight, he
would have been less effective next week.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hermosillo back, Clint Mathis will move from up front to
right midfield. He will replace Simon Elliott, who received a red
card in the 18th minute for a tackle on Colorado's Marcelo Balboa.
League rules mandate Elliott must sit out the next game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hartman shines: Schmid wanted to make sure goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman's performance wasn't overlooked. Hartman, who led the MLS
in nearly every statistical category, made two acrobatic one-on-one
saves in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Jorge Del Valdes broke free, but his shot to the far
post from 10 yards out was knocked away by Hartman. And midfielder
Paul Bravo sneaked behind two Galaxy defenders, but again Hartman
came up with the big save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theme tonight was faith and patience and it was tested on
a lot of fronts,'' Schmid said. ``Hartman said he wants no more
faith games, but what he does is more than just faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in this league, teams are going to get chances and
Colorado got a couple that could have turned the game. But Hartman
showed why he is one of the best in this league. He made some
brilliant saves when we absolutely needed them.''

MIAMI HAD WIND BENEATH WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This happened before Sunday's game ever
started.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson walked to the middle of the Dolphins' locker room
and delivered his state-of-the-moment address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to win this game in the fourth quarter. Hang in
there. No matter what, we're going to have the wind in the fourth
quarter and that's when we're going after it,'' the Miami coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Johnson was a prophet. His team, against
great odds, stunned the Patriots, 31-30, with a remarkable display
of courage and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling people for two years that this (Damon) Huard
kid is a good quarterback. They didn't believe me. He showed today
what he can do,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, kicker Olindo Mare, and the Miami defense comprised the
trifecta the Patriots, in the end, could not deal with Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, battered and belted around the field by the Patriots'
aggressive defense, ran an offense that kept the ball for an
incredible 86 offensive plays, and 40:07 on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dolphin defense gave up just 16 points, and did
something no one else has been able to do this year, shut out Terry
Glenn, the NFL's leading receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Madison did the job for us on Glenn,'' said Johnson later.
``Whenever we could, Sam took his man. If Glenn went to the slot,
then we gave Sam some help, but it was mostly Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   During the week, Dan Marino came up with a sore trapezius. He
couldn't throw in practice Thursday or Friday. He received a shot
before the game, trying to relax the muscle that was in spasm.
Marino warmed up poorly. He had a hard time throwing the ball 15
yards. But he decided to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins had the wind in the first period, and got the ball
first. On Marino's second pass, with Lawyer Milloy blitzing off the
corner, he tried to throw the ball away and couldn't. Marino didn't
have enough arm strength to get it out of bounds, and Andy
Katzenmoyer had a gift touchdown via a 57-yard interception return.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second series, Dan came out and told Jimmy he was a
liability,'' said Dolphin line coach Paul Boudreau. ``Dan didn't
make the throws and he was concerned going into the wind in the
second period he wouldn't be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Huard, who threw an interception on his first throw for
another New England touchdown, this time by Ty Law, to fall behind,
14-0, at 8:04 of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just stuck with what we wanted to do,'' said Johnson,
indicating that his team wasn't about to panic. ``We were confident
in what we wanted to do. I told our guys if we stopped turning the
ball over, we could come back to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard was in a tough spot. The Dolphins were missing their two
best offensive linemen, Mark Dixon and Richmond Webb, for most of
the game. Their starting fullback, Rob Konrad, went out early with
a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense turned up the heat. ``We knew they would
start blitzing every chance they could,'' said Boudreau. ``They
wouldn't try that with Dan because they know how fast he can get
rid of the ball, but with this kid they knew they had a chance to
get him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins had given up just two sacks in the four previous
games. They gave up nine in this one, and Huard was knocked down
another dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Huard had a total of 23 third- and fourth-down situations, and
converted 11 of them into first downs to keep the clock, and the
chains, moving. Conversely, Drew Bledsoe and the Patriots offense
converted just 2 of 11 third-down situations. When it was over, the
Dolphins had the ball for two out of every three minutes in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Mare, the Miami kicker, was magnificent. He converted all six of
his field goals, in a windy stadium. Without him, the Dolphins
didn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But Huard was the man of the hour. He was in a very hostile
environment. He had a hard time changing plays because of the crowd
noise, and the rookie backs behind him who wouldn't know how to
make the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   He had to stand there and take the heat when the Patriots
brought it, and he burned them in the end with a final touchdown
drive. Four times he had third-down, must-make situations, and he
made them, including the final touchdown toss to fullback Stanley
Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson explained the play: ``We went into the shotgun.
Pritchett came in motion across the formation (right to left). We
had a slot to the left with two receivers, and at the snap, both of
them went straight downfield. Pritchett kept on coming and went
right into the flat. It was difficult for someone (Larry Whigham)
to cover him from the end side.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ball was snapped, and the two Miami wideouts to that
side went straight downfield, Whigham got caught up in traffic, and
Pritchett came wide open in the left flat to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Johnson gave the ball to Boudreau, who was New
England's offensive line coach the previous two years. He was fired
last year as a fall guy for the Patriots' failures, and Johnson
hired him two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's a great coach. I'm really happy he's with us,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau gave the game ball to his wife, Joan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went through a lot when I got fired,'' said Boudreau, ``so
this is going to her.''

BRUINS ON THIN ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   As in ug-ly.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bruins' first eight games have been. The club,
which had Sunday off, is off to its worst start in 35 years with a
record of 0-5-3. The morale, which before Saturday's 2-1 loss to
the Phoenix Coyotes had been pretty upbeat, has taken a decided
turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   The team chemistry is off, the execution is spotty, the
performances have been inconsistent (or in some cases nonexistent)
and there's a lack of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   There have been players-only meetings, players meetings with
coaches, one-on-one meetings between players and coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   When the bus arrived at the team hotel after the loss to
Phoenix, Bruins captain Ray Bourque, looking very unhappy, kept his
teammates for several minutes and addressed them. So far, no amount
of talking off the ice has translated to better play on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when things have gone this badly, changes have been
made. There's been plenty of speculation president/general manager
Harry Sinden, who has been off hunting in Canada with Edmonton GM
Glen Sather, could be returning with more than a pelt or some
venison. It's possible Sinden could be returning to Boston with the
rights to disgruntled Oilers forward Bill Guerin, who is sitting
out in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sinden would part with unsigned, and equally unhappy,
goalie Byron Dafoe as part of a package remains to be seen, but
often when the Bruins have been in turmoil, the perceived problem
children have been shipped to Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin, a Massachusetts native and Boston College product, has
asked to be traded. He is reportedly asking for $3.5 million a
year, but would agree to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Mudville, the Arizona sunshine belied the
fact the Bruins are living under a dark cloud. Ironically, the
goaltending, which everyone feared would be a disaster without
Dafoe, has been the steadiest part of the club's game. John Grahame
has been the better of the two netminders, though Rob Tallas
certainly hasn't played badly.
</P>
<P>
   The forwards are another story. Center Jason Allison, who is
nursing a sore right wrist, has been the team's best player
recently along with Joe Thornton and defenseman Kyle McLaren. Dave
Andreychuk has played well despite having to switch to the right
side from the left, where he's played his whole career. The
defensive line of P.J. Axelsson, Sean Pronger, and Rob DiMaio has
been the team's best combination. The defensive corps has been, if
not great, adequate.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves players such as Sergei Samsonov, Steve Heinze, and
Anson Carter _ all of whom have been subpar in all categories. No
Bruins were naming names after Saturday night's loss but all were
bitterly disappointed at the lack of team effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is working for us,'' said McLaren, who was limping
Sunday as a result of a bruised knee. ``We have to go out there and
perform and if we're not performing, something has to be changed or
looked at. Certainly it's not the way we're being coached. Our
coaching is great, so that's not an issue at all. The effort is
there most nights. I don't think Pat's going to question that, but
it's the mental mistakes that are costing us right now. Coaches can
only do so much. It's us. We have to pick it up more, it comes from
inside. This game has a lot to do with your heart. You have to have
a big heart to play the game and mental toughness and if you don't
have that, you can't play here.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins began the season, it was obvious the lack of
Dmitri Khristich's goal production would be missed and would only
be made up if each forward helped. So far, only a handful are
pitching in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be going every night, every guy,'' said Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he expected there would be desperation with the
team still searching for a victory, but he said not enough of it
has been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly thought there was and (Saturday) it seemed like,
two games in two nights you're tired, but that's no excuse,'' said
Allison. ``That's garbage. You have to play better than that to win
games. Some guys were going, some weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he expects to shoulder a good amount of the load,
but he said the rest of the forwards are needed as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who took the brunt of the blame when we weren't scoring last
year? Me and (Dmitri),'' he said. ``Those were the only two guys
who ever took it. And that's not the case on any team, especially
ours. We have a lot of guys who should be 20-goal scorers. If you
looked at the beginning of the year, you'd say, `We don't need
Dmitri because we've got these guys.' Well, these guys have
pressure on them now, they can't have nights off. It's easy to
point guys out like me or Dmitri if we had a bad game last year,
but wait until you're in those shoes and then you see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good team. We have lots of depth scoring-wise, but
we're not putting it together every night, every guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he wouldn't put any of the blame for the lack of
success on the fact Khristich is not here. He said that was a road
best not taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every paper in the country said that even though he had 30
goals, we're not going to miss a guy like that,'' said Allison.
``I'm not by any means going to use his being gone as an excuse as
to why we're not winning. That's not fair to anybody. We're not
going good. The guys who have to step it up aren't every night. He
was our go-to winger. (Andreychuk) has come in and played great.
Obviously if we had both, it would've been a better situation, but
that's management's decision. We can't sulk about it. We still have
a good club without him. It's hard for me to say we miss him
because it sounds like an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first few games, Allison was hampered by his ailing arm.
He's playing well now although he thinks he can be better, as can
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm playing my best either,'' he said. ``It's a
team game and the better I play, the better the team is going to
play, and the better the team plays, the better you're going to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started slow and they stuck with me until I got going. There
were a lot of nights at the beginning where I wasn't playing well.
Now I've found my game and I'm playing a little bit better, but we
have to put it all together every night, every guy. It's not going
to happen every night with every guy but it's got to be close and
we're not close right now.''

DON'T PUT YOUR TRUST IN PATRIOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By RON BORGES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If you believe in the philosophy that you
are who you are and you're the Patriots, who you are is not a
comforting feeling this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Who these Patriots are is who they have been for more than two
years now. They are not unlike so many of those Red Sox teams that
have broken New England's hearts for generations. They are
magnificently talented but tragically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   They can pass the ball better than nearly any team in
Christendom, but they can't run through an empty lot. They can do
crushing things on defense, but when they need a stop, all systems
are go.
</P>
<P>
   They beat the teams they should beat, but not by as much as they
should. Thus they occasionally lose to them, usually at the worst
of times, which makes life difficult for them every January.
</P>
<P>
   They struggle with the teams who are nearly their equal or
better, and all too often lose to them, as they did again Sunday to
Miami, 31-30, after blowing a 14-point first-quarter lead that was
provided by their defense.
</P>
<P>
   They say they do not yet know who they are, but Sunday they
again showed you who they are if you care to look. They are a
two-games-above-.500 team capable of finishing one game better than
that or two games worse. They are who they are. They are a team
that is not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   They were 4-0 in September again this year, as they have been so
often lately. But when the leaves begin to disappear, so do these
Patriots. That has been as constant in New England as a
change-of-season cold.
</P>
<P>
   Their record might have been 4-0 but they were never truly a 4-0
team, as some people tried to warn you, because they were never
dominant when they should have been. Not once.
</P>
<P>
   They are the worker who does enough to get by, but not the one
who discovers the vaccine at 2 a.m. They are the worker who never
shows up late, but never stays late either. They are the lawyer who
gets all his paper work in on time, but never finds the flaw in his
opponent's legal argument at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   They are who they are. They are 4-2 and on their way to Lord
knows where because certainly they don't know. All they know is
that they've walked this way before and it is a road that doesn't
lead to Atlanta, where Super Bowl XXXIV will be played in January.
It is a road that leads to frustration and anger and occasional
moments of great elation and overconfidence instead.
</P>
<P>
   But to Atlanta? Not on the road they're on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played three or four complete games since I've been
here,'' said a bitterly disappointed Lawyer Milloy after his
dog-tired defense allowed the Dolphins to beat them with a 5-yard
touchdown pass with only 23 seconds left to play Sunday. ``That's
why we haven't won a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even giving our offense a 14-point lead without stepping on
the field (by returning two interceptions for touchdowns in the
first quarter) I never felt like we were in control. I never felt
like we were on top of them.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of the Dolphins they should have been, but Milloy was
right. These Patriots may be in the lead a lot, but they are never
on top of anybody. Not at the moment at least. Certainly not last
week against Kansas City, not Sunday against Miami, and seldom in
the four games they won before those two losses.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why are obvious to point out, but apparently
difficult to fathom. They are like this because when they need to
play offense, they can't. And when they need to play defense, they
can't because they haven't been playing offense long enough all day
to give their defense a chance to hold on at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The last two weeks one of the NFL's allegedly best offenses has
scored an average of 15 points a game. Over the last month, that
same offense has averaged 16.2 points a game. Not once in those
games has it run the ball with even moderate efficiency, and as the
weather gets colder and wetter and windier that will not improve.
But the passing game that has gotten them those two touchdowns a
game will not be as efficient, as it was not Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those problems, the defense has been on the field for
75 minutes and 44 seconds the last two Sundays. This is simply too
much to ask of the 1985 Bears and trust me, this defense is not the
1985 Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably that defense let down late in each game, Sunday
allowing Miami backup quarterback Damon Huard to move his team 59
yards in 107 seconds to beat them with a 5-yard touchdown. It was a
pass he was able to throw only because tired defensive linemen
weren't quite able to throw him on the ground one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Nine sacks, two defensive touchdowns, two turnovers, and the
removal of Dan Marino before the first quarter was over should be
enough of a day's work for any defense, but Sunday it was not. A
week ago, holding the Kansas City Chiefs to 16 points was not
either.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, on days the offense scored 31 and 30 points it was
barely enough to beat the New York Jets without their starting
quarterback or the Indianapolis Colts earlier in this odd season.
</P>
<P>
   So exactly who are these 4-2 Patriots? Exactly who they have
shown themselves to be for more than two years now.
</P>
<P>
   A team that can't be trusted.

EAGLES' PENDULUM ON UPSWING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College coach Tom O'Brien was only half-kidding
when he joked Sunday, ``The easy part of the schedule is coming
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment came a day after his Eagles (5-1 overall, 2-1 Big
East) took a stirring 20-16 victory over Pittsburgh at Alumni
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   BC's football team will now embark on the most perilous part of
its schedule, beginning Saturday with a visit from No. 23 Miami
(2-3, 0-0), which is vastly better than its record indicates. The
Hurricanes were off this weekend after postponing their contest
with Temple until Dec. 4 because of Hurricane Irene.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles will wrap up the month by traveling to Syracuse Oct.
30. BC then concludes the season by hosting West Virginia (Nov.
13), and going to Notre Dame (Nov. 20), and (gulp) No. 4 Virginia
Tech (Nov. 26), which was a more-than-convincing 62-0 winner over
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hard part of the schedule is over,'' O'Brien said,
before explaining why. ``To take this young football team and to
take them through the expectations that were put upon them _
everyone talking about them being 6-0 or 5-1 _ it was tough on this
football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we enter a phase where nobody gives us a chance to do
anything, and so we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
All we have to do is just go out there and play relaxed football.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that we're 5-1 and at this point we have a
chance to have a winning season. Hopefully, somewhere along the
way, we're going to knock somebody off and get that sixth
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he tried to downplay it, BC's fifth victory was
significant for O'Brien. Not only did it mark BC's best start since
going 4-0-1 in 1992, it also ensured the coach that his team would
finish with an improved record over the 4-7 campaigns of the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So what did the Eagles show him this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed tremendous heart and tremendous emotion in the
fact that they could play for 60 minutes,'' O'Brien said. ``It took
59 minutes to beat these guys, until we got the ball back there at
the end. But they were of the mindset that they were going to
refuse to lose the football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hasselbeck was held back for precautionary reasons because
of a mild right shoulder separation suffered in the 24-14 loss at
Temple Oct. 9. But the junior quarterback came off the bench with
10:17 remaining in the third quarter when starter Brian St. Pierre
was knocked out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck completed 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and twice
connected with wideout Dedrick Dewalt on touchdowns, including a
game-winning 36-yard strike with 1:48 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, Hasselbeck's wing was no worse for the wear.
``He still has to see the trainers,'' O'Brien said. ``But he came
out fine and he's going to be ready to go (against Miami). He'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre, however, was another story. The redshirt freshman
from Danvers was taken to a local hospital, and later released,
after he suffered a concussion in a brutal helmet-to-helmet
collision with Pitt linebacker Amir Purifoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(St. Pierre) watched practice today,'' O'Brien said. ``As he
said, his head cleared up and he feels pretty good, but he'll be
out until Wednesday's practice until we try to do anything with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien reported junior running back Cedric Washington (sprained
right ankle) was still sore but is expected to be ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, O'Brien was buoyed by the team's overall play,
especially the defense that held Pittsburgh to 45 yards rushing. In
five red zone opportunities, the Eagles allowed only a touchdown,
three field goals, and blocked a field goal (by Jonathan Ordway).
</P>
<P>
   ``We got back basically to the way we were in the first couple
of games of the year,'' O'Brien said.

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Yankees were within a couple of outs of wrapping up
a satisfying 9-2 victory over the Red Sox in Game 4 of the American
League Championship Series on Sunday night, when the heated rivalry
between the two sides boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   There was a domino effect. The frustrated Red Sox Manager Jimy
Williams vociferously argued a close call in the bottom of the
ninth, and after Williams was ejected, Fenway Park fans began
throwing bottles and other items on the field _ and the umpires
ordered the Yankees off the field for their own protection.
</P>
<P>
   But when they returned to their dugout, a security official
began screaming at them _ ``no show of class whatsover,'' Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said _ sparking a confrontation with the reliever
Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   After a delay of eight minutes, the Yankees returned to the
field and finished off the Red Sox, to take a 3-1 lead in the
four-of-seven-game series. Afterward, some Yankees were furious
with the fans, with Williams and with the entire episode.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez will pitch Game 5 for the Yankees here Monday,
with a chance to close out the series against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better lose tomorrow,'' said Nelson, referring to the Red
Sox, before ominously mentioning the prospect of the series
returning to Yankee Stadium. ``I think 56,000, 57,000 will
appreciate what they'' _ the Red Sox fans _ ``did to us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte had pitched seven and one-third innings for the
Yankees, and two Boston errors allowed the Yankees to take a 3-2
lead into the eighth inning. Darryl Strawberry had slugged a home
run in the second inning, and Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams
scored the tying and go-ahead runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial call that went against the Red Sox in the bottom
of the eighth _ second-base umpire Tim Tschida ruled Jose Offerman
was tagged out by the Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch, but replays showed
clearly that the Yankee did not tag him _ infuriated the Boston
manager and fans. Tschida admitted after the game that he had blown
the call, the second time in this series that an umpire admitted he
had made a wrong call that favored the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made two more errors in the top of the ninth, as the
Yankees scored six runs, the last coming on Ricky Ledee's grand
slam. Mariano Rivera, who entered the game in the eighth, came out
to pitch the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But after Nomar Garciaparra was called out at first on what
appeared to be another poor call, the Red Sox manager, his team and
the fans went over the edge. The Red Sox manager threw his hat and
was ejected, and fans began throwing bottles at the players. Al
Clark, the home-plate umpire and crew chief, waved the Yankees off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees returned to their dugout, however, under a shower
of plastic bottles, a member of Red Sox security _ whose identity
was not immediately clear _ began shouting at the Yankees' players.
Nelson yelled back, and for a moment it appeared the incident would
escalate.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight minutes, the Yankees returned to the field. When
Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, went to retrieve a hit in
the corner, a fan threw a bottle at him, and O'Neill went back
after the play was over to point out the fan.
</P>
<P>
   After the final out, the Yankees quickly shook hands and hustled
off the field, in control of this series and upset with fans they
thought out of control. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner,
said he had always thought of Williams as manager of the year, but
added, ``He incited this.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nelson: ``New York fans don't even do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``Everywhere I've walked in the city these past
couple of days, people have been genuinely nice. But to have people
throw stuff, that's disgraceful. It really is. I know it's not an
indication of Boston, Massachusetts, because I mean, I've been
around the city now for four years, and it's shown a lot of class
to me. But tonight was a bad mark against a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers from both teams usually speak to reporters en masse
after each game, but Williams refused to meet them. He issued a
one-sentence statement. ``It's the first one to win four,''
Williams said, ``and it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre added that he felt the ugliness of the last inning greatly
detracted from the Yankees victory. Said Steinbrenner: ``It was a
long day and everybody was uptight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees do not want this series to reach a seventh game;
they do not want Pedro Martinez, against whom they have five hits
and 35 strikeouts in their last 61 at-bats, to get another chance
to pitch, in what would be the deciding game. The Yankees now have
two opportunities to clinch this series before a seventh game:
Hernandez, their best pitcher, will face Boston's Kent Mercker
Monday in Game 5, and if the Red Sox win and extend the series,
then David Cone would throw against Ramon Martinez in Game 6
Wednesday, at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, sternly moved around
his team's clubhouse after Game 3's blow-out loss, and then again
before Sunday night's game, a living reminder of consequences. A
phone rang in the press room while Torre spoke with reporters after
Game 3, and Torre asked if the phone was for him, adding, ``You
never know'' - and everybody laughed, knowing what he meant.
Steinbrenner is omnipresent, especially in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre felt his team was relaxed, confident, and fully aware
of the importance of Game 4. Torre shook up his lineup a bit,
replacing Ricky Ledee in left field with Chad Curtis, and inserting
Darryl Strawberry as his designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry came to bat for the first time, the Fenway Park
fans offered a new and different chorus for the slugger with the
history of drugs and alcohol _ ``Just Say No.'' Boston's Bret
Saberhagen threw a high fastball and Strawberry rattled a high
drive two-thirds of the way up the right field foul pole fora home
run. It was the last time the hearty singers serenaded Strawberry
on this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive Pettitte, too, was hearing it _ ``Andy, Andy,'' _
and the Red Sox tied the score in the bottom of the second. Butch
Huskey slammed a double into the left field corner, but appeared to
pull a leg muscle as he came out of the box. When Troy O'Leary
singled to center field, to Bernie Williams, however, Huskey's
slogging limp did not deter Wendell Kim, Boston's third-base coach,
from waving Huskey around third in a direct challenge of Williams's
weak throwing arm; Huskey scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   That success may have led to a poor decision by Kim in the next
inning, when the Red Sox assumed a 2-1 lead but lost an opportunity
for more. Damon Buford singled, stole second and scored when
Offerman rolled a base hit through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin smacked a long drive to left, where Curtis _ who
started, in part, because of his defensive familiarity with
Fenway's 37-foot high left field wall _ misjudged the flight of
Valentin's shot. He was too close to the wall when the ball hit,
and it ricocheted off Curtis and went behind him. Williams moved to
back up the play, and Boston's third-base coach waved Offerman
around third base.
</P>
<P>
   It was a serious miscalculation. Williams made a quick and short
throw to the shortstop Derek Jeter, who relayed a rocket to the
catcher Joe Girardi; the ball arrived at the plate in plenty of
time for Girardi to reach and slap a tag on Offerman _ the second
out of the inning, with Garciaparra, Boston's best hitter, due to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made more mistakes in the top of the fourth, and it cost
the Red Sox their lead. &QL;

HOKIES' STRENGTH IS A SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Did you feel the seismic tremors? They rippled across
the college football landscape Saturday. From Tallahassee to State
College, Pa., to West Lafayette, Ind., to Oxford, Miss., to South
Bend, Ind., and all the way out to Stanford, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps, the biggest shock was registered in Blacksburg,
Va., where Virginia Tech obliterated 16th-ranked Syracuse, 62-0, in
a triumphant homecoming at Lane Stadium/Worsham Field.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you read that right. Sixty-two to nuthin'.
</P>
<P>
   Holy smokes. Or, should we say, Holy sm-hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two points. Does that register as a 6.2 on the Richter
scale?
</P>
<P>
   The victory was huge in so many respects for the Hokies, and the
Big East as well. Since its inception, the Big East has not had a
representative in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Tech's impressive victory _ which tied Rutgers'
62-0 romp over Temple Oct. 2, 1993, as the most lopsided game in
conference history _ left at least one Orangeman in the crowd,
senior tackle Mark Baniewicz, believing, ``Virginia Tech might
bring this thing, a national championship, to the Big East.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the fervent hope of everyone in the
conference home office in Providence, where it is believed the
Hokies possess all the ingredients _ a potent offense, a savage
defense, and opportunistic specials teams _ to earn a bid to the
Bowl Championship Series title game in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   While Virginia Tech's weaker strength of schedule could prove
troublesome in the final tabulation of the BCS's byzantine formulas
and myriad polls and power rankings, the No. 4 Hokies (6-0 overall,
2-0 Big East) remained on track for a Sugar Bowl berth by simply
taking care of business on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a real good get-after-you defense, with a lot of
talent and some real high-emotion guys,'' said Syracuse tackle Jeff
Pilon, saluting a Hokies defense that held the Orangemen to 120
yards total offense and rang up 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on a team that's been beaten this bad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A week after celebrating the biggest win of their season, a
34-31 triumph over Michigan, the fifth-ranked Michigan State
Spartans suffered a classic case of the letdowns _ along with a
deadly overdose of Drew Brees _ in a devastating 52-28 loss at
Purdue. Brees, the Purdue QB who revived his Heisman Trophy hopes,
beat Michigan State (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten) by completing 40 of 57
passes for a gaudy 509 yards and five touchdowns. As a result, the
Boilermakers climbed from No. 20 to No. 17 in the AP Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as it was to Michigan State, Purdue's victory proved
beneficial to No. 2 Penn State, which remained undefeated (7-0,
3-0) after its 23-10 triumph over No. 18 Ohio State. Now the
Nittany Lions have to hope Brees doesn't deep-six their
championship hopes when the Boilermakers (5-2, 2-2) host Penn State
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, folks in Blacksburg, Va., will be jumping aboard
the Brees Bandwagon in the hope he eliminates another contender
from the title picture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alabama running back Shaun Alexander remained in contention to
become his school's first Heisman Trophy winner after he ran for
214 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-24 victory at No. 22
Mississippi . . . Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton fashioned
his sixth game-saving drive in the last 13 games when he rallied
the No. 8 Yellow Jackets in a 38-31 victory at Duke. Hamilton, who
completed 23 of 34 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns,
guided Georgia Tech on a 70-yard scoring march with 2:56 to play .
. . Wisconsin's Ron Dayne ran for 167 yards, giving him 1,020 yards
for the season, in a 59-0 romp over Indiana in which the Badgers
amassed a school-record 705 yards total offense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden will have mixed emotions this
week when he goes for career victory No. 300 against Clemson, which
is coached by his son, Tommy. Call it a Bowden Family Feud? Or
Family Affair? Whatever the case, it will be a much anticipated
family reunion. After recording his 299th career victory in Florida
State's 33-10 triumph over Wake Forest, Bowden admitted the matchup
between his top-ranked Seminoles (7-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast
Conference) and his son's emerging Clemson squad (3-3, 3-1) gave
him reason for some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel too good coming off the field,'' Bowden said.
``Tommy's going to have a plan, and it'll be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared that the season had gone flat, Notre Dame
showed it still had a pulse in rallying from a 21-0 first-half
deficit to score a 25-24 victory over Southern California. The
Fighting Irish (4-3) need three victories in their last five games
_ against Navy, Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Boston College, and Stanford
_ to reach the seven-win plateau, which might be enough to steal a
bowl spot from a Big East team . . . After surviving a 21-17
victory over Oregon State, Stanford's whole season could be
determined in the next three weeks when the Cardinal face a tough
stretch of three consecutive Pac-10 road games, beginning Saturday
with a date at USC. Stanford then travels to Washington (Oct. 30),
and Arizona State (Nov. 13) before returning home to host archrival
Cal (Nov. 20). By then, Stanford could be 5-5 and playing for its
season when the Cardinal host Notre Dame (Nov. 27) . . . And while
he may never approach the NCAA record for consecutive victories set
Saturday by Division 3 Mount Union, which won its 48th in a row in
a 44-20 triumph over Otterbein, NCAA president Cedric Dempsey kept
his own streak of sorts intact when he presided over Boston
College's 20-16 victory over Pittsburgh. In his travels as NCAA
president, no home team has ever lost a football game that Dempsey
has attended.

PITINO'S CAMPERS HAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Kenny Anderson noticed a difference almost from
the start. There was time this year for teaching. The players were
in shape. The coach was _ dare we say it _ mellowing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling much better than last year, when it was a real
rush,'' he said recently. ``You can see Coach and the staff are
more relaxed because they have more time to put things in.''
</P>
<P>
   It translates into an atmosphere much more conducive to
learning. Rick Pitino may not have turned into Bob Newhart
overnight, but he, too, is more comfortable with what he sees and
what he's doing. He has a beautiful new practice facility that runs
on his watch and he has, for now, an attentive group of
eager-beaver campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best chemistry we've had since I've been here,''
Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year was all new, everybody going in 100 different
directions. Last year was no camp (because of the lockout). This is
the best year getting to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's fun teaching and focusing on little things
and the repetition of it. I'm enjoying the coaching aspect of it.
This is as good a group as I've worked with, college or pro.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Pitino's third season in Boston. He already has put
pressure on himself and the team: It will make the playoffs. But
while Larry Bird might think a coach's influence wanes after three
years, Pitino, who started from scratch and has been tinkering all
along, thinks he finally has his pieces in place.
</P>
<P>
   That's one undeniable comfort element. There are 14 players in
camp and every one will make the team. (There will be a couple of
players on the injured list to comply with league rules.) Two years
ago, in a camp best remembered for the liberal use of intravenous
lines, the roster was volatile. Chris Mills and Tony Massenburg,
both Pitino-signed free agents in the summer, were traded during
camp.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that his words might come back to haunt him,
Pitino said he is not interested now in making any moves.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Chris Wallace has taken the phone off the hook,
at least to talk about prospective trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable that this is our team,'' Pitino said.
``It's going to be our team. We're intact. We're not looking to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The players see that, too. Dana Barros is one of two Celtics _
Antoine Walker is the other _ who has been a wire-to-wire
participant in all three Pitino training camps with the Celtics.
(The only others remaining from the team he took over, Pervis
Ellison and Greg Minor, have each missed a camp.) He was there for
the craziness of Year 1, the utter insanity of Year 2, and the
tranquillity, so to speak, of Year 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still intense. It's still grinding,'' Barros said. ``But
(Pitino) is a lot more relaxed for some reason. Maybe it's because
he has the team that he wants. He's definitely a lot more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the guys who've been here, I think we've adjusted to him.
Whether he's as intense as he was his first year, or the way he is
now, we've come to expect whatever. We know that he wants us to be
in the best shape we've been in, every year. We're more
comfortable. He's more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the players in shape, there's more time for basketball.
Pitino stopped two-a-days a week into camp because he saw that the
need for conditioning wasn't as acute as he thought it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees everyone in shape, working hard, and he rewards us for
that,'' Walter McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Barros said, ``We're into the details of things rather than just
the basics. It's a lot more fun for us because we can play a lot
more and not have to stop every two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this is subject to change. The results are what
really matter and they won't start appearing for another fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Item for nonbelievers: Anderson for All-Defensive Team? ``I
never thought I'd see the day where he'd concentrate so much on
defense,'' Pitino said of his offense-oriented, defense-challenged
point guard. ``That's wonderful.'' Pitino said Anderson had 13
deflections in the first two games _ eight would be a lot, the
coach said _ and dived on the floor 11 times for loose balls . . .
The Celtics play the Hornets Tuesday night in the first of a
four-game exhibition swing through Dixie . . . The team drew about
3,000 to an open practice Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at the Cumberland County
Civic Center in Portland, Maine. Pitino had the players run through
several drills and then had a scrimmage. Eric Williams rolled his
right ankle, but the injury is not believed to be serious.

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN OPENS $400 MILLION ARENA IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ Ron Weeks came all the way from Montreal, Canada, to
hear the Boss call out his famous countdown: ``1-2-3-4!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a double kickoff Sunday, marking the opening night of
four highly anticipated sold-out dates featuring the reunion of
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, the ensemble that backed
the Boss on most of his journey from Freehold, N.J., to the stages
of the world's stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the inauguration of Staples Center, Los Angeles' new
$400 million, 20,000-seat entertainment and sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks, 30, spent three and a half days on a Greyhound bus and
bought a scalped $200 ticket at the sparkling new arena hours
before Springsteen hit the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not playing in Canada until next year,'' said Weeks, who
has seen Springsteen five times previously. ``I wanted to see the
most special night of the tour, and how much more special can you
get than the opening of Staples Center with Bruce Springsteen?
</P>
<P>
   ``This reunion is what all the fans have been waiting for for 10
years. It's the magic of Bruce and the E Street band together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes after the scheduled 8 p.m. start time,
Springsteen, who turned 50 last month, and the band lumbered on
stage one-by-one, greeted with roars from the packed audience.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black jeans, a button-down shirt and a black vest,
Springsteen kicked off a rousing gospel-tinged intro to one of his
more obscure songs, ``My Love Will Not Let You Down,'' going
straight into one of his biggest hits, ``Prove It All Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which opened six months ago in Barcelona, Spain, and
moved to the U.S. in July, has become the hottest ticket in the
country as Springsteen fever spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, fans of all ages mingled outside the venue waiting for
doors to open at the arena, home to three major league sports
franchises and the upcoming host of the 2000 Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   One teen from San Luis Obispo stood holding a sign that read
``Our Glory Days,'' referring to the popular Springsteen song.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our favorite song, and it portrays our zest for
life,'' said Brittany Gonyer, 16. ``He sings about everyday life,
and feelings and experiences that mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and the E Street Band played their final Los Angeles dates
at the Coliseum as part of the 1988 Amnesty International tour,
just before he dissolved the group in order to play with other
musicians and tour on his own.
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 years of experimenting, he reformed the group,
featuring not only original guitarist Steve Van Zandt, who had left
the unit just as Springsteen was reaching his biggest success, but
his replacement, Nils Lofgren.
</P>
<P>
   Original members also include drummer Max Weinberg, bassist
Garry W. Tallent, keyboardists Roy Bittan and Danny Federici, and
Bruce's main foil on stage, saxophonist Clarence ``Big Man''
Clemons.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa on vocals
and guitar, there were eight E Street members on stage Sunday. The
run continues tonight, Thursday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The messages in his lyrics apply to regular working people,''
said Tricia Righetti, 18, also of San Luis Obispo. ``He's kind of a
hero to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the circular lobby, souvenir stands did a brisk business,
selling Springsteen shirts ranging from $20 to $45, coffee mugs at
$15 and beach towels for $50, among other items.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Springsteen took the stage, an announcer advised
audience members to turn off their cell phones and asked patrons in
the premium annual boxes to ``turn off your lights and
televisions.'' Premium boxes, which contain a wood-paneled bar
area, TV screens and luxury seating, go for up to $300,000 per
year.

EXCEPT FOR SEAU, HAIR'S DIFFERENCE IN FINAL OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Hard to believe Sunday's matchup for the AFC West
division lead came down to who had the worst hair.
</P>
<P>
   But when resolution is undetermined until the game's final
second, little things mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Since Junior Seau was having a bad hair day for the ages, the
edge went to the San Diego Chargers over the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go in there with this kind of hair,'' said the Chargers'
rainbow warrior, ``you've got to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau's coif was a color not found in nature _ ``I think it's
called Irish gold, or something,'' he said _ the result of losing a
bet on Saturday's Notre Dame-USC game with kicker John Carney. When
the Trojans lost 28-27, USC grad Seau paid off his rival from Notre
Dame with a dye job that was not to die for.
</P>
<P>
   As a guy who normally plays in a gear reserved for locomotives
on caffeine, it's hard to know how much more he could ratchet up
his game. But if fashion embarrassment created even a smidgen more
hostility, the Chargers were happy for his personal humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   It was needed. There was about a hair's difference between the
Chargers and Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   As Seahawk defensive lineman Sam Adams put it, ``No one
dominated the game in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, outside of Seau, whose hand in 11 tackles and presence
in the general mayhem (including two offensive plays as an H-back),
shut down the Seahawks to the point of whimpering.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seahawks defenders were scarcely less domineering,
they were on the field when Carney's 41-yard field goal sailed over
their heads, beyond the crossbar and down in front of the
scoreboard game clock that read 00:00.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-10 defeat on the game's last play might have been galling
had the Seahawks not won two earlier games on missed field goals in
the last seconds. Instead, a slip from the late-game precipice was
merely annoying, and hardly cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that this division was going to come down
to the wire,'' said running back Ricky Watters. ``We better get
used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for Watters' warning is ample. No team in the West
_ hey, no team in the AFC _ appears dominant. The Seahawks have
been in all their games except the opener, and a play here or there
has been the difference-maker, except for the freakish rout of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the past five meetings between the Chargers and
Seahawks, outcomes were seven points or less, suggesting that this
portion of the AFC West will continue to be unpleasant for stomach
linings.
</P>
<P>
   The universal refrain in the Seahawk quarters sounded a lot like
the words around the Washington Huskies these days: Work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a process that takes more than five games,''
said coach Mike Holmgren. ``We lost a tough game, but this is not
an overnight thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are searching for identity.''
</P>
<P>
   After 201 yards of total offense, the Seahawks are looking for
the identity of folks who can get the ball down the field. The
Seahawks' longest run was seven yards, the longest pass 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, the Seahawks settled too easily for the
dink-a-thon passing game favored in the West Coast offense. Only 8
of quarterback Jon Kitna's 17 completions in 29 attempts went to
wide receivers, the longest for 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was a reason for some of the conservatism: The
guy with the insulted follicles.
</P>
<P>
   Seau is the sort of disrupter that bends game plans. The
Seahawks seemed to have scripted the game to accommodate his
talents, avoiding any chance that Kitna would be in the pocket more
than two heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna did all right, with only one interception and three sacks.
But in nearly every possession, Seau or one of his mates would make
a well-timed breakthrough to create a loss. The Seahawks, absent a
vertical game, almost never recovered from a negative yardage play.
</P>
<P>
   A good example came late in the third quarter, when the Seahawks
had just acquired their second of four consecutive interceptions
that ended Charger possessions in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   With a first down at the San Diego 31, Reggie Brown had two
yards off-tackle, Kitna missed on a pass to tight end Christian
Fauria, and then Seau dropped Watters for a five-yard loss on a
busted trap play.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Seahawks just beyond field goal range, and forced a
punt. Had Watters even reached the line of scrimmage, kicker Todd
Peterson would have had a decent shot at a 48-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Seau is doing it right, he's tough to stop,'' said
Holmgren. ``He creates a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Hook him up with Dennis Rodman's hairdresser, and maybe the AFC
West won't go down to the wire, after all.

`JEOPARDY' SCORES TKO IN THEATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ Moviegoers chose revenge over romance and mayhem as
``Double Jeopardy'' edged ``The Story of Us'' and ``Fight Club''
for the nation's top box office spot with an estimated $10.5
million at 2,936 theaters during a moderate Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, any of the trio could wind up on top today when final
weekend totals are tabulated. In one of the closest races in
several years, ``The Story of Us'' performed as expected with $10.4
million at 2,136 theaters in its opening weekend while the
much-discussed debut of violence-laden ``Fight Club'' finished well
under forecasts with $10.3 million at 1,936 sites.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Double Jeopardy'' wins, it will mark its fourth consecutive
victory _ a feat achieved only by ``The Matrix'' and ``The Sixth
Sense'' this year. Paramount's Ashley Judd thriller lost only 22
percent from the previous weekend and has grossed an impressive
$80.6 million in 24 days.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing strength of ``Double Jeopardy'' may have hampered
Universal's ``The Story of Us,'' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle
Pfeiffer as a couple in a disintegrating marriage, and 20th Century
Fox's ``Fight Club,'' with Brad Pitt as a psychotic mastermind
provoking brawls and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The new entries drew mixed reviews, and a number of critics
bashed Fox and director David Fincher over what they perceived as
the gratuitous use of violence in ``Fight Club,'' which had been
delayed from a mid-summer release following last spring's shootings
at Columbine High School that left 15 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``Fight Club'' performed poorly outside major cities. ``No one
in Middle America wanted to see this movie,'' he added, noting that
media coverage of the film's violence, the relatively long running
time and competition from Major League Baseball playoffs probably
held down business.
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell said he was surprised that
``Fight Club'' had not generated better numbers. ``It could be that
there's too much violence in it and that the female audience was so
turned off by it that they absolutely refused to see it,'' he
added. ``Anything that's this overdone tends to have these sorts of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' easily topped all movies on Friday with $3.8
million but ran into serious trouble Saturday when its total rose
just 10 percent to $4.2 million in an indication that the first
wave of customers were not issuing positive recommendations to
friends. By comparison, ``The Story of Us'' rose 37 percent on
Saturday and ``Double Jeopardy'' gained 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Rocco, Universal's distribution chief, said ``The Story of
Us'' drew audiences that were older than average with more females
than males and an interest in seeing Willis and Pfeiffer. Bucksbaum
noted that the drama-comedy is the fourth among current movies
portraying marriages in trouble, including ``American Beauty,''
``Random Hearts'' and ``Double Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So much for Ozzie and Harriet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Three Kings'' led the rest of
the pack with $7.3 million at 2,942 theaters to pass $43 million,
beating DreamWorks' fifth weekend of ``American Beauty'' with a
solid $6.8 million at 1,350 theaters for a $5,035 per-theater
average. ``Beauty,'' which has posted the highest per-theater
figure among major releases since it came out a month ago, has now
drawn over $41 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``Random Hearts'' skidded from second
to sixth with $5.8 million at 2,697 theaters as the Harrison Ford
vehicle left a wake of disappointed fans with a stunning 55 percent
plunge from its opening weekend. ``Hearts'' barely edged
Paramount's second weekend of ``Superstar'' with $5.7 million at
2,016 locations, which lost 36 percent by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's 11th weekend of ``The Sixth Sense'' finished eighth
with $5.2 million at 2,682, leaving it $100,000 short of becoming
the 15th movie ever to gross one-quarter of a billion dollars
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense'' should become 13th on the all-time list on Tuesday or
Wednesday when it passes ``Men In Black'' at $250.1 million and
``Batman'' at $251.2 million. ``Jaws,'' No. 12 at $260 million, is
likely to be eclipsed by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fifth weekend of ``Blue Streak'' continued to show some
drawing power in ninth with $3.8 million at 2,353 theaters to go
past $60 million overall. Providence, a recently formed
distributor, took 10th with its opening of religious thriller ``The
Omega Code'' with $2.4 million at 305 sites to beat Fox's third
weekend of ``Drive Me Crazy,'' which has a tepid $15 million total
in 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of David Lynch's ``The Straight Story,'' a
much-acclaimed true-life tale of a man's 350-mile journey on a
tractor-mower, generated strong response with $96,000 at seven
theaters. Disney will add 23 theaters next weekend and launch
another expansion Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled about $80 million, down 4 percent from
the same weekend last year. Year-to-date business remains about 7
percent ahead of last year, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a strong market for what audiences perceive as
quality films like `Double Jeopardy,''' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive weekends of only two new movies coming into
the market, next weekend will see half a dozen _ Warner's romantic
comedy ``Three to Tango,'' Universal's wedding comedy ``The Best
Man,'' Paramount's drama ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' New Line's
mystery ``Body Shots,'' Sony's comedy-drama ``Crazy in Alabama''
and start-up Destination's horror project ``Bats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, we were going to get a lot of new movies, so
the market is going to be pretty crowded,'' said Bucksbaum. ``Three
to Tango,'' starring Neve Campbell, has the best prospects of the
newcomers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Final results for the Friday-Sunday period will be released
today.

STELLAR `D' RINGS HOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They had been on the field for 40 minutes
and 7 seconds. For the New England Patriots' defense, they were the
longest 7 seconds of Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Their two interceptions for touchdowns early in the first
quarter and their nine sacks of Miami quarterback Damon Huard _ the
most ever against the Dolphins _ were relegated to hollow
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, sacked for the final time by linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer
with three minutes to play on Miami's penultimate drive, went
untouched on the one that mattered. On the final drive, Huard
countered the New England blitz by targeting the flat and middle of
the field with quick passes and scrambling away from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Huard) made the plays when he needed to,'' said linebacker
Chris Slade, who, along with Katzenmoyer and Willie McGinest, had
two sacks each in the Patriots' 31-30 loss. ``But in a two-minute
situation, you have to make one play and get off the field. A field
goal would not have beaten us.''
</P>
<P>
   But a touchdown, Huard's 5-yard toss to Stanley Pritchett with
23 seconds to play, did.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did (Huard) have rushing, 50 yards?'' said cornerback
Steve Israel, who was not off by much as Miami's backup quarterback
took off six times for 54 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing against Dan (Marino). He'll go down as one of the
best, if not the best quarterback in the game, but I don't think
Dan has 50 yards rushing in his career. And that made a huge
difference in the game because a couple of times we had him stopped
on third down, and I looked up from my coverage and this guy, he's
down the field. That hurts and it definitely wasn't in the game
plan to have a `spy' on the quarterback because he's a scrambling
guy, like Kordell (Stewart) at Pittsburgh. It was one of the major
factors in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine sacks, including three straight in one third-quarter
sequence, were important, said Israel, but ``as a defense, we just
didn't get it done.'' ``We gave up 30 points and that's
unnecessary. I can't remember being part of a game where the
defense scores two touchdowns and we lose the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tolerate that. It's unacceptable. Something
definitely has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily with the defense. The Patriots were flat
offensively, going 2 for 11 on third-down conversions, which
prevented them from running time off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't making the ball move, with the running game or
with enough completions to keep the sticks moving. We were just in
and out of there so quick,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``We
weren't making any first downs.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the defense, pinned at times by poor special teams play,
had to keep running onto the field. They did pretty well in at
least forcing Miami into field goal situations, but when the
Dolphins needed a touchdown to win, the defense was a victim of its
own previous success.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ways to effectively attack blitzes is to throw the
ball real quick,'' said Carroll. ``You have to play very tight
coverage and try to make your plays, but they just picked their way
down the field. We called everything we had to try and get them.
Things that we had been hitting earlier, they did a better job of
picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no special coverage on Huard, no adjustment by the
defense, which had been preparing for Marino and got a big, lethal
dose of the more mobile backup.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote could have been provided by the New England
offense. But in the end, it was the Patriots' defense that took the
final hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two weeks, it seems things have slipped away a
little bit from us,'' said linebacker Marty Moore. ``We were
bringing a lot of heat on that young quarterback. Then they just
started adjusting. He'd scramble out and (defensive) guys would
come up, and, boom, there's a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And the football game.

DEFEAT THROWS BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There are tests of skill. And there are
tests of character.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Foxboro Stadium, Drew Bledsoe failed the first, but
survived the second. The first test came on the field, where the
offense managed to score just one touchdown in a 31-30 loss. The
second test came in the interview room, where the quarterback had
to produce a reason for the Patriots' gradual collapse that gave
the Dolphins their first lead with 23 seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   With his eye black barely smudged and his uniform pants still
on, Bledsoe faced the questioners who critiqued the team's
performance. The 14-point lead provided by the defense in the first
quarter that disintegrated into a one-point loss. The double
coverage of top receiver Terry Glenn, who did not record a catch.
The time of possession that fell in Miami's favor, 40:07-19:53. The
inability to convert 9 of 11 third-down opportunities. The failure
to establish a potent running game.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe heard it all, over and over. And the quarterback
admitted he could not provide the answers. He conceded the red zone
offense was ineffective. He acknowledged New England's shortcomings
and took the criticism calmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, when your defense scores twice, there's no way you
should ever lose a ballgame,'' said Bledsoe. ``They came out and
spotted us 14 points and then offensively we can't put up enough,
or hold the ball long enough, to come away with a victory. And that
never should have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give their defense credit, we just didn't make the plays when
we needed to. We had opportunities towards the end to end the
ballgame and didn't get the plays made then. We didn't get the
plays made early in the game to put up some points and keep our
defense off the field when we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone offensive touchdown came with 23 seconds remaining in
the second quarter. Receiver Tony Simmons caught a 29-yard pass to
give the Patriots a 24-16 lead. The touchdown completed a
nine-play, 80-yard drive that clipped just 1:03 off the clock. The
29-yard reception marked Bledsoe's longest pass completion of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   New England's reliance on the passing game and Bledsoe's trouble
throwing the deep ball with consistency led to some
second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a passing football team. That's what we are,'' said the
quarterback, who suffered with Glenn shut down by the Miami
defense. ``We do need to establish the run more than we have. When
or if that's going to happen, I don't know. But we need to
establish it more. But right now we're a passing football team.
That's what our makeup is. We need to win that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he continues to work on the long ball. ``I can
think of one opportunity to Shawn (Jefferson) where I probably
should have hit him where I overthrew him a little bit. But you're
never going to hit all the deep balls. With our guys and with our
speed, we need to be able to hit a couple of those in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have suffered two close losses in a row and appear
to have difficulty maintaining an early lead. But Bledsoe did not
voice any alarm about the team's recent play. Instead, he spoke
about missed opportunities. A win would have placed the Patriots
one game up in the AFC East.

SEAHAWKS FINALLY GET BOOTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Twice in their first four games, the Seahawks
escaped with one-point victories when the opposing kicker missed a
field goal in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Not in this game that was a showdown for the AFC
West lead.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers escaped with an improbable 13-10 victory
over the Seahawks Sunday when John Carney kicked a 28-yard field
goal with less than three minutes left to tie the score and then
won the game with a 41-yarder that sailed through the uprights as
the final seconds ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers, now 4-1, partied like it was, well, 1999. So did
the 59,432 fans at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with heart and soul and we pulled it off,'' said
linebacker Junior Seau, the heart and soul of a Chargers' defense
that stifled Seattle all day. ``You can call this win a steal, but
you've got to win these close ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks did their best to lead with a stiff upper lip after
falling to 3-2. They talked about the continued growing pains that
should be expected with their complex new offense. They used words
like frustrating and disappointing in trying to explain how they
had lost this game. They steered locker room discussions toward
talk of regrouping and getting ready for next week's game against
the Buffalo Bills at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we lost this game. But where do we go from here?'' said
running back Ricky Watters, in a voice that was several decibels
lower than the one that could be heard behind closed doors before
reporters were allowed to enter the locker room. ``Are we just
going to spiral downward? Or are we going to say, `You know what?
We're better than this. We've got a better team than this. And
we've just got to keep working and make sure we cut out some of the
mistakes we're making.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carney's late kicks won this game, but the Seahawks' offense
should be kicking itself for wasting the opportunities provided by
its big-play defense.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Chargers' first four possessions in the second half
ended with an Erik Kramer interception. Nickel back Brian Walker
got the first and returned it 21 yards to the San Diego 34-yard
line. Nickel back Chris Canty was next. Then it was defensive
tackle Cortez Kennedy, who made like a 305-pound Barry Sanders in
returning his to the Chargers' 37. The last was turned in by
cornerback Willie Williams, who made his pick at the Seahawks'
5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of putting the game away, the offense put the pressure
on the defense by scoring just once _ on Jon Kitna's 1-yard
touchdown pass to tight end Itula Mili.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doubly frustrating when you feel like you're letting the
other side down,'' guard Pete Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make it triply frustrating when a defense that had
held the Chargers to 240 yards and seven points in the first 55
minutes gives up 90 yards and six points in the final five minutes?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot happened the last drive. Everything happened the last
drive,'' said defensive end Phillip Daniels, who spent most of what
was a very warm afternoon putting the heat on Kramer after blowing
around Chargers tackle John Jackson. ``All we needed was one big
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Kramer who made the big plays.
</P>
<P>
   On what was really a one-play drive to the game-tying field
goal, Kramer got off a 41-yard completion to wide receiver Jeff
Graham just before being driven to the turf by Seahawks linebacker
Chad Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the offense was having a tough time,'' cornerback
Shawn Springs said. ``But once we have the lead we just have to
hold it. Say what you will about our offense, but if the Chargers
don't score, they don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the drive to Carney's game-winner, Kramer quickly and
accurately chewed up the needed yardage by passing 15 yards to
tight end Freddie Jones, 16 yards to wide receiver Chris Penn and
11 yards to running back Terrell Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erik hung in there. Even though he threw some interceptions,
he came back and put our offense into field-goal range,'' Seau
said. ``That is a plus, when we can do something like this. It's
going to be positive. And it's going to remain positive because
this was a big win for us. It is going to carry us a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Chargers' first TD, which was set up when
cornerback Darryll Lewis intercepted a Kitna pass and returned it
to the Seahawks' 34. On first-and-goal from the 5, defensive end
Michael Sinclair stuffed the gap that Natrone Means was looking
for. But when Means bounced the play to his right, the Seahawks had
no one there to contain the outside and the Chargers' running back
was able to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we played the perfect game,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Seahawks were due to lose a game like this. After
all, they escaped with a one-point win in Chicago when Bears kicker
Brian Gowins was wide right on a 48-yard attempt with eight seconds
to play. They did it again against Oakland when the Raiders' Mike
Husted was just short on a 61-yarder with four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Law of averages? Or Murphy's Law?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough one,'' Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said.
``Any time you go down to the wire and lose, it's tough. But we
will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Seahawks believe that, even though they had just
blown an opportunity to take sole possession of the division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game to put us in first place,'' Daniels said.
``But it definitely wasn't to decide the AFC West. It will come
down to the end. We'll get another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But none may be as easy to reach out and touch, or fritter way,
as the one Sunday.

NO QB CONTROVERSY FOR JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ His first pass on the second play of the
game was complete to wide receiver Tony Martin for 8 yards and made
him the first man in NFL history to throw for more than 60,000
yards.
</P>
<P>
   His second pass was intercepted by Patriots linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer and returned 57 yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead
just 2:54 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, he skipped a pass to Oronde Gadsden and felt
the pain run up his right shoulder and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino's day was through and he knew it. He went to the
sidelines and told coach Jimmy Johnson that his day was done.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called on Damon Huard and the immediate result was
anything but encouraging. His first pass was intercepted by
cornerback Ty Law and returned 27 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not even seven minutes into the game, the Dolphins trailed the
Patriots, 14-0, and were without their starting quarterback. The
Patriots had everything going their way, right? Well, you'd
certainly think so.
</P>
<P>
   But Huard, who three years ago worked for the Seattle Seahawks
as a public relations intern, rallied the troops time and time
again. He made the comeback complete with a 5-yard touchdown pass
to Stanley Pritchett with 23 seconds left and the Dolphins stunned
the Patriots, 31-30, handing them their second last-second defeat
in seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The record will show that Huard completed 24 of 42 passes for
240 yards and two touchdowns, including a 69-yard strike to Martin.
He also rushed for 54 yards _ that's 36 yards more than Marino ever
rushed for in an NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   So, who gets the start next week when the Dolphins host
Philadelphia? Marino, who was battered last week against
Indianapolis, or Huard, who pulled the Dolphins from the brink of
defeat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Marino is our starting quarterback,'' said Johnson Sunday.
``Let's not get any controversy started here. If he's ready to go,
he's the man and Damon Huard is the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan took himself out. This morning he thought he'd be OK once
he loosened up, but as the day went on, he said he was having to
make a conscious effort to put velocity on the ball. He apologized
to me at the end of the game about not being able to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, whose situation will be evaluated on a daily basis, said
he knew he was in trouble early on when ``I was throwing changeups
and I'm used to throwing fastballs. I had nothing. I just didn't
feel I could throw it. In order to help the team, the best thing
was for me to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like the best thing considering the way Huard
started. But the free agent out of Washington, although sacked nine
times, hung in and pecked away at the Patriots' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty exciting day for me,'' said Huard, who drove
the Dolphins 59 yards on 14 plays on the winning drive after they
gained possession on a punt at their own 41. ``But I had a lot of
work this week with Dan being hurt and all, so I was ready to do
what I had to. We didn't put the ball in the end zone all that
much, but we did when it counted most. It was a great win on the
road for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan had 36 of these (comebacks) and I got my first today.
(Marino) was absolutely first class. He was there all day for me
even when I was making mistakes. He was telling me to hang in there
and to not give up because I'd have a chance to win in the fourth
quarter. He really helped me on my reads and on seeing the
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Johnson tell Huard before he took the field for the
game-winning drive?
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice the two-minute offense every week with one minute
and 40 seconds and no timeouts. I told him this (two minutes and
one timeout) was easier. I told him just take your time and work
with the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   He listened very well.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Running back Ricky Watters was angry. Tight end
Christian Fauria was frustrated. Quarterback Jon Kitna was
shouldering more than his share of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks offensive players took Sunday's 13-10 final-second loss
to San Diego particularly hard, unanimously feeling they'd just put
on a three-hour clinic in missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate losing,'' said Watters, who finished with 54 yards
against the NFL's fourth-best rush defense. ``We had more than
enough opportunities and we felt we should have won this game. As a
team, we didn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating. We're better than this. We have a better
team than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the harsh self-criticism in the locker room after the
game, you'd think Seattle players had just suffered a blowout
defeat instead of losing by a field goal kicked with three seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a tough one to lose. The Seahawks had just come off
a good week of practice and were playing for first place in the AFC
West. All week they'd heard about San Diego's stifling defense and
its all-world linebacker Junior Seau. But the Seahawks were riding
a three-game winning streak and felt prepared and energized when
they arrived at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a stellar defensive effort, Seattle performed well
enough to hold a 10-7 lead into the fourth quarter. But on this
day, 10 points wasn't enough to win. And it wasn't as if they
didn't have plenty of chances to score more.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive unit's aggravation was perhaps directed at a
nearly 12-minute period in the second half when Seahawks defenders
intercepted Chargers quarterback Erik Kramer on four consecutive
possessions, only to have the Seattle offense answer with a lone
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks missed a field goal and went three-and-out twice on
the other three drives _ the latter part of a 3-for-13 futility in
third-down conversions on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle got the ball with 2:54 remaining and the game tied at
10, but the drive stalled on the Seahawks' 30-yard line with 1:34
left. Kitna completed a 13-yard pass to Sean Dawkins on first down,
but the Seahawks couldn't manage another yard in the next three
downs. Watters was stuffed at the line of scrimmage and Kitna had
two incomplete passes to Derrick Mayes, who caught a third down
pass out of bounds deep in Chargers territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' said Kitna, who threw his second
interception of the year and passed for 151 yards. ``It's a team
game, but I felt like I could have played much better. I played
hard, I just felt like I could play better. They're a great defense
and they seemed to make the plays just when we were trying to get
into a flow.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year Seattle head coach Mike Holmgren was equally
disappointed in the game's outcome, but like several of the veteran
players, he took a decidedly big-picture approach to the season and
his newly-implemented offense.
</P>
<P>
   Credit also must be given to San Diego's defense, which lived up
to its reputation. The Chargers haven't allowed a 100-yard rusher
in their last 24 games and are holding runners to less than 2.6
yards a carry. Seattle averaged only 2.3 yards per try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling we lost a tough game and I'm frustrated we
couldn't come out with a win,'' Holmgren said. ``But this wasn't
going to be an overnight thing. This is a process that takes more
than five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters agreed. ``We have to realize there will be growing
pains,'' he said. ``It (the new offense) is like a puzzle and
everyone has to fit in the right place. Everyone. We cannot make
these mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all new in this but believe me, when it clicks we'll be
a hot team.''

KRAMER TAKES LICKS, GETS OVER PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When San Diego quarterback Erik Kramer learned
Wednesday he'd get the start against the Seahawks, he never
imagined the game would turn out the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year NFL veteran was 27 of 44 for 296 yards, zero
touchdowns and four interceptions. The picks came on four straight
possessions in the second half and allowed the Seahawks to regain
the lead and momentum they'd lost going into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating thing is when I make a bad play and throw a
pick, or somebody misses a block, or drops a pass, it all starts to
mount after a while,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of all of those mistakes to go around. Yet
with 1:34 left on the clock, San Diego found itself driving toward
the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer hit four consecutive passes to put the Chargers in
field-goal range and give kicker John Carney a chance to clinch the
13-10 victory. Suddenly, everything that had gone wrong for San
Diego in the second half went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had breakdowns is basically what it came down to,''
Kramer said. ``Nobody missed any blocks, nobody dropped any balls,
I didn't make any poor decisions and that's how you play offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Kramer threw a career-high four interceptions, his
team wasn't so lucky. It was two years ago at Arizona and his
Chicago Bears left with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really executing throughout that game. I didn't
feel like we were ever going to get a break,'' remembered Kramer,
who signed a two-year contract with San Diego at the starting of
training camp this season. ``Today, I felt like everything was
there for us. We just had to keep (making plays) and it was going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers rallied behind their backup quarterback. Jim
Harbaugh, left out of the game because of cracked ribs he suffered
against Kansas City three weeks ago, tried to keep Kramer positive
after the fourth and final pick that ended a San Diego drive in
field-goal range. Chargers coach Mike Riley said he never doubted
Kramer, and had no thought of taking him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   According to tight end Freddie Jones, Kramer's receivers didn't
lose faith either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a drop early for a big play and he came to me and said,
`Hey Freddie, if you didn't want to drop any more balls you'd have
to never play football again,''' said Jones, who had five catches
for 74 yards. ``He was saying, `Everybody makes mistakes.' He made
his mistakes. I made my mistakes. But the important thing is we
kept fighting and we found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Sunday's game, San Diego was averaging just 232
total offensive yards a game. The league's fourth-best rushing
defense and a turnover ratio of plus-8 kept the Chargers in the
hunt for first place in the AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the interceptions and other problems offensively, Riley
said he saw improvement. The Chargers offense finished with 330
total yards, and did not rely on a single defensive score for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it was the best day we've had where we
were able to take the ball down the field and make some plays,''
Riley said. ``Even though it was haphazard, there was enough stuff
today in the passing game against a good secondary to say that this
team is getting better in some sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll be No. 1 in the NFL in turnover ratio any
more,'' he added with a wry smile, ``... but we are 4-1 and we're
happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley was also happy with the toughness he saw in Kramer. Though
Harbaugh is cleared to play _ he was held out against the Seahawks
because he is not yet 100 percent healthy _ Riley said he will wait
to decide who will start next week when the Chargers face Green
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait before I say anything,'' he said, ``(but) I
love our quarterback situation right now.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ After 81 years of suffering, the Boston Red Sox are still
waiting for the breaks to go in their favor.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what's another day of misery?
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte pitched 7 strong innings, but it was two costly
errors and an umpire's ruling that sealed Boston's fate in a 9-2
loss to the New York Yankees on Sunday night in Game 4 of the
American League Championship Series at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the talk was about a controversial call in the eighth
inning many Red Sox fans will remember as the ``Phantom Tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Only none of the Red Sox was talking. Neither Boston manager
Jimy Williams nor his players attended a postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was ejected in the ninth inning for arguing a call
at first base, said in a prepared statement: ``It's the first one
to win four (games), and it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   New York holds a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series and
can advance to its third World Series in four years with a victory
tonight in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Only three times since the LCS went to a seven-game format in
1985 has a team come back from a 3-1 LCS deficit. The Atlanta
Braves were the last team to do it, rallying to beat St. Louis in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   What had Boston fuming _ not to mention some Yankees _ was the
controversy that surrounded Sunday night's ending.
</P>
<P>
   First, with one out and the Yankees leading 3-2 in the eighth,
John Valentin hit a grounder to New York second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch. Knoblauch scooped up the ball and stretched
unsuccessfully to tag Jose Offerman, who was trying to advance to
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Second-base umpire Tim Tschida called Offerman out _ TV replays
clearly showed no tag was made, and Tschida later admitted blowing
the call _ and Knoblauch threw to first for the inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees turned the one-run game into a rout with six runs in
the ninth inning, which included a grand slam by Ricky Ledee off
Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game was delayed for eight minutes in the bottom of the
ninth when fans became upset over a close call at first base and
began littering the field with empty plastic bottles. With one out,
Nomar Garciaparra was called out at first on a grounder to third,
prompting Williams' ejection for arguing the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inexcusable,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said of
the crowd's behavior. ``Not what Jimy Williams did, because as a
manager I understand the frustration that goes on inside. I haven't
been exposed to Boston before these last four years, but people
have been genuinely nice. But to have people throw stuff is
disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Mariano Rivera pitched 1 scoreless innings to move the
Yankees one step closer to a shot at defending their World Series
title. Rivera has not allowed a run in his last 38 innings dating
to July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the second
inning with a solo home run that hit the right-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox tied the game at 1 in the bottom half on Troy
O'Leary's RBI bloop single and took a 2-1 lead in the third on
Offerman's run-scoring base hit. It appeared they would take a
bigger lead when Valentin hit a double off the left-field wall that
Chad Curtis misplayed. But Offerman was nailed at the plate thanks
to shortstop Derek Jeter's relay from center fielder Bernie
Williams. Pettitte then struck out Mike Stanley with runners at
first and second to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took the lead for good courtesy of two errors in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Williams hit a grounder to Garciaparra, who threw
the ball into the Red Sox dugout. Garciaparra has committed four
errors in the series, one shy of the ALCS record for shortstops set
by Boston's Spike Owen in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez then doubled to right-center field to tie the game
at 2, and Strawberry was intentionally walked. After a strikeout of
Scott Brosius, Bret Saberhagen got Curtis to hit into what appeared
to be an inning-ending groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley fielded the grounder behind first base and threw to
Saberhagen at the bag. But Saberhagen bobbled the ball, allowing
the go-ahead run to score from second base.
</P>
<P>
   After his rocky start, Pettitte shut down the Red Sox before
being lifted with one out in the eighth. The Deer Park native
retired 13 of the final 16 batters he faced and did not permit a
runner to advance past first after the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second time in this series, an umpire's call also
played a crucial role in a Red Sox loss.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, umpire Rick Reed ruled Knoblauch had possession of a
bobbled ball on a force at second with the game tied at 3 in the
10th inning. After Williams hit a game-winning homer and the
Yankees escaped with a 4-3 decision, Reed admitted blowing the
call, which preceded an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday's wrong call, Tschida said he made his judgment
based on ``reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I did not make the right call,'' Tschida said. ``In my
judgment, (Offerman) made very little effort to avoid being tagged.
I called the play on reaction, on the reaction of the runner and
the reaction of the fielder. It appeared to me as though he got
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get into a position where I could see daylight
between the glove and the runner. The only position I ever got to
see that daylight came when I got to the dressing room and saw it
on television.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the last 81 years, it was too late for the Red
Sox.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mets center fielder Shawon Dunston was the set-up
man.
</P>
<P>
   His misplay of a catchable ball in the top of the 15th inning
had resulted in a Keith Lockhart triple that allowed Atlanta to
take a 3-2 lead in Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's Game 5 of the National League
Championship Series. Dunston, therefore, came to bat in the bottom
of the inning hoping to play a part in keeping the Mets' season
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes later, he safely reached first base, via a single
that followed six fouled-off pitches after the count had reached 3
and 2.
</P>
<P>
   The at-bat left Braves reliever Kevin McGlinchy, who had entered
in the prior inning, all but spent. He would watch Dunston steal
second, then give up a walk to Matt Franco and a sacrifice bunt to
Edgardo Alfonzo. Then, after intentionally walking John Olerud to
load the bases, he walked Todd Pratt to score Dunston and tie the
game, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up third baseman Robin Ventura. If Dunston was the
set-up man, Ventura was the closer. And what a relief it was for
the Mets. The Shea Stadium crowd, which had sat through the
five-hour-plus thriller in steady rain, began cheering wildly.
Dunston sensed a fantastic finish coming on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the count went to 1-1,'' he said, ``I had a feeling he
was going to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Ventura sent a 2-1 delivery over the wall in
right field, sending the Mets and their raucous crowd into a
frenzy, so much so that Ventura was mobbed by his teammates before
reaching second, and the apparent home run was ruled a single.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Two runs scored, and the Mets had closed out their
NCLS homestand with a 4-3 triumph that sent the series back to
Atlanta with the Braves ahead, 3-2. Now no one is doubting that New
York can become the first team in playoff history to rally from a
3-0 deficit to win a seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, both the set-up man and the closer credited the
other for propelling the Mets to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shawon's at-bat really did a lot,'' said Ventura. ``He
fouled off a ton of pitches and then got a base hit. And then Matty
went up there and got a good at-bat. I think guys feed off that. It
was a great job by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunston said he approached the at-bat ``thinking hack all the
way. I have only two walks this season. I don't think I have 150
for my career. I just said to myself, `I'm not going to walk. If I
go down, I'm going down swinging.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dunston attributed his grittiness at the plate to being around
players such as Ventura. ``Robin is our leader,'' said Dunston.
``He's one of the guys on this team that gives it all they have,
whether they're injured or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with an injured left knee, Ventura said he knew
McGlinchy's margin for error was minimal since he had just given up
a walk to tie the game. ``So, I'm just trying to get a ball in the
air so the guy can score,'' he said. ``I saw it go over (the fence)
and then I just ran to first. I saw Todd Pratt running back at me.
I don't know, as long as I touched first, we won, so that's fine
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets seem to play their best baseball when it appears their
season is over. ``It's a team that obviously doesn't quit,'' said
Ventura. ``I think we've been in quite a few situations like this
during the course of the year. We really don't have a reason for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Braves, they went from three outs away from advancing
to the World Series to walking off the field looking shellshocked.
``We missed too many opportunities tonight,'' said manager Bobby
Cox. ``We should have scored many more runs.''

MERCKER RED SOX' LAST HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MERCKER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With characteristic eloquence, Jimy Williams offered
this resounding endorsement of the pitcher with whom he will
entrust the ball Monday night in the Red Sox' most vital game of
the season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent Mercker is going to be our Game 5 starter,'' the manager
said before the game. ``I don't assume anything . . . Mercker is
going to start our next game.''
</P>
<P>
   From the passion in his voice and his words, it was obvious that
Williams is calling upon Mercker for this critical assignment
because . . . because . . . well, because the rules stipulate that
somebody has to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't say so _ or much of anything else _ but Mercker
is his man basically because he has no alternative. And the truth
is that Mercker is his most experienced postseason pitcher, the
lefthander having appeared in 12 October games over four years with
the dynastic Braves of the early '90s. But his postseason
experience this year hasn't been particularly pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4 of the Division Series at Fenway Park against the
Indians, Mercker was driven from the mound after 1 2/3 innings in
which he allowed three hits, two runs, and three walks. But he
happened to pick a fortuitous night to post that shabby line _
Boston's fusillade rendered its pitching irrelevant in a 23-7
bombing mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener of the American League Championship Series
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, Mercker was a portrait of
reliability in comparison to his 1999 postseason debut. In a 4-3,
10-inning loss to the Yankees, he lasted four innings, allowing six
hits and two runs. But the 83 pitches he used to reach that point
proved too taxing a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at Fenway, he hopes to make a more lasting impact,
which isn't a lofty goal, given his recent track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I need to get ahead of guys a little better,'' he
said. ``At this time of year, you can't afford to be behind guys,
1-0, 2-0. They're a patient ballclub. If they're willing to take a
strike, you've got to give it to them. Then they start to expand
the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Mercker believes, Williams will be able to keep
the bullpen phone mute a lot longer this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to keep (the relievers) more rested,'' he said. ``I
want to do that whether they're tired or they need the innings. My
job is not to win the game but to go as many innings as I can, keep
us in striking distance. I'm not going to think about going seven,
eight, or nine innings, just concentrate on each batter, on getting
outs.''
</P>
<P>
   His vast experience in pressure games would seem to be most
beneficial in that regard, and Mercker acknowledged that ``it's
more a state of mind than anything else. When you've been there
before, it helps calm you down. It's been invaluable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in a general sense. But as far as 1999 is concerned,
``if it is an advantage,'' said the self-effacing Mercker,
expressing in words the sentiments Williams had conveyed with
silence, ``I haven't tapped into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his manager, he has no other choice Monday night.

RED SOX MUST GET BEYOND CURSING THE BAD CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the Red Sox locker room Sunday night, heads were
hanging, heads were shaking. The scrappy Sox were sure they were
being doomed by outside forces.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, it's not the Curse of the Bambino the Sox are
cursing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITAL) Hey, Jose Offerman. Are the umpires cheating the
Red Sox out of calls in favor of the Yankees? (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said Offerman, who Sunday was involved in a
second controversial play this American League Championship Series
that resulted in a call going against him and the Sox. ``Every bad
call is against us,'' Offerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's something new happening here in the land of the
tortured Sox. It's called The Boston Tear Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and their fans are crying _ or at least crying foul
_ against the umpires in this ALCS, which is now 3-1 and tipped
heavily in favor of the reigning world champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And for about eight lawless minutes Sunday night, it looked as
if a Boston Tear Gas Party might be needed to bring to order what
was left of a very peeved Fenway crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As if the four errors the Red Sox committed in Sunday's 9-2
meltdown against the Yanks did not have a little something to do
with the hateful, cursed position the Sox and their faithful
followers find themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   By the bottom of the ninth inning, after the second of two blown
calls went against the Sox, the irate fans _ those still
masochistic enough to remain in the stands _ showered the umpire
crew and the Yankees with water bottle bombs and soda cups,
stopping the game for eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is that the ugly display came on the heels of one
of Boston's most celebrated playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   Uplifted, chanting, basking in the glow of ace pitcher Pedro
Martinez, the Sox and their fans had spent Saturday beating up
Roger Clemens and the Yankees in what felt like a delightful
exorcism of the so-called curse.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever momentum the Sox had hoped to sustain from Game 3's
win turned into a train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part about it is you have a ballclub that has busted
their ass all year to play and give this city something to be proud
of, and I think it's inexcusable ... to have people throw stuff.
That's disgraceful,'' Yankee manager Joe Torre said, adding:
``Tonight was a bad mark against a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed an ugly display of collective anger, even if some
of the players were hard-pressed to fault the hometown crowd for
their obnoxious and dangerous reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they've been watching the games, too. That's why
they're reacting like that,'' Offerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Quite frankly, the Sox do have reason to question authority.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, second-base umpire Rick Reed admitted he blew a call
that cost the Red Sox an out and may have helped end a 10th-inning
opportunity for the Sox to take a lead against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are still wondering what might have happened if they had
that one out back.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of it was that Reed never asked one of his crewmates
for a second opinion on the play _ instigating a debate about why
baseball umps have such arrogant authority when other officials in
other leagues like the NBA and NFL check with each and override
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the Sox's fire was further stoked when second-base
umpire Tim Tschida also admitted he blew the call against Offerman,
who avoided a tag by Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch but whom
Tschida called out.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said, echoing
Reed's admission that he blew the call and felt ``awful'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   Not as awful as Red Sox fans, apparently. Or manager Jimy
Williams, who has to take a little blame for inciting the crowd.
Williams was tossed after kicking dirt and tossing his hat and
arguing with first-base umpire Dale Scott in the ninth inning when
Scott called Nomar Garciaparra out at first. Garciaparra was
actually two strides past the bag when the blown call came.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Red Sox players could not stop thinking that more than
just their own shortcomings have gone against them in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some things that we normally don't do. We made some
mistakes but we had our chances to get back in that ballgame, but
for some reason we're not getting any help,'' Darren Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be realistic. We made some mistakes defensively.
It's tough to rebound from that. But the nature of our team is that
we continue to battle. But for some reason, that's being taken away
from us,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're battling, you battle and you're making things
happen. But if you don't get any help, it's hard to get back in the
ballgame. And I don't have to be real specific. You all know what
I'm talking about, but it's too bad the mistakes (by the umps) are
being made at crucial times of the ballgames. We made mistakes and
hurt ourselves but at the same time, they're taking away something
from us that we do very well and that's battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on down the road, maybe baseball will take up the cause of
the Red Sox, asking umpires to stop being so immune to making sure
they make the right call.
</P>
<P>
   But the bewildered and persecuted Sox have a more immediate
problem: how to end the Boston Tear Party and get ready to play
better Monday night, so there will be no way an umpire's call can
kill them.

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN OPENS $400 MILLION ARENA IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Los Angeles _ Ron Weeks came all the way from Montreal, Canada, to
hear the Boss call out his famous countdown: ``1-2-3-4!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a double kickoff Sunday, marking the opening night of
four highly anticipated sold-out dates featuring the reunion of
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, the ensemble that backed
the Boss on most of his 20-year journey from Freehold, N.J., to the
stages of the world's stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the inauguration of Staples Center, Los Angeles' new
$400 million, 20,000-seat entertainment and sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks, 30, spent 3{ days on a Greyhound bus and bought a scalped
$200 ticket at the sparkling new arena hours before Springsteen hit
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not playing in Canada until next year,'' said Weeks, who
has seen Springsteen five times previously. ``I wanted to see the
most special night of the tour, and how much more special can you
get than the opening of Staples Center with Bruce Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reunion is what all the fans have been waiting for for 10
years. It's the magic of Bruce and the E Street band together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes after the scheduled 8 p.m. start time,
Springsteen, who turned 50 last month, and the band lumbered on
stage one-by-one, greeted with roars from the packed audience.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black jeans, a button-down shirt and a black vest,
Springsteen kicked off a rousing gospel-tinged intro to one of his
more obscure songs, ``My Love Will Not Let You Down,'' going
straight into one of his biggest hits, ``Prove It All Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which opened six months ago in Barcelona, Spain, and
moved to the U.S. in July, has become the hottest ticket in the
country as Springsteen fever spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, fans of all ages mingled outside the venue waiting for
doors to open at the arena, home to three major league sports
franchises and the upcoming host of the 2000 Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The good-humored Springsteen, raised in a blue-collar family in
New Jersey, offered his take on the brand-new downtown venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pulled up, I thought I was playing at a Staples
store,'' Springsteen said from the stage, referring to the office
supply chain sponsoring the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big building, but it's important when you have a big
building, people have to get in it. And the water pressure ... I
have a similar problem at home.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sky boxes, said the Boss, there are ``too many of 'em and
they're down too low. ... You have to come out of these rooms.
That's why I don't play private parties anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The premium sky boxes go for up to $300,000 per year, which
contain a wood-paneled bar area, TV screens and luxury seating.
</P>
<P>
   After Springsteen's critique of the Center, his band launched
into ``Mansion on the Hill'' a song about separation between rich
and poor.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, which was a lovefest between audience and
performer, featured one favorite after another, including ``Tenth
Avenue Freeze-Out,'' ``Badlands,'' ``Darkness on the Edge of Town''
and ``Born in the USA,'' which Springsteen transformed from an
upbeat Top 40 hit to a bluesy dirge.
</P>
<P>
   One teen from San Luis Obispo stood holding a sign that read
``Our Glory Days,'' referring to the popular Springsteen song.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our favorite song, and it portrays our zest for
life,'' said Brittany Gonyer, 16. ``He sings about everyday life,
and feelings and experiences that mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and the E Street Band played their final Los Angeles dates
at the Coliseum as part of the 1988 Amnesty International tour,
just before he dissolved the group in order to play with other
musicians and tour on his own.
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 years of experimenting, he reformed the group,
featuring not only original guitarist Steve Van Zandt, who had left
the unit just as Springsteen was reaching his biggest success, but
his replacement, Nils Lofgren.
</P>
<P>
   Original members also include drummer Max Weinberg, bassist
Garry W. Tallent, keyboardists Roy Bittan and Danny Federici, and
Bruce's main foil on stage, saxophonist Clarence ``Big Man''
Clemons.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa on vocals
and guitar, there were eight E Street members on stage Sunday. The
run continues tonight, Thursday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The messages in his lyrics apply to regular working people,''
said Tricia Righetti, 18, also of San Luis Obispo. ``He's kind of a
hero to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the circular lobby, souvenir stands did a brisk business,
selling Springsteen shirts ranging from $20 to $45, coffee mugs at
$15 and beach towels for $50, among other items.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Springsteen took the stage, an announcer advised
audience members to turn off their cell phones and asked patrons in
the premium annual boxes to ``turn off your lights and
televisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen also dedicated a song to the Los Angeles Regional
Food Bank, adding: ``Hunger is a problem even in Los Angeles.''

SLOPPY DEFENSE OVERSHADOWS SABERHAGEN EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-SABERHAGEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Playoff games in all sports expose weaknesses as much
as they crown champions, and Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's so-called playoff
game, won by the Yankees, 9-2, exposed weaknesses long known by
many.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' infield defense, inconsistent all season, again
cracked at key moments as Nomar Garciaparra and Jose Offerman made
errant throws, giving extra outs _ and eventually extra runs _ to
the New Yorkers. And the Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch continued his
travesty of second base play; he's unable to catch some balls
cleanly and able to throw all balls anywhere but to Tino Martinez
at first.
</P>
<P>
   And American League umpires, with Tim Tschida the latest to blow
an obvious call, once again exposed their weaknesses of eyesight,
positioning, and overall competence. Knoblauch's throwing is no
more a debacle than umpires blatantly missing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amid this comedy of fielding, throwing, and umpiring
incompetence, the most crucial error of all may have been when Red
Sox starter Bret Saberhagen dropped a throw while covering first in
the fourth inning, allowing the Yankees to take a lead they would
not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought I make that play 10 out of 10 times,''
said Saberhagen, one of baseball's better fielding pitchers. ``I
guess now it's only nine out of 10 times. I should have been out of
that inning with only one run (given up).''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were leading, 2-1, in the fourth with one out when
Bernie Williams hit a shot to the right of Garciaparra, who fielded
the ball but fired high to first base, allowing the Yankee to reach
second. Tino Martinez then drove home Williams with a double toward
the Red Sox bullpen. After an intentional walk to Darryl
Strawberry, Saberhagen caught Scott Brosius looking at a third
strike for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   And when Chad Curtis hit a bouncer to Mike Stanley at first, it
seemed the damage would be minimal. But when Stanley tossed the
ball to Saberhagen covering, the pitcher seemed to take his eye off
the ball as he was trying to locate the first base bag with his
foot. Saberhagen not only dropped the throw but kicked it far
enough away that Martinez was able to score from second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was looking down at the bag,'' said Saberhagen.
``(Stanley) said to me, `Maybe I should have thrown the ball a bit
harder to you,' but that had nothing to do with the deal. I was
trying to get the bag, and I didn't see the ball into the glove; I
didn't watch it all the way in.''
</P>
<P>
   Both before and after that fourth inning, Saberhagen pitched
sharply, allowing only a second-inning homer by Strawberry off the
right-field foul pole (the umpires did get that call right). ``I
adjusted my mechanics,'' said Saberhagen. The Yankees lineup also
is several notches below the Indians' in the fear-and-trepidation
department, but beyond that, Saberhagen said he intentionally
slowed down his mechanics, ``and I felt very good out there; I was
able to locate the ball a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so good afterward, though, as the pitcher voiced his
displeasure at two blown calls going against the Red Sox in the
series, both involving Knoblauch's misadventures at second base:
the first in the 10th inning of Game 1 when all the baseball world
saw Knoblauch drop a throw except umpire Rick Reed; a mistake
topped only by Tschida's mis-call in the eighth inning
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, calling Offerman out when Knoblauch clearly had not
tagged him. In each case, Knoblauch was fumbling and bumbling but
was saved by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frustrated, and it doesn't sit well with us,'' said
Saberhagen. ``We were clearly disappointed (with Tschida),
especially with Nomar coming up with a chance to tie the ball game.
(Stuff) happens, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only hope that same (stuff) happens to the Yankees tomorrow
night.''

PETTITTE QUIETLY EMPHATIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You could call him the forgotten man of the Yankees
rotation, but that would have been overstating his influence
entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With the attention of the baseball world riveted on Apocalypse
Now _ the Saturday showdown between Red Sox Past and Present, New
York's Roger Clemens and Boston's Pedro Martinez _ nobody even
bothered to notice Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket Roger indeed supplied fireworks, but not the kind the
Yankees had in mind. By the tine Clemens finished imploding at
no-longer-friendly Fenway Park, allowing six hits and five runs in
two innings plus before leaving to standing derision, Martinez and
the Red Sox were on their way to a 13-1 anticlimax, and the Yankees
suddenly were in a most precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   True, they still led the best-of-seven American League
Championship Series, 2-1, but the momentum seemed to have taken up
residence on Yawkey Way, especially with the Sox hosting the next
two games and the marvelous Martinez brothers, Ramon and Pedro,
laying in wait for Games 6 and 7, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Pettitte, Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's starter, acquired an
identity _ last resort.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't last long. By the time the lefthander was
finished with his work in Game 4, he could answer to no other name
than ``Series Saver.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to overlook him once again because of the farcical
umpiring and mob rule into which the game degenerated at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout Pettitte's tenure, it was a taut, wrenching
struggle, and he never fell off the tightrope, nursing a one-run
lead from the fourth until he left, and then watching the Yankess
steamroll to a 9-2 triumph that leaves them one win from returning
to defend their World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte was not dazzling, just remarkably resourceful. He
allowed eight hits but walked only one and struck out five. And
after donating a 2-1 lead to the Red Sox by allowing them single
runs in the second and third _ and being spared more severe damage
by a run-saving relay to the plate _ he made the next edge the
Yankees gave him, 3-2, nonrefundable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great, being able to get the win; obviously, it was
huge for us,'' he said. ``It was a very emotional game for us. It
seemed like I was in trouble every inning, but most of the hits
they were getting were ground balls through the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the key. Unlike his predecessor the day before,
Pettitte didn't permit any fly balls into the net. And while
Clemens is still trying to get the ``Rog-er, Rog-er,'' chants out
of his ears, Pettitte wasn't rattled by the jeer du jour: ``An-dy,
An-dy.'' At least not overly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were really into it,'' he said. ``It was a very
emotional game. Sometimes it was tough to control my emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had no problem deflating the Red Sox with his assortment
of curves, cut fastballs, and changeups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night they got some momentum back,'' said Pettitte. ``To
keep them from getting to 2-2 was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, people were paying attention to Pettitte, whose major
achievement during his 14-11 season was surviving the trade
deadline. He insists that had nothing to do with his turnaround
from a 5-7 start to a 9-4 flourish after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   All the Yankees know is that they're thrilled to have him in
October. Thanks to him, they got the pressure pitching they needed.
So what if it was a day late? Roger who?

OLD FACE INFLICTS NEW PAIN

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Darryl Strawberry, you may recall, had one RBI in the
1986 World Series. It was a dagger through the Red Sox' heart: a
home run off Al Nipper on the Straw Man's final at-bat in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has been through many incarnations since then, but
you still can hear him coming before he actually appears. A
collective gasp is heard as he exits the on-deck circle, then the
familiar chant, ``Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl'' as he steps into the box.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 37, may be close to the end now, but he still has
enough power to torture the Townies. He hit a home run off the
right-field foul pole off Bret Saberhagen in the second inning
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, and it set the stage for the Yankees's 9-2 drubbing
over the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The homer had to be gratifyng for Strawberry, who almost
certainly drank, snorted, and otherwise abused himself out of a
Hall of Fame induction. He still has 332 career homers and 994
RBIs, but he will be recalled as much for his tumbles off the wagon
as for his hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he missed the postseason entirely when he was
diagnosed with colon cancer. After months of chemotherapy, he said
recently, he became depressed, and during spring training he was
arrested for soliciting an undercover police officer while
possessing a small amount of cocaine wrapped in a $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry called the incident ``one slip.'' Major League
Baseball suspended him 120 days for violating baseball's drug
policy and his own aftercare program. He said he then met with
George Steinbrenner to decided whether he had a future with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just basically told me that he knew I had been through a
lot,'' Strawberry said. ``He knew I was going through a lot of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry ended up playing in 24 games this year, hitting .327
with three home runs. In Game 3 of the Division Series against the
Rangers, he hit a three-run homer in the first inning, creating a
cushion for Roger Clemens, who coasted to his first playoff win in
13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Torre has alternated at designated hitter with
Strawberry and the dangerous Chili Davis, who played 146 games and
hit 19 homers. ``I have no rhyme or reason,'' said Torre. He said
he makes the decision ``game to game with those guys because, you
know, if somebody gets hot, then they stay in there. Right now,
it's just a feel thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's advantage, Torre said, is his big-hit potential.
``Darryl's a force,'' he said. ``The one thing that Darryl gives
you is the threat of a home run. And we may need a boom here
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Strawberry delivered in his first at-bat. As
Saberhagen ran the count to 2-2, the familiar chant washed over the
field. Strawberry got hold of the next pitch in dramatic fashion,
lofting the ball down the right-field line, toward the famous Pesky
pole.
</P>
<P>
   The only question was whether the ball would go out. It seemed
to hang for a second against the black sky, then smashed into the
mesh screen that extends from the pole and fell back to the playing
field. The crowd went limp. The Red Sox playoff hopes soon
followed.

SORRY DISPLAY BY FEW FENWAY FANS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Way to go, people. Thanks for showing the international
television audience How To Ruin A Festive Night Of Baseball And
Disgrace The Entire City In One Easy Lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I was thinking that a younger element of the crowd was
turning this whole Red Sox experience into a second 1967, one
(more) bad call against the Red Sox in the ninth inning Sunday
night sent people into a bottle-tossing mode, forcing both the
umpiring crews and the Yankees to get their respective teams off
the field before someone got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It was great in the first inning when the fans chanted ``Nomar's
Better!'' when New York's classy Derek Jeter came to bat. It was
great when the crowd chanted ``Just Say No!'' at Darryl Strawberry
when he first came to the plate. And it was also great when they
chanted a haunting ``An-dy, An-dy!'' at Yankees starter Andy
Pettitte when he got in jams.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of pathetic mindset would compel people to throw
bottles and other assorted missiles onto the field after manager
Jimy Williams got ejected in the ninth inning for protesting
first-base umpire Dale Scott's decision that Nomar Garciaparra was
out on a grounder to third? An alcohol-induced one, perhaps, but
what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   These slugs should be informed that the Red Sox got beat,
period, and that when you lose by seven runs, and when you
absolutely kill yourself with four errors, and when the other guys'
starting pitcher comes up with a needed big performance, the
umpires have nothing to do with it. But I'm sure they know that.
This is 1999. Too many people really think they're part of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   As for the game, Williams laid it out the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score tomorrow when we start is nothing to nothing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clean slate. New day. New game. New need to do things right. The
13-1 game on Saturday was good for the soul, and it was good for
Pedro Martinez's dazzling resume, but in the big picture it only
meant one thing: The Red Sox were not dead in a seven-game series.
Other than that, it meant nada.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the same as it was before Jose Offerman hit that
second Roger Clemens pitch into the right-field corner for that
leadoff triple on Saturday afternoon. It's the same as it was last
Wednesday, when Bernie Williams hit the game-winning home run off
used-up Rod Beck. It's the same as it was on Thursday, when the Red
Sox left 13 men on base in a one-run game. It's the same as it was
at any given moment during Saturday's entertaining destruction of
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is that the Yankees have all the bases covered,
while the Red Sox have some of the bases covered. How can anyone be
surprised that the better team is winning? When Pedro is pitching,
the Red Sox are the best team in the universe. But when he isn't .
. .
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to hang around too long to start noticing the
differences between the teams on days when Pedro isn't pitching.
New York's only real worry is Chuck Knoblauch, who continues to
scare everyone in the Metropolitan Area with his erratic arm. Oh,
sure, they're kind of making do with a relay team in left, and they
really don't have a No. 1 catcher, but they have won a couple of
world championships with the catching they have, and they may very
well win another. Anyway, none of the Yankee pitchers have any
complaints with Joe Girardi, and they're the ones who matter.
</P>
<P>
   This was a tough one for Red Sox fans to watch. You had Nomar
making one of those heroic throws on the move in the fourth inning
and tossing it away, leading directly to a run. You had Bret
Saberhagen, who actually pitched very well, dropping what should
have been an inning-ending throw from Mike Stanley, leading to
another unearned run. You had Jose Offerman starting what should
have been an inning-ending double play when it was still a one-run
game in the ninth and making a low throw to Garciaparra at second.
You'd like to think Nomar could have made the difficult catch, but
the planets were not in the proper alignment for him all night, and
he couldn't. What appeared to be a very big run scored from second.
</P>
<P>
   Before the inning was over, that run didn't look so big. That's
because Jimy Williams tempted the fates one more time by inserting
the sadly useless Beck into the game to face pinch hitter Ricky
Ledee with the bases loaded and one out. Ledee took out his
protractor and plotted the same trajectory Bernie Williams had used
on Wednesday, blasting an 0-1 pitch over the dead-center-field
fence for a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   This series is 3-1 in New York's favor for obvious reasons. Take
away Saturday's Fenway celebration, and New York has both played
better overall baseball and benefited from all the forces of luck
imaginable, starting with baseballs not being home runs by a matter
of inches to plain-and-simple blown calls (plural) in their favor.
I mean, we had not one, but two umpires admitting mistakes on
plays. This is, of course, unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing, nothing, nothing justifies what happened here
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. What those sorry people did was ruin everything.
``In my opinion, what happened here tonight was sad,'' said Yankees
manager Joe Torre. ``The Boston Red Sox have busted their ass all
year and have given the city something to be proud of, and what
happened was inexcusable. It surprises me. I really hadn't been
exposed to Boston until the last four years, and everywhere I've
been people have been great. I know this wasn't indicative of the
city of Boston, Massachusetts, but it definitely was a lack of
class.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of good baseball in this series, and you'd
think you'd like to see more. But if this is the way people are
going to be, then they should move Monday night's game to New York.
It's a great game, but it's just a game.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees, the rest of us are sorry. We really are.

 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To a man, the New York Yankees vowed this one would be
different, and it was.
</P>
<P>
   The defending world champions were a poised portrait in
pinstripes behind lefthanded pitcher Andy Pettitte while taking a
commanding three-games-to-one lead in the American League
Championship Series with a 9-2 win over the Red Sox Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, came close to exhausting their supply of
tomorrows by self-destructing with four errors before a sellout
gathering of 33,586 shocked into silence by a six-run Yankee ninth
that climaxed with Ricky Ledee's grand slam off Rod Beck, the fifth
Sox pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The silence didn't last long, as the night turned ugly and
dangerous in the bottom of the ninth when Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams, already agitated by an admittedly blown call by second
base umpire Tim Tschida in the Sox' half of the eighth, was ejected
by first base umpire Dale Scott, who thumbed Williams when he
hurled his cap high into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Al Clark, who approached Williams as he was
retrieving his cap, waved the Yankees off the field after he nearly
was hit by what appeared to be a plastic bottle, one of numerous
projectiles thrown onto the field from the stands. While police
officers and league and team security officials flooded the field
and Fenway Park public address announcer Ed Brickley warned the
crowd that further disorder could result in a forfeit, the players
were kept in the dugout until play resumed after an eight-minute
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who had retired John Valentin on
a controversial double play to end the eighth, gave up a couple of
hits after play resumed, but he struck out Jason Varitek to end the
game and keep intact his streak of being unscored upon in his last
33 appearances, dating to July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Since the league's pennant has been decided by a best-of-seven
series, only two teams _ the '85 Royals and '86 Red Sox _ have
overcome 3-1 deficits to advance to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very emotional game for us,'' said Yankees manager
Joe Torre, who admitted the team's joy was muted by the crowd's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion of what happened is the sad part about it is you
have a ball club, the Boston Red Sox, that has busted their ass to
play and give the city something to be proud of. I think it's
inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not what Jimy Williams did what he did. I'm a manager. I
understand the frustration that he goes through . . . (but) to have
people throw stuff, that's disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams closeted himself in his office after the game. He
issued a one-sentence statement: ``It's the first one to win four
and it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had a potential 10th-inning rally in Game 1
short-circuited by a call made by second-base umpire Rick Reed, who
he later admitted he was wrong, were hurt again Sunday &UR;  &LR; night on a
play in which the same principals were involved, except for the
umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Game 1, the play revolved around Yankees pitcher
Rivera, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, Red Sox base-runner Jose
Offerman and Sox batter John Valentin. In Game 1, Reed ruled that
Knoblauch had possession of a throw to second base on a force play
in which Offerman was running and Valentin was the hitter. Replays
clearly showed that Knoblauch never had the ball and Offerman
should have been safe.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, with Offerman aboard on an infield hit off
Knoblauch's glove, Valentin hit a checked-swing roller to second.
Knoblauch, charging the ball, made a pass at Offerman, who eluded
the tag, then made an awkward lob to first to retire Valentin.
Offerman, first-base coach Dave Jauss, and Williams disputed the
call, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Tschida said it was almost impossible to get a
proper angle to make the call, then said: ``No, I didn't make the
right call.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of capitalizing on the lift reliever Rich Garces gave
them by pitching out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, the Sox
still trailed by a run and took the field still stewing about the
blown call.
</P>
<P>
   Garces retired Joe Girardi on a fly ball to start the ninth, but
Knoblauch singled off Garces's glove and Derek Jeter singled to
left, Knoblauch stopping at second. Paul O'Neill followed with a
smash that Offerman fielded going to his left, then spun and threw
low to Garciaparra covering second. Garciaparra, who earlier in the
game had been charged with his fourth error of the series,
attempted to backhand the bag-high throw, but it went off his glove
and he fumbled the ball as he tried to pick it up with his bare
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch scored the Yankees' fourth run on the play, Bernie
Williams followed with a single to make it 5-2, and he advanced to
second when right fielder Darren Lewis's throw ticked off
Garciaparra's glove.
</P>
<P>
   In came Beck, who threw one pitch to Bernie Williams in Game 1
that ended up as a winning home run. He threw two pitches to Ledee,
the second landing in the center-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sox starter Bret Saberhagen allowed the Yankees just five hits
in six innings, but one of those hits was a home run by DH Darryl
Strawberry that gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the second.
Saberhagen also was charged with an error when he failed to handle
Mike Stanley's low flip while covering first base in the fourth,
when the Yankees also capitalized on Garciaparra's throwing error
to score two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had tied the score at 1 in the bottom of the second on
Butch Huskey's double and Troy O'Leary's broken-bat single.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox took the lead in a third inning certain to be subject to
further review across Red Sox Nation Monday morning and beyond.
With runners on first and third after singles by Damon Buford (who
stole second) and Offerman, Valentin doubled off the wall. Buford
scored, but Offerman, waved home by third-base coach Wendell Kim,
was gunned down easily at the plate by a strong relay from
shortstop Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Kim had opted to be aggressive, not unusual so early in the
game. The on-deck hitter, however, was Garciaparra, who entered the
game batting .480 in the postseason. Would the Yankees have pitched
to Garciaparra with first base open? Possibly not. But at worst,
the Sox would have had the bases loaded and cleanup man Stanley at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Valentin was on second with two out, Pettitte pitched
around Garciaparra and walked him, and Stanley went down swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was in trouble every inning, or what seemed like
trouble,'' Pettitte said. ``The fans were really into it and stuff
like that, and I know it's kind of tough to control your emotions
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had vowed to atone for Saturday's 13-1 beating, the
worst in the team's illustrious postseason history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarrassed what happened yesterday,'' Torre said
before Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's game. ``We're going to go out there and we
need a well-pitched ballgame, and you'll see a different ball
club.''

BOORISH BEHAVIOR DISGRACEFUL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was ugly. Fenway Park's Saturday euphoria gave way
to Sunday boorishness when some Red Sox fans disgraced the city of
Boston and risked causing a forfeit of Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's fourth game
of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In a hail of errors, bad umpiring calls, and worse conduct by
Boston fans, the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 9-2, to take a 3-1 lead
in the best-of-seven series. The game was delayed for eight minutes
in the bottom of the ninth inning when nitwits threw debris at the
umpires and the Yankees, prompting home plate ump Al Clark to clear
the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was scary. Police were unable to stop dozens of unruly
spectators from tossing things and the reigning world champion
Yankees cleared the field while officials weighed the merits of
resuming the game.
</P>
<P>
   Said Yankee manager Joe Torre, ``The sad part about it is, you
have a ballclub like the Boston Red Sox who have . . .busted their
ass and given this city something to be proud of, and I think it's
inexcusable. It surprised me. Everywhere I've walked in Boston the
last four days, people have been genuinely nice. But to have people
throw stuff, that's disgraceful. I know it's not an indication of
Boston, Massachusetts. It's been a lot of class to me, but tonight
was a bad mark against a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming she feels safe enough, Julia Ruth Stevens, the
82-year-old daughter of Babe Ruth, is scheduled to throw out the
first pitch of Game 5 Monday night. If Sunday &UR;  &LR; night is any
indication, whoever the Sox select to catch the toss will drop Baby
Ruth's pitch and get charged with a passed ball. Or the umps will
make a blatant mistake and call a balk on the Babe's little girl.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of frustration was built up in the eight-and-a-half
innings that preceded the unruly ninth of Game 4. It was a tight
game for a full eight innings, but the Sox were stymied by a close
play at the plate in which Jose Offerman was thrown out, several of
their own errors, and then a horrid call by second base umpire Tim
Tschida in the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Tschida joined Larry Barnett and Rick Reed in the pantheon of
umpires who've bungled calls against the Red Sox in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks led, 3-2, in the eighth when John Valentin hit a
one-out grounder to Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. Offerman
was running from first and easily avoided Knoblauch's tag attempt,
but Tschida ruled Offerman out and the throw to first completed the
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make the right call,'' admitted Tschida. ``I got the
best position I could. It's difficult to get the angle you want
without getting in the way. I called the play on the reaction of
the runner and the fielder. It appeared to me that he got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow! Three Red Sox losses. Two midnight confessions by men in
blue.
</P>
<P>
   How can this stuff keep happening? Every time we are finally
convinced that there's no black cloud renting space over Fenway
Park, something new happens to reinforce the fear that Larger
Forces are calling the shots when the Red Sox play in October.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's protests went unheard and in the top of the ninth the
mighty Yanks broke it open with six runs. The Sox helped out with
their fourth error of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Boston's ninth. Nomar Garciaparra grounded to third
and clearly beat the throw to first, but he was called out by Dale
Scott. That was enough for Jimy Williams. He'd seen the mistake by
Reed in Game 1 (the umpire issued a public apology) and the blunder
by Tschida, and now Scott. Williams got himself tossed from a 9-2
game. That's when the stuff started flying.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee owner George Steinbrenner told Fox-TV, ``It could happen
anywhere and I'm just sorry it happened here because we've been
treated well here. Their manager was my candidate for manager of
the year until tonight when he really invoked it. He incited it, I
should say.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said, ``I think the crowd was frustrated and Jimy _ if he
incited the crowd _ that wasn't his intention. He was frustrated,
sure. Maybe the fans used (it) as an excuse to do what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams refused to come to the interview room after the game
and sent this statement: ``It's the first one to win four, and it's
not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are not done yet, but their fans did much to tarnish
the reputation of Boston sports spectators. There was some
well-documented unruliness at the Ryder Cup last month and a
nationally televised near-riot from Fenway won't soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. These should be proud days in old Boston. There is
stardust on the sidewalks of the Back Bay, the Pru at night is lit
up in ``Go Sox,'' and the ``Reverse Curve'' sign on Storrow Drive's
outbound lane near the Fiedler Bridge has been altered to read
``Reverse Curse.''
</P>
<P>
   But all of it was splintered by the behavior of frustrated fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox get to the playoffs and it happens. Umpires blow
calls that go against the Red Sox. Boston players make errors they
usually don't make. Easy grounders become adventures. Easy throws
go wild. Sure double plays become no plays. Games are lost that
should not be lost.
</P>
<P>
   And now the city is disgraced by a band of unruly fans.

TSCHIDA: THE MAN IS BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The call was awful. Even the man who made it, Tim
Tschida, could admit that. It was just after midnight, and the
umpire/suspect sat in an interview room and tried to explain why he
didn't do his job.
</P>
<P>
   Tschida's problem at Fenway Park Sunday &UR;  &LR; night was that he
claimed to see something that never happened. In the eighth inning,
he ruled that Chuck Knoblauch tagged out Jose Offerman to end the
inning. Knoblauch missed Offerman by at least two feet.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrible call, the second the Red Sox have suffered in
four American League Championship Series games against the Yankees.
They now trail the series three games to one. Winter could begin
for them Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said after a couple of
minutes in front of the cameras. He explained that he was in bad
position on a tough play. ``I couldn't get into position where I
could see daylight between the glove and runner.''
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't say was that he was humiliated, but you could
tell that he was. He screwed up on national television. Before this
game, people probably didn't know how to pronounce his name. Now
they know (Chee-duh), because of his brutal night at the office.
They could start carving officials' faces into a new, dubious Mount
Rushmore, and he would be there with Rick Reed (Game 1 failure) and
Eugenia Williams (calling Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis a draw).
</P>
<P>
   After Tschida left the room, he stood in a Fenway Park corridor,
accompanied by Marty Springstead, the American League's supervisor
of officals. You would have thought Tschida was 2 years old because
Springstead did all the talking, as if Tschida couldn't speak for
himself. That seemed to be more humiliating than the blown call.
People throughout the park were saying that Tschida cost the Sox
the fourth game of this series, 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   I think that logic is worse than the phantom call at second base
itself. All Tschida did was make one error on a night when almost
everyone had a Do/Say Something Stupid quota.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the Sox, who handled the ball as if it were an
explosive. They had four errors in a championship series game,
something that championship teams never do. It continued with
Tschida, who never should have given Knoblauch the benefit of the
doubt. (Memo to the umps: Why don't you guys get it? The man is a
menace in the field. He barely can pick up a ball and throw it
straight. What makes you think he can make an athletic play,
running to his left, tagging out a runner, and throwing to first
without incident?) Stupidity reached its highest level when Sox
fans began throwing trash on the field, prompting the umpires to
clear the area for the safety of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the night of errors could not end there. A security
guard, supposedly on the field to protect the Yankees, began
cursing out the players. ``The head of security for the Red Sox was
screaming at my players,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``That
was disappointing, the show of absolutely no class whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was right. But all he needed to do was look to his boss
for additional crassness. George Steinbrenner went on television
and said that Jimy Williams incited a riot-like atmosphere by being
thrown out of the game in the ninth inning. Williams was upset over
another questionable call in the ninth and went on the field to
vent. He was, predictably, tossed.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, and people were still complaining about Tim
Tschida.
</P>
<P>
   We are all aware of the problems umpires are having in the
majors. Many of them are arrogant. Many of them don't enforce the
strike zone. Many of them never would think of standing in front of
a national press corps and admitting to mistakes. But, please,
let's not confuse the arrogance of umpires with throwing bottles at
the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't agree with the call,'' Sox first base coach Dave
Jauss said. ``But I didn't think the umpires deserved to have
bottles thrown at them. That's why I stood out there with them when
things were being thrown, hoping that people wouldn't throw if I
was with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Dave. You were thinking too clearly and rationally for a
night like this. If you had done something inane, it would have fit
in with the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill was nearly floored by a
bottle. The profane security guard nearly got into a scuffle with
Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   And all anyone wanted to talk about was Tim Tschida.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the story, guys,'' Jauss said. ``I know it works
out for you, but that's not the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' starting pitcher, Bret Saberhagen, said his teammates
don't feel the umpires have it in for them. Keep in mind that
Reed's call certainly could have changed Game 1, but
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's call came when the Sox were trailing, 3-2, and
facing Mariano Rivera, the best closer in baseball. They could have
taken the lead. That's it. Could have. The umpires never should
have put themselves in position to be questioned in a loss like
this, but they were not the cause of the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive) happens,'' Saberhagen said. ``Maybe some of that
(expletive) will happen to the Yankees (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Tschida and Reed certainly haven't done the Sox any favors this
series. But with Rod Beck's bad pitch in Game 1 and Jason Varitek's
drop in the same game and a failure to bring 13 runners home in
Game 2 and the four errors Sunday . . . well, they haven't done
themselves any favors, either.

OFFERMAN STUCK IN MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-OFFERMAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jose Offerman said he heard one explanation and then
another from second-base umpire Tim Tschida. And he didn't believe
either one.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it did any good for Offerman or the rest of the Red Sox
in Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's 9-2 loss to the Yankees in Game 4 of the
American League Championship Series at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any solace for Offerman when Tschida conceded that
he didn't get the call right when he ruled that Yankees second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch had tagged Offerman out on a ground ball
hit by John Valentin in the eighth inning of a 3-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of a series of controversial and pivotal plays
that Offerman found himself in Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first (Tschida) said he (Knoblauch) tagged me,'' said
Offerman in a quiet Red Sox clubhouse. ``And then when (Red Sox
manager) Jimy (Williams) came out to argue, he said that I ran out
of the basepath. I knew where I was, and I knew that he didn't tag
me. Once Jimy came out there, he changed his call.''
</P>
<P>
   Tschida said later, ``I didn't get the call right,'' but
contended that he never changed the ruling when he was on the field
with Williams and Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of turmoil for Offerman. It started in the bottom
of the third, when he was thrown out at the plate after trying to
score from first following a Valentin double off the left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   The relay from Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter to catcher Joe
Girardi was perfect, and Offerman was tagged out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just running the bases and couldn't see where the ball
was,'' said Offerman. ``They made a good throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox third-base coach Wendell Kim said sending Offerman
wasn't even an issue. ``I've done it before, and it will happen
again,'' said Kim. ``You guys wouldn't even be talking to me if he
had been safe.''
</P>
<P>
   After the controversy in the eighth, Offerman again found
himself in the middle of the action when a throwing error on what
looked like a routine force play or even a rally-killing double
play to Nomar Garciaparra was low and wide, starting a series of
events that resulted in a six-run Yankee rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a low throw,'' said Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   It was all he could do, all the Red Sox could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good umpires,'' said Offerman. ``But they didn't make
the (right) calls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Red Sox relief pitcher Derek Lowe summed it up best for
everyone in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Lowe. ``But despite all the
calls, right or wrong, we're still down, 3-1.''

UGLY ENDING FOR UMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fenway Park, baseball's emerald jewel, turned varying
shades of ugly Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, the pot of discontent stirred in the
stands by a combination of bad umpiring and the ejection of Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams, and followed by a heated verbal altercation
between Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson and Steve Corcoran, Fenway's
chief of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was just going to get ejected and that would
relieve the stress of the play,'' recounted Fenway security guard
Paul Anderson, reliving the moments after Williams was given the
heave-ho in the ninth inning. ``Then all of a sudden it got real
ugly, and some bottles and a lot of debris came from all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, I thought I might have to go out on the
field and stop a riot situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in the best-of-seven-game American League
Championship Series, the Sox were battling the men in blue as much
as the men in Yankees gray. At the root of Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's hubbub
was a bad call by second base umpire Tim Tschida, who ruled that
New York second baseman Chuck Knoblauch tagged out Jose Offerman as
the Sox second baseman dashed toward second on a John Valentin
roller in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tschida, in the media interview room after the game, explained
that it is difficult for an umpire to get a good angle on such
plays. He admitted, after watching a replay, that he should not
have flashed the out sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make the right call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fans in the stands finally had enough of the arbiters'
ineptness in the ninth when Nomar Garciaparra clearly beat out a
roller to third baseman Scott Brosius. First base ump Dale Scott,
however, emphatically flashed the out sign, bringing the irked
Williams bolting from the dugout. Fed up, Williams tossed his Red
Sox hat into the air, earning the ejection, then kicked around some
Back Bay dirt before he exited.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments later, the umpiring crew was calling for all
players to leave the field. Debris was cascading from the
bleachers, the shower of cups and popcorn boxes aimed at the Yankee
bullpen. A cloud also came showering down toward the umpires, much
of it from the stands around first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been treated beautifully in Boston,'' said Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner. ``Don't blame the umpires. When the
opposing manager threw his hat and kicked the dirt _ I think he
incited it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys don't remember the '70s. It was really brutal here,
brutal in New York, too. They didn't have a good game tonight _
these things happen. We didn't have a good game last night.''
</P>
<P>
   When peace in the stands was restored, following a delay of
eight minutes, it was only a few moments before more trouble
erupted. The Sox' No. 6 hitter, Troy O'Leary, shot a double to
right field, chased down by Paul O'Neill. As he dashed into the
corner, O'Neill had to duck more debris. After he collected the
ball and threw it to the infield, the Yankee right fielder pointed
out to the unpires a fan dressed in a bright orange wig, his face
painted white. Police and Fenway security personnel promptly
escorted the fan out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   When Jason Varitek fanned to end the night, Fenway security
personnel emphatically warned the players on the Yankee bench not
to go on the field. Catcher Joe Girardi needed no advice. Without
so much as lifting off his facemask, Girardi dashed off the field.
``I just didn't think it was smart to stay out there,'' said
Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Other Yankees did gather on the field for a brief celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Not seen from the stands was a verbal altercation in the New
York dugout between Nelson and Corcoran. ``He was just cussin at
us,'' said Nelson, ``tellin' us to get the `F' in the dugout and
telling us to shut the `F' up. I mean, we've got the head of
security telling us that? I played for Seattle, and I've gotten
beer dumped on me, but nothing like this. This is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sore losers. I think they are better off losing
(Sunday night). They'd better lose (Monday night), because I think
56,000 or 57,000 fans (at Yankee Stadium) are going to appreciate
(sic) what they did to us tonight. It shouldn't be retaliation, but
(Monday night) we just have to try to take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was not as fazed by the fan reaction. ``They were
throwing a bunch of stuff,'' said O'Neill. ``There was a plastic
bottle. This is the story tonight. We just won the game, didn't
we?''
</P>
<P>
   The fans, said O'Neill, were obviously frustrated. ``It's not
the first time we've seen this,'' he said. ``I don't think anybody
got hurt. They just wanted to voice their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Charles Cellucci of the Boston Police Department, in
charge of the detail at Fenway, said at 12:10 Monday morning there
were two arrests at or around the time of the debris being thrown
on the field. He also said police made two arrests outside the park
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was notified of the problems by officers
working the detail. ``There was debris being thrown, missiles,
plastics soda bottles,'' he said. ``Some were filled, some were
half-filled, some were empty. They were being thrown from
everywhere around the field. As frustrated as the fans might be,
they have to realize that can cause serious injury. It's a crime to
disrupt a game like that. From what I could see, it was coming from
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said it was up to the umpires to stop the play, not the
police. He said that when notified of the debris being thrown he
had his officers on and around the field proceed toward the areas
of concern. ``We have to show a strong presence, and that's what
did it,'' he said. ``It didn't last more than two or three minutes.
The whole time the game was stopped was about eight minutes, so it
didn't last that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre was upset that Corcoran had screamed
at his players. ``A show of no class, whatsoever,'' said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, a Red Sox initially said Corcoran had left
Fenway Park. When Corcoran later emerged, about an hour after the
last out, a security official tried to stand in front of a Globe
reporter who attempted to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran, a long-time Sox employee, referred all questions to
Kevin Shea, director of public relations. Shea said he was not
certain what occurred in front of the Yankee dugout, but he
attributed the incident to tension surrounding the situation on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Yankee reports that Corcoran repeatedly swore at
the players as they stood in the dugout, Shea said: ``I know the
man. I wasn't there, but I know him very well, as we all do around
here, and I cannot believe that he was swearing. But if there was a
sense of urgency, it was because of the safety for the fans and the
umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said he was not sure what action the Red Sox would take
regarding the incident. ``I think the first thing to do is to make
sure that nothing happens (Monday night),'' he said. ``For the
players' safety, the umpires' safety, and the fans' safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was not certain what had happened in front of
the Yankee dugout. As for the fan who was escorted out of Fenway
after the incident with O'Neill, Cellucci said he had been involved
in an argument with the right fielder but police were unable to
determine who had actually thrown the bottle. ``No one could
identify him,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the park, not long after the game ended, Boston police
broke up a small group of fans outside Gate A as they chanted,
``Yankees Suck.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Bancroft, a fan who saw much of what happened inside and
outside the park, said it was ``the first time I'm embarrassed to
be a Red Sox fan _ and it has nothing to do with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter deBernado was in the right-field stands and saw the Yankee
bullpen empty under a cloud of debris thrown from the bleachers and
stands. A life-long Yankee fan who grew up in Rochester, N.Y., the
34-year-old deBernardo now lives in Danvers and makes it a point
not to wear any Yankee gear when he attends games at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'm happy,'' he said. ``But I don't like to win on
bad calls like that. It looks like the Sox are done now, but you
never know _ hey, look what happened to the Mets today. But I do
believe the Sox are cursed, too, and I'm not superstitious about
anything. You look at what happened in '78 and '86, it always comes
down to a moment when they collapse. Look at those two near home
runs the other night in New York. My father's 75 years old, and
he's seen a lot of Yankee success _ and he said he saw Ruth's ghost
out there when those balls didn't make it over the fence. There's
just always something _ like they're not going to do it.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ He couldn't say whether he'd tagged Jose Offerman or
not. ``I'm just playing the game, trying to make the play,''
Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch said, after yet another Red
Sox nightmare had unfolded with him in the middle. ``Slow grounder
hit to me. I went after it, then I went after Offerman. Then I had
to continue and make the play at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Did his glove touch Offerman as he dashed to second on John
Valentin's one-out bouncer in the eighth? ``I have no idea,''
Knoblauch said. Did Offerman run out of the basepath? Knoblauch
couldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me these questions, and you've seen the replay
15 times,'' Knoblauch told his inquisitors. ``I haven't seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like you missed him,'' he was told. Knoblauch
shrugged. ``I have no comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boss pays him to lead off and to play second base for the
world champions. He is not paid to make calls on himself. ``If I
was an umpire, I would be wearing blue and white,'' Knoblauch said.
``Not Yankee gray.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been involved in double play situations thousands of
times since he first suited up for Little League. The first
instinct is to get the lead runner. The second is to get an out
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When Knoblauch saw Offerman sprinting past him, he took a swipe
with his glove and knew it had to be enough. There was no time to
toss to shortstop Derek Jeter for the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I field the ball and try to get the man going by, I have
to go to first,'' Knoblauch said. ``I didn't know what else was
going on. I threw the ball to first and looked around and saw the
umpire call the double play.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know he would be in the middle of a firestorm. Not a
second time. In Game 1, with the score 3-3 in the top of the 10th
and Offerman on first, Knoblauch dropped an easy toss from third
baseman Scott Brosius on another double-play ball and was still
awarded an out by umpire Rick Reed, who later admitted to the world
that he blew the call.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, controversy seems to follow him around like a mongrel
dog. In New York, bleacher creatures call WFAN radio and debate
whether Knoblauch should be in the lineup at all. Any time he's
come to a press conference during this series, it seems, manager
Joe Torre has had to explain and exonerate him.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch batted .292 during the regular season with 68 runs
batted in and a career-high 18 homers. He also made a career-high
26 errors, most on the club since third baseman Graig Nettles did
the same 26 years ago. ``That's part of the package,'' Torre keeps
saying. ``Whatever we get with Knoblauch, we get.''
</P>
<P>
   He is batting .308 against the Red Sox. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, he was on
base three of five times and scored the run in the ninth that began
the six-run deluge that put Boston six feet under. But whenever the
ball is hit to second, Yankee fans hold their breath. Offerman had
reached base on a ball hit at Knoblauch. Though he was awarded a
single on a tough chance, Offerman would have been safe anyway.
Knoblauch threw the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   Once the nightmare was done, and the Fenway denizens walked out
cursing fate and anyone in arbiter blue, Knoblauch stood by his
clubhouse cubicle wearing a gray T-shirt that read HIT ME. ``Is it
a coincidence that you've been in the middle of both these
controversies?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coincidence?'' Chuck Knoblauch pondered. ``I think it is.''

METS IN IT FOR LONG HAUL

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets are halfway to another miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Robin Ventura, struggling mightily at the plate
through most of this National League Championship Series, made sure
of that Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded in the 15th inning and New York trailing,
3-2, Ventura drilled a 2-1 pitch over the fence in right field to
give the Mets a rainy and remarkable 4-3 win and send the series
back to Atlanta with the Braves ahead, three games to two.
</P>
<P>
   It was declared a 4-3 win, not 7-3, because Ventura was given
credit for just a run-scoring single because he never made it
around the bases to home. He was mobbed by his teammates before he
reached second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like he was going to run the bases,'' said Todd
Pratt, who had worked a walk to force in the run that tied it. ``He
tagged first. I tagged second. John (Olerud) tagged third. Grand
slam. Single. It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   All that matters is that the Mets outlasted the Braves. It took
a playoff-record 5 hours 46 minutes _ and a 14th-inning stretch
during which most of the 57,723 Mets drenched fans sang ``Take Me
Out to the Ballgame'' for a second time _ to do it. It took a
record total of 45 players. It took the Braves leaving 19 on base.
</P>
<P>
   It took players who hadn't played much and a hitter who hadn't
hit much.
</P>
<P>
   And it took a tremendous bottom-of-their-last-ups-of-the-season
to do it. And the Mets did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team that obviously doesn't quit,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a task no Major League Baseball team has ever
accomplished _ winning a seven-game series after being down, three
to none _ the Mets get to play another day.
</P>
<P>
   Or night. Tuesday night. to be exact. Most likely it'll be New
York's Al Leiter vs. Atlanta's Kevin Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, after falling behind, 3-2, in the top of the 15th,
pulled it out in dramatic fashion. Shawon ``I'm a hacker, not a
walker'' Dunston fouled back six straight 3-2 pitches, then singled
up the middle. He stole second on a 2-2 pitch before pinch hitter
Matt Franco walked. Edgardo Alfonzo sacrificed Dunston and Roger
Cedeno, who was running for Franco, to second and third.
</P>
<P>
   And Pratt, the backup catcher and home run-hitting hero of the
Mets' Division Series-clinching win over Arizona, began to smile.
``I knew it was going to come down to me,'' Pratt said. ``I knew
they weren't going to pitch to Olerud.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kevin McGlinchy intentionally walked Olerud, who had hit
a two-run homer in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   So McGlinchy faced Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bases were loaded,'' Pratt said. ``I knew he had to throw
me strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so. He threw three straight balls, then a strike, another
ball. Pratt walked, forcing in a run.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ventura time.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura had come into the game zero-for-the-series and was up to
0 for 16 when he singled in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already walked a guy,'' Ventura said. ``He can't really
fool around and throw a bunch of pitches in the dirt. So I'm just
trying to get a ball in the air so the guy can score.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura got it in the air a long, long way, over the fence in
right for what must be the longest single he's ever hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I touch first, we win,'' Ventura said. ``So that's
fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mets manager Bobby Valentine, it was another display of
resiliency. ``Kind of getting used to it,'' he said. ``It seems
like we've been doing this for a couple of weeks now. And the guys
are getting used to it, too. And God bless them, they're
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Two down. Two to go.

WE BUILT THIS CITY ON ROCK 'N' ROLL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Big Ones all over the globe. A 7.0 in the
Mojave. Seismologists jumping up and down and pointing at cracks in
the earth. The 10-year anniversary of Loma Prieta.
<P>
   It's all supposed to be a wake-up call for the Bay Area, but we
reach over and jab the snooze button. Which, incidentally, is one
of the century's worst inventions. (``Give me five minutes of
fitful semi-sleep in which to dream-worry about the utter futility
of coping with the day's pending personal disasters, starting with
being five minutes behind schedule.'')
</P>
<P>
   Quake, schmake. If we were worried about the Big One, if we were
in the slightest bit realistic about what will happen when the
shift hits the fan, would we be living here?
</P>
<P>
   Look around. Hills! Cool, beautiful, poetic, scenic, photogenic,
breathtaking, fog-stopping, craggy, real-estate-value-enhancing
hills. And the hills were created by .. the envelope, please ...
earthquakes!
</P>
<P>
   As God said to Mother Nature, ``We built this city on rock 'n'
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people remember, but 10 years ago, Lombard Street was as
straight as Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   All around the bay, Hills R Us. Without 'em, the cable cars
could be pulled by Chihuahuas.
</P>
<P>
   We worry about earthquakes, but not as much as we worry about
Muni, Steve Young's brain, whimsical public art and an owl getting
mugged by a crazed football fan (I know: redundant).
</P>
<P>
   (On owl man: Just his luck his neighbor is a stool pigeon. Throw
the book at the guy, sure, but only if we do the same with fellows
who beat their wives with 2-by-4s. Or aren't women a protected
species?)
</P>
<P>
   We are a few million Alfred E. Neumans, seismologically
speaking. What, us worry? Yes, a big quake will be an
inconvenience, but I got my cell phone, I can ring up Webvan.com
and have 'em deliver some snacks and a six-pack of Jolt Cola.
</P>
<P>
   We're fixing bridges to make them quake-ready, but we back off
in a hurry if the repair might threaten a future brew pub, which
are  &LR; an endangered species. First things first. When the Biggie
hits, we're going to need a lot of brew pubs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not in denial, I'm gearing up to be shaken down. I've got
plenty of water stored up, as long as the pipe from my storage bin,
the Hetch Hetchy, doesn't snap. I bought myself a tool to shut off
the gas, but I'm worried that it was a waste of money. If I'm
trapped in the wreckage of my house, the only way out might be for
the gas explosion to blow away the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'm concerned. I worry that the Earth is becoming
irritated at all the poking and probing and digging those
geologists and seismologists are doing. It's like jabbing a stick
into the rump of a sleeping lion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what a bunch of Gloomy Guses. Every new discovery
brings more dire warnings. Never, ``A 7.5 quake on the Hayward
Fault would kill 50,000 people, but it would also make several golf
courses much more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   And seismologists keep finding new faults. Within five years, I
predict, each and every one of us will have our very own fault. So
when the Big One hits, most of us will be able to shrug and say,
``It's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   My theory: The Earth's crust is like a face _ as it gets older,
it gets shakier, develops more cracks, fissures, faults, slippage
and slideage. And what's underneath gets crankier.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about quakes, let's get back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   A JOGGER heard the frantic yelping of puppies Saturday
afternoon, peeked through the tinted windows of the GMC SUV parked
at Franklin and Vallejo streets, and saw a mother dog and five
desperate week-old puppies.
</P>
<P>
   Jogger called cops, who found the mom boxer/pit bull licking the
window in a desperate plea for help. It was hot, mid-80s, and much
hotter inside the black car, windows rolled up tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those dogs were cookin' big-time,'' says officer Jackie Riche,
one of the three cops who responded. ``They were almost in
convulsions.''
</P>
<P>
   The cops busted the window, officer Daylene Tong slicing her
thumb in the process, and liberated the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Five women who had stopped to check out the commotion each took
a now-shivering puppy and cuddled it for 40 minutes until the
animal rescue people arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the rescue, the SUV owner had not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common thing,'' sighed Mike Holland of the PD's animal
control.
</P>
<P>
   The owner claimed his six dogs Saturday evening and was issued a
citation that will cost him $27.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs should join the owls' union.
</P>
<P>
   NOBLE UNIVERSITY or Boston fern?
</P>
<P>
   Cal will go to a full-year schedule because, as regents Chairman
John Davies announced, ``It makes practical sense to make use of
our plant year 'round.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that plant as in ficus or plant as in factory?
</P>
<P>
   Whistle's blowin', kids, grab your lunch pails, punch your time
cards and hit that assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   CUTTIN' EM OFF at the pass:
</P>
<P>
   At several Bay Area Safeway stores, a yellow line has been drawn
(actually painted) in the sand (actually on the pavement). Cross
that line with your shopping cart and a sensor activates a
mechanism in the cart that locks up the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   It's clever, it makes sense, it's fair. And yet there's
something sad about it.
</P>
<P>
   DIG HE MUST: You think cell-phoning drivers are dangerous? Mark
McGuire (not Mark McGwire) was tooling along the San Mateo Bridge
when he was passed at 70 mph by a white VW Golf driven by a young
dude flossing his teeth vigorously, with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it looked like flossing,'' McGuire says. ``Might have
been a yoga thing to combat road rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Road rage? Nah, this guy obviously had a bad case of plaque
pique.

 THREAT TO INTERNET SALES UNCORKS A NEW ALLIANCE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the geography of Washington lobbying, the
valleys Napa and Silicon share fame, cachet and that rawer
attribute, power.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed little to join the interests of Cabernet and
computers until an assault on their mutual turf _ a bill to crack
down on Internet wine sales _ pushed the two powerful California
industries into an unusual alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the ``21st Amendment Enforcement Act'' say they
want to stop teenagers from buying booze in cyberspace. Wineries
contend the measure is actually aimed at protecting state liquor
wholesalers from direct sales of wine over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley was losing badly, but Silicon Valley largely ignored
the dispute until the bill breezed through the House of
Representatives on August 3 after passing the Senate on a voice
vote.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the high-tech industry suddenly realized that if
states could ban Internet wine sales, they might restrict other
electronic commerce as well, opening a Pandora's box of
product-targeted Internet regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of the bill's House passage, Palo Alto chipmaker
Intel Corp. _ whose stationery commands attention on Capitol Hill _
fired off a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, the Utah Republican who has jurisdiction over the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel, like other companies that are collectively building the
`new economy' through the products and services which form the
infrastructure of e-commerce, has a great stake in the preservation
of an Internet free of discriminatory taxation and regulation,''
wrote F. Thomas Dunlap Jr., Intel's vice president for law and
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the arrival of reinforcements from Silicon Valley will
be enough to stop the wine bill, which awaits a House-Senate
conference to shape its final version, remains to be seen. But
winemakers are joyous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech community has galvanized support,'' said John
DeLuca, president of the Wine Institute, representing California
wineries. ``It's new strength for us, new power for us, and new
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   While framed as a debate over how to stop alcohol sales to
minors, the wine fight bears all the marks of a classic Washington
special-interest battle, this one pitting vintners against
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Republican Rep. Joe Scarborough, hails
from Florida, headquarters of Southern Wine and Spirits of America,
the nation's largest liquor wholesaler. Florida is one of five
states that has made it a felony for manufacturers to sell
alcoholic beverages directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough's ``21st Amendment Protection Act'' is named after
the 1933 constitutional amendment that lifted federal Prohibition
and, in exchange, gave states the power to restrict alcohol sales.
In most states, those restrictions include bans or tight limits on
direct shipments of wine, beer or spirits to consumers. Most states
require alcoholic beverages to be sold through state-licensed
wholesale distributors and local retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   (California permits residents to buy two cases of wine a month
from out-of-state wineries, if the state allows its own residents
to do the same.)
</P>
<P>
   For years, wineries battled in state legislatures to loosen the
restrictions, while wholesalers battled back to tighten them.
</P>
<P>
   The fight suddenly escalated with the arrival of the Internet,
which vastly widened the potential for consumers to buy wines _
often hard-to-find boutique labels that wholesalers don't carry _
directly from vintners. Wholesalers, arguing that state attorneys
general are unable to prosecute out-of-state wineries, went to
Congress to get a federal statute allowing them to sue wineries in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The political fault lines broke against the vintners from the
start. Although solid backing from the huge 54-member California
delegation usually gives winemakers the upper hand, local liquor
distributors dot every congressional district in the nation. With
the issue framed as a remedy for teenage drinking, the bill sailed
through the House 310 to 112.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a few alarms in Silicon Valley, which is acutely
aware that the explosive medium of the Internet threatens not just
the Prohibition-era liquor distribution system, but nearly all
traditional retail commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Association for Interactive Media, representing America
Online, Yahoo, RealNetworks and other Internet companies, warned
Hatch that the wine bill could invite not just states, but even
nations, to restrict electronic commerce in the name of protecting
local laws and customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other nations are eager to impose language requirements,
prohibitions against importing clothing that violates religious
customs and other idiosyncratic restrictions of electronic commerce
that disadvantage remote sellers,'' the trade group wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seek the bill's outright defeat, Californians are
backing a House amendment inserted by Rep. Chris Cox, a Southern
California Republican and a savvy opponent of Internet regulation
and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cox's amendment in effect could force states that want to
sue a winery to first prove that they are not discriminating
against Internet sellers to protect their own local industries.
This provision, based on the Constitution's interstate commerce
clause, could pose a big hurdle to the very state lawsuits that the
wine bill is intended to permit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Silicon and Napa valleys are now throwing their combined
weight behind the Cox amendment and are bringing politicians with
them, including Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer,
both New York Democrats. Whatever the final outcome, the wineries
are so pleased with their newfound friends in high tech that the
Wine Institute's DeLuca said he hopes to forge a formal alliance in
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   That's a view shared by Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat from the
Napa Valley who vainly fought the wine bill on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing the Cox amendment did was bring this
to the attention of the e-commerce community,'' Thompson said.
``There have been people who have tried to get them involved, but
they didn't for whatever reason. Maybe they didn't think it was a
real threat.''

   Military coups are rarities these days, so there was something
rather nostalgic about the events in Pakistan on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions went black, then martial music started up against a
background of patriotic pictures of strutting soldiers and, a few
hours later, a cross-looking man in a uniform appeared on the
screen and said that he had done it for the good of his country.
</P>
<P>
   General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's new military leader,
certainly has all the trappings of an old-fashioned villain; and he
was welcomed as such by condemnations and expressions of concern
from all over the world _ including from that champion of
democracy, China.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct to support democrats and condemn military coups is
correct, yet it is worth remembering that not all elected leaders
are democrats and not all generals are villains.
</P>
<P>
   It is regrettable that the army should be the instrument of
change in Pakistan, but the departure of the government of Nawaz
Sharif (after Sharif had tried to secure General Musharraf's
departure) may well bring an improvement to the country's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in fact it turns out that way depends entirely on what
General Musharraf does now. He has the power to make his country a
better place, or to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has been in such a mess for so long that it is tempting
to conclude that the country is doomed. It was created in the chaos
of partition, and torn since birth between conflicting cultures.
</P>
<P>
   It has a tribal social structure, an Islamic ideology and a
legal and political system that is British in origin. Islamic and
secular law battle each other. Tribal loyalties distort the
democratic process. Shia and Sunni Muslims shoot each other on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   From the west, Afghanistan's Taliban spill into Pakistan and
bolster the growing ranks of its fundamentalists. On the other side
of the country, the perpetual conflict with India over Kashmir
helps destabilize domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   In response to one mess or another, the generals have ousted
politicians before, in 1958, in 1971 and in 1977. Yet, whatever the
pressures, individuals can still make a difference, and Sharif and
Benazir Bhutto, who have both had two turns in power, certainly
have done.
</P>
<P>
   Their dismal performance has demeaned democracy and may have
blown Pakistan's chances of maturing into a decently governed
country for years to come. &QL;

   Sharif is especially culpable. He came to power in 1997 with a
huge majority, and with the freedom that comes from strength. He
could have used his power for good or ill. He chose to use it
badly, in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, Sharif fostered corruption. It is unclear how deeply
implicated he himself was: the former chief justice, Sajjad Ali
Shah, had agreed to hear corruption charges against Sharif, but was
sacked soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, as most Pakistanis would agree, their country
stinks. Corruption undermines not just the polity, but the economy
as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Pakistan's big problems is ordinary people's refusal to
pay their taxes. And one reason why ordinary people do not pay
their taxes is that they reckon the politicians will steal their
money.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Sharif used his considerable power to attack not just
his political opponents, but also the institutions essential to the
proper functioning of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   When he got into an argument with the chief justice in 1997,
mobs from Sharif's party surrounded the Supreme Court, and Shah was
sacked.
</P>
<P>
   When the press gave Sharif trouble, he turned on it, freezing
bank accounts, confiscating newsprint and even having an editor
imprisoned without charge for a month.
</P>
<P>
   His placemen were put in to run the police, turning the
guardians of law and order into the guardians of Sharif's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   And the army _ which had seen one chief of staff sacked after
criticizing Sharif's capricious use of power _ believed that the
same was about to happen to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my advice,'' General Musharraf told the nation in
the small hours of Oct. 13, ``they tried to interfere with the
armed forces, the last remaining viable institution in which all of
you take so much pride and look up to at all times for stability,
unity and integrity of your beloved country.'' &QL;

   It was not just the army that had turned against Sharif. So had
the voters. In a country that takes easily to the streets, there
were no demonstrations protesting against the army's action, and a
few supporting it. In itself, however, that is not very reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread rejoicing was the initial reaction when General Zia
booted out Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977. When Zia started jailing
people indiscriminately, and executed Bhutto, feelings changed. &QL;

<P>
   Pakistanis now need to know what their new general intends. The
good news is that, although the army itself is a conservative and
Islamic organization, General Musharraf is not a fundamentalist: he
is, say those who know him, a westernized liberal who is alarmed by
the spread of extremist views in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he reckoned to have political ambitions. He gave his
first broadcast to the nation, explaining his coup, in English, the
language of the elite; anybody who had been planning a political
career would have spoken in Urdu, the national language.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even unambitious westernized liberals can acquire a
dangerous taste for power. If General Musharraf is to persuade his
countrymen _ and the rest of the world _ that he has done the right
thing, he must quickly take three steps.
</P>
<P>
   First, he needs to reassure India that he plans no new
aggression. The Indian government _ and the American one, which
negotiated the peace between India and Pakistan in July _ is
concerned that Pakistan's withdrawal of troops from Kashmir was the
principal bone of contention between the army and Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   It has expressed ``grave concern'' and placed its army on high
alert along the border. Unless General Musharraf makes it clear
that he has no wish to renew the conflict, the subcontinent could
move back to the brink of war. Nowadays that could mean nuclear
war.
</P>
<P>
   Second, General Musharraf needs to make it very clear, very
soon, that he is moving Pakistan towards democracy. He needs to set
up a caretaker government that would have two main jobs: to prepare
for a new set of elections and to clear up corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling corruption is the more difficult task, but it is
essential. Honesty and democracy go hand in hand. If politicians
are reasonably honest, people will support the institutions of
democracy; and if democracy works reasonably well, it will help
root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, General Musharraf needs to go back to his barracks and
keep quiet. If he has the sense to do that, he will go down in
history as one of the few Pakistani leaders who has done his
country a favor.
</P>
<P>
   If he tries to hold on to power, he will, in the long run, fail.
In that event, he might well bring his country down with him. &QL;

<P>
   Some people take numbers seriously. Indeed, we do. Ever since
August 1843, when our first editor promised his readers the
``statistics of the week,'' our articles have been peppered with
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent editor, in the 1950s, coined the word numeracy, to
describe a quality he valued. But numeracy is nothing without
accuracy _ and we, like other journalists, are not infallibly
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Wise readers, even of The Economist, should never forget that
there are lies, damned lies and statistics, and among the most
damnable are those relating to disasters, whether natural or
man-made.
</P>
<P>
   British readers may need little reminding of this. They have
just endured a week in which Britain's newspapers have revelled in
a dreadful train crash.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose almost minute by minute until, two days
after it had happened, ``at least 100'' were dead, according to one
tabloid, and ``it could be many more, even as high as 170.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times reckoned 70 had been killed and 100 more were missing.
No wonder, for the Sun, it was ``the worst peacetime disaster.'' We
ourselves said ``at least 70'' had died.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a week after the accident, the death toll had settled
at about 35 _ a fact that few newspapers reported in type so big
and bold as the sort they had been using a few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, we reported claims by the American State
Department that 100,000 people had been killed in Kosovo. We were
skeptical, but by the end of the war in June we had swallowed,
albeit with the weasel qualification of ``perhaps,'' the figure of
100,000 Kosovars dead at the hands of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Today few authorities put the correct number above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A similar downsizing is going on in East Timor, where mass
killings were widely reported to have been carried out by rampaging
militias. The rampaging took place, but the reports of the deaths
were a bit like Mark Twain's: exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations spokesman said this week, ``We've heard
horrendous stories for which there's not a shred of evidence... We
don't believe that people in their thousands have been killed and
their bodies buried or thrown in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fog of war, or of peacetime catastrophe, it is, of
course, impossible to know for certain how many people have died or
been hurt, yet readers want an estimate. So the word ``perhaps'' is
not always _ perhaps _ so weasel, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet journalists seldom reduce their estimates as time goes by.
The first figure _ ``as many as 100'' _ soon becomes ``about 100,''
and then ``at least 100'' and often then ``perhaps 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists want to promote their stories, editors their papers,
aid workers their agencies. Even government officials may want to
curry sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, the official toll in Turkey's earthquake was an
apparently precise 17,997. A day later it had dropped to the
equally precise figure of 12,514.
</P>
<P>
   This points to some rules for journalists, such as: treat the
claims of interested parties with suspicion, make clear that the
figure you accept is just an estimate and, if you are subsequently
proved wrong, own up to it.
</P>
<P>
   But readers too should beware _ of spurious accuracy, of
manifest inflation, and of journalists' persistent tendency to
exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the power of the press in general, when it comes to
killing people, the pen is truly mightier than the sword. &QL;

accuracy _ and we, like other journalists, are not infallibly
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Wise readers, even of The Economist, should never forget that
there are lies, damned lies and statistics, and among the most
damnable are those relating to disasters, whether natural or
man-made.
</P>
<P>
   British readers may need little reminding of this. They have
just endured a week in which Britain's newspapers have revelled in
a dreadful train crash.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose almost minute by minute until, two days
after it had happened, ``at least 100'' were dead, according to one
tabloid, and ``it could be many more, even as high as 170.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times reckoned 70 had been killed and 100 more were missing.
No wonder, for the Sun, it was ``the worst peacetime disaster.'' We
ourselves said ``at least 70'' had died.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a week after the accident, the death toll had settled
at about 35 _ a fact that few newspapers reported in type so big
and bold as the sort they had been using a few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, we reported claims by the American State
Department that 100,000 people had been killed in Kosovo. We were
skeptical, but by the end of the war in June we had swallowed,
albeit with the weasel qualification of ``perhaps,'' the figure of
100,000 Kosovars dead at the hands of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Today few authorities put the correct number above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A similar downsizing is going on in East Timor, where mass
killings were widely reported to have been carried out by rampaging
militias. The rampaging took place, but the reports of the deaths
were a bit like Mark Twain's: exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations spokesman said this week, ``We've heard
horrendous stories for which there's not a shred of evidence... We
don't believe that people in their thousands have been killed and
their bodies buried or thrown in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fog of war, or of peacetime catastrophe, it is, of
course, impossible to know for certain how many people have died or
been hurt, yet readers want an estimate. So the word ``perhaps'' is
not always _ perhaps _ so weasel, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet journalists seldom reduce their estimates as time goes by.
The first figure _ ``as many as 100'' _ soon becomes ``about 100,''
and then ``at least 100'' and often then ``perhaps 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists want to promote their stories, editors their papers,
aid workers their agencies. Even government officials may want to
curry sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, the official toll in Turkey's earthquake was an
apparently precise 17,997. A day later it had dropped to the
equally precise figure of 12,514.
</P>
<P>
   This points to some rules for journalists, such as: treat the
claims of interested parties with suspicion, make clear that the
figure you accept is just an estimate and, if you are subsequently
proved wrong, own up to it.
</P>
<P>
   But readers too should beware _ of spurious accuracy, of
manifest inflation, and of journalists' persistent tendency to
exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the power of the press in general, when it comes to
killing people, the pen is truly mightier than the sword. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty is a humiliation for the Clinton administration, a pyrrhic
victory for the Senate and a disaster for America's
foreign-policymaking process.
</P>
<P>
   It humiliates the president because this was a treaty he once
described as among the most important of his presidency. Part of
his legacy is now in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, victory revealed many senators to be more
interested in their partisan fight with the president than the
consequences of their actions in the world. And foreign policy has
been damaged because it is no longer possible to trust the
president's signature even on a nuclear treaty.
</P>
<P>
   This debacle resulted, in part, from a failure to cope with the
deep differences of opinion among American policymakers over the
CTBT.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argued that the treaty would make America
safer by hampering the efforts of Russia, China and others to
produce new, more threatening nuclear weapons and by strengthening
support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the main
anti-proliferation effort.
</P>
<P>
   The armed services liked the test ban because it would have left
America with the most up-to-date and powerful nuclear force in the
world. The past five chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
testified in the treaty's favor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Richard Lugar of Indiana, one of the most
respected internationalists in the Senate, argued that the treaty
simply would not work. ``I have little confidence that the
verification and enforcement provisions will dissuade other nations
from nuclear testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the treaty was pointless because it would do nothing
to stop the most dangerous nuclear states, North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And balancing the five chiefs of staff, six former secretaries
of defense said the CTBT would damage America's ability to keep its
warheads safe.
</P>
<P>
   Warheads last around 20 years. After that, they become less
reliable. ``We would be vulnerable to the effects of ageing,'' the
grandees argued, ``because we could not test...existing warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet reasonable though such reservations may sound, they played
only a background role in the treaty's death on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the leader of the Senate, originally brought the
vote to humiliate Clinton when he realized his colleagues would not
support the treaty. He allowed just one day of hearings _ hardly
evidence of a desire to thrash out the issues.
</P>
<P>
   He was even willing to do a deal with Democrats which would (for
a political price) have postponed the vote until after 2000,
keeping the treaty alive.
</P>
<P>
   This did not happen because a small number of senators who
wanted to kill the CTBT at any cost saw their chance and refused to
go along with the postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Senate's procedural rules, they were able to
force a division. The Senate duly voted 48-51 not to ratify the
treaty, splitting largely on party lines and falling far short of
the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   That there had been a military coup the day before in the
world's newest nuclear power, Pakistan, mattered not a jot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, in the aftermath of impeachment, the minimum level of
amity needed to work the system was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Clinton was as much to blame as the Senate. He
continually demanded a vote which he knew he could not win,
gambling that the Senate would cave in.
</P>
<P>
   He did virtually nothing to lobby for the treaty between the
time he signed it, in 1996, and last weekend, when most of his
national security team fanned out to drum up support on television.
By that time it was far too late.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was more than just partisanship as normal. Nuclear
policy has traditionally been a bipartisan matter.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the Senate has vetoed a nuclear treaty
(though in 1980 it forced President Carter to withdraw the second
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, SALT 2, after the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worryingly, the Senate vote is also the culmination of a pattern
of actions which point to creeping isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton failed to get ``fast-track'' authority to
negotiate trade agreements. Congress at first refused to back what
Republicans dubbed ``Clinton's war'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses voted this summer to cut the foreign-affairs budget
by 14 percent next year, which would make it impossible for America
to fulfill its commitments under the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been refusing to pay its dues to the
United Nations for so long that it may lose its vote in the General
Assembly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many senators no doubt had serious reservations about the
test-ban treaty. But some could not have cared less.
</P>
<P>
   The impact may not be felt immediately. The test-ban treaty
cannot enter into force anyway until 44 nuclear countries have
ratified it _ and it was nowhere near that number even before the
Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said America will continue to observe the moratorium
on nuclear testing. Still, it is hard to believe that a decision of
this magnitude will not have consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, the leaders of Britain, France, and Germany
appealed to the Senate to ratify the treaty, saying failure would
show that the United States is not serious about arms control.
</P>
<P>
   American opponents of the CTBT reply that America's nuclear
policy will now rest on American interests and power, not waffly
and unenforceable treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from this particular nuclear test is already
spreading. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is savoring his Sister Souljah moment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton dramatized his differences with the left
wing of the Democratic Party by condemning the rap singer and black
activist who had called for the murder of whites after the Los
Angeles riots.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush is signalling his credentials as a man of the center
by criticizing a group of people who have about the same level of
public respect: the Republican leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him? Congress is passing through a dreadful
period. The Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty shows not just President Bill Clinton but the Republican
leaders at their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Even for opponents of the test-ban treaty, including Bush, the
manner of its rejection _ largely to inflict political humiliation
on the president rather than to defend American nuclear security _
is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much partisan bickering is on display in the House, and
this time it touches Bush more directly.
</P>
<P>
   As with the test-ban treaty, the Republicans are seeking to
embarrass the president, rather than to agree upon a fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, says Majority Whip Tom DeLay, is to pass a series of
tough spending bills that the president will veto. Republicans will
then seek to blame him for shutting down the federal government and
for trying to spend the huge surplus generated by the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Republicans will probably get the blame, as they
did before, for shutting the government down if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that they themselves are planning to dip into the
surplus (just like every Congress since the year dot).
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that to achieve their spending cuts they are
resorting to budget gimmickry and tactics such as delaying payments
to the low-paid (an idea that earned the rebuke from Bush that the
party was ``seeking to balance the budget on the backs of the
poor'').
</P>
<P>
   This is a political game in which the aim is to blame the other
side when everything goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Such conflicts are becoming more and more common. They include
not only national and international matters, like the budget and
the test-ban treaty, but local concerns, such as the Senate's
controversial rejection of the appointment of Ronnie White as a
federal judge to the Missouri Supreme Court. (The decision was
connected with the local politics of the Senate race next year, and
has caused particular anger because White is the first black judge
proposed for the job.)
</P>
<P>
   All this is a reminder of how much partisan bitterness remains
in Congress after the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   And you might think that the popular distaste such shenanigans
create would damage Bush, who is the front-running nominee of the
party in charge of the mess on Capitol Hill. But in many ways, it
helps him by justifying his basic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   This is not (as in Clinton's case) the idea of splitting the
difference between the two parties and attracting the mushy center.
The Texas governor remains an unapologetic conservative. Despite
his criticism of the congressional Republicans, he agrees with them
on a number of basic issues such as tax cuts and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, his appeal is that of a problem-solver who promises to
sidestep the bickering of Washington and concentrate instead on
encouraging modest government action by the states, the counties
and the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hence his stress on the role of churches and ``faith-based
organizations'' in welfare reform. Hence too his praise of the
crime-reduction, welfare and education reforms of the states.
</P>
<P>
   So the notion that the congressional Republicans are petty and
vindictive does his electoral prospects no harm at all. If they are
more interested in slinging mud and attaching blame than passing
laws, so be it. He is above all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often my party has confused the need for limited
government with a disdain for government itself... our goal (should
be): a limited government, respected for doing a few things and
doing them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing congressional Republicans also defuses criticism
that Bush is a captive of the right. It enables him to appeal
beyond his party's core constituency, to the center, where
elections are won.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps him in the huge task of moving the Republicans away
from their radical conservatism of the mid-1990s towards his more
compassionate kind.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts him in a far better position than the Democrats'
front-runner, Al Gore. The vice-president has been forced by Bill
Bradley's powerful challenge to move away from the center and
scramble for the endorsement of the unions, which stand among the
more narrow-minded and divisive of the Democrats' constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Gore is looking a bit like a machine politician of the
old school, Bush is emerging, Clinton-like, as the candidate of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all that said, his strategy is not without risk. In
painting the Republicans in Congress as mean, he could harm their
chances of holding the House in next year's election (their
opinion-poll ratings are now even more abysmal than they were after
the impeachment debacle).
</P>
<P>
   A bigger risk is that, in appealing to the center, Bush could
lose support on the Republican right. Several of his rivals are
using his remarks to boost their appeal as the real conservative
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to beat the Democrats by sounding like
Clinton-Gore lite,'' said Steve Forbes. ``The more he speaks,''
said Rush Limbaugh, a talk-show host with a following among
conservative Republicans, ``the more troubled I am about his
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that at the moment Bush's money, his overwhelming
lead in national polls and the intense desire of Republicans to
back whoever can regain the White House will all incline activists
to swallow hard and back him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first states to vote for the presidential nominee _
Iowa and New Hampshire _ Bush's poll lead is much smaller than it
is nationally, and Forbes and John McCain are both running
respectable campaigns there. A further erosion of his support would
turn them into credible challengers.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unlikely that they could take the nomination away
from Bush. But they might well do enough to take away his aura of
inevitability. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is savoring his Sister Souljah moment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton dramatized his differences with the left
wing of the Democratic Party by condemning the rap singer and black
activist who had called for the murder of whites after the Los
Angeles riots.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush is signalling his credentials as a man of the center
by criticizing a group of people who have about the same level of
public respect: the Republican leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him? Congress is passing through a dreadful
period. The Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty shows not just President Bill Clinton but the Republican
leaders at their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Even for opponents of the test-ban treaty, including Bush, the
manner of its rejection _ largely to inflict political humiliation
on the president rather than to defend American nuclear security _
is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much partisan bickering is on display in the House, and
this time it touches Bush more directly.
</P>
<P>
   As with the test-ban treaty, the Republicans are seeking to
embarrass the president, rather than to agree upon a fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, says Majority Whip Tom DeLay, is to pass a series of
tough spending bills that the president will veto. Republicans will
then seek to blame him for shutting down the federal government and
for trying to spend the huge surplus generated by the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Republicans will probably get the blame, as they
did before, for shutting the government down if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that they themselves are planning to dip into the
surplus (just like every Congress since the year dot).
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that to achieve their spending cuts they are
resorting to budget gimmickry and tactics such as delaying payments
to the low-paid (an idea that earned the rebuke from Bush that the
party was ``seeking to balance the budget on the backs of the
poor'').
</P>
<P>
   This is a political game in which the aim is to blame the other
side when everything goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Such conflicts are becoming more and more common. They include
not only national and international matters, like the budget and
the test-ban treaty, but local concerns, such as the Senate's
controversial rejection of the appointment of Ronnie White as a
federal judge to the Missouri Supreme Court. (The decision was
connected with the local politics of the Senate race next year, and
has caused particular anger because White is the first black judge
proposed for the job.)
</P>
<P>
   All this is a reminder of how much partisan bitterness remains
in Congress after the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   And you might think that the popular distaste such shenanigans
create would damage Bush, who is the front-running nominee of the
party in charge of the mess on Capitol Hill. But in many ways, it
helps him by justifying his basic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   This is not (as in Clinton's case) the idea of splitting the
difference between the two parties and attracting the mushy center.
The Texas governor remains an unapologetic conservative. Despite
his criticism of the congressional Republicans, he agrees with them
on a number of basic issues such as tax cuts and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, his appeal is that of a problem-solver who promises to
sidestep the bickering of Washington and concentrate instead on
encouraging modest government action by the states, the counties
and the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hence his stress on the role of churches and ``faith-based
organizations'' in welfare reform. Hence too his praise of the
crime-reduction, welfare and education reforms of the states.
</P>
<P>
   So the notion that the congressional Republicans are petty and
vindictive does his electoral prospects no harm at all. If they are
more interested in slinging mud and attaching blame than passing
laws, so be it. He is above all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often my party has confused the need for limited
government with a disdain for government itself... our goal (should
be): a limited government, respected for doing a few things and
doing them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing congressional Republicans also defuses criticism
that Bush is a captive of the right. It enables him to appeal
beyond his party's core constituency, to the center, where
elections are won.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps him in the huge task of moving the Republicans away
from their radical conservatism of the mid-1990s towards his more
compassionate kind.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts him in a far better position than the Democrats'
front-runner, Al Gore. The vice-president has been forced by Bill
Bradley's powerful challenge to move away from the center and
scramble for the endorsement of the unions, which stand among the
more narrow-minded and divisive of the Democrats' constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Gore is looking a bit like a machine politician of the
old school, Bush is emerging, Clinton-like, as the candidate of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all that said, his strategy is not without risk. In
painting the Republicans in Congress as mean, he could harm their
chances of holding the House in next year's election (their
opinion-poll ratings are now even more abysmal than they were after
the impeachment debacle).

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a week it has been for Al Gore. On Oct. 6 the
vice-president cut the ribbons on his new offices in Nashville,
Tenn., seizing the chance to talk unwoodenly of his love for home
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, at a Democratic dinner in Iowa that just
happened to include his rival for the nomination, Bill Bradley, he
accused Bradley of cowardice to his face, and looked as if he had
rattled him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to crown it all, came the news on Oct. 13 that he had won
the endorsement of America's trade-union congress, the AFL-CIO, at
its convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a giant prize. The AFL-CIO has 13 million members; the
endorsement mobilizes the grass-roots efforts of those members on
behalf of Gore, and puts into his camp the 80 delegates the AFL-CIO
is expected to send to next summer's Democratic Party convention.
</P>
<P>
   It also slows down Bradley, who has been creeping level with
Gore in the latest Northeastern polls.
</P>
<P>
   Fully aware of the importance of this ``first primary,''
President Bill Clinton had pulled out all the stops on Gore's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He put in calls to the Food and Commercial Workers Union and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and even appeared
at a dinner to honor James Hoffa of the Teamsters, the closest
presidential brush with this sleaze-ridden union since Nixon's day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although the AFL-CIO's president, John Sweeney, had all but
announced the endorsement of Gore when he opened the convention,
the voice-vote at the end was not quite so straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's wooing, the Teamsters _ the largest union
among the 68 represented, with 1.4 million members _ ``respectfully
disagreed'' with the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said his union's members needed more information about the
candidates' positions on issues dear to labor, and wanted the vote
delayed. (It was, in fact, the earliest endorsement labor has ever
given to a candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   Another important union, the 800,000-member United Auto Workers,
also chose to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   This reluctance was seen as an expression of unhappiness with
Gore's support for the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
and for the proposed inclusion of China in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa was careful, however, to comment that the Teamster ``no''
vote was ``not a criticism of Gore nor an endorsement of Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Teamsters at the convention were less guarded. ``In the
South, we always say, `Don't wrap that pig, weigh it,''' said one
Kentucky member. ``And we'd like to have it weighed before it's
wrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the end, the ``Yes'' vote for Gore turned out to
be a full-throated roar.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement comes at a time when the unions are beginning to
recover some of their old power and influence after years of
decline. This year the AFL-CIO posted a net gain of about 200,000
new members after five straight years of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has concentrated on grass-roots organizing, and has
tried to recast labor's traditional hard-hat, white-man-only image
into a perception that the AFL-CIO embraces workers of every sort.
The ``Welcome'' banner in the convention hall displayed the word in
a dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization has far to go before it returns to full
strength. In the 1950s about 35 percent of the American work force
was represented by a union; today the figure is 14 percent, even
with this year's gain in members.
</P>
<P>
   A new study commissioned by the AFL-CIO has revealed that in the
fastest-growing sectors of the American economy, including hotels,
airlines, retailing and child-care, only about one in 20 workers is
subject to collective-bargaining agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor clearly fears a return to the anti-labor
platform of the Reagan-Bush years, which the AFL-CIO assumes will
again predominate if George W. Bush becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore does not have their full confidence, either, and he had
some soothing to do when he addressed the delegates after the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to support raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour
(amid the loud cheering that followed, some delegates might not
have heard him add ``phased in over a couple of years'');
encouraging employers to provide flexible work-time schedules for
working parents; creating subsidies and tax credits for
stay-at-home mothers, and establishing tax-deductible savings
accounts to pay for college and further education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore seemed well aware during his speech that while he
had received the AFL-CIO's endorsement, he has not yet captured
labor's love. ``I need more than your vote and your support,'' he
pleaded. ``I need your hearts.'' &QL;

   Only a few years ago Air France was bankrupt, Germany's
Lufthansa was going nowhere and British Airways (BA) vied with
Singapore Airlines for the title of the world's most profitable
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This week BA's share price slid close to Pounds3 ($5), less than
half its level in the summer of 1998. The cause of the latest
decline was an admission by a small, nimble rival, Virgin, that,
like BA, it was suffering from a price war over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think that the French and German carriers are
still enjoying good profits, whereas BA is heading for a loss in
the year ending next March of Pounds100 million-200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worryingly for BA, its rivals are pursuing
expansionist strategies diametrically opposed to its own. Both are
piling on capacity, revenue and profits; and Lufthansa is buying
airline-service businesses, such as catering and ground-handling,
with a view to dominating that part of the aviation business.
</P>
<P>
   BA, by contrast, is retreating to its core activities. The
problem is that the core looks pretty rotten.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks the BA board must vote on whether to
maintain its dividend as a signal of its confidence, or cut the
dividend to conserve cash. The credibility of the chief executive,
Bob Ayling, has been stretched since trouble hit a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the company that calls itself ``the world's
favorite airline?''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of its prosperity in the mid-1990s, BA brought in
an ambitious plan to cut Pounds1 billion off its Pounds8 billion
annual costs. So far it has found savings of about Pounds700
million; it hopes to hack out the other Pounds300 million by March.
</P>
<P>
   A cull of 1,000 middle managers should lop a further Pounds225
million off costs.
</P>
<P>
   This was proclaimed as a precautionary measure to prepare BA for
the next downturn, when price competition was bound to intensify.
BA also started to outsource as much as it could, getting rid of
such services as engineering, IT and catering.
</P>
<P>
   Its bosses talked of ``a virtual airline,'' one that
concentrated only on selling seats and operating flights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted approvingly that BA had been the first
international airline to emerge smiling from the 1990-91 slump,
thanks to similar prompt action. Yet despite all its hacking, BA is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One side-effect of the cost-cutting was a labor dispute in the
summer of 1997, when short-haul cabin crews went on strike to
protest against changes in their working patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption lasted nearly a month, losing the airline
valuable business-class passengers. Low staff morale and
indifferent service further tried the loyalty of these lucrative
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling's decision to replace the Union flag on BA tailfins with
ethnic art also went down badly with the pinstriped brigade; BA is
now putting a version of the flag back on again.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, such things can damage a brand. BA has had other
problems too. It misjudged the regulatory opposition to its
proposed merger with American Airlines; the plan eventually had to
be dropped. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, BA's international strategy was stalled for three
years as competitors streaked ahead. Although BA, AA and a handful
of other airlines now have a global alliance, called oneworld, it
is less well-established in the market than, say, Star (built
around Lufthansa, United Airlines, SAS and, from this week, All
Nippon Airways), which has been going for two-and-a-half years. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, BA's forays into the continental European market
via Deutsche BA and Air Liberte in France are losing money. Its
low-cost offshoot, Go, will have a hard time breaking into profit,
because of competition from other start-ups such as Ryanair and
EasyJet.
</P>
<P>
   These threats are hitting BA just as its most profitable market,
London to America, has turned sour. Faced with a big fall in Asian
business, many airlines switched their jumbos to the Atlantic,
where previously they might have used smaller wide-bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a 25 percent rise in capacity in the market
from which BA earns a big part of its profits, coming on top of a
slump in its other big market, Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing price war has cut revenues per seat over the
Atlantic by about 10 percent for the industry as a whole. For BA,
the strength of sterling has hurt as well, making London an
expensive destination for travellers and reducing the value of BA's
foreign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   BA's cost-cutting was a tactical response to all this and to a
much-predicted downturn, but it was soon to lead, somewhat
serendipitously, to a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it faced a Pounds6 billion investment decision, as
its aging fleet of 30 big Boeing 747s and Douglas DC-10s was due
for replacement. The ensuing analysis revealed that BA was selling
as many as 100 seats on every 400-seat jumbo at prices well below
average costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Light of Salomon Smith Barney, an investment
bank, it made sense to focus on profitable point-to-point business
and full-fare economy traffic, rather than boost market share with
transfer passengers flying on cheap tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the decision to buy smaller wide-body jets for long-haul
routes. The Boeing 777, being newer, is cheaper to run than the
jumbo and, with around 300 seats, it can be filled with premium and
full-fare economy passengers.
</P>
<P>
   From shrinking the aircraft, it was but a small step to
shrinking the airline. Last August Ayling spelled out his intention
to shift his focus gradually from cut-price leisure travellers to
the premium passengers from whom airlines make money.
</P>
<P>
   The route network will be pruned of unprofitable, short-haul
services to free up slots for more flights of smaller, 100-seater,
short-haul aircraft such as the Airbus 318s that BA ordered this
week.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, BA will drop flights to Basle and instead market
seats block-booked at wholesale prices on Crossair, a Swiss
airline.
</P>
<P>
   The risks in such a strategy start with the fear that BA is
handing business to its competitors, which will grow bigger and
gain enough efficiency to maintain profits even with low-margin
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that BA's unit costs are sure to rise. Tim
Coombs of Aviation Economics, a London-based consultancy,
calculates that, even with cost savings, BA's unit costs will rise
by 7 percent from present levels.
</P>
<P>
   If profits are to regain their levels of the mid-1990s, its
revenues need to rise by twice as much. This will not be easy with
today's overcapacity. Unless the surplus melts away over the
Atlantic, BA's new strategy will not pay off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 450-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,575) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In contrast to BA's retrenchment, Air France is adding capacity
at a rate of 12 percent a year. Last year the French carrier flew
to only 36 American cities; this year the number is 162, boosted
partly by new flights and partly by its alliances with Delta and
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Like BA, it is switching from jumbos to 777s to focus on more
frequent flights in smaller aircraft, always a lure to business
travellers. This expansion has helped Air France to increase
revenues on the Atlantic, against the trend. And it is cutting unit
costs.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, Air France is exploiting opportunities that it has
neglected for years. But its prospects are helped by having a hub
at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where there is room for expansion
after the opening of a third runway last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Heathrow or Amsterdam Schiphol, there is no strong local
opposition to more flights. Indeed, the airport plans to overtake
Heathrow in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Already the number of international connecting flights has risen
by 44 percent in the past year, as Air France has begun to connect
the day's long-haul and short-haul flights in six ``waves,'' which
group arrivals and departures so as to shorten passengers' transfer
times.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's strategy seems to be paying off. Even last year,
before BA ran into its recurring quarterly losses, the French
carrier had caught up with it in terms of operating margin, though
it trails Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   Did BA have an alternative to its risky course? No, says one BA
executive. ``Not unless we did what Rupert Murdoch did in the
1980s, taking on the unions, moving the Times to Wapping and
completely altering his cost base.''
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than trying to improve labor productivity further (up
nearly 60 percent since privatization in 1987), BA wants to improve
capital productivity with smaller jets, frequent services and a
focus on premium traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This is what airlines in America did in the past ten years when
they trimmed capacity, reinforced their hubs and drove up yields.
</P>
<P>
   Although BA's business class is weak, the airline is revamping
it and introducing innovative bed-seats ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``BA has to rebuild its presence in the long-haul business, and
the beds should do it,'' says Chris Tarry, of Commerzbank in
London. BA executives admit that they are ``betting everything'' on
the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe BA is ahead of the game, and other airlines, including Air
France and Lufthansa, are not ready for trouble ahead. Yet the
danger is that business-class and full-economy fares keep falling,
eroding the high margins on which BA's entire strategy is founded.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the world's favorite airline could become the
world's shakiest. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   At the height of its prosperity in the mid-1990s, BA brought in
an ambitious plan to cut Pounds1 billion off its Pounds8 billion
annual costs. So far it has found savings of about Pounds700
million; it hopes to hack out the other Pounds300 million by March.
</P>
<P>
   A cull of 1,000 middle managers should lop a further Pounds225
million off costs.
</P>
<P>
   This was proclaimed as a precautionary measure to prepare BA for
the next downturn, when price competition was bound to intensify.
BA also started to outsource as much as it could, getting rid of
such services as engineering, IT and catering.
</P>
<P>
   Its bosses talked of ``a virtual airline,'' one that
concentrated only on selling seats and operating flights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted approvingly that BA had been the first
international airline to emerge smiling from the 1990-91 slump,
thanks to similar prompt action. Yet despite all its hacking, BA is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One side-effect of the cost-cutting was a labor dispute in the
summer of 1997, when short-haul cabin crews went on strike to
protest against changes in their working patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption lasted nearly a month, losing the airline
valuable business-class passengers. Low staff morale and
indifferent service further tried the loyalty of these lucrative
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling's decision to replace the Union flag on BA tailfins with
ethnic art also went down badly with the pinstriped brigade; BA is
now putting a version of the flag back on again.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, such things can damage a brand. BA has had other
problems too. It misjudged the regulatory opposition to its
proposed merger with American Airlines; the plan eventually had to
be dropped. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, BA's international strategy was stalled for three
years as competitors streaked ahead. Although BA, AA and a handful
of other airlines now have a global alliance, called oneworld, it
is less well-established in the market than, say, Star (built
around Lufthansa, United Airlines, SAS and, from this week, All
Nippon Airways), which has been going for two-and-a-half years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, BA's forays into the continental European market
via Deutsche BA and Air Liberte in France are losing money. Its
low-cost offshoot, Go, will have a hard time breaking into profit,
because of competition from other start-ups such as Ryanair and
EasyJet.
</P>
<P>
   These threats are hitting BA just as its most profitable market,
London to America, has turned sour. Faced with a big fall in Asian
business, many airlines switched their jumbos to the Atlantic,
where previously they might have used smaller wide-bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a 25 percent rise in capacity in the market
from which BA earns a big part of its profits, coming on top of a
slump in its other big market, Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing price war has cut revenues per seat over the
Atlantic by about 10 percent for the industry as a whole. For BA,
the strength of sterling has hurt as well, making London an
expensive destination for travellers and reducing the value of BA's
foreign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   BA's cost-cutting was a tactical response to all this and to a
much-predicted downturn, but it was soon to lead, somewhat
serendipitously, to a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it faced a Pounds6 billion investment decision, as
its aging fleet of 30 big Boeing 747s and Douglas DC-10s was due
for replacement. The ensuing analysis revealed that BA was selling
as many as 100 seats on every 400-seat jumbo at prices well below
average costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Light of Salomon Smith Barney, an investment
bank, it made sense to focus on profitable point-to-point business
and full-fare economy traffic, rather than boost market share with
transfer passengers flying on cheap tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the decision to buy smaller wide-body jets for long-haul
routes. The Boeing 777, being newer, is cheaper to run than the
jumbo and, with around 300 seats, it can be filled with premium and
full-fare economy passengers.
</P>
<P>
   From shrinking the aircraft, it was but a small step to
shrinking the airline. Last August Ayling spelled out his intention
to shift his focus gradually from cut-price leisure travellers to
the premium passengers from whom airlines make money.
</P>
<P>
   The route network will be pruned of unprofitable, short-haul
services to free up slots for more flights of smaller, 100-seater,
short-haul aircraft such as the Airbus 318s that BA ordered this
week.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, BA will drop flights to Basle and instead market
seats block-booked at wholesale prices on Crossair, a Swiss
airline.
</P>
<P>
   The risks in such a strategy start with the fear that BA is
handing business to its competitors, which will grow bigger and
gain enough efficiency to maintain profits even with low-margin
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that BA's unit costs are sure to rise. Tim
Coombs of Aviation Economics, a London-based consultancy,
calculates that, even with cost savings, BA's unit costs will rise
by 7 percent from present levels.
</P>
<P>
   If profits are to regain their levels of the mid-1990s, its
revenues need to rise by twice as much. This will not be easy with
today's overcapacity. Unless the surplus melts away over the
Atlantic, BA's new strategy will not pay off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 450-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,575) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In contrast to BA's retrenchment, Air France is adding capacity
at a rate of 12 percent a year. Last year the French carrier flew
to only 36 American cities; this year the number is 162, boosted
partly by new flights and partly by its alliances with Delta and
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Like BA, it is switching from jumbos to 777s to focus on more
frequent flights in smaller aircraft, always a lure to business
travellers. This expansion has helped Air France to increase
revenues on the Atlantic, against the trend. And it is cutting unit
costs.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, Air France is exploiting opportunities that it has
neglected for years. But its prospects are helped by having a hub
at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where there is room for expansion
after the opening of a third runway last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Heathrow or Amsterdam Schiphol, there is no strong local
opposition to more flights. Indeed, the airport plans to overtake
Heathrow in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Already the number of international connecting flights has risen
by 44 percent in the past year, as Air France has begun to connect
the day's long-haul and short-haul flights in six ``waves,'' which
group arrivals and departures so as to shorten passengers' transfer
times.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's strategy seems to be paying off. Even last year,
before BA ran into its recurring quarterly losses, the French
carrier had caught up with it in terms of operating margin, though
it trails Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   Did BA have an alternative to its risky course? No, says one BA
executive. ``Not unless we did what Rupert Murdoch did in the
1980s, taking on the unions, moving the Times to Wapping and
completely altering his cost base.''
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than trying to improve labor productivity further (up
nearly 60 percent since privatization in 1987), BA wants to improve
capital productivity with smaller jets, frequent services and a
focus on premium traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This is what airlines in America did in the past ten years when
they trimmed capacity, reinforced their hubs and drove up yields.
</P>
<P>
   Although BA's business class is weak, the airline is revamping
it and introducing innovative bed-seats ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``BA has to rebuild its presence in the long-haul business, and
the beds should do it,'' says Chris Tarry, of Commerzbank in
London. BA executives admit that they are ``betting everything'' on
the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe BA is ahead of the game, and other airlines, including Air
France and Lufthansa, are not ready for trouble ahead. Yet the
danger is that business-class and full-economy fares keep falling,
eroding the high margins on which BA's entire strategy is founded.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the world's favorite airline could become the
world's shakiest. &QL;

   LEXINGTON AND OMAHA, NEB. _ A decade ago Lexington, Neb., was a
dying town. In the late 1980s, a big tractor factory shut down;
almost overnight, the population fell and businesses started
closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a ghost town,'' recalls Marty Romero, who ran a
homeless shelter then. ``The biggest landowner was a bank. People
would just walk into the bank and leave their keys on the
president's desk.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990 IBP, a big slaughterhouse (meat-packing plant, to
Americans) moved into the space where the old tractor factory had
been. With that, Lexington managed to turn itself round.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to the Interstate highway nearby and the arrival
of new workers, it is teeming with life.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plant's employees _ mostly Latinos, plus a few
Asians _ have legal working papers. But some do not, and that is
why towns like Lexington have caught the attention of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
   Lexington is one of many towns in Nebraska, Iowa and other Great
Plains states revived in part by immigrants flocking to work in
slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, of course, the plants would prefer to
have legal workers. But unemployment is low in these parts _
between 1 percent and 2 percent recently _ and the going wage for
the plants' bloody, dangerous jobs is well below what was paid 20
years ago. So most jobs go to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry say that some employers look the other
way when they hire workers of uncertain provenance, but even those
who stick by the rules can be fooled by the spread of increasingly
convincing fake documents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the INS rooted out undocumented workers by raiding
factories, sometimes under cover of darkness and with the help of
heavily armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   But this year INS officials devised a gentler new way of doing
things, called Operation Vanguard. Under Vanguard, INS officials
check employees' work documents regularly and compare them with
federal databases to work out which employees are legal and which
are not.
</P>
<P>
   The agency switched to this approach because it seemed likely to
be both cheaper and more humane; but it is also a real nuisance for
companies that use undocumented workers. Raids are no longer a
once-every-several-years cost of doing business; the companies are
now subject to constant scrutiny and checking.
</P>
<P>
   When the first round of Vanguard investigations started in
Nebraska earlier this year, it pored over 24,000 employee records
and found 4,441 discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   Each employee with a discrepancy was asked to meet INS
officials. About three-quarters disappeared rather than show up for
the interview. That did not make them fugitives from the INS; it
only meant that they would lose their jobs _ the agency's
objective.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other 1,000-odd managed to explain their
circumstances to the INS's satisfaction. Only 34 came to the
interview but failed to justify themselves; they were arrested, and
set on a path towards deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency thought Vanguard a success. So did the meat-packing
companies _ but with much less enthusiasm. With a quarter of their
workers gone, many businesses faced serious disruption. Worried
businessmen prevailed upon their elected representatives to
complain about the agency's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking reversal, politicians who had once favored a stern
approach to immigration suddenly found themselves asking for
greater leniency, fearing that their local economies could be
damaged by strict INS enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Odder still, business leaders sought out alliances with
advocates for Latino causes, with whom they had long tangled over
such matters as working conditions for plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``An IBP vice-president called asking for my help in fighting
Vanguard,'' says Father Damian Zuerlein of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a
predominantly Latino Catholic church in Omaha. ``When that
happened, I asked myself, `What planet am I on?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two groups' concerns are not precisely aligned. The big
issue for meat-packing executives and the cattlemen who supply them
is that Vanguard seems to single out their industry and their part
of the country, particularly at a time when low commodity prices
have already been hurting ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect INS to run the agency based on what's best for
Nebraska agriculture, but I also don't expect them to go out of
their way to come up with a program that kicks agriculture right in
the shins,'' says Ben Nelson, a former governor who opposed
Vanguard before leaving office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some worried Latinos fear that many innocents
will be caught up in the dragnet, and that too little legal and
humanitarian assistance is available locally to handle so much
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Latino advocates note that an operation like Vanguard
is more damaging to undocumented workers with established families;
footloose single workers can move on easily, whereas families hit
hard by Vanguard may have to uproot children in school or spouses
or relatives in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Local activists and INS officials agree that the agency needs to
put extra effort into the human-services part of its job, rather
than just enforcement. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the INS office in Omaha, 200 people a day show up seeking
help, far more than the small staff can handle. The modest waiting
room is usually filled; those farther back in the queue have to
stand outside for hours.
</P>
<P>
   If extra officers were assigned to paperwork duty, it might mean
fewer discrepancies and delays. Yet the last time Congress
increased the INS's staff in Nebraska, it merely added several
dozen enforcement officers assigned to handle illegal immigrants
who were picked up by state troopers along Interstate 80. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the lobbying by businessmen, Latino activists and
politicians appears to have fallen on deaf ears. INS officials in
Omaha and Washington are convinced that Vanguard-style operations
are the way to go; they are now attempting to bring the concept to
other states, beginning with Iowa, as well as to other professions,
including restaurant and hotel work, in order to squeeze the kinds
of job that are thought to employ the largest number of illegal
workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are also planning fresh investigations every three months
in states where Vanguard has already been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that the INS can apply simultaneous
pressure in enough states and enough industries to remove all job
options from undocumented workers. But, so far, nothing else has
worked nearly so well. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It looks like a simple decision. One of the perks of
being a politician is that you watch sports events from the best
seats. At the moment, the voters of New York are interested in only
one thing: the possibility of a ``subway'' World Series between the
city's two baseball teams, the Yankees and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   So what better way for a New York politician to mix business
with pleasure than turning up to watch your team? Unfortunately,
for Hillary Rodham Clinton, nothing comes easy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived in New York
but wants to become its senator, suddenly revealed that she had
always been a Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this was completely true, not remotely an attempt to
pander to voters and certainly not a joust at Rudy Giuliani, Mrs.
Clinton's likely rival for the Senate seat, whose most notably
human characteristic is his devotion to the ``Bronx Bombers.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, very few people (including, hurtfully, the Yankee players)
seem to believe Mrs. Clinton. Hence the prospect that if she makes
her way to Yankee Stadium (a picture of which she has of course
lovingly clutched through the long years in Chicago, Arkansas and
Washington), she may just possibly be laughed at by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That will not worry the fan in Mrs. Clinton, who will presumably
be too thrilled at finally seeing her heroes in action to notice;
but it might not be so successful for the prospective senator (let
alone the aide who advised her to pledge her troth so publicly).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if she stays away, she can count on Giuliani
pointing it out repeatedly. Chancing her luck with the fans may be
Mrs. Clinton's best chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Koch, a former mayor, has already advised her to ``take a
Yankee cap and bow to the crowd, and act as though they were
cheers.'' And they could surprise her.
</P>
<P>
   When a far less endearing British politician, David Mellor,
gingerly turned up at a Chelsea football game after the disclosure
of an adulterous affair, he was cheered to the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   But then Mellor was a Chelsea regular, who, according to the
tabloids, had donned the team's strip when in bed with his
mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mrs. Clinton simply chose the wrong team. The
demographics were right.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that the Yankees, who are the current world
champions (as in other American sports, ``world'' being redefined
to mean the United States and Canada), have around twice as many
fans in the city as the much less predictable Mets; in fact they
are the most followed team in the country. But they are also, for
much the same reasons, probably the most hated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees' ``real fans,'' just like their
equivalents at Manchester United, are always griping at the
out-of-towners who latch on to the team's success, wear the cap
without knowing the players' names, and drive up seat prices.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton had gone for the Mets, she would still have had
to counter a few disbelieving cynics, but she would have looked
brave and original _ and offended very few voters (Yankees fans
don't hate the Mets; they pity them).
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets might just win, which would be one in the eye for
Giuliani. But Mrs. Clinton's heart seems to have ruled her head. As
was once observed by Yogi Berra, the Yankee oracle, baseball is
only ``90 percent mental, the other half is physical.'' &QL;

   &UR; SCORPION TONGUES: The Irresistible History of Gossip in
American Politics &LR;  By Gail Collins. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
This compendium of political gossip includes both famous rumors
from the 19th and 20th centuries and others that were long
forgotten. Not surprisingly, there's a fat chapter on the Clinton
years, pre- and post-Monica. The result is ``a breezy, timely
history,'' Wendy Kaminer wrote in The New York Times Book Review
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENED GROUND: Selected Poems, 1966-1996 &LR;  By Seamus Heaney.
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $15. This generous selection, which
includes works from the poet's 12 previous volumes, a few
uncollected poems and his 1995 Nobel Prize address, digs deep in
the ground of memory and is dense with the bodies of the ancient
and recent dead. Much of the verse is suffused with domestic detail
but is shadowed by the Troubles in Northern Ireland. ``Heaney has
assembled a collection with a satisfying heft and more than enough
variety of subject and style to delineate the shape of a long and
constantly evolving career,'' Edward Mendelson wrote in 1998. ``It
eloquently confirms his status as the most skillful and profound
poet writing in English today.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRAND CENTRAL WINTER: Stories From the Street &LR;  By Lee Stringer.
Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95. The author is a former
crack addict and homeless man who started writing after he found a
pencil in a crawl space beneath Grand Central Terminal in New York.
His unflinching memoir gives readers ``the long view of New York's
underbelly, born of pain but delivered with style and heart,'' John
Jiler wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; SLEEPING WITH THE MAYOR: A True Story &LR;  (Hungry Mind, $15),
John Jiler chronicles New York's attempts to deal with the homeless
issue during the last decade, and his own interaction with a ragtag
group of protesters camped in City Hall Park during the
administration of Mayor Edward Koch. He ``offers a persuasive
portrait not only of a tough problem but of the larger society
surrounding it,'' Joyce Purnick wrote in 1997. ``He humanizes, but
refuses to romanticize, the characters he came to know.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION &LR;  By Gore Vidal. Harvest/Harcourt
Brace, $13. This novel about a young science prodigy summoned to
the Smithsonian to help a coven of physicists tinker with nuclear
fission and the space-time continuum is really an excuse to play
with the what-ifs of American history. Last year the reviewer
Christopher Benfey praised Vidal's ``eye for the freaks and foibles
of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HERSELF SURPRISED &LR;  By Joyce Cary. New York Review, $12.95. The
robust heroine of this English novel, the first of a trilogy being
reissued by the publisher, is Sara Monday, a former housekeeper who
marries a rich gentleman and eventually winds up in prison. She is
``warm and real, and twice as natural as most women in fiction,''
Helen B. Parker wrote in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO BE A PILGRIM &LR;  ($14.95) is narrated by one of Sara's lovers,
a pious, tight-fisted lawyer who reflects on his long life and lost
opportunities as he approaches death. In 1949 the reviewer George
D. Painter found the novel to have ``actuality like Defoe, humor
and energy like Dickens, hand-made prose and improvisation like
both these great writers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HORSE'S MOUTH &LR;  ($12.95) is the picaresque autobiography of
another of Sara's lovers, the irrepressible Gulley Jimson, a
raucous, bandy-legged artist who thumbs his nose at society in
grand style. ``Cary is a careful, even a profound, thinker'' whose
deeply moral tales are layered by the common themes of Protestant
grace and the conflict between individual freedom and authority,
Donald Barr wrote in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MARITIME ALBUM: 100 Photographs and Their Stories &LR;  By John
Szarkowski and Richard Benson. Mariners' Museum and Yale
University, $24.95. This collection of images from 1859 to 1956 is
less a book about maritime history than a book that uses
photographs of shipyards, harbors and cockpits to fire the
imagination. The result is ``a moving testimonial to the exaltation
and apprehension of human interaction with the sea,'' W. Jeffrey
Bolster wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY &LR;  By Fay Weldon. Atlantic Monthly, $13. This
wry novel about a circle of women who start a feminist publishing
company in 1970s London follows their quest for happiness and asks
the question: Was the women's movement worth all the fuss? ``Though
Weldon's satirical breeziness can be infuriating, it's always
entertaining,'' Elizabeth Gleick wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in
Colonial Africa &LR;  By Adam Hochschild. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $15.
From 1885 to 1908, King Leopold II of Belgium directed a brutal
campaign of forced labor to plunder what is now the Democratic
Republic of Congo. This account of the frenzy of murder and
profiteering _ and of the figures, white and black, who rose up
against it _ is ``a superb synoptic history of European misdemeanor
in central Africa,'' Jeremy Harding wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A LEXICON OF TERROR: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture &LR;  By
Marguerite Feitlowitz. Oxford University, $16.95. This grim book
focuses on the victims and crimes of the ``dirty war'' waged by the
military junta in Argentina. The result is ``a well-researched,
intimate and perceptive portrait'' of a nation still struggling
with its past, Tina Rosenberg wrote in 1998.

   A Bird's Eye View, for a Price
</P>
<P>
   Back-yard sunbathers and lovers on the beach have nothing to
fear. The resolution of the world's first private spy camera, now
orbiting 400 miles overhead, is insufficiently sharp to spot
individuals. But it can see much else, including buildings, roads,
pipelines, bridges, tanks, ships, jets and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Space Imaging Inc., the private company in Thornton, Colo., that
built the spacecraft, made public the world's first commercial
image from space whose sharpness rivals those of military spies in
the sky. A closeup of Washington showed the intersection of 14th
and Constitution, cars and buses plainly visible.
</P>
<P>
   More orbiting snoops are on the way. Analysts see the
development as a boon for geographers and urban planners and a
potential nightmare for states and people with something to hide.

   No Pain, Plenty of Gain
</P>
<P>
   Natural childbirth, drug-free in all its pain and glory, may be
losing its cachet. More and more women are saying no to labor pain
and yes to drugs, proffered by doctors with clever new ways of
giving spinal and epidural anesthetics that numb the pelvis but
still let a woman walk around.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of natural childbirth demurred, warning of risks from
the drugs and lamenting the high-tech meddling with a rite of
passage. Some women do still want the full experience of labor and
the satisfaction of getting through it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of others scoff at noble suffering. At an
anesthesiology conference in Dallas, doctors reported that from
1981 to 1997 there was a tripling of the percentage of women in
labor at large hospitals who had spinal or epidural injections,
from 22 percent to 66 percent.

   Gore Lands Endorsement Of AFL-CIO
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore won the biggest plum awarded so far in
the presidential campaign: the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. With
Gore slipping in the polls and his rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley,
rising, Gore supporters hoped the labor federation's endorsement
would reverse the vice president's slide.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats hope the endorsement will do more for Gore than
it did for the last Democratic presidential candidate who received
such an early show of support from organized labor: former Vice
President Walter Mondale, who was swamped by President Ronald
Reagan in the 1984 election.

   California Sets Nurse Levels
</P>
<P>
   Managed health care began in California, and now the nation's
toughest health care regulations are springing up there, too. Gov.
Gray Davis signed a bill that will make California the first state
to require fixed staffing ratios of nurses to patients in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Strongly backed by the state nurses' union _ and opposed by the
hospital industry _ the bill does not set specific ratios, but
leaves it up to the state Department of Health Services to set
staffing levels for various kinds of care.

   Daily Cell Growth in Brain
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at Princeton University have found that the brain
generates a daily stream of new cells that migrate into the
cerebral cortex, the area that harbors higher intellectual
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's too early to tell what the cells are doing, they
could be part of the brain's mechanism for learning. The discovery
was made in monkeys and is expected to prove true of people too. It
caps a series of findings that refute the longstanding view that no
new cells are formed in the adult brain.

   New Clinton Plan for Forests
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Clinton came to office, he's been at war
with timber companies, paper producers and others who want to
preserve and expand their use of the National Forest System to
harvest timber, dig mines and build roads. In his latest battle,
Clinton announced a plan that would ultimately put 40 million or
more acres of federal forests into a new category that would
prevent roads from being built _ and make them off-limits to
commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
   Western legislators were outraged, particularly because the
White House is using an administrative procedure that bypasses
Congress. But Clinton is betting that Republicans won't want to
take on the forest issue in an election year.

   Fessing Up to Smoking Risks
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos., hoping to recast its corporate image and
make it more difficult for new smokers to sue, unveiled a new
Internet site that acknowledges the scientific evidence that
cigarette smoking is addictive and causes disease. But the company,
which had disputed such evidence for decades, soon confronted new
demands that it submit to federal regulation of cigarettes and
nicotine in light of its acknowledgment.

   Suharto Case Is Dropped
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians were angry but few were really surprised. After
32 years in power during which he and his six powerful children
amassed fortunes, President Suharto saw his year-long corruption
case dropped for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week an electoral assembly will choose a new Indonesian
president. Most people believe that only with a new government that
is not beholden to Suharto will there be any chance of a real
investigation and possible trial.

   A Lean Fighting Machine
</P>
<P>
   After years of resisting change, the Army announced plans to
create lighter, more mobile combat brigades.
</P>
<P>
   With armored vehicles instead of tanks, the brigades would be
more agile than the ``heavy'' armored brigades, able to go anywhere
in 96 hours while still having more punch than light infantry or
airborne divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The new brigades are part of a ``major transformation'' planned
by the Army over the next decade, but restructuring efforts have
stalled in the past.

   Colt's to Curb Gun Sales
</P>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Co. is retreating from its 144-year-old
retail revolver business and will offer only boutique versions of
the Colt .45, the gun that won the West. Colt's, based in West
Hartford, Conn., had been struggling financially even before it and
other gun makers were hit with lawsuits from 28 cities and counties
seeking to recover costs from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company plans to focus on sales to the military and to
collectors, and to lay off as many as 200 of its 700 workers.

   No Charges in Ramsey Case
</P>
<P>
   After 13 months of grand jury testimony, the Boulder County,
Colo., district attorney decided there was not enough evidence to
indict anyone in the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty
pageant queen who was found dead in her parents' home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer
remains free and undetected,'' the parents, John and Patsy, said in
a statement, even though they had been the only real suspects in
the case.

   Big Move by Con Ed
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison Inc. of New York announced plans to acquire
Northeast Utilities, the largest utility in New England, for $3.29
billion in a deal that could bring cheaper power to its customers.
Con Edison will become one of the largest utilities in the nation,
with a base of 4.7 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies want to be mainly distributors and not generators
of electricity. They are also preparing to sell electricity,
natural gas and other services to customers throughout the
Northeast as states open up their utilities to competition.

to ``the fundamental principle that all disaster victims, whether
the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a right to
professional assistance given as quickly and as efficiently as

</P>
<P>
   The group of more than 2,000 medical professionals in 80
countries was formed in 1968 and often defied governments by
intervening without being asked.

   Among the places its volunteers have provided humanitarian aid

   Babbitt Inquiry Ends

<P>
   After an 18-month investigation, an independent counsel said
there was insufficient evidence to warrant charges against Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt or anyone else involved in a decision by
the Interior Department in 1995 to deny a permit for an Indian
gambling project in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation centered on whether Babbitt lied in
congressional testimony about the decision. The statement by the
prosecutor vindicated Babbitt, a former Arizona governor.

   Drug Arrests in Colombia
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said Colombia had broken that country's
biggest cocaine-trafficking ring with the arrest of the ring's
leader and other traffickers. Colombian officials pledged to
extradite the suspects back to the United States for trial. In
1991, Colombia stopped extraditions following a wave of killings
and bombings by drug cartels, but now officials are vowing to renew
the process even as they brace for possible violence.

   Clintons Get New Home Loan
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have secured new
financing for their house in Chappaqua, N.Y. They now have a
30-year $1.36 million mortgage, with interest for three years at
7.5 percent and afterward at 2.75 percentage points over the
one-year Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
   With the loan from PNC Mortgage, the First Couple no longer
needs the backing of Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fund-raiser
whose offer of financial help had been criticized by Republicans
who said the arrangement smacked of special treatment.

the presidential campaign: the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. With
Gore slipping in the polls and his rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley,
rising, Gore supporters hoped the labor federation's endorsement
would reverse the vice president's slide.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats hope the endorsement will do more for Gore than
it did for the last Democratic presidential candidate who received
such an early show of support from organized labor: former Vice
President Walter Mondale, who was swamped by President Ronald
Reagan in the 1984 election.

   California Sets Nurse Levels
</P>
<P>
   Managed health care began in California, and now the nation's
toughest health care regulations are springing up there, too. Gov.
Gray Davis signed a bill that will make California the first state
to require fixed staffing ratios of nurses to patients in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Strongly backed by the state nurses' union _ and opposed by the
hospital industry _ the bill does not set specific ratios, but
leaves it up to the state Department of Health Services to set
staffing levels for various kinds of care.

   Daily Cell Growth in Brain
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at Princeton University have found that the brain
generates a daily stream of new cells that migrate into the
cerebral cortex, the area that harbors higher intellectual
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's too early to tell what the cells are doing, they
could be part of the brain's mechanism for learning. The discovery
was made in monkeys and is expected to prove true of people too. It
caps a series of findings that refute the longstanding view that no
new cells are formed in the adult brain.

   New Clinton Plan for Forests
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Clinton came to office, he's been at war
with timber companies, paper producers and others who want to
preserve and expand their use of the National Forest System to
harvest timber, dig mines and build roads. In his latest battle,
Clinton announced a plan that would ultimately put 40 million or
more acres of federal forests into a new category that would
prevent roads from being built _ and make them off-limits to
commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
   Western legislators were outraged, particularly because the
White House is using an administrative procedure that bypasses
Congress. But Clinton is betting that Republicans won't want to
take on the forest issue in an election year.

   Fessing Up to Smoking Risks
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos., hoping to recast its corporate image and
make it more difficult for new smokers to sue, unveiled a new
Internet site that acknowledges the scientific evidence that
cigarette smoking is addictive and causes disease. But the company,
which had disputed such evidence for decades, soon confronted new
demands that it submit to federal regulation of cigarettes and
nicotine in light of its acknowledgment.

   Suharto Case Is Dropped
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesians were angry but few were really surprised. After
32 years in power during which he and his six powerful children
amassed fortunes, President Suharto saw his year-long corruption
case dropped for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week an electoral assembly will choose a new Indonesian
president. Most people believe that only with a new government that
is not beholden to Suharto will there be any chance of a real
investigation and possible trial.

   A Lean Fighting Machine
</P>
<P>
   After years of resisting change, the Army announced plans to
create lighter, more mobile combat brigades.
</P>
<P>
   With armored vehicles instead of tanks, the brigades would be
more agile than the ``heavy'' armored brigades, able to go anywhere
in 96 hours while still having more punch than light infantry or
airborne divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The new brigades are part of a ``major transformation'' planned
by the Army over the next decade, but restructuring efforts have
stalled in the past.

   Colt's to Curb Gun Sales
</P>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Co. is retreating from its 144-year-old
retail revolver business and will offer only boutique versions of
the Colt .45, the gun that won the West. Colt's, based in West
Hartford, Conn., had been struggling financially even before it and
other gun makers were hit with lawsuits from 28 cities and counties
seeking to recover costs from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company plans to focus on sales to the military and to
collectors, and to lay off as many as 200 of its 700 workers.

   No Charges in Ramsey Case
</P>
<P>
   After 13 months of grand jury testimony, the Boulder County,
Colo., district attorney decided there was not enough evidence to
indict anyone in the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty
pageant queen who was found dead in her parents' home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer
remains free and undetected,'' the parents, John and Patsy, said in
a statement, even though they had been the only real suspects in
the case.

   Big Move by Con Ed
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison Inc. of New York announced plans to acquire
Northeast Utilities, the largest utility in New England, for $3.29
billion in a deal that could bring cheaper power to its customers.
Con Edison will become one of the largest utilities in the nation,
with a base of 4.7 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies want to be mainly distributors and not generators
of electricity. They are also preparing to sell electricity,
natural gas and other services to customers throughout the
Northeast as states open up their utilities to competition.

   A Nobel for Doctors' Group
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders won the Nobel Peace Prize for adhering
to ``the fundamental principle that all disaster victims, whether
the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a right to
professional assistance given as quickly and as efficiently as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of more than 2,000 medical professionals in 80
countries was formed in 1968 and often defied governments by
intervening without being asked.
</P>
<P>
   Among the places its volunteers have provided humanitarian aid
are Nicaragua, Vietnam, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Kosovo and
East Timor.

   Babbitt Inquiry Ends
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-month investigation, an independent counsel said
there was insufficient evidence to warrant charges against Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt or anyone else involved in a decision by
the Interior Department in 1995 to deny a permit for an Indian
gambling project in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation centered on whether Babbitt lied in
congressional testimony about the decision. The statement by the
prosecutor vindicated Babbitt, a former Arizona governor.

   Drug Arrests in Colombia
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said Colombia had broken that country's
biggest cocaine-trafficking ring with the arrest of the ring's
leader and other traffickers. Colombian officials pledged to
extradite the suspects back to the United States for trial. In
1991, Colombia stopped extraditions following a wave of killings
and bombings by drug cartels, but now officials are vowing to renew
the process even as they brace for possible violence.

   Clintons Get New Home Loan
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have secured new
financing for their house in Chappaqua, N.Y. They now have a
30-year $1.36 million mortgage, with interest for three years at
7.5 percent and afterward at 2.75 percentage points over the
one-year Treasury bill rate.

<P>
   With the loan from PNC Mortgage, the First Couple no longer
needs the backing of Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fund-raiser
whose offer of financial help had been criticized by Republicans
who said the arrangement smacked of special treatment.

<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN-REVIEW (United Nations) _ India and Pakistan seem
to be taking starkly divergent paths into the next political era.
India anointed another democratically elected government and
Pakistan applauded yet another military coup. But beneath the
surface, are these events as diametrically different as they seem?
These two countries may be demonstrating a common trend. In their
search for identity, a new generation of Pakistanis and Indians are
unveiling the face of home-grown, grass-roots politics _ pure
Indian and pure Pakistani, more inward-looking, less cosmopolitan.
And, perhaps, more likely to misunderstand each other. By Barbara
Crossette. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   RACE-HEALTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the implications of a
new study showing that even when blacks seek medical care for an
early stage of lung cancer, they were less likely than whites to
get the best treatment, surgery. As a result, the blacks were more
likely to die from their disease. By Denise Grady. (moved in `a'

<P>
   LEWINSKY-LINGO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although the epilogue to the
impeachment scandal is still being written, there are constant
reminders of our long national nightmare in Americans' every day
speech. Every era has its popular terms, but the impeachment
scandal _ with its overheated mixture of sex, lies, power and
audiotapes _ provided a bounty of material for Americans searching
for phrases that fit the cynical weariness that permeates so much
of the nation's popular culture. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   TRIANGULATION-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is no higher
praise from Bill Clinton's devotees than when they applaud George
W. Bush for proving himself a deft triangulator. Bush says he does
not know what the word means. The definition, according to Dick
Morris, the former Clinton adviser who invented the idea, is: `A
process of taking the best ideas from each party and combining them
into a coherent policy and program. It is not just splitting the
difference, but molding a creative synthesis which rises above the
doctrine of either party.' By Richard Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERWARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The addition of an
information-war fighting capability to the U.S. military arsenal is
a watershed event, both adding cyberwar to the quiver of the
Pentagon and at the same time taking a set of military activities
which have for the last two decades largely been confined to the
black secret side of the military and intelligence world and making
them part of the military chain of command. At the same time the
new military command is a public acknowledgment that as the worlds
most technically advanced nation, the U.S. is also potentially the
most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   MATHEMATICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is no Nobel prize in
metaphysics. But if there were, it would surely go to the thinker
who could solve the stubborn mystery of why mathematics so often
mirrors the workings of the physical world. Rocks arc through the
sky in parabolic trajectories, planets swing in ellipses around the
sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles move according to the
mathematics of quantum mechanics. A look at the work of Nobel
winners Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRON-COSTSBENEFITS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Amid a study of whether
or not to breach four huge hydroelectric dams on the Snake River in
eastern Washington, which would restore 140 miles of it to a wild,
free-flowing condition and could revitalize endangered salmon runs,
government economists are adding a factor known as ``existence
value'' to their list of costs and benefits. Aside from calculating
the proposal's effects on jobs, electric bills and shipping rates,
the government is now hoping to assign a dollar value to Americans'
knowledge that a piece of their wilderness might be regained. By
Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTSWRITING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The 1920s were the golden age
of sportswriting. A handful of talented and ambitious journalists
who found other paths to literary fame blocked began to notice, as
indeed their editors had already noticed, that an increasingly
affluent middle class was responding more to the exploits of Jack
Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what would come to be
known as ``hard'' news stories. Within three decades, TV would make
athletes smaller than life. Rarely again would sportswriters see
athletes in such mythic proportions, outlined against skies
blue-gray or any other color. By Allen Barra. (moved in `a' and `s'

</P>
<P>
   NOBEL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Nobel Prize awards have often
provoked second-guessing. With the current Nobel season just
wrapping up, it's worth noting the critical reaction to some of the
disputed honorees of the past.

   U.S.-WORLD-ROLE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The test ban treaty was
only the latest of a number of divisive issues in the capital that
share a common subtext: An argument not over whether the U.S. is
strong, but over how it should use its power. Should it strut the
global beach alone, or leverage that power by accepting restraints
on its freedom to act? It is that debate that has eroded the
``vital center'' that President Clinton talks about so often in his
laments about the disappearance of bipartisanship in foreign
affairs. By David E. Sanger. WITH GRAPHIC.

WHITE DOCTORS, BLACK PATIENTS: NOT A SIMPLE CASE OF HEALTH RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DENISE GRADY  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even sickness and death are beyond the reach of racial
inequality. Blacks are more likely than whites to suffer from
dangerous conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney
failure. Black women are more likely than whites to die in
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most troubling news came last week: A study found
that blacks were less likely than whites to get surgery for early
stages of lung cancer and, as a result, more likely to die from a
potentially curable disease.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a straightforward case of racism, though, may
well be something more complicated: a breakdown in doctor-patient
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The study is forcing doctors to confront what they may be doing
wrong: For some reason, their black patients are not getting the
message that surgery could save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy of suspicion may further cloud already emotionally
fraught doctor-patient consultations. For example, black doctors
say many black patients remain wary of the health care system
because of the notorious Tuskegee study, in which black men with
syphilis were left untreated for 40 years so that government
doctors could study the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new lung cancer study, based on the records of nearly 11,000
patients 65 and over, appeared in the New England Journal of
Medicine. The authors, led by Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, concluded that the
inequity in treatment seemed to stem from race itself. They found
no significant differences between the blacks and whites the study
tracked, in socioeconomic status, insurance, complicating illnesses
or access to care.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with the racial disparities in care for blacks
and whites, many doctors have tended to blame the patient. Blacks
are prone to obesity, smoke more, and seek medical treatment later
_ often because they also tend to be poorer than whites, with lower
rates of health insurance and less ability to pay doctors' fees.
</P>
<P>
   But the study ruled out the usual excuses. That raised two
unpalatable possibilities. Either doctors were not recommending
surgery to blacks as often as to whites, or blacks, for some
mystifying reason, were more likely to say no to lifesaving
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Freeman, a cancer surgeon and president of North
General Hospital in New York's Harlem, dismissed the thought of
blatant racism. ``I'm not cynical enough to think people would
purposely deny someone treatment,'' said Freeman, who is black. ``I
have more faith in humanity than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites dominate the medical profession; only 4 percent of
doctors are black. In some cases white doctors and black patients
may have trouble talking to each other not just because of color,
or the undercurrent of tension between the races, but also because
of differences in social class, education, background and
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Talmadge King, chief of medical services at San Francisco
General Hospital, said: ``We have tended to blame the patient, but
I think the problem is on the side of the doctors. It's up to us to
understand where the patient is and learn how to communicate so
they can understand what we're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that if a doctor did not understand a patient's
background and presented information about cancer in a way that the
patient had trouble accepting, the patient might reject the advice
or might take so long to finally accept it that in the meantime the
cancer might advance and become inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ticking time bomb,'' he said. ``Medical schools are
now getting very interested in training doctors to be culturally
sensitive and to understand diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   If a treatment is presented to a black patient as experimental,
King said, ``that can be really detrimental in your communication''
because it raises the specter of Tuskegee in some minds. In the
study, 400 black men were left untreated from 1932 until 1972, even
though penicillin came into use to cure syphilis during the 1940s.
And experimental treatment does come up in discussions about lung
cancer, because if the disease progresses after surgery, patients
may need chemotherapy and are often advised that they may benefit
from studies of new drugs. If that is not carefully explained by
someone the patient trusts, the patient may become alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bach's study did not detect socioeonomic differences
between the black and white patients, Freeman said the records,
from the Medicare program for people 65 and older, may not have
been detailed enough to pick up such differences. Studies have
shown that blacks have less wealth _ fewer assets and savings, for
instance _ than whites even when their incomes are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, he said, ``are more often people with other priorities,
survival priorities like food, clothing and shelter, and avoiding
of crime, and then you tell them they also have cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may have no idea what such patients' lives are like or
what sort of help they would need to rearrange their lives to deal
with a major illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Freeman said, ``I've practiced surgery in the black
community for 32 years, and it is a rare, rare patient who will not
follow my advice. So I am discomforted by somebody saying `We
couldn't communicate, we tried to tell this person and couldn't get
it over.' I say that's a poor excuse. If you take the time and say
it in the right way, the poorest people will understand. Poor black
people in Harlem are very reliable when you communicate to them in
an appropriate way. You can't throw up your hands and say, `I can't
communicate with these people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Telling someone he or she has cancer and must have all or part
of a lung cut out is a wrenching and arduous task. When the doctor
and patient come from different worlds and the patient seems
reluctant to listen, it may be easier for doctors to tell
themselves they have done their jobs and let the patient walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to, how much, really, fundamentally, deep down
in yourself do you value the other person?'' Freeman said. ``If you
were dealing with somebody who looked exactly like you look, would
you take it another step?''

potentially curable disease.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a straightforward case of racism, though, may
well be something more complicated: a breakdown in doctor-patient
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The study is forcing doctors to confront what they may be doing
wrong: For some reason, their black patients are not getting the
message that surgery could save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy of suspicion may further cloud already emotionally
fraught doctor-patient consultations. For example, black doctors
say many black patients remain wary of the health care system
because of the notorious Tuskegee study, in which black men with
syphilis were left untreated for 40 years so that government
doctors could study the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new lung cancer study, based on the records of nearly 11,000
patients 65 and over, appeared in the New England Journal of
Medicine. The authors, led by Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, concluded that the
inequity in treatment seemed to stem from race itself. They found
no significant differences between the blacks and whites the study
tracked, in socioeconomic status, insurance, complicating illnesses
or access to care.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with the racial disparities in care for blacks
and whites, many doctors have tended to blame the patient. Blacks
are prone to obesity, smoke more, and seek medical treatment later
_ often because they also tend to be poorer than whites, with lower
rates of health insurance and less ability to pay doctors' fees.
</P>
<P>
   But the study ruled out the usual excuses. That raised two
unpalatable possibilities. Either doctors were not recommending
surgery to blacks as often as to whites, or blacks, for some
mystifying reason, were more likely to say no to lifesaving
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Freeman, a cancer surgeon and president of North
General Hospital in New York's Harlem, dismissed the thought of
blatant racism. ``I'm not cynical enough to think people would
purposely deny someone treatment,'' said Freeman, who is black. ``I
have more faith in humanity than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites dominate the medical profession; only 4 percent of
doctors are black. In some cases white doctors and black patients
may have trouble talking to each other not just because of color,
or the undercurrent of tension between the races, but also because
of differences in social class, education, background and
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Talmadge King, chief of medical services at San Francisco
General Hospital, said: ``We have tended to blame the patient, but
I think the problem is on the side of the doctors. It's up to us to
understand where the patient is and learn how to communicate so
they can understand what we're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that if a doctor did not understand a patient's
background and presented information about cancer in a way that the
patient had trouble accepting, the patient might reject the advice
or might take so long to finally accept it that in the meantime the
cancer might advance and become inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ticking time bomb,'' he said. ``Medical schools are
now getting very interested in training doctors to be culturally
sensitive and to understand diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   If a treatment is presented to a black patient as experimental,
King said, ``that can be really detrimental in your communication''
because it raises the specter of Tuskegee in some minds. In the
study, 400 black men were left untreated from 1932 until 1972, even
though penicillin came into use to cure syphilis during the 1940s.
And experimental treatment does come up in discussions about lung
cancer, because if the disease progresses after surgery, patients
may need chemotherapy and are often advised that they may benefit
from studies of new drugs. If that is not carefully explained by
someone the patient trusts, the patient may become alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bach's study did not detect socioeonomic differences
between the black and white patients, Freeman said the records,
from the Medicare program for people 65 and older, may not have
been detailed enough to pick up such differences. Studies have
shown that blacks have less wealth _ fewer assets and savings, for
instance _ than whites even when their incomes are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, he said, ``are more often people with other priorities,
survival priorities like food, clothing and shelter, and avoiding
of crime, and then you tell them they also have cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may have no idea what such patients' lives are like or
what sort of help they would need to rearrange their lives to deal
with a major illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Freeman said, ``I've practiced surgery in the black
community for 32 years, and it is a rare, rare patient who will not
follow my advice. So I am discomforted by somebody saying `We
couldn't communicate, we tried to tell this person and couldn't get
it over.' I say that's a poor excuse. If you take the time and say
it in the right way, the poorest people will understand. Poor black
people in Harlem are very reliable when you communicate to them in
an appropriate way. You can't throw up your hands and say, `I can't
communicate with these people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Telling someone he or she has cancer and must have all or part
of a lung cut out is a wrenching and arduous task. When the doctor
and patient come from different worlds and the patient seems
reluctant to listen, it may be easier for doctors to tell
themselves they have done their jobs and let the patient walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to, how much, really, fundamentally, deep down
in yourself do you value the other person?'' Freeman said. ``If you
were dealing with somebody who looked exactly like you look, would
you take it another step?''

   It took Grantland Rice three tries to get it right. In 1922,
writing about the Notre Dame-Army football game, he led with
``Notre Dame's attack is more like a modern war offensive than
anything we have seen.'' Nope. In 1923, again covering the Irish
and the Cadets, he began, ``Brazil can cheer about its coffee ...''
Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1924 _ almost exactly 75 years ago _ he finally
found the right rhythm and imagery and struck hard and clean as a
Knute Rockne-coached linebacker:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against a blue, gray October sky, the Four Horsemen
rode again. In dramatic lore, they were known as Famine,
Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are only aliases. Their
real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They
formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another
fighting Army team was swept over the precipice of the Polo Grounds
this afternoon. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In a few swift, polished sentences _ and with an assist from a
photograph _ Rice changed his own life, his profession, the course
of college football and the character of American leisure culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were the golden age of myth-making sports journalism.
A handful of talented writers who found other paths to literary
fame blocked began to notice, as indeed their editors had already
noticed, that a rising middle class was responding more to the
exploits of Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what
would come to be known as ``hard'' news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico of the New York Daily News, who later went on to
better things, admitted to being a ``Gee-Whizzer'' _ one of the new
breed of sportswriter who wrote in ``the most florid and exciting
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice, writing for the New York Herald Tribune, was the
king of the Gee-Whizzers. As Murray Sperber wrote in ``Shake Down
the Thunder,'' his history of Notre Dame football, ``Each day he
flung out metaphors about athletes and sports events and, indeed,
some of his words stick to the American psyche. ... The vast
majority of his figures of speech quickly disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines that stick with us today were a happy combination of
skill and circumstance. To begin with, Rice had picked the right
sport, and the right team. The rise of football _ and college
football in the 1920s and for several decades thereafter  &UR; was &LR; 
football _ coincided with the rise of the sports pages and the
Gee-Whizzers. Some historians have called the explosion of football
popularity a newspaper phenomenon. College football had been a
small-time sport with local appeal at best before near-hysterical
coverage made it a national game in the rank of, if not actually on
a par with, big-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber relates an incident between the Notre Dame football
coach, Knute Rockne, and a journalist that makes the point: ``Tut,
tut, Rockne,'' the writer responded when the Notre Dame coach
complained about the paper's football coverage. ``You know damn
well that were it not for newspapers, not five hundred people would
be interested in Notre Dame, Nebraska, or the whole kit and
kaboodle of football teams.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was true before 1924, it wasn't true afterward.
</P>
<P>
   College football and sports pages combined to make each other,
and both helped to create Grantland Rice. He got a big boost, too,
from the night editor of the Herald Tribune, who loved the lead for
Rice's 1924 Notre Dame-Army story and put it on the front page of
the Sunday morning paper. Other papers picked up the story.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hardly anyone remembers the actual game. It wasn't even
the biggest story in college football that day: Red Grange had
scored five touchdowns against Michigan, and most papers, including
Rice's own, considered that game the bigger event. Notre Dame's
13-7 victory wasn't even its most impressive win that season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, a friend of Knute Rockne, correctly perceived that
Notre Dame would be the football team with national appeal, and for
thousands of fans that Sunday, and for millions more who would read
the story in weeks and months and, as it appeared in anthologies of
sportswriting, years to come, that fall Saturday would forever be
the day the Four Horsemen rode.
</P>
<P>
   George Strickler, a Notre Dame press assistant, gave Rice his
inspiration when he likened the Irish backfield to the stars of the
Rudolph Valentino film ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
Rice took the ball, as it were, from there. Strickler then picked
it up and ran it for another score when he messaged back to South
Bend, Ind., for a photographer to shoot the Notre Dame backfield on
horses. It was a cute picture, but for many it only seemed to
diminish the myth _ in truth, the four heroes looked a little
uneasy on horses. The picture was not worth the thousand words Rice
wrote. Actually, it didn't measure up to the 12 words of his lead
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against blue, gray October sky ...'' What was Rice's
vantage point? Looking up from the turf of the football field? It
must have seemed so to newspaper readers all over the country to
whom the Four Horsemen must have seemed larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Within three decades, TV would make athletes smaller than life.
Rarely again would sportswriters see athletes in such mythic (and
unrealistic) proportions. The athletes would be as great or greater
than Dempsey, Ruth, Jones and the Four Horsemen, but fans would
watch them over and over on TV and have no need of poetic writing
to make their feats seem memorable.

NOBELS THAT SOME FELT WEREN'T SO DYNAMITE

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Alfred Nobel stipulated that the recipients of his namesake
prizes ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.''
But often the annual prize announcements provoke second-guessing.
Detractors have long pointed out, for example, that Freud never won
the Nobel for medicine, and that Chekhov, Proust and Conrad are
among the giants who never won for literature.
</P>
<P>
   Even when an award goes to the right person, it may be for the
wrong _ or at least arguable _ reasons. Such is the case with
Albert Einstein, whose 1921 physics Nobel was bestowed not for the
theory of relativity but for his work on the photoelectric effect.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nobel season just wrapping up, it's worth noting the
critical reaction to some of the disputed honorees of the past. The
envelopes, please.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The most disputed science Nobel was probably
the 1918 chemistry award to Fritz Haber, who helped develop poison
gas for Germany during World War I. Morris Goran noted in ``The
Story of Fritz Haber'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1967) how the
scientist's record haunted him right after the war and later when
he won the prize:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Believing himself a potential war criminal, Haber grew a beard
as a disguise and went to Switzerland for several weeks; he was
afraid of being delivered to the Allies. ... Others remembered that
in Karlsruhe (Institute of Technology) Haber had been depicted as
Hamlet in a graveyard, leaning on a gas cylinder and holding a
skull. The caricature, drawn in 1904 at a Christmas party, was
intended to show his interest in gas chemistry and his diversion to
dramatics. Soon after the war it was subject to different
interpretation. Even many years later, an Allied scientist chose to
point out Haber in a photograph by drawing a gas mask over his
face. ...
</P>
<P>
   In November 1919, he was awarded the 1918 chemistry prize.
Frenchmen offered awards declined the honor rather than be in the
same company with their former enemy. One French scholar accused
the Swedes ... of manufacturing gas masks for the German army.
Another called Haber ``morally unfit for the honor and material
benefits of a Nobel prize.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Today, the lobotomy is largely discredited
and rarely performed. Yet Egas Moniz of Portugal shared the 1949
Nobel in medicine for pioneering this radical brain operation,
which was supposed to cure certain mental illnesses. In ``Great and
Desperate Cures'' (Basic Books, 1986), Elliot Valenstein described
how Moniz's very first monograph about the procedure, published in
1936, revealed it as dangerously suspect:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The psychological symptoms produced by the surgery were apathy,
akinesia (retarded movement or inertia), loss of initiative
(present in one half of Moniz's patients; and in a few, prolonged),
catatonic ``attitude,'' mutism (... observed in 11 of the 20
cases), negativism, disturbed orientation in space and time,
puerility (one patient carried around and rocked dolls she had
made), kleptomania and abnormal hunger sensations (experienced by
one-quarter of the patients). In all, a serious list of
psychological problems, except that Moniz insisted that these
symptoms lasted no more than several weeks. With absolutely no
evidence, he asserted unequivocally that the operation did not
impair intelligence or memory.
</P>
<P>
   While Moniz stated in his monograph that the apathy was
transient, Sobral Cid, in his critical comments made in Paris in
1937, insisted that the apathy might last much longer and could be
permanent. Moniz ... later seemed to confirm this criticism when in
the same year he reported modifying his initial surgical procedure,
as ``two or three of the patients in my first series have remained
somewhat apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In 1982, Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala wrote
``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' a memoir of her country's agonizing civil
war; she won the Peace Prize 10 years later. But in ``Rigoberta
Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans'' (Westview, 1999),
David Stoll found that she had fabricated much of her story. At the
time the prize was announced, the truth was troublesome enough:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Her selection revived the debate over the parameters of
acceptability, because her 1982 testament clearly advocates
violence. Invoking the Bible for precedents, Rigoberta makes
Molotov cocktails, endorses bomb threats as a tactic, and debates
whether to execute an old woman suspected of being an informer
(fortunately for the future Peace laureate, the suspect is judged
innocent). A related objection was that Rigoberta still belonged to
the guerrilla movement. The Nobel committee sidestepped this issue
by deciding that it was unknowable. Instead the committee
attributed political violence in Guatemala to ethnic tension. The
committee also avoided any explicit reference to the book that made
Rigoberta famous, as if to evade any doubts on that score.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)These days, academics have few kind words
for the 1938 literature laureate Pearl Buck, whose ability to
produce best-sellers is seen as proof of her middlebrow status.
Peter Conn reported in ``Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography''
(Cambridge University, 1996) that this low regard, tinged with
misogyny, was already entrenched when she won the prize:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A day after the announcement, for example, critic Norman Holmes
Pearson grumbled that ``this woman, Pearl Buck, was given the Nobel
Prize for literature. Do they intend to make it as hammish (sic) as
the Pulitzer award? Thank heavens I have seen no one who has taken
it seriously and none of the great congratulatory articles which
followed a similar award to O'Neill last winter. Mrs. Buck's only
comment seemed to be, `I was terribly surprised' _ nuts to her, say
I, I think that was putting it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's derisory views echoed those of most of the country's
leading cultural opinion makers. Pearl's Asian subjects, her prose
style, her gender, and her tremendous popularity offended virtually
every one of the constituencies that divided up the literary 1930s.
Marxists, Agrarians, Chicago formalists, New York intellectuals,
literary nationalists and New Humanists had little enough in
common, but they could all agree that Pearl Buck had no place in
any of their creeds and canons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pearl's selection for the Nobel Prize became a
shorthand proof of the Swedish Academy's bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The most ``ig-Nobel'' literature winner was
surely 1920s Knut Hamsun of Norway, who became a Nazi collaborator.
Robert Ferguson's ``Enigma: The Life of Knut Hamsun'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1987) offers this example of Hamsun's devotion to
the Third Reich:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Back in Norway after the trip he looked for a way to express his
appreciation of (Joseph) Goebbels' courtesy in receiving him. He
puzzled for some time over the most appropriate gift, and finally
hit on the idea of presenting the doctor with the medal which he
received for the Nobel Prize in 1920. On 17 June he sent it, along
with a short explanatory note:
</P>
<P>
   ``To Minister of the Reich Dr. Goebbels. I wish to thank you for
all the kindness you showed to me on my recent trip to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot thank you enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobel founded his Award as a reward for the most `idealistic'
writing during the recent past. I know of no one, Minister, who has
so idealistically and tirelessly written and preached the case for
Europe, and for mankind, year in and year out, as yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for sending you my medal. It is a quite useless
thing for you, but I have nothing else to send.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)So if you've been unfairly passed over for a
Nobel, take heart. Leo Tolstoy lost the first Literature prize in
1901 to the forgettable Rene F. A. Sully Prudhomme. Tolstoy wrote
philosophically:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I was very pleased to learn that the Nobel Prize was not given
to me. First, because it spared me the great problem of disposing
of the money, which, like all money, can lead only to evil, in my
view; and second, because it has given me the honor and great
pleasure of receiving such expressions of sympathy from so many
highly esteemed although unknown persons.

   Alfred Nobel stipulated that the recipients of his namesake
prizes ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.''
But often the annual prize announcements provoke second-guessing.
Detractors have long pointed out, for example, that Freud never won
the Nobel for medicine, and that Chekhov, Proust and Conrad are
among the giants who never won for literature.
</P>
<P>
   Even when an award goes to the right person, it may be for the
wrong _ or at least arguable _ reasons. Such is the case with
Albert Einstein, whose 1921 physics Nobel was bestowed not for the
theory of relativity but for his work on the photoelectric effect.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nobel season just wrapping up, it's worth noting the
critical reaction to some of the disputed honorees of the past. The
envelopes, please.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The most disputed science Nobel was probably
the 1918 chemistry award to Fritz Haber, who helped develop poison
gas for Germany during World War I. Morris Goran noted in ``The
Story of Fritz Haber'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1967) how the
scientist's record haunted him right after the war and later when
he won the prize:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Believing himself a potential war criminal, Haber grew a beard
as a disguise and went to Switzerland for several weeks; he was
afraid of being delivered to the Allies. ... Others remembered that
in Karlsruhe (Institute of Technology) Haber had been depicted as
Hamlet in a graveyard, leaning on a gas cylinder and holding a
skull. The caricature, drawn in 1904 at a Christmas party, was
intended to show his interest in gas chemistry and his diversion to
dramatics. Soon after the war it was subject to different
interpretation. Even many years later, an Allied scientist chose to
point out Haber in a photograph by drawing a gas mask over his
face. ...
</P>
<P>
   In November 1919, he was awarded the 1918 chemistry prize.
Frenchmen offered awards declined the honor rather than be in the
same company with their former enemy. One French scholar accused
the Swedes ... of manufacturing gas masks for the German army.
Another called Haber ``morally unfit for the honor and material
benefits of a Nobel prize.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Today, the lobotomy is largely discredited
and rarely performed. Yet Egas Moniz of Portugal shared the 1949
Nobel in medicine for pioneering this radical brain operation,
which was supposed to cure certain mental illnesses. In ``Great and
Desperate Cures'' (Basic Books, 1986), Elliot Valenstein described
how Moniz's very first monograph about the procedure, published in
1936, revealed it as dangerously suspect:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The psychological symptoms produced by the surgery were apathy,
akinesia (retarded movement or inertia), loss of initiative
(present in one half of Moniz's patients; and in a few, prolonged),
catatonic ``attitude,'' mutism (... observed in 11 of the 20
cases), negativism, disturbed orientation in space and time,
puerility (one patient carried around and rocked dolls she had
made), kleptomania and abnormal hunger sensations (experienced by
one-quarter of the patients). In all, a serious list of
psychological problems, except that Moniz insisted that these
symptoms lasted no more than several weeks. With absolutely no
evidence, he asserted unequivocally that the operation did not
impair intelligence or memory.
</P>
<P>
   While Moniz stated in his monograph that the apathy was
transient, Sobral Cid, in his critical comments made in Paris in
1937, insisted that the apathy might last much longer and could be
permanent. Moniz ... later seemed to confirm this criticism when in
the same year he reported modifying his initial surgical procedure,
as ``two or three of the patients in my first series have remained
somewhat apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In 1982, Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala wrote
``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' a memoir of her country's agonizing civil
war; she won the Peace Prize 10 years later. But in ``Rigoberta
Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans'' (Westview, 1999),
David Stoll found that she had fabricated much of her story. At the
time the prize was announced, the truth was troublesome enough:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Her selection revived the debate over the parameters of
acceptability, because her 1982 testament clearly advocates
violence. Invoking the Bible for precedents, Rigoberta makes
Molotov cocktails, endorses bomb threats as a tactic, and debates
whether to execute an old woman suspected of being an informer
(fortunately for the future Peace laureate, the suspect is judged
innocent). A related objection was that Rigoberta still belonged to
the guerrilla movement. The Nobel committee sidestepped this issue
by deciding that it was unknowable. Instead the committee
attributed political violence in Guatemala to ethnic tension. The
committee also avoided any explicit reference to the book that made
Rigoberta famous, as if to evade any doubts on that score.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)These days, academics have few kind words
for the 1938 literature laureate Pearl Buck, whose ability to
produce best-sellers is seen as proof of her middlebrow status.
Peter Conn reported in ``Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography''
(Cambridge University, 1996) that this low regard, tinged with
misogyny, was already entrenched when she won the prize:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A day after the announcement, for example, critic Norman Holmes
Pearson grumbled that ``this woman, Pearl Buck, was given the Nobel
Prize for literature. Do they intend to make it as hammish (sic) as
the Pulitzer award? Thank heavens I have seen no one who has taken
it seriously and none of the great congratulatory articles which
followed a similar award to O'Neill last winter. Mrs. Buck's only
comment seemed to be, `I was terribly surprised' _ nuts to her, say
I, I think that was putting it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's derisory views echoed those of most of the country's
leading cultural opinion makers. Pearl's Asian subjects, her prose
style, her gender, and her tremendous popularity offended virtually
every one of the constituencies that divided up the literary 1930s.
Marxists, Agrarians, Chicago formalists, New York intellectuals,
literary nationalists and New Humanists had little enough in
common, but they could all agree that Pearl Buck had no place in
any of their creeds and canons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pearl's selection for the Nobel Prize became a
shorthand proof of the Swedish Academy's bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The most ``ig-Nobel'' literature winner was
surely 1920s Knut Hamsun of Norway, who became a Nazi collaborator.
Robert Ferguson's ``Enigma: The Life of Knut Hamsun'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1987) offers this example of Hamsun's devotion to
the Third Reich:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Back in Norway after the trip he looked for a way to express his
appreciation of (Joseph) Goebbels' courtesy in receiving him. He
puzzled for some time over the most appropriate gift, and finally
hit on the idea of presenting the doctor with the medal which he
received for the Nobel Prize in 1920. On 17 June he sent it, along
with a short explanatory note:
</P>
<P>
   ``To Minister of the Reich Dr. Goebbels. I wish to thank you for
all the kindness you showed to me on my recent trip to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot thank you enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobel founded his Award as a reward for the most `idealistic'
writing during the recent past. I know of no one, Minister, who has
so idealistically and tirelessly written and preached the case for
Europe, and for mankind, year in and year out, as yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for sending you my medal. It is a quite useless
thing for you, but I have nothing else to send.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)So if you've been unfairly passed over for a
Nobel, take heart. Leo Tolstoy lost the first Literature prize in
1901 to the forgettable Rene F. A. Sully Prudhomme. Tolstoy wrote
philosophically:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I was very pleased to learn that the Nobel Prize was not given
to me. First, because it spared me the great problem of disposing
of the money, which, like all money, can lead only to evil, in my
view; and second, because it has given me the honor and great
pleasure of receiving such expressions of sympathy from so many
highly esteemed although unknown persons.

   SEATTLE _ It sounds like a philosophical cousin to the age-old
question of whether a tree falling in the forest makes a sound if
no one is around to hear it. In this case, though, federal
officials are seeking to add an economic variable to the puzzle:
just how much is it worth to  &UR; you &LR;  to know that a once-dammed river
is running wild again _ even if you never visit it?
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a major study of whether or not to breach four
huge hydroelectric dams on the Snake River in eastern Washington,
economists with the Army Corps of Engineers are adding a factor
known as ``existence value'' to their list of costs and benefits of
the contentious proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams would restore 140 miles of the lower Snake to
its wild, free-flowing condition and would, many biologists argue,
stand a good chance of revitalizing endangered salmon runs in the
river. Aside from calculating the proposal's effects on jobs,
electric bills and shipping rates, the government is now hoping to
assign a dollar value to Americans' knowledge that a piece of their
wilderness might be regained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication that there are certainly folks out there
who are willing to pay for the existence of something in the
wild,'' said Dennis Wagner, the Corps official overseeing an
economic analysis for the agency. ``I think we'd be remiss in not
presenting something to the decision makers. How they use that
information is up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of existence value, favored by many environmentalists
as a legitimate policy tool in conservation debates and ridiculed
by critics as unquantifiable, meaningless or both, has been around
since the 1960s. ``There's not a single, agreed-upon definition,''
said Tom Stevens, a professor of resource economics at the
University of Massachusetts. ``But the basic idea is that yes,
people do place a value on things they know they are never going to
use, or maybe even to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept, also known as contingent value or passive-use
value, has been increasingly cited in legal battles over issues
like logging in the Alaskan wilderness or offshore oil drilling.
Yet many economists say that while existence value is, in theory, a
perfectly valid factor to bring to the table, coming up with
precise ways to gauge how much people value something like
wilderness is far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you'd be willing to pay something for some state
of the world to exist, as you would pay for a commodity or a
contract for services, is not at all crazy,'' said Alan Randall,
chairman of the department of agricultural, environmental and
development economics at Ohio State University. ``The controversy,
really, is mostly about measurability.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Snake River debate, for instance, proponents of the
dam-breaching proposal have pointed to polls suggesting that
Seattle-area residents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars
a month on their electricity bills in order to save salmon runs. In
addition, Stevens and a team of economists at the University of
Massachusetts found in a survey several years ago that residents of
the Connecticut River Valley area said they would pay, on average,
$7.90 annually in higher electric bills for efforts to preserve
Atlantic salmon spawning in that river.
</P>
<P>
   And at the height of a legal fight with Exxon over the 1989 oil
spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker, the state of Alaska
commissioned a $3 million study of what Americans who said they
were unlikely to ever visit Prince William Sound would be willing
to pay to avoid a similar accident. About $30, was the average
respondent's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Using polls and other data, some economists at the Corps of
Engineers have calculated that breaching the four Snake River dams
and successfully restoring the salmon is an idea for which
Americans would be willing to shell out as much as $1 billion, but
others have pegged the figure much lower, said Wagner. ``It's
really not an exact thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, proponents of breaching the dams say that even if the
existence value of restoring the river and salmon can't be
precisely quantified, it is both large and meaningful. ``If that
guy in Dubuque thinks that this is important, that shows that this
is a national issue,'' said Chris Zimmer, a spokesman for Save Our
Wild Salmon, a Seattle-based environmental group. ``This is a
quality-of-life issue for people. It's important to their
well-being that they know we still have wild places left.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue, in effect, that it doesn't really matter what the
guy in Dubuque thinks. ``It's really an affront to the people who
live here,'' said Bruce Lovelin, executive director of the Columbia
River Alliance, which represents industrial users of the Columbia
and the Snake. ``I mean, unless you're going to come up here and
spend some money to recreate, don't tell us how we should run
things in the Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Others question whether such a value can be accurately measured.
``The only way to do it is to ask people what they would be willing
to pay, and in my view you ask people questions like that and you
get very upwardly biased results,'' said Jerry Hausman, an
economics professor at MIT. ``When somebody calls you on the phone
to ask, it's not real money.''
</P>
<P>
   Existence values are generally used to buttress the
environmentalists' side of the debate, but that doesn't mean all
environmentalists like the idea. ``Maybe it's really not
appropriate to try to put dollar values on something like
wilderness,'' Stevens said. ``After all, what if you add up all
those numbers and they don't come out in your favor?''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, whose department oversees
national parks and much of the more than 100 million acres
designated as protected wilderness, also cautions against using
existence values in environmental debates _ but largely because
they may wind up understating the value of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge collection of academic literature on all this,
and I've found it fairly unsatisfactory,'' Babbitt said in a
telephone interview. ``It all comes down to quantifying economic
activity, and I don't know if you can do that on any piece of
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the cost of everything and the value of nothing, is
what this is all about,'' he added. ``You can't just cost this
stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is complicated by the fact that many of the same
people who say they would pay to protect wild rivers and wild fish
would surely respond differently if asked whether they want to put
port workers in Idaho out of work or drive up shipping rates for
wheat farmers (both likely effects of the dam breaching plan).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, as Babbitt warns, economics could wind up driving a
debate that perhaps should be about something far deeper. Wallace
Stegner, one of the great writers of the West, was clearly talking
about existence value in his ardent calls for ``wilderness
preserved,'' but the author never veered into discussing actual
dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reminder and the reassurance that it is still there is
good for our spiritual health even if we never once in 10 years set
foot in it,'' he once wrote. ``It is important to us when we are
old simply because it is there _ important, that is, simply as an
idea.''

<P>
   There is no Nobel prize in metaphysics. But if there were, it
would surely go to the thinker who could solve the stubborn mystery
of why mathematics so often mirrors the workings of the physical
world. Rocks arc through the sky in parabolic trajectories, planets
swing in ellipses around the sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles
move according to the mathematics of quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   But not every equation is so well behaved. Sometimes they
predict absurdities like subatomic particles with negative masses
or even negative probabilities of existing. What could it mean for
something to weigh less than nothing or to have less than a zero
chance of being real? ``Physics in the never-never land,'' the
theorist Marvin Goldberger once called these mathematical chimera.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Dutch physicists, Gerardus 't Hooft and his
former teacher, Martinus (Tini) Veltman, belatedly won a Nobel
Prize for showing, in the early 1970s, that a theory connecting two
of the four forces of nature belonged not in the land of Peter Pan
but among the handful of mathematical inventions that speak truths
about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having parsed reality into four forces _ gravity,
electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces _
physicists have been trying ever since to fit the pieces back
together. They dream of ``unifying'' these separate phenomena,
showing they are different manifestations of a single superforce
that existed in the first moments after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, physicists had taken an important step toward
unification with a theory blending electromagnetism with the weak
force. But it was not clear whether this ``electroweak'' theory was
sound. Like a buggy piece of software, it might churn out
quantities that were infinite, as when you divide a number by zero.
If so, the theory would be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Decades earlier, spurious infinities had threatened to wreck the
crown jewel of early 20th-century physics: quantum electrodynamics.
The theory, which explains electromagnetism, is an example of a
more general notion called quantum field theory, in which forces
are carried by ephemeral particles, called quanta, that pop in and
out of existence too quickly to be observed. For electromagnetism
these messengers (or ``virtual particles'') are called photons.
They shuttle back and forth between two electrons, causing them to
repel each another.
</P>
<P>
   But a single electron would also interact with itself, like a
snake swallowing its own tail. The result, the equations predicted,
was an endlessly looping process that would bestow the particle
with infinite mass and charge. This was so obviously false that
many physicists came to doubt the whole idea of quantum field
theory. There were other crazy infinities as well. Maybe it was
time to uproot the entire foundation of particle physics and begin
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It came as a relief when, in the late 1940s, Richard Feynman,
Julian Schwinger and Sin-itiro Tomonaga independently discovered a
way to ``renormalize'' the equations _ manipulating them so the
infinities cancel one another out like terms in an algebraic
equation. The result was measurements so precise that, as Feynman
later put it, it was like gauging the distance from Los Angeles to
New York within the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone was impressed with this shell game.
``Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it turns
out to be small,'' the great theorist Paul Dirac complained, ``not
neglecting it because it is infinitely great and you do not want
it!'' Even after he shared a Nobel Prize for the work, Feynman
dismissed it as ``hocus pocus,'' insisting that he had been honored
for sweeping a problem under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by the time electromagnetism and the weak force were on
the verge of being unified, quantum field theory had fallen again
into disrepute. At the University of Utrecht, Veltman, who had been
laboring over the infinities for years, found an ally in Gerard 't
hooft.
</P>
<P>
   The two could hardly have been more different, said Peter van
Nieuwenhuizen, who was with them at the time. With a thick black

honest. ``He looked like a character from a Dutch painting,'' said
van Nieuwenhuizen, who is now director of the C.N. Yang Institute
for Theoretical Physics at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. 'T hooft was small, soft-spoken, diplomatic. From the
day he arrived, it was clear he was a star.
</P>
<P>
   The obsessive Veltman once said he would gladly give up a finger
to make the infinities go away. With an unusual ability to see an
old problem in a new light, 't hooft broke the ice jam. ``He could
solve problems that seemed unsolvable in a way so elegant that you
could only sit in absolute stupefaction,'' van Nieuwenhuizen said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Veltman's earlier work as a platform, the younger
scientist found the key to renormalizing electroweak theory,
reconciling the infinities. He also deepened the understanding of
how, in the early moments of creation, the two forces might have
come unraveled. The agent for this ``spontaneous symmetry
breaking'' was a particle, still undiscovered, called the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   The symmetry between teacher and student was also destined to
break. Veltman thought the Higgs particle was baloney. And over the
years, he came to feel that his student's contributions were being
celebrated more than his own. Gradually they drifted apart. But the
ideas that emerged from their uneasy collaboration changed physics.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists accomplished far more than simply debugging
electroweak theory. Their work applied to electromagnetism and the
strong force as well, bringing quantum field theory to a new height
of respectability. Today's Standard Model, which describes the
workings of all the forces but gravity, is cast in this very form.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists still argue about whether renormalization is a mere
trick or a clue, still barely understood, to some deep truth of
nature. Most leave such questions to the metaphysicians, content to
get on with their work.

   ``There's a huge collection of academic literature on all this,
and I've found it fairly unsatisfactory,'' Babbitt said in a
telephone interview. ``It all comes down to quantifying economic
activity, and I don't know if you can do that on any piece of
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the cost of everything and the value of nothing, is
what this is all about,'' he added. ``You can't just cost this
stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is complicated by the fact that many of the same
people who say they would pay to protect wild rivers and wild fish
would surely respond differently if asked whether they want to put
port workers in Idaho out of work or drive up shipping rates for
wheat farmers (both likely effects of the dam breaching plan).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, as Babbitt warns, economics could wind up driving a
debate that perhaps should be about something far deeper. Wallace
Stegner, one of the great writers of the West, was clearly talking
about existence value in his ardent calls for ``wilderness
preserved,'' but the author never veered into discussing actual
dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reminder and the reassurance that it is still there is
good for our spiritual health even if we never once in 10 years set
foot in it,'' he once wrote. ``It is important to us when we are
old simply because it is there _ important, that is, simply as an
idea.''

<P>
   There is no Nobel prize in metaphysics. But if there were, it
would surely go to the thinker who could solve the stubborn mystery
of why mathematics so often mirrors the workings of the physical
world. Rocks arc through the sky in parabolic trajectories, planets
swing in ellipses around the sun. And inside atoms, tiny particles
move according to the mathematics of quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   But not every equation is so well behaved. Sometimes they
predict absurdities like subatomic particles with negative masses
or even negative probabilities of existing. What could it mean for
something to weigh less than nothing or to have less than a zero
chance of being real? ``Physics in the never-never land,'' the
theorist Marvin Goldberger once called these mathematical chimera.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Dutch physicists, Gerardus 't Hooft and his
former teacher, Martinus (Tini) Veltman, belatedly won a Nobel
Prize for showing, in the early 1970s, that a theory connecting two
of the four forces of nature belonged not in the land of Peter Pan
but among the handful of mathematical inventions that speak truths
about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having parsed reality into four forces _ gravity,
electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces _
physicists have been trying ever since to fit the pieces back
together. They dream of ``unifying'' these separate phenomena,
showing they are different manifestations of a single superforce
that existed in the first moments after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, physicists had taken an important step toward
unification with a theory blending electromagnetism with the weak
force. But it was not clear whether this ``electroweak'' theory was
sound. Like a buggy piece of software, it might churn out
quantities that were infinite, as when you divide a number by zero.
If so, the theory would be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Decades earlier, spurious infinities had threatened to wreck the
crown jewel of early 20th-century physics: quantum electrodynamics.
The theory, which explains electromagnetism, is an example of a
more general notion called quantum field theory, in which forces
are carried by ephemeral particles, called quanta, that pop in and
out of existence too quickly to be observed. For electromagnetism
these messengers (or ``virtual particles'') are called photons.
They shuttle back and forth between two electrons, causing them to
repel each another.
</P>
<P>
   But a single electron would also interact with itself, like a
snake swallowing its own tail. The result, the equations predicted,
was an endlessly looping process that would bestow the particle
with infinite mass and charge. This was so obviously false that
many physicists came to doubt the whole idea of quantum field
theory. There were other crazy infinities as well. Maybe it was
time to uproot the entire foundation of particle physics and begin
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It came as a relief when, in the late 1940s, Richard Feynman,
Julian Schwinger and Sin-itiro Tomonaga independently discovered a
way to ``renormalize'' the equations _ manipulating them so the
infinities cancel one another out like terms in an algebraic
equation. The result was measurements so precise that, as Feynman
later put it, it was like gauging the distance from Los Angeles to
New York within the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone was impressed with this shell game.
``Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it turns
out to be small,'' the great theorist Paul Dirac complained, ``not
neglecting it because it is infinitely great and you do not want
it!'' Even after he shared a Nobel Prize for the work, Feynman
dismissed it as ``hocus pocus,'' insisting that he had been honored
for sweeping a problem under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by the time electromagnetism and the weak force were on
the verge of being unified, quantum field theory had fallen again
into disrepute. At the University of Utrecht, Veltman, who had been
laboring over the infinities for years, found an ally in Gerard 't
hooft.
</P>
<P>
   The two could hardly have been more different, said Peter van
Nieuwenhuizen, who was with them at the time. With a thick black
beard and shining eyes, Veltman was large, imposing, bluntly
honest. ``He looked like a character from a Dutch painting,'' said
van Nieuwenhuizen, who is now director of the C.N. Yang Institute
for Theoretical Physics at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. 'T hooft was small, soft-spoken, diplomatic. From the

   WASHINGTON _ Step outside the United States for even a few days,
and the country has never looked more powerful: An economy that
won't quit, a military that has never faced fewer direct
challenges, a popular and business culture that has become the
world's most eagerly-sought export.
</P>
<P>
   But take one step back into Washington and it's easy to wonder
if you are talking about the same country. The president of the
most powerful nation at its most powerful moment has rarely looked
weaker than he did last week, when the Senate overwhelmingly
defeated the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded with an hour-long recitation of the
dangers of a ``new isolationism.'' Republicans shot back that
Clinton had cynically sought to turn a popular but hard-to-enforce
treaty into a political weapon. Bickering along these lines will
doubtless go on for months. But it masks the real debate.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty was only the latest of a number of divisive
issues in the capital that share a common subtext: An argument not
over whether the United States is strong, but over how it should
use its power. Should it strut the global beach alone, or leverage
that power by accepting restraints on its freedom to act?
</P>
<P>
   It is that debate that has eroded the ``vital center'' that
Clinton talks about so often in his laments about the disappearance
of bipartisanship in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself, who has been episodic in focusing on foreign
policy, has ranged all over the map on this question. He preaches
cooperation one day and acts unilaterally the next _ whether the
issue is swatting Saddam Hussein or slapping huge tariffs on
low-cost Japanese steel. Usually, though, he has come down on the
side of power-sharing, either pressing for more arms control
accords even if that means a slow deterioration of the American
nuclear fleet, or granting more power to the World Trade
Organization even if sometimes strikes down American laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years battles have gradually gotten more and
more vociferous, as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty showed. Now
it has turned into an open fight, bound to haunt Clinton as he
finishes the last 15 months of his term. It is also certain to
plague his successor in a city where the consensus about U.S.
responsibilities in the world has splintered.
</P>
<P>
   It is a battle in which Clinton has steadily been losing ground.
In his first term he won over moderate Republicans to push through
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global trade treaty
that created the World Trade Organization. True, these victories
came only after desperate legislative battles, but unlike the test
ban treaty, they were at least fought out in hundreds of hours of
hearings and public debate. But lately, with the exception of the
war in Kosovo, he has been unable to stitch together any kind of
majority for his international initiatives. He was unable even to
convince his own party to vote to give him authority to negotiate
new trade treaties _ a reminder that, for all his denunciations of
isolationism Thursday, most of the economic isolationists in
Congress are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in a treaty that involved national security rather than
economic prosperity, the culmination of an idea whose intellectual
roots go back to Eisenhower Republicans, he became the first
president since Woodrow Wilson to face outright rejection of a
major international accord. The fact that Democrats and Republicans
were unable to agree on the obvious face-saving compromise _ a
delay of the vote until after the presidential election _ seems to
prove that the politics of post-Cold War Washington really are
different. ``It's inconceivable,'' one of Clinton's top advisers
said, ``that this would have been the outcome if the country still
felt under an imminent threat from a major enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of those who had doubts about the treaty and thus
voted against it would have preferred to see it postponed, amended
or at least fully aired in hearings rather than killed. Moderate
Republicans who voted no like John McCain, a presidential
candidate, were clearly uncomfortable with the message that the
treaty's rejection sent around the world. ``There has always been
an isolationist wing in our party and they were transcendent in the
'20s and '30s,'' McCain said Friday, trying to distance himself
from that group as fast as he could. ``It's still there, it will
always be there, yet I have every confidence that the majority will
take an international viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the instinct in evidence on the Senate floor
Wednesday night was less about isolationism than about
unilateralism _ preserving America's ability to use its power
unchallenged. In the case of the test ban treaty, that means
retaining an ability to go back to traditional deterrence,
constantly improving America's nuclear arsenal and forcing a
resurgent Russia or an ambitious China to fear a financially
ruinous arms race. After all, the Soviet Union went that route and
bankrupted itself along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republican party has ever been or is now a
party of isolationism,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations. Many of the Republicans who voted
against the treaty, he noted, rank among the Senate's strongest
internationalists. ``But there is a very strong unilateralist
impulse manifesting itself. That's very different. It's not opposed
to foreign entanglements, it just sends a message: `Don't tie our
hands.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued vociferously against that approach during his
press conference Thursday, warning that if an anti-test ban treaty
president ever gets elected (he named no names, but clearly had
George W. Bush Jr. in mind) ``we'll have China testing; we'll have
India testing; we'll have Pakistan testing.'' The result, he
argued, would be a return to an economically destructive arms race.
Sooner or later, he predicted, Republicans would be pressing for
``30 or 40 or 50 billion a year'' in additional defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. But it is also possible that the lessons of the
Cold War run deep, and countries now feel far more competitive
pressure than they did a decade ago to invest that money in their
economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same moment that Clinton is talking about isolation,
American foreign investment is off the charts, American economic
engagement around the world is breaking all records,'' said Jeffrey
Garten, a former undersecretary of commerce and now dean of the
Yale School of Management. ``In some subtle way, this has
ricocheted back to Washington, and perhaps there are a lot of
people who feel that you can reject an arms control treaty and
still not be withdrawing from the world.''

WILT THE STILT'S VIEWS ON RACE AND HOOPS

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By TOM KUNTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, who died last week of a heart
attack at the age of 63, had a taciturn demeanor as a player, but
he was best-known off the court for bragging in his autobiography
that he had had sex with some 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that wasn't nearly the half of Chamberlain's boasting
in ``A View From Above'' (Villard Books, 1991), which opened with
his disclaimer that although he was a big man, ``I am certainly not
 &UR; the &LR;  Big Man'' _ God _ in case anyone was confused.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most curious are Chamberlain's comments on race. At
one point in the book, he is derisive toward Al Campanis, the Los
Angeles Dodgers executive forced to resign in 1987 after he said on
national television that blacks ``may not have the necessities''
for management in baseball, and that blacks aren't good swimmers
``because they don't have the buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Chamberlain asks why the Dodgers had no black
third-base coaches under Campanis. Was it because blacks ``can't
say stop?'' he asked. ``Or because they don't know when to go
home?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at another point, Chamberlain offers his own views about
racial differences between black and white basketball players,
which attracted very little attention at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because there were juicier headlines in a former
star athlete claiming to have bedded 20,000 women, and because
Chamberlain was not an executive in a major sport using racial
stereotypes on ``Nightline'' to justify racial disparities in
management.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Chamberlain wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of color seem to be blessed with specific physical
attributes that benefit them in several sports, particularly
basketball. They have explosive muscle power that translates into
speed, quickness, and jumping ability (three major ingredients
needed to be a good jock, a good basketball player in particular).
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is another element that makes men of color tend to

`flair' _ which translates into showmanship.

   ``A perfect example of this can be seen if you examine the
playing styles of the two best passers in the game of basketball
today, Magic Johnson and John Stockton,'' Chamberlain continued.
``At present, Stockton out-assists Magic _ on a per game basis _ by
approximately one assist. But Magic has that flair and Stockton
doesn't. It makes Magic appear as if he's doing much more than
Stockton. It's not ability, it's style. And in basketball, men of
color have all the style. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I suppose this flair can be traced back to
environmental conditioning or heritage or even to the Harlem
Globetrotters, the true forefathers of all the showmanship that has
become the trademark of so many stars _ all men of color _ in the

WILT THE STILT'S VIEWS ON RACE AND HOOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication notice: also sent with `s' code)  
 (bl)  
 By TOM KUNTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, who died last week of a heart
attack at the age of 63, had a taciturn demeanor as a player, but
he was best-known off the court for bragging in his autobiography
that he had had sex with some 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that wasn't nearly the half of Chamberlain's boasting
in ``A View From Above'' (Villard Books, 1991), which opened with
his disclaimer that although he was a big man, ``I am certainly not
 &UR; the &LR;  Big Man'' _ God _ in case anyone was confused.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most curious are Chamberlain's comments on race. At
one point in the book, he is derisive toward Al Campanis, the Los
Angeles Dodgers executive forced to resign in 1987 after he said on
national television that blacks ``may not have the necessities''
for management in baseball, and that blacks aren't good swimmers
``because they don't have the buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Chamberlain asks why the Dodgers had no black
third-base coaches under Campanis. Was it because blacks ``can't
say stop?'' he asked. ``Or because they don't know when to go
home?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at another point, Chamberlain offers his own views about
racial differences between black and white basketball players,
which attracted very little attention at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because there were juicier headlines in a former
star athlete claiming to have bedded 20,000 women, and because
Chamberlain was not an executive in a major sport using racial
stereotypes on ``Nightline'' to justify racial disparities in
management.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Chamberlain wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of color seem to be blessed with specific physical
attributes that benefit them in several sports, particularly
basketball. They have explosive muscle power that translates into
speed, quickness, and jumping ability (three major ingredients
needed to be a good jock, a good basketball player in particular).
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is another element that makes men of color tend to
stand out above the rest. For lack of a better word, let's call it
`flair' _ which translates into showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect example of this can be seen if you examine the
playing styles of the two best passers in the game of basketball
today, Magic Johnson and John Stockton,'' Chamberlain continued.
``At present, Stockton out-assists Magic _ on a per game basis _ by
approximately one assist. But Magic has that flair and Stockton
doesn't. It makes Magic appear as if he's doing much more than
Stockton. It's not ability, it's style. And in basketball, men of
color have all the style. Think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I suppose this flair can be traced back to
environmental conditioning or heritage or even to the Harlem
Globetrotters, the true forefathers of all the showmanship that has
become the trademark of so many stars _ all men of color _ in the
NBA.''

THE SPORTS STORY THAT CHANGED AMERICA

   It took Grantland Rice three tries to get it right. In 1922,
writing about the Notre Dame-Army football game, he led with
``Notre Dame's attack is more like a modern war offensive than
anything we have seen.'' Nope. In 1923, again covering the Irish
and the Cadets, he began, ``Brazil can cheer about its coffee ...''
Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1924 _ almost exactly 75 years ago _ he finally
found the right rhythm and imagery and struck hard and clean as a
Knute Rockne-coached linebacker:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against a blue, gray October sky, the Four Horsemen
rode again. In dramatic lore, they were known as Famine,
Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are only aliases. Their
real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They
formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another
fighting Army team was swept over the precipice of the Polo Grounds
this afternoon. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In a few swift, polished sentences _ and with an assist from a
photograph _ Rice changed his own life, his profession, the course
of college football and the character of American leisure culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s were the golden age of myth-making sports journalism.
A handful of talented writers who found other paths to literary
fame blocked began to notice, as indeed their editors had already
noticed, that a rising middle class was responding more to the
exploits of Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones than to what
would come to be known as ``hard'' news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico of the New York Daily News, who later went on to
better things, admitted to being a ``Gee-Whizzer'' _ one of the new
breed of sportswriter who wrote in ``the most florid and exciting
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice, writing for the New York Herald Tribune, was the
king of the Gee-Whizzers. As Murray Sperber wrote in ``Shake Down
the Thunder,'' his history of Notre Dame football, ``Each day he
flung out metaphors about athletes and sports events and, indeed,
some of his words stick to the American psyche. ... The vast
majority of his figures of speech quickly disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines that stick with us today were a happy combination of
skill and circumstance. To begin with, Rice had picked the right
sport, and the right team. The rise of football _ and college
football in the 1920s and for several decades thereafter  &UR; was &LR; 
football _ coincided with the rise of the sports pages and the
Gee-Whizzers. Some historians have called the explosion of football
popularity a newspaper phenomenon. College football had been a
small-time sport with local appeal at best before near-hysterical
coverage made it a national game in the rank of, if not actually on
a par with, big-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber relates an incident between the Notre Dame football
coach, Knute Rockne, and a journalist that makes the point: ``Tut,
tut, Rockne,'' the writer responded when the Notre Dame coach
complained about the paper's football coverage. ``You know damn
well that were it not for newspapers, not five hundred people would
be interested in Notre Dame, Nebraska, or the whole kit and
kaboodle of football teams.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was true before 1924, it wasn't true afterward.
</P>
<P>
   College football and sports pages combined to make each other,
and both helped to create Grantland Rice. He got a big boost, too,
from the night editor of the Herald Tribune, who loved the lead for
Rice's 1924 Notre Dame-Army story and put it on the front page of
the Sunday morning paper. Other papers picked up the story.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hardly anyone remembers the actual game. It wasn't even
the biggest story in college football that day: Red Grange had
scored five touchdowns against Michigan, and most papers, including
Rice's own, considered that game the bigger event. Notre Dame's
13-7 victory wasn't even its most impressive win that season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, a friend of Knute Rockne, correctly perceived that
Notre Dame would be the football team with national appeal, and for
thousands of fans that Sunday, and for millions more who would read
the story in weeks and months and, as it appeared in anthologies of
sportswriting, years to come, that fall Saturday would forever be
the day the Four Horsemen rode.
</P>
<P>
   George Strickler, a Notre Dame press assistant, gave Rice his
inspiration when he likened the Irish backfield to the stars of the
Rudolph Valentino film ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
Rice took the ball, as it were, from there. Strickler then picked
it up and ran it for another score when he messaged back to South
Bend, Ind., for a photographer to shoot the Notre Dame backfield on
horses. It was a cute picture, but for many it only seemed to
diminish the myth _ in truth, the four heroes looked a little
uneasy on horses. The picture was not worth the thousand words Rice
wrote. Actually, it didn't measure up to the 12 words of his lead
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlined against blue, gray October sky ...'' What was Rice's
vantage point? Looking up from the turf of the football field? It
must have seemed so to newspaper readers all over the country to
whom the Four Horsemen must have seemed larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Within three decades, TV would make athletes smaller than life.
Rarely again would sportswriters see athletes in such mythic (and
unrealistic) proportions. The athletes would be as great or greater
than Dempsey, Ruth, Jones and the Four Horsemen, but fans would
watch them over and over on TV and have no need of poetic writing
to make their feats seem memorable.

BLOWN TO BITS: CYBERWARFARE BREAKS THE RULES OF MILITARY
ENGAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Years ago, in the movie ``WarGames,'' Matthew Broderick
played a computer hacker who electronically ferrets his way into
the Pentagon's Norad early warning system inside Cheyenne Mountain,
Colo., and almost starts World War III by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the military finally struck back. The Pentagon
created a new military center to harness the nation's disparate
cyberwarfare forces under the Air Force Space Command at Peterson
Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. That followed the public
acknowledgment by Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, that the United States played hacker itself earlier this
year _ waging a keyboard war against Serbian computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond challenging America's own military culture and requiring
sophisticated technology, cyberwarfare raises a fundamental
philosophical question. The biggest challenge that such warfare may
pose for democratic societies is that it further blurs the line
between military and nonmilitary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberwarfare involves deliberately targeting noncombatants,''
said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on legal
issues in computer security. ``Frequently, you're not going after a
government or military or some strategic target.'' The target might
instead be a public utility.
</P>
<P>
   The new command's first mission will be to coordinate the
defense of the military's computer networks against foreign threats
and cyberterrorists. Soon after the mission will expand to include
offense: Joint Task Force Computer Network Attack, in Pentagon
jargon, designed to conduct wartime military operations against
computer networks in enemy countries.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of an information-war fighting capability to the
Pentagon's quiver takes activities that have largely been confined
to covert military and intelligence operations and makes them part
of the nation's military chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new center is a public acknowledgment that
as the world's most technically advanced nation, the United States
is also potentially the most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of simultaneous computer network attacks against
banking, transportation, commerce and utility targets _ as well as
against the military _ conjures up the fear of an electronic Pearl
Harbor in which the nation is paralyzed without a single bullet
ever being fired.
</P>
<P>
   But the real-world challenge faced by the military is likely to
be more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat is going to be death by a thousand cuts, rather
than a giant attack,'' said a former top military scientist.
``There will be a little bit of this and a little bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   This ghost-in-the-machine threat is perhaps the military's worst
nightmare and also the one that a closed and secretive military
organization may have the most difficulty combating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can throw technology at this but it's not a
technology problem at all,'' said Ronald Knecht, a former Pentagon
official who helped develop information warfare policy for three
decades and who is now senior vice president for corporate
development at Science Applications International Corp., a large
military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, is to change a military culture that has
fought wars with bombs and tanks into one that fights with bits and
bytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparing for cyberwar will force the nation to rethink the
way it fights wars,'' said Steven Lukasik, a military analyst at
the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford
University and a former director of the Pentagon's Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trained to fight nuclear wars where static defenses
are fatal,'' he said. ``But in information warfare we have to
rethink everything. It may be that Maginot Lines have basically
gotten a bad name.'' In other words, building impenetrable
electronic walls may be a more effective tactic in cyberwarfare.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper challenge for the Pentagon may be keeping pace with
Silicon Valley's fast-paced consumer technology companies. Until
the end of the Cold War, the most powerful computer technology
would trickle down from a handful of defense contractors and
supercomputer companies financed by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, however, the most powerful computer
technologies are increasingly made by companies that make products
that go under Christmas trees. To cope with the consumer technology
challenge, the CIA announced plans this month to set up a venture
capital fund to gain quicker access to state-of-art technologies
being incubated in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's problem may be compounded because the
technology is the same as in consumer products but the rules of
cyberwarfare are different, said Knecht of Stanford. He said a
military commander should expect an attack that blocks access to
his computer networks ``and he should assume that somebody who has
approved access to his networks is working for the other side _ and
still be ready to fight a war.''

that go under Christmas trees. To cope with the consumer technology
challenge, the CIA announced plans this month to set up a venture
capital fund to gain quicker access to state-of-art technologies
being incubated in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's problem may be compounded because the
technology is the same as in consumer products but the rules of
cyberwarfare are different, said Knecht of Stanford. He said a
military commander should expect an attack that blocks access to
his computer networks ``and he should assume that somebody who has
approved access to his networks is working for the other side _ and
still be ready to fight a war.''

TRIANGULATION: POLITICS' NEW GEOMETRY IS OLD MATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush gets no higher praise from President
Clinton's devotees than when they applaud the Republican for
proving himself a deft triangulator. But asked about his
triangulation skills over lunch at the Governor's Mansion in Austin
last week, Bush looked as if he wanted to smash the sweet potato
pie into his questioner's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that means,'' Bush bristled. ``This is some
invented word. I don't know what triangulation stands for. It's new
in the political jargon. What does it mean? Triangulation?
Seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that triangulation, in shorthand, has something do to with
satisfying everyone, Bush grew even more impatient: ``Sounds like
somebody trying to insult me then.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it means, according to Dick Morris, the former
Clinton political adviser who dreamed up the concept for his client
in 1995: ``Triangulation is a process of taking the best ideas from
each party and combining them into a coherent policy and program.
It is not just splitting the difference, but molding a creative
synthesis which rises above the doctrine of either party.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Bush now has been branded by pundits and
political professionals _ even by White House officials _ as a
triangulator because in recent days he has distanced himself from
his party's congressional leadership _ a pattern that has marked
the Clinton presidency. Such positioning by Bush, Morris argued,
demonstrates ``why he is winning'' and, in his view, will be
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is combining Democratic ideals like compassion, income
redistribution, help for the poor,'' he said, ``with Republican
ways of doing it, like using faith-based organizations, charities
and tax incentives to achieve these goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush wants, of course, is to be accused of what
even Morris acknowledges are the crass (though successful)
political strategies of Clinton. One of Bush's most reliable
applause lines in his stump speech is an unambiguous dig at the
president: ``I won't use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet maybe Bush had a point when he grimaced at the notion of
triangulation. The term has been defined, perhaps too broadly, as a
catch-all for any politician who diverges from the doctrine of his
or her party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triangulation is probably a term we could do without,'' said
Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``Dick Morris gets too much credit for way too many
things. You can explain what happened without invoking any
triangles.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are major differences between the Clinton and
Bush approaches. Unlike Clinton, who actually pressed for
Republican positions on issues like welfare, trade and the death
penalty, Bush's outreach has been largely rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush delivered a speech about education recently, the
passage that captured the attention was his broadside at the
Republican Party. He made no mention of his support for vouchers,
which are controversial yet popular among conservatives _ and would
give federal money to parents for private tuition. But, in a subtle
move to reassure conservatives, the supporting documentation
explicitly outlined a voucher proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, careful not to put off abortion-rights supporters,
never utters the word abortion. Instead, he uses code phrases about
babies to reassure conservatives. When he addressed the Christian
Coalition this month, Bush did not appreciably change his theme.
But abortion opponents were reassured by the man who introduced
Bush, Jay Sekulow, and spoke passionately (and bluntly) about the
governor's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's oratory criticizing congressional Republicans for
balancing the federal budget ``on the backs of the poor'' is
reminiscent of Clinton in one instance: when, during the 1992
campaign, Clinton sought to show he was a new kind of Democrat by
repudiating Sister Souljah, a race-baiting rapper. Back then,
Morris had not even invented the term triangulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Souljah and `backs of the poor' are very good
parallels,'' said Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton
University. ``In each case, you've got someone at the core of your
party who has no other place to go and is controversial to people
at the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that triangulation may be too easy a buzzword.
``It's kind of slippery to hang it exclusively on triangulation
because the more you look at it the more it fades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that presidents and presidential candidates have
long sought to broaden their appeal on the backs of their own party
faithful. A maxim of politics is that presidential elections are
always won at the center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the term had been around when he assumed the presidency in
1841, John Tyler, a Whig, would surely have been stamped a
triangulator. His party was eager to repudiate the Andrew Jackson
era by establishing a national bank and setting high tariffs. But
Tyler, something of a renegade, vetoed bank bills proposed by his
own party and opposed the tariffs, fearing that moving against the
Jacksonian legacy too hastily would backfire on his party.
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for president in 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower resisted
enormous pressure from Republican leaders who wanted him to run as
an isolationist and advocate rolling back the New Deal. But buoyed
by his stature and popularity as a World War II general, Eisenhower
pressed forward with his drive to moderate the party.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after Republicans lost control of Congress in the 1954
midterm elections, Eisenhower _ two years into his first term _
sounded as despondent as Clinton, who had the same thing happen to
him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party must be known as a progressive
organization or it is sunk,'' Eisenhower wrote in his diary. ``I
believe this so emphatically that I think that far from appeasing
or reasoning with the dyed-in-the-wool reactionary fringe, we
should completely ignore it and, when necessary, repudiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that he was elected by a frighteningly narrow margin in
1968, President Richard M. Nixon sought to broaden his appeal by
seizing the Democrats' agenda on matters like the environment,
welfare and, of course, China, which he visited as the 1972
presidential campaign was getting underway.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters are particularly troubled by the triangulation
label because it has a Machiavellian air to it. They want their
candidate to float above politics _ or, at least, appear that way.
``George W. Bush is saying what's on his mind,'' said Michigan Gov.
John Engler. ``I don't think there's any elaborate
three-dimensional game board strategy that's being played out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is no political innocent. He, too, has a pollster. He,
too, has wily political operatives. When the governor lambasted
House Republicans, he knew that keeping some distance from his
party's unpopular leaders in Washington could make him look
independent and no creature of Washington. In doing so, he also
gave a nod to the accomplishments of governors like himself. He had
the same intention when, in a subsequent speech, he declared, ``Too
often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of America
slouching toward Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   Triangles or not, a challenge for Bush is not to take things too
far. By the time Tyler left the White House he had been disowned by
his own party _ and Democrats wanted nothing to do with him,
either. Neither party wanted him on its ticket in 1844.
</P>
<P>
   Nor in 1999 is President Clinton is greatly beloved in either
party.

NEW SCANDALISMS: IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR DEFINITION OF LINGUISTIC
TREND IS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a recent episode of the new NBC drama ``Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit,'' a male character referred to
``getting a Lewinsky.'' Most of the audience instantly understood
what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Although the epilogue to the sordid impeachment scandal is still
being written _ Monica Lewinsky has accepted a $1 million weight
loss challenge from a fitness chain, Linda Tripp awaits trial in
Maryland and Kenneth Starr plans to exit the national stage this
week _ there are constant reminders of our long national nightmare
in Americans' everyday speech.
</P>
<P>
   Every era has its popular terms, but the impeachment scandal _
with its overheated mixture of sex, lies, power and audiotapes _
provided a bounty of material for Americans searching for phrases
and symbols that fit the cynical weariness of the times.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the people whose names are being
invoked are touchy about being portrayed as caricatures for
behavior deemed ``not appropriate,'' to borrow the often-used
phrase invoked by President Clinton. For example, Dr. Bernard
Lewinsky, the father of the former White House intern, demanded an
apology last week from the ``Law &AMP; Order'' producers for using the
unseemly phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they say he got a `Clinton job' rather than use my
name, and see how the White House responds to that?'' Lewinsky said
in an interview published by Variety, the entertainment-industry
trade magazine. ``I deserve an apology and so does Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, the producer of the show, refused to apologize, but
he issued a blunt written statement: ``Res ipsa loquitur,'' a
legalistic Latin expression that means, ``It speaks for itself.''
An NBC spokeswoman also defended the program's use of the Lewinsky
name: ``Some words are borne out of national news events, which is
the case with this particular word. This word has been used many
times before on television.''
</P>
<P>
   It has joined a slew of other terms and metaphors from the
scandal now in the American political and cultural lexicon. Linda
Tripp's last name is often used as a verb; to be ``Tripped,''
always with a capital T, is to be betrayed, the way Ms. Tripp
double-crossed Ms. Lewinsky by secretly tape-recording their
intimate phone discussions and turning the tapes over to the
independent counsel. Starr's name is relentlessly invoked as an
extreme example of prosecutorial overzealousness, and pundits have
compared the bespectacled, perpetually smirking prosecutor to
Inspector Javert, the obsessed detective in ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   Even William Ginsburg, Ms. Lewinsky's first attorney, who once
managed to appear on five television programs on a single Sunday
morning, has not escaped; his name has become immortalized as a
label for a media-hogging talking head. Last summer, writer Douglas
Brinkley, who appeared on numerous television programs talking
about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., was described by a writer
for Slate magazine as ``the William Ginsburg of the Kennedy death
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has contributed more catch-phrases to the national
conversation than Bill Clinton. In February, after the impeachment
trial in the Senate ended favorably for the president, Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, said Clinton would go down in history as ``the
most accomplished, polished liar we have ever had serving in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Clinton has already gone into the lexicon as a
synonym for an elegant and well-crafted lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the world was introduced to Monica Lewinsky,
Republicans on Capitol Hill lamented what they call
``Clinton-speak.'' In courthouses around the country, some lawyers
have used the term ``Clinton defense'' as shorthand for what one
attorney said is ``optional amnesia when testifying under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is the most famous deponent of the decade; his
legalistic and linguistic maneuvers during his deposition in the
Paula Jones case and his nationally televised grand jury testimony
are admired by some defense lawyers as models of obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the president's torrent of ``I don't
recalls'' and ``I don't remembers'' are common for a witness
confronted by a perjury inquiry. Lawyers point out that former
President Ronald Reagan failed to recall most details of the
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal. But more than a few defense
lawyers say they can't recall a witness ever uttering Clinton's
classic dodge: ``It depends on what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that sentence, along with ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman,'' are among the most cited Clintonisms
from the impeachment saga. Both phrases have become more widely
quoted than Clinton's acknowledgment, during his 1992 campaign,
that while at Oxford he ``experimented with marijuana'' but
``didn't inhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the dean of the Annenberg School of
Public Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, predicts
that the image of a defiant Clinton emphatically denying that he
had sexual relations with ``that woman'' could come to define the
Clinton presidency, just as ``I am not a crook'' came to symbolize
President Richard M. Nixon's legacy. Ms. Jamieson explained that
Clinton's seething expression and repeated finger-jabbing are
powerful visual images that could endure for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it being constantly referred to, even now, it
means that it has already started to move into our collective
memory,'' Ms. Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Every era has spawned memorable phrases. Watergate brings to
mind Sen. Howard Baker's 1973 question, ``What did the president
know and when did he know it?'' And during the McCarthy hearings in
1954, a special counsel to the Army, Joseph Welch, posed a question
to Sen. Joseph McCarthy that defined the era: ``Have you no
decency, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no such penetrating question, posed by Starr or one of his
prosecutors, emerged from the long-running investigation, which
could help explain why the public never embraced Starr's view of
himself as a truth-seeking Sgt. Joe Friday. Instead, the glib
answers given by Clinton are the verbal touchstones most often
invoked today, either with admiration or disgust.
</P>
<P>
   But some scholars and students of popular culture doubt that the
scandal's cast of characters _ and endlessly repeated phrases
ranging from ``talking points'' to ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' _
will last into the next generation. This will undoubtedly encourage
the people concerned about burnishing Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that any of these things will be
said 10 years down the road,'' said Frank Hoffmann, a professor at
Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, who has written
numerous books on popular culture. ``The attention span of our
young people is too short, for one thing. I teach 18-year-olds, and
these people have no sense of what happened five years ago, let
alone historical events that occurred as long ago as Vietnam. And
they don't care.''

compared the bespectacled, perpetually smirking prosecutor to
Inspector Javert, the obsessed detective in ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   Even William Ginsburg, Ms. Lewinsky's first attorney, who once
managed to appear on five television programs on a single Sunday
morning, has not escaped; his name has become immortalized as a
label for a media-hogging talking head. Last summer, writer Douglas
Brinkley, who appeared on numerous television programs talking
about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., was described by a writer
for Slate magazine as ``the William Ginsburg of the Kennedy death
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has contributed more catch-phrases to the national
conversation than Bill Clinton. In February, after the impeachment
trial in the Senate ended favorably for the president, Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, said Clinton would go down in history as ``the
most accomplished, polished liar we have ever had serving in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Clinton has already gone into the lexicon as a
synonym for an elegant and well-crafted lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the world was introduced to Monica Lewinsky,
Republicans on Capitol Hill lamented what they call
``Clinton-speak.'' In courthouses around the country, some lawyers
have used the term ``Clinton defense'' as shorthand for what one
attorney said is ``optional amnesia when testifying under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is the most famous deponent of the decade; his
legalistic and linguistic maneuvers during his deposition in the
Paula Jones case and his nationally televised grand jury testimony
are admired by some defense lawyers as models of obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the president's torrent of ``I don't
recalls'' and ``I don't remembers'' are common for a witness
confronted by a perjury inquiry. Lawyers point out that former
President Ronald Reagan failed to recall most details of the
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal. But more than a few defense
lawyers say they can't recall a witness ever uttering Clinton's
classic dodge: ``It depends on what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that sentence, along with ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman,'' are among the most cited Clintonisms
from the impeachment saga. Both phrases have become more widely
quoted than Clinton's acknowledgment, during his 1992 campaign,
that while at Oxford he ``experimented with marijuana'' but
``didn't inhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the dean of the Annenberg School of
Public Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, predicts
that the image of a defiant Clinton emphatically denying that he
had sexual relations with ``that woman'' could come to define the
Clinton presidency, just as ``I am not a crook'' came to symbolize
President Richard M. Nixon's legacy. Ms. Jamieson explained that
Clinton's seething expression and repeated finger-jabbing are
powerful visual images that could endure for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it being constantly referred to, even now, it
means that it has already started to move into our collective
memory,'' Ms. Jamieson said.

   UNITED NATIONS _ For a few days last week, it took a split
screen to watch developments in South Asia, where India and
Pakistan seemed to take starkly divergent paths into the next
political era. India anointed another democratically elected
government and Pakistan applauded yet another military coup.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface, are these events as different as they
seem?
</P>
<P>
   Half a century after the partition of British India, some
students of the area say, these two countries _ now nuclear powers
_ may be demonstrating a common trend. In their search for
identity, a new generation of Pakistanis and Indians are unveiling
the face of home-grown politics _ pure Indian and pure Pakistani,
more inward-looking, less cosmopolitan. And, perhaps, more prone to
misunderstanding each other.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone in retreat from a cosmopolitan approach. In
the shadow of globalization, there seems to be a revival of intense
provincialism in unlikely places. Look at the U.S. Senate proudly
casting votes last week against an international effort to ban
nuclear testing, accompanied by boasts of indifference to what the
world thinks. Or at an assorted coalition of British politicians
scrambling to salvage their new-found embrace of Europe from
renewed attacks by Little Englanders. A growing number of
international agreements, not only the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, are at risk worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The developments on the Indian subcontinent and the intensity of
passions that the Senate vote stirred, in fact, were only
marginally coincidental. For it is on the subcontinent that the
probability of a devastating nuclear arms race and even the
possibility of nuclear war are arguably the highest. And the two
countries' drift away from international engagement does nothing to
lower the risks.
</P>
<P>
   American opponents of the test ban treaty were quick to read the
coup in Pakistan as another reason to doubt that any treaty regimen
would be immune to cheating. Proponents argued the opposite: that a
global treaty is the only alternative to an arms race. President
Clinton warned both India and Pakistan not to read the Senate vote
``as a sign that America doesn't care whether you resume nuclear
testing and build up your nuclear arsenals.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such warnings will be heeded is another question.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of power by Hindus in India and the emergence
of a Muslim-inspired agenda in Pakistan are mirror images. In
India, it was the foreignness of Sonia Gandhi, who was born an
Italian, that helped bring the secular Congress Party that she led
to its lowest ebb in 50 years; in Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif was toppled in large part because he bucked Islamist
policies domestically and in relations with India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both communities, both nations, are now at a very great
distance from the founding fathers,'' said Hamid Alvi, a political
columnist in Islamabad and a retired analyst of the Pakistani press
for the U.S. Embassy there. ``India continues with elections,
though democracy has suffered a lot there _ and the persecution of
Christians was certainly not an idea of Jawaharlal Nehru. In
Pakistan, the happenings of today are far from even the wildest
dreams of Mohammed Ali Jinnah.'' The founding generation's ideas,
he said, were both democratic and liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the appearance of Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf in power
after the overthrow of Sharif may have marked the beginning of a
new age as much as a reversion to military rule. Although the
general, who is 58, was born in New Delhi before the partition of
India in 1947, he grew up Pakistani, immersed in an Islamic
heritage that had been the cause of his family's flight from his
birthplace. There would be no shared memories of the dying days of
the British Raj to reminisce about with his military counterparts
across the border. There would be only war and hatred, and pressure
from Muslim radicals with their own agenda within the Pakistani
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both sides of the border there has been a qualitative
change in the military,'' said Sumit Ganguly, a visiting fellow at
Stanford University's Center for International Security and
Cooperation. Officers, he said, have become more opportunistic. And
while India has at least made recruitment more representative of
the nation's diversity, Pakistan's army is still drawn from among
the most religiously conservative ethnic groups. ``Islam,'' he
said, ``is getting into the army from the bottom up.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Experts tend to agree that this opening to Muslim militancy is a
legacy of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul Haq, who in the 1970s and '80s
thought he could hold the Islamists at bay with concessions. This
is a mistake that Sharif also appears to have made, Alvi said _
until, under U.S. pressure, he withdrew support for a Muslim
insurgents' attack on the Kargil area of India. At that point
Islamic leaders used that and other Muslim issues to widen
opposition to Sharif's corrupt and ineffective government and help
bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have now coming up are people who have never known an
undivided India,'' said Paula Newberg, the author of ``Judging the
State: Courts and Constitutional Politics in Pakistan''
(Cambridge). They are, she said, far less cosmopolitan: ``They
haven't done their training in England, they haven't done their
training in the United States. Their associations are much more
within Pakistan, and a Pakistan which has seen itself as quite
beleaguered.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, the loss of Soviet sponsorship in world affairs and
the rise of Hindu nationalism have contributed to a similar
phenomenon. Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh acknowledged in an
interview at the United Nations that India turned inward at the end
of the Cold War, preoccupied with domestic problems. ``While the
rest of the world moved at great velocity,'' he said, ``India was
not part of a global transformation. Had India recognized earlier
that the Cold War had ended, it would not have been left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In those years of introspection Singh's party, the Bharatiya
Janata Party, was growing, supported by intolerant Hindu
organizations bent on destroying other religions and sometimes even
their monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Singh has complained bitterly that the Western press is unfair
when it labels his party as Hindu nationalist, and that the party
has resisted some aggressively pro-Hindu moves that the Congress
Party governments made. There is evidence for his argument, but it
may only underline another reality: that Hindu chauvinism has been
developing for years as India moved away from the secular
philosophy and internationalist outlook of its founders. As in
Pakistan, the Bharatiya Janata Party could be crystallizing, not
creating, a nativist trend.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the man who is now the BJP's home minister, Lal
Krishna Advani, led a crusade to the North Indian town of Ayodhya
in 1990, encouraging Hindu fanatics to destroy a 16th century
mosque they say had been built over the birthplace of the god Rama.
But it was a Congress Party government that first turned over the
long-padlocked mosque, the Babri Masjid, to Hindu militants in
1983. Its destruction in 1992 was only the dramatic finale of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, political analysts keep a watchful eye on Advani,
who has in the past spoken of reassembling an ancient India, which
means bringing back Pakistan and Bangladesh into the
Hindu-dominated fold. Hindu leaders have a seamless argument for
this: All India was once Hindu, so these Muslims (or Sikhs or
Buddhists) are only converts who can be reconverted.
</P>
<P>
   And in Pakistan, Alvi says that the appeal of Islamic parties,
including to the professional middle class, derives in many cases
from a desire to complete an ``intellectual decolonization'' of the
country, a goal that can carry a threat to its inherited democratic
institutions. ``People take refuge, or they appeal to the cheap
sentiments of the public,'' he said. ``Politicians, instead of
reaching up for sublime ideas, are shrinking down to the smaller
things in life.''

 UNDATED: Jamieson said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every era has spawned memorable phrases. Watergate brings to
mind Sen. Howard Baker's 1973 question, ``What did the president
know and when did he know it?'' And during the McCarthy hearings in
1954, a special counsel to the Army, Joseph Welch, posed a question
to Sen. Joseph McCarthy that defined the era: ``Have you no
decency, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no such penetrating question, posed by Starr or one of his
prosecutors, emerged from the long-running investigation, which
could help explain why the public never embraced Starr's view of
himself as a truth-seeking Sgt. Joe Friday. Instead, the glib
answers given by Clinton are the verbal touchstones most often
invoked today, either with admiration or disgust.
</P>
<P>
   But some scholars and students of popular culture doubt that the
scandal's cast of characters _ and endlessly repeated phrases
ranging from ``talking points'' to ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' _
will last into the next generation. This will undoubtedly encourage
the people concerned about burnishing Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that any of these things will be
said 10 years down the road,'' said Frank Hoffmann, a professor at
Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, who has written
numerous books on popular culture. ``The attention span of our
young people is too short, for one thing. I teach 18-year-olds, and
these people have no sense of what happened five years ago, let
alone historical events that occurred as long ago as Vietnam. And
they don't care.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Europe still going up in smoke
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 20, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THUN, Switzerland _ I am sitting in a delicious little
restaurant in this equally delicious lakeside town scarfing down a
pizza that is the best I have tasted in years. Nevertheless, I am
choking. There is so much cigarette smoke floating around the
establishment that I find it difficult to breathe. The smoke is
smothering _ and embedding itself in my clothing for me to savor
the remainder of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true, as most medical studies confirm, that cigarette
smoke is a catalyst for cancer, then the entire population of
Europe ought to be extinct before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   As a former smoker (we're the worst kind), I found myself
strangling in secondary cigarette smoke in each and every Swiss
restaurant I ate in over a 10-day period _ as I have in other
European nations over the years.
</P>
<P>
   This surprised me about Switzerland. I've always connected
obsessive smoking to anxiety, tension. That's why the Israelis
smoke so much; they don't know when bombs will go off or armies
invade. The French also throw up clouds of smoke and I always have
attributed that to the apprehension that yet another labor strike
will close the airports, the Metro, the hotels _ that striking
truckers will block the highways, that irate farmers will dump
their produce on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits smoke en masse, so do the Russians and just about
everyone else in Europe. This, despite overwhelming evidence of the
danger of cigarette smoke, certified by the announcement last week
that Philip Morris, the cigarette makers, have acknowledged that
smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the Swiss so stressed about? One could stretch the
imagination by saying they smoke too much because they're
distraught over their tarnished image; the Nazi gold notoriety
contradicting an otherwise placid habitat in a remarkably beautiful
country. But I think too few Swiss are concerned about this, and
even fewer a party to it. So I can't explain their inclination to
kill themselves (and me) in clouds of lethal smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting people, the Swiss. When traveling around the country
by train, you are afforded the choice of smoking or no-smoking
cars. In the hotels, there are no-smoking rooms if you so wish.
</P>
<P>
   But the restaurants? Open the door, walk in and expect the
worst. I did not find a Swiss restaurant that had a no-smoking
section. The best you can hope for is a table near the door, so
that when it opens a bit of fresh air blows in.
</P>
<P>
   We are not talking about just cigarette smoke here. We also are
dealing with pipes and cigars. It is a bombardment of assorted
fumes that permeate your food, your nostrils and your senses.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize until this visit how far ahead of the rest of
the world we Americans are when it comes to grappling with smoking
and its effects. We are eons ahead because we are making it safer
for non-smokers to dine, to attend public events, to do business in
public buildings without having second-hand smoke threaten our
tomorrows.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing people do here when they enter a restaurant is
reach into their pockets or purses and place a box of cigarettes on
the table, a statement that the smoke soon will begin to waft.
</P>
<P>
   And waft it does. It goes nowhere but into your lungs because
few of the restaurants are air-conditioned, the windows are shut
tight. The smoke spreads across the room much as an early-morning
fog settles over a field.
</P>
<P>
   You are the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always a sucker for Europe; love its culture, its
architecture, its scenery. But someday there might be an awful
price for me to pay for that enjoyment. My lungs can't take much
more.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gun lawsuits are a failure of politics
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Colt's Manufacturing, legendary gunmaker to the Wild West,
goes through with its reported plan to quit the retail handgun
business after 144 years, it may be doing the right thing, but it
will be doing it for the wrong reason.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's will be acting because lawyers scared the company into
it. Litigation _ whimsical, blunt and often profit-minded _ is a
poor substitute for politics as an instrument of public policy,
even when the fallout is in the public good, as is the case here.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's has indicated that in the future it will produce firearms
only for law enforcement and the military. It is reacting to the
growth industry in municipal lawsuits against gunmakers and in
private lawsuits seeking to hold manufacturers to costly account
for gun deaths.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Colt's and several other gunmakers have begun
toe-in-the-water talks with some of the suing cities that could
lead to lawsuits being dropped in exchange for improved gun safety
features and a commitment from manufacturers to take some
responsibility for the way their guns are distributed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   All this is to the good, after its fashion. Any restraint in the
current what-the-hell manner of firearms production and sale is
welcome, but this flurry of activity is more motion than change.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers that cynically produce firearms mainly for the
junior-high and street-thug trades are not involved. They
presumably will just write off any civil judgments against them as
business costs and go on arming street violence and suicide. The
danger of crippling court findings is distant anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Much anti-gun litigation mimics lawsuits against the tobacco
industry, but the courts have not yet bought into the dubious
argument that there's a liability equivalent between a product
that, despite its body count, has lawful and legitimate purposes
and one that sickens and kills in its intended use.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has fallen into this sloppy business of making
half-baked gun policy by legal threat because the political system
has defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby has forbidden the creation of a coherent,
purposeful control program. It has even spiked any political
discussion that might precipitate one. The National Rifle
Association crybabies about all the gun laws on the books now, but
the patchwork suits control opponents nicely. It is a busywork
illusion of control, more holes than material.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best the current lawsuit fad could produce is so
much unpredictability in the business environment that at least the
more sober gunmakers rethink their habitual alliance with the
gunners lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Does their industry's best future lie in continuing to pal
around with every gun-nut paranoia and hysteria the NRA can crank
out? Or might it lie in engaging with the political system in the
development of a stable, national system of common-sense controls?
</P>
<P>
   The Wild West shut down a century ago. Maybe even Colt's can see
that it's time to stop hanging around with the gunslingers.

KNOWING THE JARGON IS PHAT, PILGRIM
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes 6 color graphics illustrating words/Includes a 150-word

<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's phat, we're all about that, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse potatoes in the cube farm may be ROFL over treeware, but
they're just whacked. And whatever you do, don't say ''groovy.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole new vocabulary of slang out there, pilgrim. If
you know it, you're mackin'. If you don't, you're a granny.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all changes so quickly,'' said Connie C. Eble, a professor
of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who
has gained national attention for her updated glossaries of college
slang.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, slang by its very nature is always changing, said Wayne
Glowka, a professor of English at George College and State
University, who edits the new words section of The Journal of
American Speech.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, slang is nonstandard and usually ephemeral,
Glowka said. It is primarily used for in-group solidarity, spread
by members of a subculture or clique to identify each other.
College students make up vast quantities of slang, Glowka said, to
signal that they're part of an in-crowd.
</P>
<P>
   However, once outsiders _ nonstudents or even worse, your own
parents _ decode the slang and start using it themselves, well, it
just turns bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Much once-potent slang has recently been ''outed'' (shortened
verb form of ''out of the closet,'' i.e., exposed as a homosexual,
or, more generally, exposed). Now its meaning has been frayed or,
in some cases, reversed. ''Radical'' or ''rad,'' once a synonym for
''good'' or ''cool,'' now implies ''uncool'' or ''phony.'' And
while Glowka noted that ''cool'' has had a remarkably long run as
slang, Filters, an online magazine for skateboarders, reports that
''cool guy'' refers to fakers with bleached hair and Billabong
shirts _ outsiders trying to fake their way into the group, but
failing in an obvious or inept way.
</P>
<P>
   So what's _ to use an aging piece of slang _ in?
</P>
<P>
   Among the new usages Eble has catalogued are ''all that,'' as in
the recent movie ''She's All That,'' a phrase meaning ''smart,''
''attractive'' or ''appealing.'' Another new phrase is ''all
about,'' implying interest or obsession, like ''He's all about
Phantom Menace'' or ''I'm all about dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rap music remains a fertile source of slang, for both black and
white students, Eble said. ''Phat,'' meaning good, rich or
desirable, is one longstanding example. Another, more recent one,
is ''Benjamin,'' as in ''Benjamin Franklin,'' an in-group reference
to the $100 bills commonly used in drug deals, now used by students
to refer to any denomination of cash or currency. (''Dead
presidents,'' a phrase which also became a movie title, has a
similar meaning.)
</P>
<P>
   Still more rap-inspired slang includes ''da bomb,'' referring to
something very, very fine; ''booty'' for body, especially the
posterior of same; ''ill'' for good; or ''chronic'' for
high-quality.
</P>
<P>
   The drug subculture also supplies slang to the general
population, even for youngsters not using drugs. ''Dope'' signifies
better than cool, at least among some skateboarders. ''Bogart''
still implies selfishness, 30 years after Fraternity of Man sang
''Don't Bogart That Joint, My Friend (Pass It Over to Me)'' on the
soundtrack of the movie Easy Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another slang-generator is the virtual community of computer
users and hackers _ especially those forced to live in a symbiotic
relationship with corporate enterprise. The Berkeley Slang Database
notes a number of e-mail- and chat site-inspired abbreviations such
as ''ppl'' for ''people,'' ''lol'' for ''laughing out loud'' or
''rofl'' for ''rolling on the floor laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is laid on thick here; ''rofl'' implies a reaction to
something so dim or absurd, it's laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Other current computer-inspired slang:
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Mouse potato: The personal-computer equivalent of
television's couch potato; one who sits in front of a monitor,
playing with a computer mouse all day, while his physique
deteriorates to the approximate shape of a potato.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Treeware: Anything, such as books or documents, in
old-fashioned paper form. Used derisively.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Percussive Maintenance: The fine art of making
electronic hardware work properly by whacking it with one's palm or
fist.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have noticed, values are often transvalued in
slang; what was good for one generation becomes bad for the next
and vice versa. One example is the word ''geek.''
</P>
<P>
   When it first appeared, in the 1920s, the word referred to a
carnival performer who bit the head off live chickens or performed
some other disgusting act for money. Sometimes the word was used in
a pejorative sense as a synonym for freak.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the term ''computer geek,'' arose and was adapted by
software fanatics as a badge of pride. Now the phrase ''alpha
geek'' is often applied to the best PC user in the office.
</P>
<P>
   The same subversive spirit that turned Scott Adams' ''Dilbert''
books into best-sellers seems to have coined a lot of employee
slang as well. A business whose office is filled with the
ubiquitous cubicles is often called a ''cube farm.'' A large cube
farm becomes a ''cube prairie,'' and when its inhabitants poke
their heads over the walls to see what's going on, the phenomenon
is termed ''prairie-dogging.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other recent slang specimens from the post-college
lifestyle:
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Body Nazi: An exercise and weight-lifting fanatic who
goes too far, especially one who looks down on anyone who isn't as
obsessed as he or she is. The ''- Nazi'' construction can also be
applied to any rigid or tyrannical person, such as an anti-smoking
''health Nazi'' or Seinfeld's Soup Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Stress puppy: Someone who seems to thrive on being
stressed out, especially if he or she whines about it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) DINK: Acronym for ''Double Income, No Kids,'' the
epitome of the selfish (often yuppie) working couple. At the other
end of the spectrum from the DINKs are the SITCOMs (Single Income,
Two Children, Oppressive Mortgage).
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) McJob: Minimum-wage employment involving mindless,
repetitive skills, often at a fast-food establishment; not a real
source of income. A more recent corollary to this is the GOOD Job,
or ''Get-Out-Of-Debt'' Job, which one quits once one reaches
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Yuppie Food Stamps: The $20 bills spewed out of ATM
machines, usually to pay for lunch. Unavailable if the user has
been ''swiped out,'' i.e., if the magnetic strip on the ATM or
credit card has been worn off from overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the inevitable terminology for winners or losers.
A regular guy is still a ''dude'' it appears, and if he's ''mack''
or ''mackin' 6'' (a reference to ''Mack Daddy'' from rap lyrics),
he's in very good shape. Meanwhile a loser might be ''whacked,'' a
''trout'' or, in extreme cases, a ''chester.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ''pilgrim,'' as in ''Watch it, pilgrim!'' is often
used to address a newcomer or lesser member of the tribe _ a
backhanded tribute, apparently, to John Wayne. Somebody besides
Granny must be watching those old Westerns on AMC. bc-close

   (SIDEBAR)
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 College Slang Terms, as reported at California State
Polytechnic University, Pomona:
</P>
<P>
   10. Cool: Well, like, cool.
</P>
<P>
   9. Grub, grub on: To eat. The word itself dates back at least to
the 1600s, although its use as a verb (''Let's grub downtown - know
a place?'') is fairly recent.
</P>
<P>
   8. Dope: Good, better than good.
</P>
<P>
   7. My bad: My fault, my mistake. Implies apology.
</P>
<P>
   6. Kick it: Relax.
</P>
<P>
   5. Tight: Way cool, sharp, attractive. (Remember Booker T and
the MGs' Time is Tight, recorded 1968?)
</P>
<P>
   4. Player, playa: An individual (usually male) who dates many
people (usually secretly) all at the same time. Someone not serious
about a relationship. A real player can be a cheater who gets
caught.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trip, trip out: A '60s survivor. To act crazy or
overemotional, to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chill, chill out: To relax.
</P>
<P>
   And the top college slang word
</P>
<P>
   1. Dude: A person, usually male, usually positive.

PLANT BULBS NOW: SPRING FLING BEGINS IN AUTUMN
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo of a field of yellow daffodils) 
 By SUSAN McCLURE 
 c.1999 Susan McClure 
 World rights except Chicago

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although autumn leaves are turning crimson and burgundy, there
is no better time than the present for thinking about spring.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season of new beginnings for spring flowering bulbs,
plump packets that contain everything necessary for springtime
bliss. Inside the brown wrapping of a bulb are primordia for roots,
leaves, and flowers _ golden daffodils and cobalt grape hyacinths.
</P>
<P>
   While most people are familiar with spring standards such as
tulips, hyacinths, and crocus, new colors, forms, and even new
species are now available, enough to satisfy even the experienced
plant collector.
</P>
<P>
   Daffodils that bloom in many shades of pink, tulips with
clustered flowers instead of the solitary tear drop and exotic
newcomers never before seen in American gardens are among the
dynamic new offerings available this spring. If you can't find them
at the local garden center, you can find them in specialty
catalogues such as McClure &AMP; Zimmerman (1-800-883-6998), or Brent
and Becky's Bulbs (804-693-3966).
</P>
<P>
   According to Brent Heath, owner of Brent and Becky's Bulbs, the
following are some of the hottest options for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   * Mariposa or fairy lantern (Calochorus venustus): A native of
the Rocky Mountains, this American wildflower makes a marvelous cut
flower that will stay fresh in a vase for a month. The name
Calochortus is Greek, meaning beautiful grass, in reference to the
grasslike, gray-green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   From late spring into early summer, cup-shaped flowers emerge,
varying from white, to yellow, purple, and red with a yellow-ringed
red eye.
</P>
<P>
   Mariposas thrive if allowed to dry out when dormant in summer
and winter, doing best in well-drained sandy soils, and raised beds
that are not regularly irrigated.
</P>
<P>
   In northern climates, they may winter best in a sheltered
southern exposure or near the house, microclimates that offer
protection from winter's worst. To prevent alternating freezing and
thawing, which is hard on these bulbs, mulch the planting site
after Christmas with old evergreen boughs when the soil is frozen.
Remove the mulch in spring just before the soil thaws.
</P>
<P>
   * Corydalis solida ''Beth Evans'': Some shade gardeners may be
familiar with yellow corydalis, a perennial that resembles a wild
bleeding heart but can bloom all summer. This is its cousin, a
native of the European Balkans to Scandinavia. Clusters of tubular
flowers open in April, drifting over finely cut ferny foliage.
</P>
<P>
   A low grower, staying under 6 inches tall, it is a graceful
companion for draping over steps, retaining walls, or the perimeter
of paths. Once you find the right place for it, don't be surprised
if it multiplies, making a bold companion for nearby daffodils and
tulips.
</P>
<P>
   * Firecracker flower (Dachelostemma ida-maia): Like
attention-getting Fourth of July firecrackers, these flowers snap,
crackle, and pop with color when they open their firecracker-red
tubular flowers. The tips of the petals are lit with a golden green
edging.
</P>
<P>
   Natives of California and Oregon, they jump to life in late
June, sending their flowers up and out on arching stems from 1 to 3
feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Like mariposa, the hardiness of firecracker flowers are not
proven in cold winter areas. Protect them for best results.
</P>
<P>
   * New developments in classic bulbs: Some spectacular new colors
are available in our tried-and-true spring bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dynamic is the ''Valerie Finnis'' grape
hyacinth, a small bulb known for its long blooming season. Valerie
Finnis has larger flowers with a smoky, steel-gray petal color that
is particularly striking.
</P>
<P>
   A British gardener discovered the bulb that bears her name
growing in her garden. She displayed the flowers at a Royal
Horticultural Society flower show where it caught the eye of bulb
nurserymen. It was promptly propagated and made it available
worldwide. Planting Tips
</P>
<P>
   Spring flowering bulbs are among the easiest flowers to grow,
but provide the biggest rewards if you do a little planning before
you plant.
</P>
<P>
   Formal vs. Informal: For formal gardens, you can plant stately
bulbs like tulips and hyacinths in matching rows, squares,
rectangles, or circles. For informal clusters, appropriate to most
landscape beds, plant 5, 7, 9, 11 or other odd numbers of bulbs
such as daffodils in freeform clusters.
</P>
<P>
   Consider planting bulbs around hardy geraniums, daylilies,
hostas, Siberian irises, and other perennials in a flower garden or
between shrubs in a foundation planting. Naturalized bulbs such as
daffodils look great growing in ivy or periwinkle under shade
trees.
</P>
<P>
   With most bulbs, more is merrier. Planting dozens or hundreds
will fill your yard with spring color.
</P>
<P>
   Drainage: Make sure the soil is well-drained. In heavy soil,
bulbs may grow best planted in raised beds of amended soil.
</P>
<P>
   Critters: If you have lost small and shallowly planted bulbs
such as crocus to hungry chipmunks and other critters, enclose new
plantings in a wire mesh cage to keep animals out.
</P>
<P>
   If deer are a problem, avoid tulips and hyacinths and stick with
inedible bulbs such as daffodils, flowering onions, and squills.
</P>
<P>
   Digging In: Most bulbs thrive if planted three times as deep as
the height of the bulb, although there are some exceptions to this
rule. If in doubt, ask your bulb supplier about the best planting
depth.
</P>
<P>
   On point: Many bulbs have a flat end where the roots emerge and
a pointed end where the shoots arise. Set them in the hole with the
flat end down and the pointed end up to get them started off right.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding frenzy: If the soil is not already fertile, you can add
some bulb fertilizer (available at most garden centers) before
covering the bulbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Mark your spot: Firm the soil around the bulbs and mark their
location with a colored golf tee so you won't dig into them by
mistake.

<P>
   Year after year I stand dutifully at my door dispensing
Halloween candy. And year after year I'm struck by the difference
between the fantasies of little boys and their female counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The boys are always dressed as cowboys, pirates, soldiers,
spacemen, and monsters. When boys masquerade, they portray males
who do, who can. They become little men of action or powerful,
terrifying monsters. They fantasize dominance; if they can't
capture you, they'll eat you up. They also evince a peculiar
attraction for depicting mass murderers, serial killers and other
victims of an aberrant psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The girls show no such tendencies and their psyche seems
dominated by Walt Disney. They are princesses, fairies, brides, and
angels. In their glitter and flounces, the girls join the
time-honored tradition of helpless loveliness. Fairies are tiny.
The most potent thing they can do is be mischievous.
</P>
<P>
   And every time I ask a little girl if she's a queen, she assures
me she is actually a princess. Queens, I suppose, have a certain
authority and of course, they may not be pretty. They might be
evil, or heaven help us, old. Princesses on the other hand are
always gorgeous and need only wait for the appearance of princes.
Brides represent a perfect, passive ideal of beauty. And whoever
heard of an angel with much to dO but flutter around seraphically.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, my mother saw boys and girls dressed in
precisely the same way. It seems that for children, nothing much
has changed in spite of the women's movement, men's groups, the Age
of Aquarius, and guys doing dishes. How have girls and boys
remained so untouched by all the years of social upheaval? Perhaps
they are not so much unaffected by that as more affected by
advertising, movies, and toys.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it some biological imperative that populates boy dreams
with superheroes, fanged werewolves, and blood sucking vampires,
while girls imagine being Miss America?
</P>
<P>
   If Halloween in my mid-American neighborhood is representative,
then today's girls want what females have always been allowed and
educated to want: to be not only beautiful, but more beautiful than
all the rest. Today's little girls may be free to wear pants to
school and join baseball teams, but it seems that when it comes to
expressing their fantasies, they still come out pink and pretty.
</P>
<P>
   One girl who came to my door took it one step further. She was
dressed as a French Maid, in a low cut, short-skirted black outfit
with a white apron and cap and a black velvet bow at her throat
that looked more like a dog collar than a decoration. This girl
opted not only for beauty, but for subjugation too.
</P>
<P>
   Is this ''you've come a long way, baby'' consciousness? If so,
where did we start and where are we going?
</P>
<P>
   There was one girl, a little woman after my own heart, who
bucked all the stereotypes for a while. She came to my door three
years in row in the same costume. She was dressed as a dinosaur,
Tyrannosaurs rex no less, and her bright-eyed hopeful face peered
out from between huge sharp teeth. I always gave her extra treats.
But last Halloween, she too came dressed as a princess.
</P>
<P>
   I must be honest. I do see an occasional kid, sex unknown,
dressed as a pumpkin or a mouse. I attribute these kinds of
artistic costumes to mothers with sewing skill, few outlets for
their creativity and kids too young to fight back. My mother did
that to me. Not having any idea of what I really wanted to be, she
made me clever costumes that I hated.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one year she dressed me in paper bags and made a
bird's nest, complete with bird, for me to wear in my hair. I was a
tree. I won a prize. I was miserable. I wanted beauty and glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Each year brings a few witches. None of these girls, however,
opt for an ugly crone-like visage _ no warts, wild hair, beaked
noses, or toad companions. Every witch I see is cute as a button.
There are a few gypsy women too, but as every girl worth her salt
knows, choosing to be a gypsy is just a sure-fire way to get
permission to put on a face full of makeup. The gypsy girls at my
door did not look free, mysterious, and exotic, but more like
Barbie run amuck.
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the Annie Oakley's, Amazon warriors, female
pirates and bandits supreme? Our newly revised histories tell us
there were plenty of them. Doesn't any girl want to dress up as
Joan of Arc? And where's the boy who dream of being an elf, a
Prince Charming, or a groom?
</P>
<P>
   My own sons, who are truly sweet and gentle boys, have always
chosen to be something disgusting risen from dead, and over the
years I've become as adept as a theatrical pro at creating scars,
wounds, and bloody mutilations.
</P>
<P>
   I keep asking myself why. I ask them, and they find my curiosity
vastly amusing. ''Because,'' they patiently explain to me, ''it's
fun.'' But I'm haunted by the question of why the girls don't want
to look dreadfully, wonderfully scary and horribly, terrifyingly
ugly.

 &HT;    No semicolons? Give me a little break!
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I heard Kurt Vonnegut on public radio
recently. He talked about his new book of old short stories, ``The
Bagombo Snuff Box,'' and his years selling bad cars before he
became A Famous Writer. He was a hoot. A world-weary hoot, but
still a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   The famous writer and world-weary hoot gave sound writerly
advice: Don't use semicolons.
</P>
<P>
   Listen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me note that Kilgore Trout and I have never used
semicolons. They don't do anything. Don't suggest anything. They
are transvestite hermaphrodites.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he said in ``Timequake,'' his last novel, recently
out in paperback. He repeated it on the radio. (Kilgore Trout is a
character of his, a science-fiction writing fictional counterpart.)
</P>
<P>
   I must admit _ reluctantly _ that both he and Trout have a
strong point. We do not live in an age friendly to semicolons. We
expect stop-and-go, binary prose. They are out of place in a dot
com world.
</P>
<P>
   Semicolons are supposed to act like a stop sign on a deserted
street; they beg the reader to make a rolling stop.
</P>
<P>
   They are a halfway measure between the speed-bump of a comma and
the red light of a period.
</P>
<P>
   I got out of high school with no idea what to do with them. They
were squiggles as mysterious as a hieroglyph when I landed in
college freshman English. But once I learned how to work them, I
sought opportunities to show off my new-found knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   To my great disappointment, nobody was impressed. Editors
converted them all into plain old dots. Killjoys.
</P>
<P>
   But despite my editors and Vonnegut, I feel we are losing
something by letting semicolons fall into disuse. Semicolons are a
sigh before continuing; a pause before a punch line; a turn of the
head and folding of the arms before Jack Benny says anything else:
they are a tool of timing too finely calibrated for our age of
online speed reading.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of cynical old Edward Gibbon's old-fashioned, long,
semicolon-studded sentences:
</P>
<P>
   ``The various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman
world, were all considered by the people as equally true; by the
philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading that kind of perfectly tuned three-part sentence is like
watching a triple play.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Vonnegut is stretching the truth when he boasts
of living well without semicolons. I have proof. Here's the opening
of his novel, ``Mother Night'':
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only story of mine whose moral I know. I don't
think it's a marvelous moral; I simply happen to know what it is:
We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we
pretend to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He is pretending to be a man without semicolons. And as he would
predict, that is what he has become.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes.
</P>
<P>
   I should clarify here that I'm talking only about real
semicolons used in real sentences. Not the run-of-the-mill,
who-cares semicolons thrown in to break up lists.
</P>
<P>
   I used those when I used to prepare the hog markets. Like this:
``220-260 lbs., 31.00-33.00; 220-260 lbs., 29.00-31.00; 200-220
lbs., too few ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why I was never too proud of them. They were mere
pig-semicolons. But at least editors let me keep them.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by my success as hog-market compiler, I persisted in
my drive to revive the semicolon in modern journalism. I failed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm older now and don't need to show off. It's been ages since
my finger strayed east of the L key to plant a semicolon next to an
independent clause. But Vonnegut's dissing the dot-squiggle made me
realize there's a danger here. If we allow the semicolon to pass
away, it's only a matter of time before writers of short, punchy
sentences go after the colon, too.
</P>
<P>
   We risk a slippery slope. Already Internet travelers are calling
a period a ``dot'' as though punctuation were just visual
decoration. Even commas, which used to be cheap, are being used
less and less as writers let introductory phrases fly headlong into
nouns. Pow.
</P>
<P>
   Writers and students! Reclaim the semicolon; there comes a time
when everyone deserves a little break.

 &HT;    Quality, not quantity, key in making a statement
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In a move to trim the number of hereditary
peers and to give itself the appearance of being more democratic,
Britain's House of Lords
</P>
<P>
   has ordered its 759 members to submit a brief statement
defending their right to the seats they've been occupying. And to
do it in 75 words or less.
</P>
<P>
   Once all submissions have been considered and voted upon,
officials will then elect 92 of the most deserving to remain in the
house. The other 667 will be told to hit the road Jack, or in this
instance, (SET ITAL)Lord(END ITAL) Jack.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of finding themselves in such a shocking situation,
the noblemen are chortling, in a snide but dignified manner, and
insisting that it would be impossible to chronicle a lifetime in so
brief a missive. ``Ludicrous,'' one has
</P>
<P>
   commented, asking if he should include his shoe size and number
of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but only if the latter exceeds the former, and if he can
get the job
</P>
<P>
   done within the 75-word limit.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, could one sum up an entire life (or so much of it
as has been lived thus far) in so few words? Can great stories be
told, or arguments made with such brevity? After all, 75 is a mere
five words longer than the Lord's Prayer. On the other hand, the
Pledge of Allegiance is only 31 words.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of success for the milords would be to think in terms
of pithy
</P>
<P>
   but succinct. The KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid) that is
so useful in the classroom as the basic structure of a three-point,
five-paragraph essay could be of some assistance here. That is,
unless the peers, like politicians, are incapable of applying such
a formula to their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, however, history records a success.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the hand-lettered sign President Truman had on his
desk: ``The buck stops here.'' Point well made, I think, and in
only four words.
</P>
<P>
   October 1, 1939, and Britain is in the first month of a war with
Germany. Winston Churchill is speaking to his countrymen in a BBC
address, and in an attempt to explain the conundrum that is Russia,
he states simply: ``I cannot
</P>
<P>
   forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in
a mystery
</P>
<P>
   inside an enigma. ...'' Twenty words _ still true.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure a deeply troubled nation, Franklin D.
Roosevelt in his first inaugural address on March 4, 1933, spoke
these words: ``Let me assert my
</P>
<P>
   firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself.'' Seventeen
</P>
<P>
   words that worked.
</P>
<P>
   Tongue-in-cheek, as was usually the case, Mark Twain wrote:
``Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to.'' Ten words.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was my father's dinner blessing that, because of his
rapid-fire delivery, was open to misinterpretation, but
nevertheless effective: ``Lord make us thankful for these and all
our blessings. Amen.'' Eleven words, including the Amen, although
for years I thought he was saying: ``Lord megga-sankle freeze
</P>
<P>
   and all our blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   The noble British gentlemen have a lot riding on a mere 75 words
where a lack of brevity and pith could be catastrophic. Of course,
it's possible they might take a lesson from Minnesota's Gov. Jesse
Ventura, who tells it quick and straight
</P>
<P>
   (as he sees it), but they'd have to bear in mind that this guv'
seems to
</P>
<P>
   open a can of worms every time he opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up one's life and accomplishments in so few words could
be a formidable, but not impossible task. My son did rather well, I
thought, once he quit goofing around. ``The most important thing I
have accomplished,'' he wrote
</P>
<P>
   at my request, ``is the true friendship of a very select few
individuals and
</P>
<P>
   the love of my family. Notable enough, I'm happy.'' Twenty-seven
words, one contraction, and enough said.

 &HT;    College students have it good because others have seen to it
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Talk about changes. Send your daughter to college
and she gets a mustache.
</P>
<P>
   The wipe-off kind, that is. It's mustaches across the board on
any Tuesday, which is Dr Pepper Hour at Baylor University.
</P>
<P>
   For over 40 years the university has maintained a tradition:
invite students for floats _ Dr Pepper and Blue Bell _ or the hard
stuff straight up.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bill Daniel Student Center recently I was struck by this
scene and by this great concept.
</P>
<P>
   College, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Take an idyllic setting. Stock it with magnificent buildings,
brainy mentors and books. Stir in sports and lively arts, not just
for spectating but for participating.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, stock with really fine young people and tell them,
``Here. Become friends for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a concept, and quite in contrast to the concept I remember
trying to nurse away from a certain high schooler one night last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He had a deep case of sophomore blahs. Pointless, he said about
college. Pointless and dull and perfunctory. You punch a time
clock, sit in rows, for the privilege of living.
</P>
<P>
   Not pointless, we said. A means of living beyond the means of,
say, the guy emptying the grease trap at Burger City.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me tell you. That ``means'' stuff may pay bills later
on, but it won't get you to the counter with a high school
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a junior. Though still not ready to model anyone's
letter sweater, I do think I heard him say the other day that _ in
concept _college had a certain appeal.
</P>
<P>
   I swallowed the impulse to stand on the table and sing the alma
mater. Any alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Certain appeal? You've got that right. I was ruminating on it
the other day while strolling the Baylor campus, just one of
countless options.
</P>
<P>
   I got my first look at the new Drayton McLain Student Life
Center. If that doesn't put a smile on a young person's lips, I
want to see what does. You've seen Emerald City in the movies?
Well, this involves more green ($21 million to be exact).
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you're reminded of Neil Young's song ``Sugar Mountain,''
in part because there's a man-made mountain inside, a
two-story-high climbing rock with youngsters clinging and
clambering, and others admiring as if it were a sundae. In a room a
few feet away is a pool with a water slide and a ``lazy river.''
Most densely populated is the fitness room, where a veritable
dormful of students sweat out some spare time before a row of
monster TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the intramural field is multicolored commotion that
really strikes a chord with me. In addition to working on the
college newspaper, I must have played every intramural sport there
was.
</P>
<P>
   College is just one of the greatest concepts ever invented _
fields of green laid out before you, time to work, time to play,
time to establish yourself as something far beyond a worker drone.
</P>
<P>
   Little discoveries made in college often are major.
</P>
<P>
   At my college we had an on-campus night spot called the
Ramskellar _ live entertainment, commonly bands, but sometimes
stand-up comedians.
</P>
<P>
   A roommate who was into comedy kept bugging me to go see one
comedian who put him in stitches. The man was unknown, but my
roomie assured me we'd hear more of him.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin was the stand-up's name.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones played our campus. I learned to bowl. I
learned photography and Marshall McLuhan and Immanuel Kant.
</P>
<P>
   That's college. And that is a gift.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a freebie. Your share of actual costs aside, with
excellent grades and test scores you'll have earned it. In the end,
however, you'll have to admit that someone you never knew did you a
huge favor just because he or she bought into a splendid concept.
</P>
<P>
   You and college, that is.

 &HT;    Quicken upgrade a bit buggy
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to personal finance software, Mac users
don't have much choice. It's either Intuit's Quicken or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Intuit has done a pretty good job with Quicken. The
company just released the latest version, called Quicken 2000, and
it's a nice upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been two years since the latest version, you
won't find any major breakthroughs in terms of features in Quicken
2000. This version largely represents a fine-tuning of old features
and a touch-up of the program's look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   As always with a Quicken update, there's a host of bugs.
Internet bulletin boards have been plastered with user complaints.
The biggest seems to be the inability of Quicken 2000 in some cases
to read and update old files.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled launches are nothing new for the latest versions of
Quicken, which are often buggy. The good news is that Intuit is
pretty good about fixing problems through patches that can be
downloaded from the Internet or your local Mac users bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've had no problem with either installing or
updating my Quicken files to the latest version. I suspect problems
are isolated and probably created by conflicts with certain system
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The best new addition to Quicken 2000 is something called the
Insight window. It's a customized screen that gives you a snapshot
of your financial status.
</P>
<P>
   Insight can list and total all your accounts, including credit
card debt, and display in multicolored charts your cash flow or
lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The other big change is the new, cleaned-up interface. Gone are
the big buttons that lined the top and left side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   They have been replaced with a tabbed toolbar along the top of
the screen. You can customize both the tabs and the toolbars under
each of them. This is a less cluttered, easier-to-use layout.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a tighter integration with the
Internet. Quicken 2000 comes with direct links to Intuit's vast Web
presence. With a click of a button you can download through Quicken
2000 historical share prices of mutual funds or individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   You can also jump to services that provide comparative shopping
for insurance, mortgages and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite among the new features is a small but
highly useful change. Quicken can now accurately recognize
electronic payments. In the past, many merchants were identified
only as addresses if you banked electronically through Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   Should you run out and buy Quicken 2000? It depends on the
strength of your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Go out and upgrade if you don't mind the potential risk of some
buggy installation and conversion problems. Otherwise, wait a few
more weeks until Intuit inevitably posts the fixes on the Internet.

 &HT;    Deal puts spotlight on unsigned musicians of MP3.com
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the rest of the recording industry tries to
figure out what to do about digital music downloads, some prominent
industry executives are actually hiring bands from MP3.com, the
popular digital music download site.
</P>
<P>
   For those with the time and patience to wade through the
thousands of artists on the site, there's a good chance that you
might find, as Chief Executive Michael Robertson puts it, ``the
best music you never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers have been trolling through ``slush piles'' for
years, hoping to find the Great American Novel buried among the
thousands of unsolicited manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com _ the ultimate slush pile _ eliminates the middleman for
music industry executives. Sure, they can spend every night in a
smoke-filled rock club checking out every unsigned band from Maine
to Monterey _ and some people do enjoy passing the time this way.
</P>
<P>
   However, with MP3.com, you can pretty much do the same thing in
the comfort of your home or office. The beer is cheaper, and you
can get a clean glass if you want one.
</P>
<P>
   This week, producers Francis Ford Coppola and Larry Sugar said
they would be picking out tunes for their cable TV series ``First
Wave'' solely from artists who make their music available on
MP3.com. Artists who'd like to submit their work for inclusion on
the show can get information at www.mp3.com/firstwave. Fans of the
show who like the music they hear will be able to listen to it or
purchase it only on the MP3.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Both MP3.com and Coppola's production company are enthusiastic
about the deal. Steve Love, the music executive who helped
orchestrate the deal, said in a statement that the relationship
helps offer potentially global exposure to MP3.com artists.
</P>
<P>
   TV and movie producers turning to MP3.com will show a lot of
ordinary consumers that there's some good music out there on the
Web _ and that the site will help them find it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, says this
type of deal is part of a continued effort by MP3.com to make order
out of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3.com as a big flea market,'' he says. ``The number of
relationships they've announced lately is designed to help people
sort through that flea market and give traditional television
production companies and radio stations access to that flea
market.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com says it wants to be the biggest source of music on the
Web, but the bigger it gets, the more urgent it will be to develop
ways for consumers to separate good online music from bad online
music.
</P>
<P>
   Deals with TV, movie and radio companies, such as the deal
earlier this year with Cox Interactive Media, allow those companies
to sort through MP3.com's vast roster of artists, choosing some of
the better music for their projects. Listeners and viewers will
then be directed to MP3.com to download the music. But instead of
going to MP3.com and hoping for the best, they'll have major media
properties guiding them to the best music, and MP3.com will promote
the music on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say this is a good move because most consumers don't
want to wade through piles of unfamiliar music. They want someone _
whether it's Rolling Stone magazine or the local radio station _ to
do the dirty work of finding good music for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want access to enjoyable entertainment, with some
degree of filtering,'' Hardie says. ``That's how the real world
works. And the real world does work. It's not broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives like to talk about building and establishing
their brand and branding themselves with consumers. At first it
sounds like a bunch of techno-marketing speak, but what they are
really saying is they have to persuade consumers to take their
products seriously.
</P>
<P>
   They realize they have to build credibility with people who
really don't believe anything that only exists online can possibly
be good. Cross-promotion with familiar brands, such as television
and movies, is designed to make online music, magazines and even
e-commerce sites more acceptable to consumers unused to making
purchases, listening to music or reading magazines over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, anybody can be a publisher, open a store or be a
recording artist. The only way Web surfers can separate the good
from the bad is to read every online e-zine or listen to every file
on MP3.com, which nobody really has the time or inclination to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have a perception that absent some sort of
filtering, it's not the same quality as what they might buy in a
record store,'' Hardie says. ``It hasn't proven itself yet.''

   WASHINGTON _ For retailers, the holiday shopping season is the
crucial period of the year when their decisions about inventory,
staffing, pricing and advertising will result in drinking champagne
in January _ or bathing in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the stakes are even higher for merchants who plan
to use the Internet to capture customers. The electronic retailers,
or e-tailers, who can attract eyeballs and open wallets during the
last 10 weeks of 1999 may well become the masters of merchandising
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an absolutely huge season for online companies,''
said David Baltaxe, who studies Internet commerce for Current
Analysis, a research firm in Sterling, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Having enough merchandise in stock, employees on hand and
sophisticated technology in place will be the keys to handling
explosive growth, he said. ``This is the first year that we'll have
real mainstream shopping done through the Internet. Sales are
expected to be three times what they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much Christmas shopping will be done on the Web
vary from roughly $5 billion to $8 billion. Whatever the final
tally, it is sure to be a leap from last year's $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important to e-tailers will be the ``buzz'' the
season generates. Companies that perform well from mid-October
through December could see their stock prices rocket up in January
as more investors become believers in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Christmas '99 is so important because it will be
the first time that millions of Americans will try shopping with a
mouse rather than at a mall. Their experiences could shape a
lifetime of buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly scenarios haunt e-tail boosters who fear those experiences
won't measure up to expectations. They worry that shoppers will
show up online, only to find they can't get accurate inventory
information or understand how to complete orders. Or perhaps
consumers will find what they want and buy it, only to discover the
delivery system is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my nightmare: It's December 23rd and I'm at the mall
shopping because the things I ordered didn't show up,'' said Mary
Helen Gillespie, president of e-BuyersGuide.com, a Burlington,
Mass., firm that gives consumers advice.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are turning to the Web because ``they want to make
things easier for themselves,'' Gillespie said. Online merchants
``have to fulfill those expectations, not make life more difficult.
If they don't perform, people are going to say: 'I'm never going
back there.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if consumers find Web shopping a breeze, the
retail world may be turned upside down. Traditional merchandisers
who expect customers to drive to a store during business hours may
find they can't compete with the 24-hour-a-day e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's round-the-clock convenience will be the main lure
during the hectic holiday season for Damali Noel, a 27-year-old
Atlanta resident who recently made an online purchase through
FlowersAGoGo.com, a Decatur, Ga.,- based florist. She said that
smooth transaction has encouraged her to try surfing the Web for
bigger purchases during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats leaving the house,'' she said. ``You can sit in your
robe ... and shop in the middle of the night. It's very
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that convenience is what draws people to the Web, Wall
Street analysts are trying to figure out which kinds of companies
have the best chance of getting everything right. The Internet
offers essentially three formats for buying goods. One is the pure
Internet company, such as Amazon.com, which operates only in
cyberspace. Some observers believe these Web-only businesses will
be the winners in the e-tail world because of their laser-like
focus on online consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But others predict this holiday season will reveal the strengths
of the second type of Web merchant: the traditional retailers who
have stretched over into the Internet. Their advantage is having
real storefronts where shoppers can return merchandise without
having to ship goods back. For example, if a consumer goes on line
to buy a Christmas present through gap.com, he knows the recipient
will be able to return the gift at any Gap store and pick out
something that fits better.
</P>
<P>
   The third type of online merchant is the catalog company, which
sits somewhere between the Internet-only e-tailers and the
traditional stores with Web sites. The companies with vast
experience in direct merchandising are trying to use their brand
names and well-developed delivery systems to leap ahead of others
online.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End, the 35-year-old clothes company based in Wisconsin,
is perhaps the most aggressive in trying to make the transition
from the printed catalog to the Web. Last year, the company sold
about $61 million worth of goods through its Web site, or about 4.5
percent of total sales. That was up from $18 million in 1997. So
far this year, Web-based sales are running at 2.5 times last year's
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, vice president of electronic commerce at Lands' End,
said that to boost holiday sales, the company has started offering
a ``live chat'' box to allow customers to ``talk'' to sales clerks
while looking at merchandise on line. By clicking on the chat box,
the shopper will synchronize her screen with the clerk's so that
together, they can exchange messages about clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper also can use the ``shop-with-a-friend'' option,
which brings a companion into the chat. That will allow, for
example, two sisters who live hundreds of miles apart to go on line
together and chat while picking out a present for their parents,
Bass said. In addition, they can put the clothes on a model, a
cyberfigure who can be configured to resemble the recipient of the
gift.
</P>
<P>
   By using these new technologies, Lands' End hopes to greatly
reduce shoppers' concerns about making exchanges of gifts. ``We are
trying very hard to make sure you get the right product right from
the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, the e-commerce analyst, said Lands' End's
spending spree to boost technology and staffing is typical this
year. ``A lot of money has been spent to make sure people are
ready,'' he said. ``Last year, some Web sites crashed because they
weren't prepared for the crush of business. ... They won't let that
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is so intense because the scrutiny from Wall Street
will be so close, he said. ``Now is the time to prove you can grab
(online customers) and make sure they enjoy using you,'' he said.
``If you can do that, you'll find the Holy Grail _ the ability to
carry over customers'' into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Big holiday sales and satisfied customers will prompt venture
capitalists and stock investors to pour much more money into
e-commerce, making instant millionaires, even billionaires, out of
many e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   Those entrepreneurs are hoping they'll please first-time holiday
shoppers like Jennifer Reichenbach, a 32-year-old Atlanta resident
who recently has begun making purchases online, primarily because
of the 24-hour-a-day convenience. ``I really, really like it,'' she
said. ``In fact, I almost fear getting addicted to it.''

 &HT;    Flashy download speed often immaterial to task at hand
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Come a little closer. Today I'm going to tell you a
dirty little secret that all those folks pushing high-speed
Internet access _ whether through a cable modem, digital subscriber
line, ISDN or satellite receiver _ would just as soon you not
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what you do on the Internet at home works fine at the
speeds you get from an old-fashioned telephone line modem. If, like
most folks, your prime use of the Internet is sending and receiving
e-mail, you probably won't notice any difference between that now
old-fashioned analog modem and a high-speed connection. If you
enjoy chat _ either in one of the Internet chat groups or on AOL _
same thing, no difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the Web _ where many pages contain enormous amounts of
data, including photographs, videos and sound _ where the speed
difference pays off. I have a cable modem at home, and I do see a
big difference on the Web. But, for me now, the Web is a place to
look up specific information. I don't ``surf'' as often anymore _
aimlessly wandering from one site to another just for amusement.
So, if I still used my old-fashioned modem instead of the cable
modem I use (mostly because I do this stuff for a living), it would
be a matter of waiting 30 seconds for the answer to my question
about the population of Sao Paulo, Brazil, instead of the
five-second wait with my cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing that you may not know. Often, the real
delays on the Web have nothing at all to do with how fast a
connection you have to the Internet. Sometimes _ lots of times, in
fact _ it's the traffic on a particular Web site that is slowing
things down, not your connection.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love my cable modem. But I am saying that
_ depending on how you use the Internet and how much money you have
to spend _ you may be able to live a reasonably full and productive
online life without the added expense of high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   While we are at it, let's talk about another misconception about
Internet speed _ and maybe save you some money.
</P>
<P>
   It's not at all uncommon for me to receive a long e-mail from a
reader, asking what kind of new computer they need to speed things
up. These aren't dumb questions because even some of the national
advertising I see from computer companies, including Dell, seems to
equate a high-power PC with high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that your PC (unless it is an old 80486
machine) probably is plenty fast enough for using the Internet. I'd
rank PC power way down on the list when it comes to making a
difference in how fast a Web page loads. The most important factor
is connection speed, followed by general conditions on the Web (how
much traffic there is). In fact, I'd rank the stage of the moon and
the way you hold your mouth when you type ahead of computing power
when it comes to making a difference in Net speed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. For the most part (and there are exceptions, but
they aren't important) your PC _ when connected to the Net _ is
acting as a ``dumb terminal.'' The real computing work is being
done by the computers on the Web and on the Net. Your computer is
simply taking this information _ relayed by the Web site and your
Internet provider _ and displaying it on the screen. Some amount of
computing is going on, mostly by Windows and the Web browser, but
the really heavy lifting doesn't happen on your machine.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's my advice. If you want a new PC, if you want a
high-speed Internet connection, go ahead and buy one and get
high-speed access if you can afford it and understand the
limitations. But if you're counting pennies at your house _ as I do
_ then don't feel obliged to own the best of everything when it
comes to the Internet.

 &HT;    Colorful iMac line a trendsetter
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer's zoomy iMac line has kicked off a trend that few
thought would happen. Manufacturers are racing to provide colorful
new computers and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue of Yahoo Internet Life looks at this trend
and tries to determine whether it will last. Among companies that
have jumped on the color bandwagon are Epson, Iomega and
HandSpring, the new maker of hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the big computer media companies are selling out to
bigger rivals. Boston-based IDG, publisher of InfoWeek and
ComputerWorld, is staying proudly independent. Read about the
company's leaders and strategy in the October issue of MC. For IDG,
independence hasn't meant standing still. The magazine says the
company is undergoing a major cultural change to keep itself a
strong competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Sega Dreamcast, the latest video console, has been on the market
less than a month, but developers are releasing a steady stream of
new games for the platform. The latest is ``The House of the Dead
2.'' This arcade-style game, available in stores now, features a
horror story depicted in 3-D color. The retail price is about $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris,'' one of the first digital games, lives on. Hasbro
Interactive has released the latest version of this classic, a
title in which players must fit together falling geometric blocks.
Called ``The Next Tetris,'' the game features breakaway and sticky
blocks, as well as the opportunity to play against others.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest trends in software now is open-source code.
Anyone can take and improve on this software code, which is
unprotected by corporations or copyright laws. The Linux operating
system is the biggest example, but there are plenty of other
open-source projects under way.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can find out all about them in one place. Xnot is a site
that lists links to all the open-source projects across the
Internet. New projects are added weekly. You'll find this site at
www.xnot.com.

 &HT;    One site can manage all passwords
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First there was the PC. Then they added things to make
it worthwhile to us, programs that process words and crunch numbers
_ and an operating system to make it all manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Internet, and they added things like search
engines and e-mail accounts and airline reservations and online
banking to make it worthwhile to us. But how do you manage it all?
How do you keep track of all the sites and all the passwords?
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Vertical One, in Atlanta, have a way to reach all
your online accounts through one site and one password. Microsoft's
Passport product does something similar on sites that are part of
the Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Desktop.com, a San Francisco start-up that has
developed a desktop interface for the Internet. The idea is to make
all Internet functions _ e-mail, calendars, bookmarks, phone lists
_ accessible from the Web, which means it would be accessible
anywhere there's Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The free service is available at www.desktop.com. Users can
store files that can be shared with other users, as well as
bookmarks. The service logs users on to the sites that require
passwords. Desktop.com does not yet work on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY LAWS TACKLE SPAM, SECURITY ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, state legislators introduced 59 bills dealing with
online and Internet privacy issues, according to the Center for
Social and Legal Research. This year, about 80 online
privacy-related bills have been introduced in state legislatures.
Of those, 14 have been enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   Most were related to a few specific areas: the sending of spam,
or junk e-mail, and the verification of digital signatures and
records. Eight states _ Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia,
Connecticut, Nevada, Oklahoma, Washington and Tennessee _ enacted
anti-spam laws. Most try to ban deceitful in-state spam by
requiring that people or companies that send large amounts of spam
use accurate names, addresses and subject lines. In New York,
California, Connecticut, North Carolina, Virginia and West
Virginia, sending spam can be a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Resume on Web OK with most workers
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech labor crunch certainly has skewed the job market
toward sellers. People are becoming more comfortable with the idea
of posting resumes on the Web, even if their boss is looking.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey sponsored by CareerMosaic, an online job
site, 80 percent of the 400 asked said they had no concern about
posting their resume on a Web site where it can be viewed by
anyone. Most people, 95 percent of those asked, said they were
comfortable applying online to job openings. The survey was
conducted by Cyber Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 83 percent of those interviewed and almost all college
graduates (94 percent) have a resume prepared.
</P>
<P>
   _ About the same number, 82 percent, know how to cut-and-paste
their resume into a job search database.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone asked said they would go back to the Internet to
research a company before interviewing there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most online access (93 percent) takes places at home. But 59
percent are on the Internet at work, 58.5 percent at school and
19.1 percent at places like libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men are more likely than women to be online at work, 67
percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most job hunters, 79 percent, check the Web more than once
each day. And most, 73 percent, said they have been using the
Internet since before 1997.

 &HT;    New call-waiting modem actually works as billed
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always a real thrill when I try out a piece of
hardware and find that (1) it does what it's supposed to do without
threats or pleas and (2) what it does is actually useful.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is a pleasure to report my experience with a little item
called the Call Waiting Modem, made by Actiontec. It's close to an
ideal solution for those folks who don't want to get a telephone
line just for their computer.
</P>
<P>
   It works, of course, only if you subscribe to the call-waiting
feature on your line. It's a stylish little purple-and-cream box _
although you can get an internal version, as well. In stand-alone
versions, it comes in a standard serial port model and another for
the new-fangled USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   Bold as brass, I tried the USB model. It could not have been
simpler to install. Once plugged in, Windows 98 recognized it,
called for the driver provided on a CD-ROM, and set it up without a
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it actually worked, just as advertised. When calls came
in, the modem rang. Then I picked up the telephone to see who was
there. The modem gave me about seven seconds to get rid of the
caller; if I didn't hang up by then it severed the Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be set to cut the online connection the minute you
pick up the phone, or you can instruct it to ignore incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, I had a problem with the speed of the Actiontec Call
Waiting Modem. But in the course of spending several hours fooling
with it, I learned a few things.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it wants to connect using the old 56KFlex
standard, which few ISPs support any longer. It routinely dropped
back to the standard V34 protocol, and we crawled along at 28k. The
manual suggests a register setting to dispense with the 56KFlex
business and go directly to V90, the most modern 56k protocol.
That, however, only got us up to around 31.6k.
</P>
<P>
   We have two telephone lines coming into our house, one for the
computers and one for voice. To test the modem's call-waiting
feature, it was easier to use the voice line. So, in an effort to
give the little guy every break, I hooked it up to the regular
modem line.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. Right away it was cooking along at 49k, and you can't ask
for much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time through the years hectoring the
telephone company into improving the quality of that line, but I
wouldn't have guessed it made that much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The modem has a list price of $135. It can probably be found at
retail stores for considerably less. Actiontec, at
www.actiontec.com, has a $50 rebate deal going now, which brings it
down to a very reasonable price.

 &HT;    Quicken upgrade a bit buggy
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to personal finance software, Mac users
don't have much choice. It's either Intuit's Quicken or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Intuit has done a pretty good job with Quicken. The
company just released the latest version, called Quicken 2000, and
it's a nice upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been two years since the latest version, you
won't find any major breakthroughs in terms of features in Quicken
2000. This version largely represents a fine-tuning of old features
and a touch-up of the program's look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   As always with a Quicken update, there's a host of bugs.
Internet bulletin boards have been plastered with user complaints.
The biggest seems to be the inability of Quicken 2000 in some cases
to read and update old files.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled launches are nothing new for the latest versions of
Quicken, which are often buggy. The good news is that Intuit is
pretty good about fixing problems through patches that can be
downloaded from the Internet or your local Mac users bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've had no problem with either installing or
updating my Quicken files to the latest version. I suspect problems
are isolated and probably created by conflicts with certain system
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The best new addition to Quicken 2000 is something called the
Insight window. It's a customized screen that gives you a snapshot
of your financial status.
</P>
<P>
   Insight can list and total all your accounts, including credit
card debt, and display in multicolored charts your cash flow or
lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The other big change is the new, cleaned-up interface. Gone are
the big buttons that lined the top and left side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   They have been replaced with a tabbed toolbar along the top of
the screen. You can customize both the tabs and the toolbars under
each of them. This is a less cluttered, easier-to-use layout.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a tighter integration with the
Internet. Quicken 2000 comes with direct links to Intuit's vast Web
presence. With a click of a button you can download through Quicken
2000 historical share prices of mutual funds or individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   You can also jump to services that provide comparative shopping
for insurance, mortgages and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite among the new features is a small but
highly useful change. Quicken can now accurately recognize
electronic payments. In the past, many merchants were identified
only as addresses if you banked electronically through Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   Should you run out and buy Quicken 2000? It depends on the
strength of your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Go out and upgrade if you don't mind the potential risk of some
buggy installation and conversion problems. Otherwise, wait a few
more weeks until Intuit inevitably posts the fixes on the Internet.

 &HT;    Deal puts spotlight on unsigned musicians of MP3.com
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the rest of the recording industry tries to
figure out what to do about digital music downloads, some prominent
industry executives are actually hiring bands from MP3.com, the
popular digital music download site.
</P>
<P>
   For those with the time and patience to wade through the
thousands of artists on the site, there's a good chance that you
might find, as Chief Executive Michael Robertson puts it, ``the
best music you never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers have been trolling through ``slush piles'' for
years, hoping to find the Great American Novel buried among the
thousands of unsolicited manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com _ the ultimate slush pile _ eliminates the middleman for
music industry executives. Sure, they can spend every night in a
smoke-filled rock club checking out every unsigned band from Maine
to Monterey _ and some people do enjoy passing the time this way.
</P>
<P>
   However, with MP3.com, you can pretty much do the same thing in
the comfort of your home or office. The beer is cheaper, and you
can get a clean glass if you want one.
</P>
<P>
   This week, producers Francis Ford Coppola and Larry Sugar said
they would be picking out tunes for their cable TV series ``First
Wave'' solely from artists who make their music available on
MP3.com. Artists who'd like to submit their work for inclusion on
the show can get information at www.mp3.com/firstwave. Fans of the
show who like the music they hear will be able to listen to it or
purchase it only on the MP3.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Both MP3.com and Coppola's production company are enthusiastic
about the deal. Steve Love, the music executive who helped
orchestrate the deal, said in a statement that the relationship
helps offer potentially global exposure to MP3.com artists.
</P>
<P>
   TV and movie producers turning to MP3.com will show a lot of
ordinary consumers that there's some good music out there on the
Web _ and that the site will help them find it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, says this
type of deal is part of a continued effort by MP3.com to make order
out of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3.com as a big flea market,'' he says. ``The number of
relationships they've announced lately is designed to help people
sort through that flea market and give traditional television
production companies and radio stations access to that flea
market.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com says it wants to be the biggest source of music on the
Web, but the bigger it gets, the more urgent it will be to develop
ways for consumers to separate good online music from bad online
music.
</P>
<P>
   Deals with TV, movie and radio companies, such as the deal
earlier this year with Cox Interactive Media, allow those companies
to sort through MP3.com's vast roster of artists, choosing some of
the better music for their projects. Listeners and viewers will
then be directed to MP3.com to download the music. But instead of
going to MP3.com and hoping for the best, they'll have major media
properties guiding them to the best music, and MP3.com will promote
the music on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say this is a good move because most consumers don't
want to wade through piles of unfamiliar music. They want someone _
whether it's Rolling Stone magazine or the local radio station _ to
do the dirty work of finding good music for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want access to enjoyable entertainment, with some
degree of filtering,'' Hardie says. ``That's how the real world
works. And the real world does work. It's not broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives like to talk about building and establishing
their brand and branding themselves with consumers. At first it
sounds like a bunch of techno-marketing speak, but what they are
really saying is they have to persuade consumers to take their
products seriously.
</P>
<P>
   They realize they have to build credibility with people who
really don't believe anything that only exists online can possibly
be good. Cross-promotion with familiar brands, such as television
and movies, is designed to make online music, magazines and even
e-commerce sites more acceptable to consumers unused to making
purchases, listening to music or reading magazines over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, anybody can be a publisher, open a store or be a
recording artist. The only way Web surfers can separate the good
from the bad is to read every online e-zine or listen to every file
on MP3.com, which nobody really has the time or inclination to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have a perception that absent some sort of
filtering, it's not the same quality as what they might buy in a
record store,'' Hardie says. ``It hasn't proven itself yet.''

 &HT;    This year could be key to making 'e-tailing' mainstream
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For retailers, the holiday shopping season is the
crucial period of the year when their decisions about inventory,
staffing, pricing and advertising will result in drinking champagne
in January _ or bathing in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the stakes are even higher for merchants who plan
to use the Internet to capture customers. The electronic retailers,
or e-tailers, who can attract eyeballs and open wallets during the
last 10 weeks of 1999 may well become the masters of merchandising
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an absolutely huge season for online companies,''
said David Baltaxe, who studies Internet commerce for Current
Analysis, a research firm in Sterling, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Having enough merchandise in stock, employees on hand and
sophisticated technology in place will be the keys to handling
explosive growth, he said. ``This is the first year that we'll have
real mainstream shopping done through the Internet. Sales are
expected to be three times what they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much Christmas shopping will be done on the Web
vary from roughly $5 billion to $8 billion. Whatever the final
tally, it is sure to be a leap from last year's $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important to e-tailers will be the ``buzz'' the
season generates. Companies that perform well from mid-October
through December could see their stock prices rocket up in January
as more investors become believers in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Christmas '99 is so important because it will be
the first time that millions of Americans will try shopping with a
mouse rather than at a mall. Their experiences could shape a
lifetime of buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly scenarios haunt e-tail boosters who fear those experiences
won't measure up to expectations. They worry that shoppers will
show up online, only to find they can't get accurate inventory
information or understand how to complete orders. Or perhaps
consumers will find what they want and buy it, only to discover the
delivery system is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my nightmare: It's December 23rd and I'm at the mall
shopping because the things I ordered didn't show up,'' said Mary
Helen Gillespie, president of e-BuyersGuide.com, a Burlington,
Mass., firm that gives consumers advice.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are turning to the Web because ``they want to make
things easier for themselves,'' Gillespie said. Online merchants
``have to fulfill those expectations, not make life more difficult.
If they don't perform, people are going to say: 'I'm never going
back there.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if consumers find Web shopping a breeze, the
retail world may be turned upside down. Traditional merchandisers
who expect customers to drive to a store during business hours may
find they can't compete with the 24-hour-a-day e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's round-the-clock convenience will be the main lure
during the hectic holiday season for Damali Noel, a 27-year-old
Atlanta resident who recently made an online purchase through
FlowersAGoGo.com, a Decatur, Ga.,- based florist. She said that
smooth transaction has encouraged her to try surfing the Web for
bigger purchases during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats leaving the house,'' she said. ``You can sit in your
robe ... and shop in the middle of the night. It's very
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that convenience is what draws people to the Web, Wall
Street analysts are trying to figure out which kinds of companies
have the best chance of getting everything right. The Internet
offers essentially three formats for buying goods. One is the pure
Internet company, such as Amazon.com, which operates only in
cyberspace. Some observers believe these Web-only businesses will
be the winners in the e-tail world because of their laser-like
focus on online consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But others predict this holiday season will reveal the strengths
of the second type of Web merchant: the traditional retailers who
have stretched over into the Internet. Their advantage is having
real storefronts where shoppers can return merchandise without
having to ship goods back. For example, if a consumer goes on line
to buy a Christmas present through gap.com, he knows the recipient
will be able to return the gift at any Gap store and pick out
something that fits better.
</P>
<P>
   The third type of online merchant is the catalog company, which
sits somewhere between the Internet-only e-tailers and the
traditional stores with Web sites. The companies with vast
experience in direct merchandising are trying to use their brand
names and well-developed delivery systems to leap ahead of others
online.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End, the 35-year-old clothes company based in Wisconsin,
is perhaps the most aggressive in trying to make the transition
from the printed catalog to the Web. Last year, the company sold
about $61 million worth of goods through its Web site, or about 4.5
percent of total sales. That was up from $18 million in 1997. So
far this year, Web-based sales are running at 2.5 times last year's
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, vice president of electronic commerce at Lands' End,
said that to boost holiday sales, the company has started offering
a ``live chat'' box to allow customers to ``talk'' to sales clerks
while looking at merchandise on line. By clicking on the chat box,
the shopper will synchronize her screen with the clerk's so that
together, they can exchange messages about clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper also can use the ``shop-with-a-friend'' option,
which brings a companion into the chat. That will allow, for
example, two sisters who live hundreds of miles apart to go on line
together and chat while picking out a present for their parents,
Bass said. In addition, they can put the clothes on a model, a
cyberfigure who can be configured to resemble the recipient of the
gift.
</P>
<P>
   By using these new technologies, Lands' End hopes to greatly
reduce shoppers' concerns about making exchanges of gifts. ``We are
trying very hard to make sure you get the right product right from
the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, the e-commerce analyst, said Lands' End's
spending spree to boost technology and staffing is typical this
year. ``A lot of money has been spent to make sure people are
ready,'' he said. ``Last year, some Web sites crashed because they
weren't prepared for the crush of business. ... They won't let that
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is so intense because the scrutiny from Wall Street
will be so close, he said. ``Now is the time to prove you can grab
(online customers) and make sure they enjoy using you,'' he said.
``If you can do that, you'll find the Holy Grail _ the ability to
carry over customers'' into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Big holiday sales and satisfied customers will prompt venture
capitalists and stock investors to pour much more money into
e-commerce, making instant millionaires, even billionaires, out of
many e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   Those entrepreneurs are hoping they'll please first-time holiday
shoppers like Jennifer Reichenbach, a 32-year-old Atlanta resident
who recently has begun making purchases online, primarily because
of the 24-hour-a-day convenience. ``I really, really like it,'' she
said. ``In fact, I almost fear getting addicted to it.''

 &HT;    Colorful iMac line a trendsetter
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer's zoomy iMac line has kicked off a trend that few
thought would happen. Manufacturers are racing to provide colorful
new computers and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue of Yahoo Internet Life looks at this trend
and tries to determine whether it will last. Among companies that
have jumped on the color bandwagon are Epson, Iomega and
HandSpring, the new maker of hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the big computer media companies are selling out to
bigger rivals. Boston-based IDG, publisher of InfoWeek and
ComputerWorld, is staying proudly independent. Read about the
company's leaders and strategy in the October issue of MC. For IDG,
independence hasn't meant standing still. The magazine says the
company is undergoing a major cultural change to keep itself a
strong competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Sega Dreamcast, the latest video console, has been on the market
less than a month, but developers are releasing a steady stream of
new games for the platform. The latest is ``The House of the Dead
2.'' This arcade-style game, available in stores now, features a
horror story depicted in 3-D color. The retail price is about $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris,'' one of the first digital games, lives on. Hasbro
Interactive has released the latest version of this classic, a
title in which players must fit together falling geometric blocks.
Called ``The Next Tetris,'' the game features breakaway and sticky
blocks, as well as the opportunity to play against others.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest trends in software now is open-source code.
Anyone can take and improve on this software code, which is
unprotected by corporations or copyright laws. The Linux operating
system is the biggest example, but there are plenty of other
open-source projects under way.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can find out all about them in one place. Xnot is a site
that lists links to all the open-source projects across the
Internet. New projects are added weekly. You'll find this site at
www.xnot.com.

 &HT;    New call-waiting modem actually works as billed
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always a real thrill when I try out a piece of
hardware and find that (1) it does what it's supposed to do without
threats or pleas and (2) what it does is actually useful.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is a pleasure to report my experience with a little item
called the Call Waiting Modem, made by Actiontec. It's close to an
ideal solution for those folks who don't want to get a telephone
line just for their computer.
</P>
<P>
   It works, of course, only if you subscribe to the call-waiting
feature on your line. It's a stylish little purple-and-cream box _
although you can get an internal version, as well. In stand-alone
versions, it comes in a standard serial port model and another for
the new-fangled USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   Bold as brass, I tried the USB model. It could not have been
simpler to install. Once plugged in, Windows 98 recognized it,
called for the driver provided on a CD-ROM, and set it up without a
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it actually worked, just as advertised. When calls came
in, the modem rang. Then I picked up the telephone to see who was
there. The modem gave me about seven seconds to get rid of the
caller; if I didn't hang up by then it severed the Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be set to cut the online connection the minute you
pick up the phone, or you can instruct it to ignore incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, I had a problem with the speed of the Actiontec Call
Waiting Modem. But in the course of spending several hours fooling
with it, I learned a few things.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it wants to connect using the old 56KFlex
standard, which few ISPs support any longer. It routinely dropped
back to the standard V34 protocol, and we crawled along at 28k. The
manual suggests a register setting to dispense with the 56KFlex
business and go directly to V90, the most modern 56k protocol.
That, however, only got us up to around 31.6k.
</P>
<P>
   We have two telephone lines coming into our house, one for the
computers and one for voice. To test the modem's call-waiting
feature, it was easier to use the voice line. So, in an effort to
give the little guy every break, I hooked it up to the regular
modem line.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. Right away it was cooking along at 49k, and you can't ask
for much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time through the years hectoring the
telephone company into improving the quality of that line, but I
wouldn't have guessed it made that much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The modem has a list price of $135. It can probably be found at
retail stores for considerably less. Actiontec, at
www.actiontec.com, has a $50 rebate deal going now, which brings it
down to a very reasonable price.

 &HT;    Flashy download speed often immaterial to task at hand
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Come a little closer. Today I'm going to tell you a
dirty little secret that all those folks pushing high-speed
Internet access _ whether through a cable modem, digital subscriber
line, ISDN or satellite receiver _ would just as soon you not
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what you do on the Internet at home works fine at the
speeds you get from an old-fashioned telephone line modem. If, like
most folks, your prime use of the Internet is sending and receiving
e-mail, you probably won't notice any difference between that now
old-fashioned analog modem and a high-speed connection. If you
enjoy chat _ either in one of the Internet chat groups or on AOL _
same thing, no difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the Web _ where many pages contain enormous amounts of
data, including photographs, videos and sound _ where the speed
difference pays off. I have a cable modem at home, and I do see a
big difference on the Web. But, for me now, the Web is a place to
look up specific information. I don't ``surf'' as often anymore _
aimlessly wandering from one site to another just for amusement.
So, if I still used my old-fashioned modem instead of the cable
modem I use (mostly because I do this stuff for a living), it would
be a matter of waiting 30 seconds for the answer to my question
about the population of Sao Paulo, Brazil, instead of the
five-second wait with my cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing that you may not know. Often, the real
delays on the Web have nothing at all to do with how fast a
connection you have to the Internet. Sometimes _ lots of times, in
fact _ it's the traffic on a particular Web site that is slowing
things down, not your connection.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love my cable modem. But I am saying that
_ depending on how you use the Internet and how much money you have
to spend _ you may be able to live a reasonably full and productive
online life without the added expense of high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   While we are at it, let's talk about another misconception about
Internet speed _ and maybe save you some money.
</P>
<P>
   It's not at all uncommon for me to receive a long e-mail from a
reader, asking what kind of new computer they need to speed things
up. These aren't dumb questions because even some of the national
advertising I see from computer companies, including Dell, seems to
equate a high-power PC with high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that your PC (unless it is an old 80486
machine) probably is plenty fast enough for using the Internet. I'd
rank PC power way down on the list when it comes to making a
difference in how fast a Web page loads. The most important factor
is connection speed, followed by general conditions on the Web (how
much traffic there is). In fact, I'd rank the stage of the moon and
the way you hold your mouth when you type ahead of computing power
when it comes to making a difference in Net speed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. For the most part (and there are exceptions, but
they aren't important) your PC _ when connected to the Net _ is
acting as a ``dumb terminal.'' The real computing work is being
done by the computers on the Web and on the Net. Your computer is
simply taking this information _ relayed by the Web site and your
Internet provider _ and displaying it on the screen. Some amount of
computing is going on, mostly by Windows and the Web browser, but
the really heavy lifting doesn't happen on your machine.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's my advice. If you want a new PC, if you want a
high-speed Internet connection, go ahead and buy one and get
high-speed access if you can afford it and understand the
limitations. But if you're counting pennies at your house _ as I do
_ then don't feel obliged to own the best of everything when it
comes to the Internet.

 &HT;    CBS as trendy? It could happen soon
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Viacom's purchase of CBS slated for
approval any day now, will viewers of the Big Eye notice any
difference?
</P>
<P>
   Will Dan Rather turn up on Viacom-owned MTV as a guest veejay
decked out in an Old Navy sweater? Will David Letterman be farmed
out to ``The Real World'' for a round of Stupid Teen Tricks?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But expect to see a shift in tone and demographics
sooner rather than later. It didn't take long after Disney bought
ABC in 1996 for Disney movies and Disney-produced sitcoms to be
sprayed like fairy dust all over ABC's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as big a deal when General Electric bought NBC. There
were charges that NBC News had become slanted, notably an instance
in 1990 when ``Today'' reported on several consumer boycotts but
ignored a big one against GE. About the only thing viewers noticed
on the entertainment front was an increase in ``Late Night'' jokes
about the lights going out in Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Viacom announced its purchase of CBS for $35 billion,
the largest media merger since Walt Disney Co. bought ABC/Capital
Cities for $19 billion. CBS had been on the block for a long time.
Ted Turner tried to buy it in the mid-1980s, and there were
whispers about Disney's interest later in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, corporations are merging and buying out their
competition. If Sprint and MCI become one big conglomerate, your
phone bill and Internet bill and maybe even your cable bill will
morph into one humongous bill.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate gobbling isn't just happening in telecommunications.
There's a long history of it across the corporate landscape. Philip
Morris Inc., the folks who helped create a nation of smokers (and
coughers), also sells macaroni and cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS/Viacom merger continues an opposites-attract trend. Of
all the commercial networks, CBS skews the oldest. That means there
are more viewers over 49 watching CBS than ABC, NBC or Fox. That's
not good business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the network finished last season No. 1 in the
ratings, industry folks considered the victory a flop because of
the older demographics _ advertisers prefer shows that target
free-spending youth. CBS's top-rated shows are ``60 Minutes,''
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ``JAG.'' Not exactly youth magnets
like ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS entertainment chief Leslie Moonves proudly crowed to critics
in July that the ``other guys'' were welcome to the teeny-boppers
and twentysomethings. CBS would happily continue to pursue a mass
audience, and that includes older viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But with Viacom at the helm, that's not likely to continue,
according to several ad buyers who predict the lure of bigger bucks
for younger viewers will be too strong to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The Viacom influence may not be apparent by next fall, since
development of those shows is in the works. But by 2001 _ and maybe
even by midseason next year _ we could see a change. Look for less
talk about aging boomers and mass appeal and more talk about
younger demos and target audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts almost universally say the media marriage of CBS
and Viacom is good for both sides. The network of William Paley and
Walter Cronkite could use some fresh blood and fresh ideas. The MTV
influence may seem extreme, but don't forget that Viacom also owns
MTV's kid cable phenomenon Nickelodeon, arguably the best source
for innovation on commercial TV.
</P>
<P>
   CBS hasn't fared too well on Saturday mornings, and Nickelodeon
_ home of clever tyke shows ``Hey, Arnold,'' ``Blue's Clues'' and
``Rugrats'' _ could do wonders for the Big Eye by supplying
producers and writers and maybe even reruns of the shows
themselves. Nor has CBS been able to attract kids and teens to
early evening sitcoms the way ABC has done on Friday nights and NBC
has done with ``Friends.'' The creative Nick folks who crafted the
sketch comedy show ``All That'' and the teen sitcom ``Kenan &AMP; Kel''
could probably fix CBS's woes in that area, too.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks, which have been bleeding viewers to
cable for years, believe the answer to their problems is to
circumvent the competition by copying cable. Fox _ now headed by
former Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog _ has done a pretty good
job in that regard by luring ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head'' creator Mike
Judge to produce ``King of the Hill'' and giving David E. Kelley
plenty of room to indulge his fantasies with ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But CBS's successes have been more traditional. The only
slightly innovative show on CBS this season is ``Now and Again,'' a
high-tech updating of ``The Six Million Dollar Man.'' The
Viacom-MTV influence could pump CBS's prime-time schedule in the
new millennium with hip, sardonic shows like the animated ``Daria''
and ``Celebrity Death Match.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the distant future, well, Letterman won't last forever.
His ratings are sagging, and, to hear him tell it, so is he. The
good old days of Dave sticking to walls in Velcro suits and tossing
watermelons off skyscrapers are long gone. If CBS wants to go for
late-night weirdness, it could replace Letterman with wacky standup
Tom Green, whose MTV show is a major hit with young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft macaroni didn't start adding nicotine to its packages
after Philip Morris bought the company, and Mike Wallace isn't
likely to turn up hosting ``Blue's Clues.'' But there will be
changes.

 &HT;    Students asked to take pledge against gun violence
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every day, kids throughout the country pledge
allegiance to the flag of the United States, but on Thursday,
thousands of Georgia kids will make a different type of pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls on children of all
ages to promise not to bring a gun to school or to use violence to
settle an argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right that kids are getting killed every
day,'' said East Cobb Middle School eighth-grader Michael Schlact.
``By signing this pledge, we're trying to put an end to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old said he feels safe at his own school, but gun
violence is always a worry after shootings such as the ones in
Colorado and Georgia last school year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Michael signed the pledge. This year, he helped
distribute packets to every school system in Georgia asking them to
participate. The packets include the official pledge for older
students and a similar pledge more simply worded for younger
children.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence began four years ago.
While some Georgia schools participated at that time, it wasn't
until two years ago that Georgia got involved on a statewide level.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Lindsey, youth service chair for the Georgia Parent
Teacher Association, said everyone is getting involved because
they're realizing that violence can occur anywhere _ from urban and
suburban to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pledge really focuses on educating kids to use nonviolent
means of settling disputes,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 1 million American kids _ including 67,000
Georgians _ signed the Student Pledge Against Gun Violence. This
year, organizers expect Georgia's number to double.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the pledge says:
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge: I will never bring a gun to school; I will never use
a gun to settle a dispute; I will use my influence with my friends
to keep them from using guns to settle disputes; my individual
choices and actions, when multiplied by those of young people
throughout the country, will make a difference. Together, by
honoring this pledge, we can reverse the violence and grow up in
safety.''

 &HT;    6 billionth child is born
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The number of people living on Earth doubled in less
than 40 years, hitting 6 billion on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Really, tens of thousands of children were born on that day. But
the United Nations _ which we learned about last week in NFK _
chose one child to represent the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed a baby boy in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He was born to refugee parents in that East
European nation.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials and others around the world worry about
the rapidly increasing population. Many children will live in
poverty in developing nations. In fact, one-third of those who live
in the world's poorest countries won't survive past age 5.
</P>
<P>
   ARMY TAKES OVER PAKISTAN
</P>
<P>
   Army Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf toppled the elected government
of Pakistan last week. He then declared himself the supreme leader
of the Asian country. He suspended the constitution, which is the
document that establishes the way the government will run. He also
dissolved the legislature, which is similar to our Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came three days after the general ousted the
prime minister in a bloodless ``coup d'etat.'' A coup d'etat is a
sudden change of government that is unlawful or by force.
</P>
<P>
   The coup is not expected to affect the nation's nuclear weapons
because they were always controlled by the military.

 &HT;    MiniDisc players cheaper with new Sharp product
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's getting cheaper to carry around a miniature
digital recording studio. New Jersey-based Sharp Electronics Corp.
has introduced a personal MiniDisc player/recorder that the company
says is the first of its kind to retail for less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's MD-MT15 has many of the features of more expensive
machines, but while most other MiniDisc player/recorders start in
the $300 range, the MD-MT15's suggested price is $199.95.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-MT15 is just under four inches square and records music
and other sound on small discs similar to CDs. Each disc holds 74
minutes of sound, and blank discs are sold for about $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's new MiniDisc player/recorder is powered by a
rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery that allows 12 hours of
playback or seven hours of recording. It has a 10-second memory so
it can continue playing without interruption if it is shaken or
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   The player has a view screen, and the user can mark songs on the
disc with a titling function. The device also marks selections with
the date and time they were recorded. Sharp claims discs can be
rerecorded up to 1 million times without losing sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on the MD-MT15 and the nine other
MiniDisc players in the Sharp line, call (800) 237-4277 (BE-SHARP).
The MD-MT15 was not included on the Sharp Web site as of last week,
but you can access information on or order other products at
www.sharp-usa.com.

 &HT;    One site can manage all passwords
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First there was the PC. Then they added things to make
it worthwhile to us, programs that process words and crunch numbers
_ and an operating system to make it all manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Internet, and they added things like search
engines and e-mail accounts and airline reservations and online
banking to make it worthwhile to us. But how do you manage it all?
How do you keep track of all the sites and all the passwords?
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Vertical One, in Atlanta, have a way to reach all
your online accounts through one site and one password. Microsoft's
Passport product does something similar on sites that are part of
the Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Desktop.com, a San Francisco start-up that has
developed a desktop interface for the Internet. The idea is to make
all Internet functions _ e-mail, calendars, bookmarks, phone lists
_ accessible from the Web, which means it would be accessible
anywhere there's Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The free service is available at www.desktop.com. Users can
store files that can be shared with other users, as well as
bookmarks. The service logs users on to the sites that require
passwords. Desktop.com does not yet work on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY LAWS TACKLE SPAM, SECURITY ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, state legislators introduced 59 bills dealing with
online and Internet privacy issues, according to the Center for
Social and Legal Research. This year, about 80 online
privacy-related bills have been introduced in state legislatures.
Of those, 14 have been enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   Most were related to a few specific areas: the sending of spam,
or junk e-mail, and the verification of digital signatures and
records. Eight states _ Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia,
Connecticut, Nevada, Oklahoma, Washington and Tennessee _ enacted
anti-spam laws. Most try to ban deceitful in-state spam by
requiring that people or companies that send large amounts of spam
use accurate names, addresses and subject lines. In New York,
California, Connecticut, North Carolina, Virginia and West
Virginia, sending spam can be a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Resume on Web OK with most workers
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech labor crunch certainly has skewed the job market
toward sellers. People are becoming more comfortable with the idea
of posting resumes on the Web, even if their boss is looking.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey sponsored by CareerMosaic, an online job
site, 80 percent of the 400 asked said they had no concern about
posting their resume on a Web site where it can be viewed by
anyone. Most people, 95 percent of those asked, said they were
comfortable applying online to job openings. The survey was
conducted by Cyber Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 83 percent of those interviewed and almost all college
graduates (94 percent) have a resume prepared.
</P>
<P>
   _ About the same number, 82 percent, know how to cut-and-paste
their resume into a job search database.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone asked said they would go back to the Internet to
research a company before interviewing there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most online access (93 percent) takes places at home. But 59
percent are on the Internet at work, 58.5 percent at school and
19.1 percent at places like libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men are more likely than women to be online at work, 67
percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most job hunters, 79 percent, check the Web more than once
each day. And most, 73 percent, said they have been using the
Internet since before 1997.

 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: What is the story behind the three longhorns
that roam the ``front yard'' at the Westinghouse building on
Interstate 35? Could we have our photograph taken with them or
perhaps other longhorns in this area, such as Bevo? It would be fun
to send such a picture of us back to our old neighborhood to show
them that we have a new ``pet.'' _ K.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, cowgirl, you can have your picture taken with a
longhorn, but not these longhorns. These steers are not docile
enough to entertain humans. The land was originally planned as a
park, but became pasture instead. The Longhorns grazing at
TECO-Westinghouse are named Freeloader, Fiddlesticks and Remington.
They were preceded by Sancho, Quijote, El Tejas and Scooter, whose
horns are on display inside the facility. Years ago El Tejas jumped
the company fence and strolled Interstate 35. El Tejas survived.
Bet he made a few Suburbans dance, though. To take a ``Merry
Christmas Y'All'' or ``Look at us Now'' photo for a small fee,
contact Ralph Fisher at (409) 247-4999, whose longhorns are famous
(and very tame), or Pat Beach of CalPat Ranch at (512) 281-9603,
where you can pose on top of Nike the red steer.

   Q: I bought my father some Scotch whisky in a 1.75 liter bottle
back in December 1997. He is the only one who drinks scotch. Is it
safe to serve now? _ B.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Should be fine. Technically liquor, unlike wine, will last
forever, says Todd Murrell of Steve's Liquor &AMP; Fine Wines. Of
course, when scotch is stored in extreme temperatures, the taste
may be adversely affected. Scotch, the heart of a Rusty Nail or a
Rob Roy cocktail, is often consumed neat _ no ice, no water, no
kidding. Whiskey is an interesting word from the Irish ``uisge
beatha,'' meaning water of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was curious if the use of waterless hand soaps is OK or
even better than the time-honored way. And if so, is the same
amount of time for washing the hands, 15 or 20 seconds, necessary?
Most of the waterless hand soaps are alcohol-based, so I assume
they would be good for killing germs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don Zappone
</P>
<P>
   A: The traditional soap and water combo reaches into the pores
better than waterless hand soaps. When you are traveling or have no
other way to wash your hands, waterless soaps are great, says
pharmacist J.D. Harper at Crestview Pharmacy. Anywhere from 5-15
seconds should do it. These soaps contain alcohol or an antiseptic
as an antibacterial agent. Still doubtful? Harper uses them on
occasion. Q: I conducted an interview using a recorder and
audiocassette. The sound quality is fine except for a 30-minute
portion of the discussion that I recorded in a moving car. The
background noise makes the discussion inaudible, though our voices
are clearly present under the roar of the vehicle. Can anyone
remove the unwanted noise, heighten the voices or in some way save
my interview?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hard to know until an expert listens to the tape.
Thebackground noise will be sampled and then attenuated (weakened)
with computer processing. The background noise cannot be completely
eliminated without affecting the quality of the recorded
conversation, but the contrast between the conversation and the
background can be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I ordered a cord of wood, but I do not know what a cord is.
Is there a way to be sure I got what I paid for? _ Doris R.
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet. Measure. A cord is 128 cubic feet (4 by 4 by 8 feet,
or 2 by 8 by 8 feet). So, if the logs are two feet long, the wood
stack should be one log width, 8 feet high and 8 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There must be two days a year when the sun rises exactly in
the east at a given latitude. What days are they in Austin? Don't
say, ``Who cares?'' _ David Alger
</P>
<P>
   A: I care. Brad Armosky of McDonald Observatory and Stardate
Magazine cares. The two days are the vernal (March 20, 2000) and
the autumnal (Sept. 23, 1999) equinoxes. ``On the equinox the sun
rises and sets due east and west regardless of latitude,'' says
Armosky. However, the angle at which the sun rises and sets is
affected by latitude. If you are at the North Pole on either
equinox day the sun appears to swim around the horizon rather than
rise or set; at the equator, the sun shoots straight up over the
horizon, is directly overhead at noon, and sets due west.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the employer required by law to give you two weeks' pay if
you have turned in a written notice of termination, and they let
you go? One of my co-workers says yes, I say no. _ A. Seguin
</P>
<P>
   A: You win. It is common for employers to ask an employee to
leave without working the full two-week notice period. Based on the
Texas Pay Day Law, ``the employer would not owe the employee money
for the two weeks where no service was performed,'' advises Laura
Thomas of the Texas Workforce Commission. Unless there is a written
policy stating ``leave will be paid upon termination,'' generally,
reimbursement for unused vacation or sick leave would not be paid.
Check that employee handbook. And think before quitting. For more
information on payday (and child labor laws) contact the
Commission's Labor Law Section at (800) 832-9243.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have not written a ``Dear Jane'' letter for 48 years, but
this is a little different. We have a water cooler that is not used
by many people, and sometimes the water is not used up for three
weeks. How long is it safe to have a bottle on a dispenser before
it should be removed and a new bottle installed? _ Bill S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Three weeks should not be a problem. Packaged and labeled
water is regulated by the Texas Department of Health. The water in
the bottle must come from an approved source, says Joe Dixon of the
Texas Department of Health. Bottled water plants are tested weekly
to ensure the bottling process is sanitary. Manufacturers of
bottled water are required to do a final sanitization before
capping to remove harmful bacteria (usually with ozone gas). If you
maintain the water cooler properly, the water should be potable for
6 to 12 months, concludes Dixon. Cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Quick question _ I have several of the old Silver Certificate
dollar bills that I saved when they were eliminated and replaced by
the Federal Reserve note. Can these be presented for silver at a
bank (silver bars, not coins)? _ Rick O.
</P>
<P>
   A: Quick answer: no. You are 31 years too late. An act of
Congress (June 24, 1967) provided that Silver Certificates could be
exchanged for silver bullion for one year (until June 24, 1968).
Your certificates are still legal tender. The Department of the
Treasury issued Silver Certificates beginning in 1878, and they
were redeemable for silver dollars until 1964.

 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: What is the story behind the three longhorns
that roam the ``front yard'' at the Westinghouse building on
Interstate 35? Could we have our photograph taken with them or
perhaps other longhorns in this area, such as Bevo? It would be fun
to send such a picture of us back to our old neighborhood to show
them that we have a new ``pet.'' _ K.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, cowgirl, you can have your picture taken with a
longhorn, but not these longhorns. These steers are not docile
enough to entertain humans. The land was originally planned as a
park, but became pasture instead. The Longhorns grazing at
TECO-Westinghouse are named Freeloader, Fiddlesticks and Remington.
They were preceded by Sancho, Quijote, El Tejas and Scooter, whose
horns are on display inside the facility. Years ago El Tejas jumped
the company fence and strolled Interstate 35. El Tejas survived.
Bet he made a few Suburbans dance, though. To take a ``Merry
Christmas Y'All'' or ``Look at us Now'' photo for a small fee,
contact Ralph Fisher at (409) 247-4999, whose longhorns are famous

   SYPHILIS-ROCKDALE _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Before May's Heritage High
shooting, an earlier scandal shook Rockdale County _ the diagnosis
of a cluster of syphilis cases among affluent teens less than 18
years old. In 1996, as Atlanta was preparing for the Olympics, 17
teens tested positive for syphilis, more than 200 were treated, and
about 50 acknowledged being part of a ring of kids who would meet
for group sex at each other's houses while parents were not around.
Tonight (Tuesday) a PBS Frontline documentary, ``The Lost Children
of Rockdale County,'' tells the story of the outbreak and talks to
many teens and some parents; it ultimately traces both the outbreak
and the school shooting to teen alienation, peer pressure and lack
of parental involvement. In advance of it, we talk to Rockdale
parents and teens, and community officials about the shock of
discovering the outbreak, the investigation of the cases and
reflect what health officials say are the lessons learned.

   SYPHILIS-ROCKDALE _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Before May's Heritage High
shooting, an earlier scandal shook Rockdale County _ the diagnosis
of a cluster of syphilis cases among affluent teens less than 18
years old. In 1996, as Atlanta was preparing for the Olympics, 17
teens tested positive for syphilis, more than 200 were treated, and
about 50 acknowledged being part of a ring of kids who would meet
for group sex at each other's houses while parents were not around.
Tonight (Tuesday) a PBS Frontline documentary, ``The Lost Children
of Rockdale County,'' tells the story of the outbreak and talks to
many teens and some parents; it ultimately traces both the outbreak
and the school shooting to teen alienation, peer pressure and lack
of parental involvement. In advance of it, we talk to Rockdale
parents and teens, and community officials about the shock of
discovering the outbreak, the investigation of the cases and
reflect what health officials say are the lessons learned.

   SCREENWRITER-KAUFMAN (San Francisco) _ The 1949 movie ``Home of

made, veteran screenwriter Millard Kaufman shrugged. ``You might
ask, first, why the subject was changed from a gay man to a Jew,''
said Kaufman, a good friend of the play's author, Arthur Laurents.

CONSUMERS OF AMERICA, UNITE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With the fuss over privacy on the Internet
heating up, it's past time for American consumers, which is every
one of us, to make the principles of the market economy work for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you buy goods or services and pay for them with a
credit card, and the sales clerk asks you to share some personal
information, you face a couple of pivotal choices.
</P>
<P>
   You can, as probably most people do, simply comply when your
phone number or ZIP code is solicited. Many don't so much as
question why this information is being sought, supposing the seller
is entitled to ask. Others may be uneasy about providing it, but do
so because they don't want to make a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you feel such questions are intruding into your
private life to an unwarranted degree, then, of course, you can
decline to respond, even in the face of insistence by the seller
that this information is required.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all circumstances, that is a false claim and violates
one or another law, and occasionally some companies' written
policy. The rationale for the legal protection is that your credit
card already establishes your credit with the issuing bank. No
additional information is needed to validate your purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses of all stripes, shapes and sizes lust after every
tidbit they can gather about the consumer because it is a terrific
way to make extra dough. These business are on their toes, not so
dull as to be content with having sold you the goods you bought,
and satisfied with a deserved profit. For them the quid pro quo of
a sale is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the consumer is a bountiful resource. However, unless
merchants take steps, that resource just lies there inert and
undeveloped. To make it productive, the resource needs to be
exploited, just as coal is mined and oil is pumped to provide for a
payoff.
</P>
<P>
   To develop a consumer to his or her fullest potential, the
essential first step is to harvest as much information as possible
about where you live, your phone number, your family, your
education, your income and the kinds of things and services you
have so far purchased.
</P>
<P>
   With those data in hand, a smart merchandiser has the means to
analyze what else you might be convinced to be interested to buy.
By refining the data into all their particularities, your simple
purchase of a widget one Saturday afternoon will surely lead to
your being offered by direct mail, telephone or Internet, widget
cleansers, widget holders, widget storage and widget insurance, not
to overlook bigger and better widgets. From being a one-time widget
buyer, you have been magically transformed into almost a cornucopia
of potential profits.
</P>
<P>
   If this is just fine with you, or at least acceptable, you are a
member of the silent majority.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as everyone else in the economy is doing so well by
you, this is also your opportunity to hop on the bandwagon and do
something for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   When you are in a drugstore emporium wanting to have a roll of
film developed, and you are asked to first fill out a questionnaire
to join a ``photo club'' in which you are not the least interested
...
</P>
<P>
   Or the checker at the department store asks you for additional
personal info ...
</P>
<P>
   Your correct response is not to meekly fork it over nor to throw
a fit of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you look the sales representative, or associate _ as
they have come to be widely known _ coldly in the eye, and in a
level tone of voice, you ask: ``What's it worth to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how much you value yourself, you might conclude a
deal on the spot. If in a supermarket, say, trade your data for all
the milk, cheese and eggs in your shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty good deal, but not good enough. After you and
yours have ingested and processed the milk, cheese and eggs, they
will be gone. But your personal information will be lodged in the
seller's computer forever.
</P>
<P>
   So you are advised to strike a harder bargain. Agree to share
your data for a set period of time and for a defined fee, in kind
or money. Remember, you are entitled to it. You are, after all, the
resource everyone covets. And by marketing yourself, you are only
doing for yourself as you have been done to.
</P>
<P>
   As a full-fledged participant in the free market, you are
entitled, like everyone else in it, to a decent profit.
</P>
<P>
   You may select whatever method of payment you can work out with
the seller. But whatever you do, do not, repeat not, give your data
away for nothing. As mothers have counseled throughout the
generations, if you do, no one will respect you.

 &HT;    BRAIN INJURIES SEEN INHIBITING DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL COMPASS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Magnetic imaging and psychological tests of two
persons who suffered brain injuries as small children suggest that
damage to a specific part of the brain may hinder the development
of a moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   The studies also raise the possibility that neuroscientists may
one day use drugs or other interventions to modify severe
anti-social behavior resulting from such injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The two individuals, a man and a woman, had suffered injury to
the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain above the eyes, as
small children. Both had psychological profiles similar to patients
who have been diagnosed as ``psychopaths'' or ``sociopaths,'' said
a team of Iowa researchers in an article published in the current
issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   They were reared in stable, middle-class homes by caring,
college-educated parents and had socially well-adapted siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they each had a pervasive disregard for moral and social
standards, lifelong irresponsibility and lack of remorse over harm
they caused other people.
</P>
<P>
   Their social and moral impairment seemed even worse than the
kind that has been observed in persons who experience similar brain
injuries as adults, said neuroscientist Antonio Damasio and his
colleagues at the University of Iowa College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Start optional trim
</P>
<P>
   Since 1848, when railroad worker Phineas Gage made medical
history after surviving a dynamiting accident in which an iron rod
was driven through his head, researchers have known that certain
brain injuries can lead to a type of moral impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rod was removed from Gage's brain and he evidently
emerged from the accident superficially normal, the experience
radically changed his personality.
</P>
<P>
   Once a conscientious worker, he became a hopeless drifter with a
callous disregard for his former loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   End optional trim
</P>
<P>
   Modern research has shown that adults injured in the prefrontal
cortex, especially an area known as the orbitofrontal cortex, or
OFC, seem to understand ``right from wrong'' but are unable to
incorporate that understanding into their everyday decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But studies of the two persons with lifelong injury to the same
areas suggest they never were able to acquire moral or social
knowledge in the first place. ``Right'' and ``wrong'' were concepts
they appeared never to have been able to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Start optional trim
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary on the research, British neuroscientist Raymond
Dolan noted that Damasio is the originator of the ``somatic-marker
hypothesis'' to explain the role of the OFC has on complex
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   End optional trim
</P>
<P>
   The OFC, Damasio suggests, links current decisions to knowledge
and feelings acquired in past experience. On the basis of brain
lesion studies and psychological tests, he has suggested that
persons with injury to the OFC are unable to invoke emotions that
normally bias their decisions on the basis of previously learned
lessons.

   Without this emotion-based guidance, such persons may be unable

   The Iowa researchers compared detailed psychological studies of
the two individuals, a man and a woman, with magnetic resonance
imaging of their brains. Although they do not report why they chose
these two individuals for study, they note that persons with known
prefontal cortex damage and lifelong ``behaviorial dysfunction''
are exceedingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was 20 years old at the time of the studies. She had
been run over by a vehicle when she was 15 months old, and by the
time she was three years old, she was first noted to be largely
unresponsive to verbal or physical punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent and academically capable, she nonetheless failed in
school, was disruptive, frequently stole from other children and
was arrested for shoplifting. She could not hold a job and was
largely insensitive to the needs of the infant born because of her
early and risky sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The man was 23 and had undergone surgery for a right frontal
tumor at age three months. He recovered with no sign of recurrence.
By age nine, he showed general lack of motivation, limited social
interaction and brief, explosive outbursts of anger. He became
progressively more obese, could not hold a job as an adult, often
ate uncooked frozen foods, lied frequently without apparent motive
and showed no remorse for his behavior or ability to formulate
realistic plans. He exhibited no interest in the child he fathered
in a casual relationship.

   Magnetic resonance imaging of both subjects' brains showed
damage in the prefrontal cortex, the brunt of it borne by the OFC.

<P>
   ``The crucial element may involve a deficit in representing the
value of behavioral options that involve other people,'' Dolan
noted.
</P>
<P>
   If neurological and biological factors underly the ability to
acquire and use knowledge relevant to social and moral behavior, he
said, ``we will need to reappraise the societal challenges posed by
psychopathy and relarted disorders, which currently (and
conveniently) linger in a hinterland between psychiatry and
criminal services.''

SHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL: '89 QUAKE HAD ITS FINE MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The guys next to me at Peet's coffeehouse in the
Marina, a couple of blocks from where buildings collapsed and
burned in 1989, were looking at a newspaper article on the odds of
a Big One in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent chance by the year 2030?'' said one guy.
``That means there's a 30 percent chance of not having a big quake
in the next 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He was half-joking, but that's the way people look at things in
this land of perpetual start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, buy San Francisco real estate. It has less chance of
collapsing than Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the 10th anniversary of The Pretty Big One that
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, wrecked freeways and buildings
and killed 63 people.
</P>
<P>
   Denial, repression, too many scare stories, willful
miscalculation of the casino odds against us _ many are the things
that make us ignore a threat to our lives. But I have another
theory why people in the Bay Area aren't sufficiently frightened of
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The last one was too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better word is ``exciting.'' The '89 quake definitely
wasn't fun for those who lost friends and relatives or had houses
and freeways collapse around them. But the Bay Area was on a manic
edge for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Loma Prieta was the seismic equivalent of the Persian Gulf War.
It was a low-casualty quake, and we think of it as a time of glory
and heroism. That teaches us all the wrong lessons about
earthquakes, just as Operation Desert Storm was a misleading
example of a war.
</P>
<P>
   We lived very intensely for a few days and have stories to tell
forever. A man in Menlo Park called in late October of 1989 to say
he'd been out of town and had started a support group for those who
missed the quake.
</P>
<P>
   After the quake, everybody was in streets, many drinking beer on
that strange, hot night. Most of San Francisco was a party.
</P>
<P>
   Some yuppies I overheard in North Beach sucked on bottles of
Veuve Cliquot champagne, and one said cavalierly, ``Maybe after
this we'll go looting.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people remained indoors, like the guys looking at
skin magazines by flashlight in a porno shop on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   For several days San Franciscans pulled together, were polite to
each other and even stopped at traffic lights that weren't working,
something they don't do when the lights are working.
</P>
<P>
   The quake managed to be mythic without destroying everything.
</P>
<P>
   It stopped a World Series, diverting blimp coverage to the
burning Marina and a collapsed section of the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The video of a burning block that seemed to be the whole city
caused great concern among out-of-town relatives. At some level,
that made us happy.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was exciting. Why else would local television keep
running all that videotape of volunteers manning hoses?
</P>
<P>
   I must admit, I felt some exhilaration in having the routines of
society shaken apart for a few days. Everyone performed above and
beyond expectation, and I contributed to the myth of Loma Prieta by
writing about the generosity of people's response.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants gave away food and coffee. Food Not Bombs, whose
street soup kitchens are usually suppressed by the authorities, fed
tired and hungry San Francisco cops and firemen.
</P>
<P>
   A courier who had been trapped in his car under the fallen upper
deck of the Cypress Structure told me of his new ``best friend,'' a
man on his way home from shopping who found the courier in his
flattened Datsun. When the man dug a crowbar into what was left of
the courier's door, he said, ``I'm going to scratch your car. Is
that OK?''
</P>
<P>
   We loved our neighbors. But I hated the earthquake as soon as I
got to the office, where we had to put out a newspaper without
anything that runs on electricity.
</P>
<P>
   I was a rich man because I had a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays I keep two flashlights and spare batteries in my car,
along with clothes, work boots, a first aid kit and a canteen of
water that's probably turned green by now.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff looks pathetic in the trunk, but it's probably more
than most people have.
</P>
<P>
   The Loma Prieta anniversary and the U.S. Geological Survey
report on earthquake odds seem to have convinced some people to be
prepared for the earth to move. I swear I'll refill that canteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as something starts shaking, people start coming in,''
said Stan Deorian, co-owner of the Earthquake Store in Emeryville.
``They just need something to push them away from ... I mean, back
to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   That slip of the tongue said it all. The human brain says
reality is a stable earth. But it isn't, not in the San Francisco
Bay Area, where the map of faults looks like a railroad yard in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Like the guys at Peet's, most people are betting on the Earth
not convulsing for a while. Or else their attitude is to let the
chips fall where they may. And their homes, too.
</P>
<P>
   The next one won't be fun at all.
</P>

APPEALING TO CENTER MAKES POLITICAL SENSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower,
an accomplished quipster and one of the last openly liberal
politicians to get elected to statewide office in Texas, has
observed on numerous occasions that there is ``nothing in the
middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he overlooked hundreds of election winners who owe
their victories to their ability to appeal to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   As most people know by now, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has
collected a lot of yellow paint on his shoes in his carefully
scripted campaign for the White House. The strategy, so far hugely
successful, is not unlike what he employed to win two races for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   And, with some partisan variations, it is not much different
than the strategy that the eventual nominee for either major party
will have to use in the general election in order to capture the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   But some issues are easier to walk a tightrope over than others,
and one of the most difficult _ so difficult it is virtually
impossible _ is abortion, perhaps the most emotional political
issue of our era.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made it pretty clear that he opposes most, if not all,
abortion rights. But mostly he is trying to ignore the issue,
banking on his record fund raising and the widespread perception
that he is unbeatable for the Republican nomination to avoid
antagonizing abortion-rights supporters any more than necessary.
Some of those people are Republicans. Others are independents whose
votes he will need in the general election next fall if he actually
becomes the GOP nominee. Even some Democrats may want to vote for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would never say that he is taking the social and religious
conservatives in his own party for granted. But he certainly is
betting that he can win the GOP nomination without putting abortion
and other social issues at the top of his agenda, despite the
importance of those issues to that influential element of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas governor, Bush has spoken out against abortion. He has
urged premarital abstinence among young people and advocated
adoption as the best alternative in cases of unwanted pregnancies.
Last spring, he signed a new state law, which he had strongly
advocated, to require doctors to notify the parents before
performing abortions on unmarried minors.
</P>
<P>
   But, in his national campaign, Bush has declared that he
wouldn't require his potential federal court appointees to pass a
litmus test on abortion, and he has refused to rule out an
abortion-rights advocate as a potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to take shots on social issues from Gary Bauer,
Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes _ three Republican candidates who are
actively courting the party's right wing. But they aren't making
any noticeable headway against the front-runner in voter preference
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial Republican candidate Pat Buchanan, a longtime hero of
social conservatives, has all but given up on the GOP and is
flirting with the idea of seeking the Reform Party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from the other direction, meanwhile, Vice President Al
Gore, who is battling former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic
presidential nomination, warned abortion-rights activists that
Bush, if elected, would try to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court
decision that legalized abortion more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Bush by name, Gore told a Women for Choice
group in Los Angeles that ``moderate-sounding'' Republican
candidates say different things about abortion to the religious
right in private than they do to everyone else in public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been praised by Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson as a ``very acceptable candidate'' who was ``committed''
to the conservative social agenda. Robertson has either received
private assurances from Bush or is being pragmatic in commending a
conservative candidate with a strong chance of winning the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some anti-abortion hardliners are unhappy that Bush
hasn't made their issue a prominent, public part of his national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush wins the nomination while alienating
conservatives, as his father did in 1992 ... he is doomed to repeat
history and the country will be the big loser _ again,'' recently
wrote Phyllis Schlafly, chairwoman of the Republican National
Coalition for Life.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one prominent Texas anti-abortion leader is, like
Robertson, more pragmatic. Bill Price, president of Texans United
for Life, is convinced that Bush is a strong anti-abortion
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But campaigning isn't always a pretty process,'' Price added.

KIDS SPEAK OUT ON FAMILY VACATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They prefer to travel by airplane, not in the family car. Their
ideal companion: a best friend. They relish theme-park thrills,
swimming, snorkeling and a CD stereo system in their hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the No. 1 place to visit with a family, and they answer
Florida. In case the message isn't clear, their second choice is
Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   They have a significant say in planning a family trip. And 87
percent have access to a personal computer _ 71 percent to the
Internet _ in aiding their research.
</P>
<P>
   Recognize them? They're our kids.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least they fit the profile of the typical American child,
according to the 1999 Portrait of Family Travel, an extensive study
undertaken by Orlando-based marketing research firm Yesawich,
Pepperdine &AMP; Brown.
</P>
<P>
   During the second quarter of this year, YP&AMP;B conducted
interviews with 506 adults who traveled with children within the
previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes this 102-page report especially compelling are
additional interviews conducted with 525 children randomly selected
from four age categories: 6-8, 9-11, 12-14 and 15-17.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ADULTS VS. CHILDREN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, the adult perspective:
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six percent of the adults interviewed said travel is an
experience all children should have and that travel is educational
for children. Ninety-one percent said travel brings a family closer
together. Eighty-four percent said traveling with kids is rewarding
for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 93 percent said their children's interests are an
important factor in planning vacations. Sixty-four percent
described kids as ``extremely/very influential'' in picking a
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Children, however, sense a less significant role in travel
planning. Only 48 percent of those ages 12-17 consider themselves
``very important'' in determining where the family vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Also intriguing: Although 83 percent of the children interviewed
said they ``really like'' taking a family vacation, neither Mom nor
Dad _ and certainly not little brother or sister _ gets the nod as
the person they ``really like to vacation with'' most.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing for multiple responses, 91 percent of the kids prefer
to travel with a best friend. Other named: Mom (80 percent); Dad
(77 percent); cousins or other relatives the same age (72 percent);
older sisters or brothers (47 percent); grandparents (46 percent);
and _ ouch _ younger sisters and brothers (35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE DISAGREEMENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More food for family thought:
</P>
<P>
   _ Asked what kind of vacation they prefer, 83 percent of the
kids said theme park, 80 percent listed beach, 80 percent answered
water park, 72 percent suggested a cruise, and 67 percent listed an
adventure trip and a visit with family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising to me, only 57 percent (and only 44 percent of kids
ages 15-17) named camping. But throughout the study, parents tended
to rank nature-oriented vacations significantly higher than did
kids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asked the top places they would like to experience on vacation
with their children, parents surveyed named Walt Disney World,
Hawaii, the Grand Canyon, Orlando and Washington, D.C., in that
order. Kids' preferred choices, following Florida and Walt Disney
World, are California (home to Disneyland), Hawaii and Australia
(remember, they're not balancing the family budget). Among those
ages 15-17, Australia is the No. 1 choice, even ahead of Florida
and Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to parents, 89 percent of families took at least one
vacation over the previous year in the family automobile (and only
22 percent took a trip via airplane). Kids surveyed prefer airplane
(54 percent) over car (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Parents and kids also differ in evaluating accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel and resort amenities considered most important by the
adults: (1) security and safety; (2) discounts for additional rooms
for children traveling with parents; (3) a restaurant where kids
eat free; (4) larger guest rooms designed to accommodate children;
and (5) a restaurant with special menu items for children. Within
guest rooms, amenities judged most important are (1) in-room movies
and (2) childproofing.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel and resort amenities considered most important by
children: (1) a swimming pool with slides and waterfalls and
separate from the parents' pool; (2) an area for kids to hang out;
(3) a separate room that attaches to the parents' room; (4) a video
arcade; and (5) a restaurant that features hamburgers and pizza.
Beyond CD music, other guest-room amenities preferred _ I sense a
pattern here _ are (2) movies, (3) a VCR and (4) video games.
</P>
<P>
   Also eye-opening are numbers involving the Internet. It's
impressive enough that 71 percent of the kids surveyed have access
to an online service. But 58 percent of those ages 12-17 said they
research travel information online.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, although Internet access figures are similar, only
32 percent of parents had obtained travel information and prices
online. Ten percent had booked travel online. (For the record, 34
percent said they referred to the Sunday travel section of their
local newspaper for family vacation planning.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of our study suggest that (previous surveys of
adults only) overlooked the sentiments of some of the most
important decision-makers in the households: kids,'' said YP&AMP;B
president Peter Yesawich.
</P>
<P>
   The YP&AMP;B study is available to businesses as a tool in planning
marketing efforts. Cost is $1,600. Custom analyses also are
available. Call 407-875-1111. &QL;

GORE A BORE? GOVERNOR SAYS IT MAY NOT BE A BAD THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Maybe California Gov. Gray Davis didn't get
the memo from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At the exact moment Vice President Al Gore was trying to inject
some excitement into his campaign, Davis was taking the stage at
the AFL-CIO convention last week in Los Angeles, snatching Gore
right back into the Land of the Political Dweeb.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, urged union workers from across the nation to
embrace Gore as they did him _ a ``boring, dull fellow dismissed as
roadkill and yesterday's news.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be good reason for Davis' backhanded endorsement:
Davis beat former Attorney General Dan Lungren last year in one of
the largest landslides in state history, and helped sweep other
Democrats into near-total power.
</P>
<P>
   If California is a microcosm of the nation, then the Davis
campaign and how he won offer an important star chart to the White
House. Never have the signs been more apparent than during the last
few weeks on the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   His new Tennessee campaign headquarters and cowboy boots aside,
Gore is running a campaign that parallels Davis' in many ways. Last
week, he courted and secured the endorsement of the influential
AFL-CIO. Trade unions helped sweep Davis to victory by working the
phones and energizing rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, has stayed cautious when it comes to tipping the boat
with expensive policy initiatives. Davis has perfected that
strategy, despite being identified by Time magazine as the most
``fearless'' governor in America. Davis is convinced that a
don't-rock-the-boat philosophy wins races, especially when the
economy is reaching Xanadu status.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently introduced a series of health-care reforms that
would be roughly $50 billion cheaper than those proposed by his
Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. For
his part, Bradley has been busy courting liberal Democrats while
maintaining the patina of an outsider charging the net in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis marched into the 1998 Democratic convention before
the gubernatorial primary, he faced a sea of Davis signs and
hundreds of chanting supporters. Down in the polls at the time,
insiders dismissed the convention support as just party faithful
rallying around a party insider.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, too, has been counting signs, and he's worried about
it. Last week in Iowa, the two candidates spoke at the annual
Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in Des Moines. Seeing all the Gore
signs, Bradley remarked: ``There is no question we are up against
entrenched power. I don't have high expectations. We have to do
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little bit like going into Boston Garden in
the seventh game.'' the former New York Knicks basketball player
said. ``You never know, you could turn around some of the Boston
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear difference between Gore and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Edmund G. ``Pat''
Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University in
Los Angeles, said Gore ``carries a lot of baggage from the worst of
the Clinton years. Gray Davis didn't suffer from that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another student of the 1998 California race has been Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the apparent Republican front-runner. Although he
agrees with Lungren on many crucial conservative issues, Bush has
in recent weeks begun veering toward the center, at least in words.
</P>
<P>
   That is the primary lesson for Republicans from the California
race. Lungren, a conservative to the core, never really liked
pretending to be a centrist. Amid President Clinton's sex scandal,
Lungren injected religion into the debate as he lectured about
morality and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush is lecturing his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of
America slouching toward Gomorrah,'' Bush said recently. Bush, in
another speech, chastised the Republican-led Congress for
attempting to ``balance their budget on the backs of the poor'' and
later said his party often ignores `human problems that persist in
the shadow of affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Davis has gone out of his way to alienate
the far reaches of the Democratic Party. He revels in it. Like Bush
_ and Clinton before him _ Davis is antagonizing the left and the
right in order to appear centrist and connected to real voters in
the middle. It's an extension of the monotonous drone of Davis'
1998 campaign _ moderation, centrism, no huge promises.
</P>
<P>
   The far reaches of the GOP huffed and protested that Bush is
dismissing his core voters by ripping into the conservative side of
the party. But the base in American politics consists of millions
of independent voters within both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Gore to convince voters that Bush isn't on
their side. That means going after his public record, just as Davis
hammered Lungren on issues such as guns, abortion and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has so far avoided critical scrutiny of his record in
Texas, he continues to score points in an area where Lungren
foundered. Bush has received critical support from Hispanic voters
in Texas, whereas Lungren alienated Hispanic voters with his
support for an anti-immigrant ballot initiative.

   IT'S TIME FOR BUSH TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST BUCHANAN. ``George W.
Bush should tell us what he really thinks of fellow Republican
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan's history of bigotry,'' writes
columnist James Garcia in this commentary. He continues that if
Bush really wants us to believe that Republicans are serious about
inviting more people of color to join the GOP, he should start by
publicly denouncing Buchanan's views on minorities, women and
homosexuals. Garcia thinks that Bush's silence sends a disturbing
message _ namely that Bush is less interested in taking a
principled stand against the likes of Buchanan than he is in
holding on to a few more right-wing votes. PLEASE NOTE: This is a
strong opinion piece which may provoke reactions from readers.
</P>
<P>
   THE TALE OF THE `INDIAN' TRADEMARK. Before Karen Lincoln
Michel's tribe legally changed its name to Ho-Chunk, they were
known as Winnebago. ``The motor-home connection to my tribe
wouldn't be so demoralizing, I used to think, if we were reaping
some of the profits from the RV maker,'' Michel writes. An Indian
tribe in southern Oregon can relate. The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua
Tribe of Indians wanted to revive the vintage Indian Motorcycle by
manufacturing a new version on reservation land. But a white-owned
company beat them to the rights to the ``Indian'' trademark a year
ago. Michel reports that it is unlawful under the federal Indian
Arts and Crafts Act to label products as ``Indian made'' when they
are not. Her take: ``Most companies neither verbalize nor
demonstrate any kind of respect for Native-Americans unless they
can make a buck from it.'' Lincoln is a past president of the
Native-American Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   ON ISRAEL, I'LL CALL IT AS I SEE IT _ Columnist Bill Maxwell
knows that his commentaries about Israel anger many American Jews
nationwide. He is often asked why he, an American black, is
interested in Israel and Jews. Maxwell tries to answer this
question, as well as examine a related issue, that of Jews
selectively misreading anything they deem unflattering to Israel _
even if the issue in question is indisputably true. '' ... too many
American Jews see the nation as an innocent land that can do no
wrong. The truth is that the Promised Land _ while giving Jews a
sacred homeland and while inspiring millions of other people
worldwide to wonder and to affirm their religious faith _ has warts
just like other nations. Acknowledging this simple truth does not
make a journalist an anti-Semite,'' Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   IS THE GOVERNMENT TELLING US THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MOSQUITOES?
Mayor Giuliani and his health-department aides would like New
Yorkers to believe that the pesticide malathion that has been
sprayed all over the city's neighborhoods recently to kill off any
mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus is perfectly safe. How safe
it is really? Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports that on a data sheet
from one of the city's main malathion suppliers, a company called
Cheminova Agro, a note to physicians reads: ``Fyfanon ULV
(malathion) is a cholinesterase inhibitor affecting the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and producing cardiac and respiratory
depression.'' According to Dr. Adrienne Buffaloe, who runs a
private environmental medicine center on Manhattan's upper East
Side, ``the city and federal governments are deceiving the public
about the dangers of malathion ... A good number of medical
professionals have been troubled by the massive pesticide spraying
that went on in New York.''

   ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE FAST LANE. There's a new momentum
in Asian-American studies (AAS) at the university level, reports
Mitchell J. Chang in this excerpt from A. Magazine. Way back in
1968, AAS emerged out of the social unrest at San Francisco State
University. It grew slowly, mainly across the West Coast and in
pockets in the East until the '90s, when the field experienced a
turbo-charged expansion. So why the sudden growth spurt? For one
thing, there has been as jump in Asian Pacific American student
enrollment. In addition to this, students in the '90s are the
children of the civil-rights struggles that established the
original AAS courses and programs. They fully expect to have the
opportunity to take such courses. In this feature, Chang, an
assistant professor at the Graduate College of Education at the
University of Massachusetts, Boston, offers a primer on the boom in
Asian-American studies.

   IT'S TIME FOR BUSH TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST BUCHANAN. ``George W.
Bush should tell us what he really thinks of fellow Republican
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan's history of bigotry,'' writes
columnist James Garcia in this commentary. He continues that if
Bush really wants us to believe that Republicans are serious about
inviting more people of color to join the GOP, he should start by
publicly denouncing Buchanan's views on minorities, women and
homosexuals. Garcia thinks that Bush's silence sends a disturbing
message _ namely that Bush is less interested in taking a
principled stand against the likes of Buchanan than he is in
holding on to a few more right-wing votes. PLEASE NOTE: This is a
strong opinion piece which may provoke reactions from readers.

   THE TALE OF THE `INDIAN' TRADEMARK. Before Karen Lincoln
Michel's tribe legally changed its name to Ho-Chunk, they were
known as Winnebago. ``The motor-home connection to my tribe
wouldn't be so demoralizing, I used to think, if we were reaping
some of the profits from the RV maker,'' Michel writes. An Indian
tribe in southern Oregon can relate. The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua
Tribe of Indians wanted to revive the vintage Indian Motorcycle by
manufacturing a new version on reservation land. But a white-owned
company beat them to the rights to the ``Indian'' trademark a year
ago. Michel reports that it is unlawful under the federal Indian
Arts and Crafts Act to label products as ``Indian made'' when they
are not. Her take: ``Most companies neither verbalize nor
demonstrate any kind of respect for Native-Americans unless they
can make a buck from it.'' Lincoln is a past president of the
Native-American Journalists Association.

   ON ISRAEL, I'LL CALL IT AS I SEE IT _ Columnist Bill Maxwell
knows that his commentaries about Israel anger many American Jews
nationwide. He is often asked why he, an American black, is
interested in Israel and Jews. Maxwell tries to answer this
question, as well as examine a related issue, that of Jews
selectively misreading anything they deem unflattering to Israel _
even if the issue in question is indisputably true. '' ... too many
American Jews see the nation as an innocent land that can do no
wrong. The truth is that the Promised Land _ while giving Jews a
sacred homeland and while inspiring millions of other people
worldwide to wonder and to affirm their religious faith _ has warts
just like other nations. Acknowledging this simple truth does not
make a journalist an anti-Semite,'' Maxwell writes.

   IS THE GOVERNMENT TELLING US THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MOSQUITOES?
Mayor Giuliani and his health-department aides would like New
Yorkers to believe that the pesticide malathion that has been
sprayed all over the city's neighborhoods recently to kill off any
mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus is perfectly safe. How safe
it is really? Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports that on a data sheet
from one of the city's main malathion suppliers, a company called
Cheminova Agro, a note to physicians reads: ``Fyfanon ULV
(malathion) is a cholinesterase inhibitor affecting the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and producing cardiac and respiratory
depression.'' According to Dr. Adrienne Buffaloe, who runs a
private environmental medicine center on Manhattan's upper East
Side, ``the city and federal governments are deceiving the public
about the dangers of malathion ... A good number of medical
professionals have been troubled by the massive pesticide spraying
that went on in New York.''

   ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE FAST LANE. There's a new momentum
in Asian-American studies (AAS) at the university level, reports
Mitchell J. Chang in this excerpt from A. Magazine. Way back in
1968, AAS emerged out of the social unrest at San Francisco State
University. It grew slowly, mainly across the West Coast and in
pockets in the East until the '90s, when the field experienced a
turbo-charged expansion. So why the sudden growth spurt? For one
thing, there has been as jump in Asian Pacific American student
enrollment. In addition to this, students in the '90s are the
children of the civil-rights struggles that established the
original AAS courses and programs. They fully expect to have the
opportunity to take such courses. In this feature, Chang, an
assistant professor at the Graduate College of Education at the
University of Massachusetts, Boston, offers a primer on the boom in
Asian-American studies.

SCREENWRITER SEES TOO MUCH EXCESS IN TODAY'S HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 1949 movie ``Home of the Brave,'' the story
of a black Marine having a breakdown because of racism in his unit
during World War II, originally was a play about prejudice against
a Jewish soldier. Asked why the change was made between the
Broadway and Hollywood versions, veteran screenwriter Millard
Kaufman shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might ask, first, why the subject was changed from a gay
man to a Jew,'' said Kaufman, a good friend of the play's author,
Arthur Laurents.
</P>
<P>
   The first dedication in Kaufman's current best-selling
nonfiction book, ``Plots and Characters,'' goes to Laurents ``for
all the talk and explorations past midnight spanning more than
fifty years.'' Originally, said Kaufman, Laurents wrote ``Home of
the Brave'' about a gay man, ``but in those days it wasn't
accepted, even on Broadway. That's why he changed it to a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hollywood, which ``wanted something a bit more
spectacular,'' changed the Jewish soldier to a black, raising
eyebrows all over the nation. In its own way, by moving from a gay
to a Jew to a black, the movie showed the progression of what was
acceptable when attacking the caste system in postwar America.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, 82, wrote the screenplay for the 1955 Spencer Tracy
film, ``Bad Day at Black Rock,'' one of the strongest anti-racist
movies of its time. It's the story of a one-armed man coming to a
desert town after World War II to award a medal to the father of
one of the Japanese-American soldiers who had been under his
command in Italy. He has to grapple with racism and shame in a town
consumed by hatred of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   You could send ``Bad Day at Black Rock'' and ``Home of the
Brave'' back into the theaters right now and they would still be
relevant, Kaufman said. ``Racism exists. Nobody comes out today and
makes blatant anti-Semitic or anti-black remarks, except,
unconsciously, maybe Pat Buchanan. But racism is still out there.
It's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Making racism uncomfortable for bigots has been a gradual
process, said Kaufman, who was in on the beginnings of that
process. ``It's not that I think `Black Rock' was any great
innovator,'' he said, ``but I think there's less pressure now when
you make a movie about racial difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman laughed a little, remembering that his script for the
'57 film ``Raintree County'' was challenged by Hollywood higher-ups
because Elizabeth Taylor's character may have had a black mother
and because Montgomery Clift's character, the romantic lead and an
outspoken abolitionist, joins the Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the '50s, when they were reliving the Civil War, so it
was all this, `We're going to lose the Southern market,' blah,
blah,'' Kaufman said. ``The Taylor story line was central to the
picture. I fought for it. I got it. But Montgomery Clift. ... They
had him joining the Union Army because it was the only way he could
get into the South to find his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman shook his head at the weirdness of that scenario. But if
movies from the '50s fell victim to white America's conservatism,
he said, screenwriters nowadays err on the side of excess.
</P>
<P>
   Movies cater to what is seen as a young, violence-hungry
audience, said Kaufman. ``We've gotten into all this brainlessness.
We used to talk about a cast of thousands, now we talk about a cast
of a thousand corpses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business of Hollywood is, indeed, a business. It
has always been that way, because the biggest motivation in making
pictures is greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, who settled in Los Angeles after serving in the Marines
in World War II, was nominated for an Academy Award for his first
screenwriting effort, ``Take the High Ground.'' He went on to ``Bad
Day at Black Rock,'' ``Raintree County'' and ``Never So Few,'' but
he is not nostalgic for the '50s, his high-water mark as a
screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a golden age,'' he said. ``The people who came
before us probably thought theirs was, and 20 years from now you'll
have screenwriters talking about how things were real good in these
`good ol' days.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman has seen a lot of pure talent in his time, casually
listing the actors in ``Black Rock'' _ Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan,
Ernest Borgnine, Lee Marvin, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, Anne
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a marvelous, marvelous cast,'' he said.

 &HT;    IMPORTED CRAB MEAT THREATENS EAST COAST WATERMEN
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national, (l) lifestyle and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRISFIELD, Md. _ Soulful amens drifted over piles of cooked
crabs as the praying concluded and the picking commenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it since I was 13. When I was younger, I
thought it was hard. But not now. I just know I have to do it to
survive,.'' said Barbara James, whose nimble fingers and graying
hair testify to decades of separating the sweet meat from the sharp
shells. ``On a good day, I'll make $80 to $90. On a bad day, $50 to
$60.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a heavenly tilt toward more good days than bad, the crab
pickers at Byrd's Seafood sing the Lord's Prayer each morning. For
generations, they have prayed daily for a plentiful catch by the
local watermen. Such traditions are deeply anchored in the hamlets
nestled along the meandering Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in the crab and oyster industry _ mostly
small, family-owned businesses that have been around a long time,''
explained J.C. Tolley, who operates a crab-picking house that his
ancestors opened in 1920. ``In rural, isolated fishing villages,
they're the lifeblood of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the folks who harvest and pick blue crabs believe their
livelihood and lifestyle are being threatened by imported crab meat
from Asia. Seafood industry analysts say that these imports
increased 300 percent between 1994 and 1998. During this period,
the domestic processors' share of the U.S. market fell from 56
percent to 32 percent. When Americans buy crabcakes or deviled crab
now, the meat is more likely to have come from Indonesia or
Thailand or some other foreign country than from native
crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effects have been felt all along the Southern
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Maryland and Virginia around to Louisiana, I don't know
anybody in the picking business that's not having a hard time
selling crab meat,'' said Jack Amason, president of Sea Garden
Seafoods in McIntosh County, Ga., and a director of the National
Blue Crab Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crab pickers make $2 to $5 a day _ less than U.S. pickers
make per hour. American crab processors say they can't compete with
such low labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven or eight years ago, Georgia had eight picking houses.
Now there are only two left,'' said Amason, who said both
establishments are in McIntosh County. ``My sales are off over 50
percent. I've been at it 30-something years, but I don't know
whether I'll be in the crab business a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chesapeake Bay communities where most jobs are linked to the
water, the invasion of crab imports is having a ``tremendous
impact,'' said Doug Lipton, a marine economist at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Watermen are losing income but may survive by selling live crabs
in summer and switching to more oysters and fish, Lipton predicted.
``But for the pickers, an old way of life is threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   Paintings of crabs adorn the water tower and every street sign
in this waterfront community. Main Street is lined with businesses
like Eddie Heath's Crab Pots and Supplies and Carvel Hall Cutlery,
where they make knives used in picking. At Gordon's Restaurant,
watermen fuel up on coffee and fried-egg sandwiches before dawn.
Streets dead-end at docks where crabbing boats fill nearly every
slip.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, lives have depended on the bounty of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been crabbing and oystering for 60 years,'' said Homer
Tyler, 73. ``I finished the seventh grade and then I went out on
the water.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a waterman and so are his sons. Their days are
spent baiting, stringing and checking crab pots in the bay or
tonging for oysters. Tyler spent 35 years on a skipjack, the
working sailboat that has long since been replaced by motorized
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is what keeps me going,'' Tyler allowed. ``I'm up at 3:30
most mornings in the summer, but I come back in around dinner time.
My fingers don't work too well in winter months. But I love the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Elliott, the son of a sawmill worker, expresses similar
devotion to the crab-picking house at Toddville where he does a bit
of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I love it,'' he exclaimed. ``I can go fishing off the
pier. It's peaceful. There ain't no place else I want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott works at Meredith &AMP; Meredith, founded by two cousins
returning from World War I. Their nephew came into the business
when he came home from World War II. His son, J.C. Tolley, joined
the enterprise in 1963 after a couple of years at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The go-go, online '90s'' have bypassed Toddville, Tolley said.
``We don't have high-tech companies, Kmarts or Wal-Marts. We don't
even have a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are blue crabs and oysters nearby in the bay. For
years, shellfish have supported the families of Toddville.
</P>
<P>
   But with the influx of imported crab meat, Tolley said, ``It's
getting harder for all of us to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much we can do to modernize,'' he said. ``It's
hand work. It's not like you could build a new plant with computers
and robots. There's nowhere to squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, the Phillips family founded a crab-picking plant on
Hoopers Island, just off the Eastern Shore. In 1956, Brice and
Shirley Phillips opened a seafood restaurant in the resort town of
Ocean City, Md. Since then, the family business has exploded _ with
restaurants from Washington, D.C., to West Palm Beach, Fla., and
Phillips ``Maryland-style'' crab soup and frozen crab cakes in
supermarkets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the crab meat in the company's restaurants and packaged
products is much more likely to have come from Asia than from the
Chesapeake Bay. Along with its original Hooper's Island picking
house, Phillips now has plants in Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines. Those foreign facilities supply most of the crab meat
for Phillips frozen products and restaurants, as well some sold to
outside distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The description of ``Maryland-style'' refers to the Phillips
family recipes, not the origin of the crab meat, said Honey
Konicoff, the marketing director for Phillips Seafood. The quality
of the crabcake is more important than where the crab came from,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips sells pasteurized crab meat to distributors at or above
the domestic market price, said Aden King, the company's sale
manager. Labor costs are cheaper in Asia, he conceded, so Phillips
foreign pickers can take more time to provide ``virtually
shell-free'' crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to restaurateurs'' who otherwise have to pay
their own kitchen workers to check for shells, said Mark Sneed,
president of Phillips. The company has also expanded by emphasizing
``value-added products'' such as prepared crabcakes rather than
plain crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed said the seafood market has ``changed dramatically'' in
recent years but domestic crab meat processors ``haven't changed
how they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, domestic crab meat processors have a different view
of the situation. Their pickers are guaranteed the minimum wage,
but most make considerably more because they're paid about $2.25
for every pound they pick. There are spot checks for shells, but
the expense of ``double picking'' would be prohibitive, said Norman
Dorrell, president of Warren Denton Seafood of Broomes Island, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't compete on labor costs,'' said Dorrell. Asians
are ``putting us out of business and I don't see any legal way to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For temporary help, U.S. processors are asking the Clinton
administration to impose quotas or duties on imported crab meat to
give the domestic industry time to adjust to the foreign
competition. Similar relief was provided by the U.S. International
Trade Commission when American sheep ranchers were hard hit by lamb
imports from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tariffs or quotas are only a short-term solution, but (such
measures) might buy time'' for imposing marketing standards and
launching an information. campaign to let consumers know when Asian
crab meat is sold, said Lipton, the marine economist.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers ``may or may not care, but at least they would know
that the crabcakes at a waterfront restaurant didn't come from
local crabs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crabs are significantly different from the blue crabs
caught in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Southern coast, said
Jack Brooks, who, along with his brothers, runs J.M. Clayton Co., a
Cambridge, Md., seafood business begun in 1890s by their
great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and other domestic processors maintain that the American
blue crab meat tastes better than the Asian variety. They want
federal requirements so the products will be labeled with the
crab's country of origin. Temporary tariffs or quotas will give the
American crab industry time to differentiate their product, like
Florida has done with oranges or Vidalia, Ga., with onions, Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barbara James prays every morning and picks the meat
from a crab every 20 seconds or so. Outside the seafood business,
she said, ``there are no jobs in this town.''

 &HT;    IMPORTED CRAB MEAT THREATENS EAST COAST WATERMEN

   CRISFIELD, Md. _ Soulful amens drifted over piles of cooked
crabs as the praying concluded and the picking commenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it since I was 13. When I was younger, I
thought it was hard. But not now. I just know I have to do it to
survive,.'' said Barbara James, whose nimble fingers and graying
hair testify to decades of separating the sweet meat from the sharp
shells. ``On a good day, I'll make $80 to $90. On a bad day, $50 to
$60.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a heavenly tilt toward more good days than bad, the crab
pickers at Byrd's Seafood sing the Lord's Prayer each morning. For
generations, they have prayed daily for a plentiful catch by the
local watermen. Such traditions are deeply anchored in the hamlets
nestled along the meandering Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in the crab and oyster industry _ mostly
small, family-owned businesses that have been around a long time,''
explained J.C. Tolley, who operates a crab-picking house that his
ancestors opened in 1920. ``In rural, isolated fishing villages,
they're the lifeblood of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the folks who harvest and pick blue crabs believe their
livelihood and lifestyle are being threatened by imported crab meat
from Asia. Seafood industry analysts say that these imports
increased 300 percent between 1994 and 1998. During this period,
the domestic processors' share of the U.S. market fell from 56
percent to 32 percent. When Americans buy crabcakes or deviled crab
now, the meat is more likely to have come from Indonesia or
Thailand or some other foreign country than from native
crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effects have been felt all along the Southern
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Maryland and Virginia around to Louisiana, I don't know
anybody in the picking business that's not having a hard time
selling crab meat,'' said Jack Amason, president of Sea Garden
Seafoods in McIntosh County, Ga., and a director of the National
Blue Crab Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crab pickers make $2 to $5 a day _ less than U.S. pickers
make per hour. American crab processors say they can't compete with
such low labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven or eight years ago, Georgia had eight picking houses.
Now there are only two left,'' said Amason, who said both
establishments are in McIntosh County. ``My sales are off over 50
percent. I've been at it 30-something years, but I don't know
whether I'll be in the crab business a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chesapeake Bay communities where most jobs are linked to the
water, the invasion of crab imports is having a ``tremendous
impact,'' said Doug Lipton, a marine economist at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Watermen are losing income but may survive by selling live crabs
in summer and switching to more oysters and fish, Lipton predicted.
``But for the pickers, an old way of life is threatened.''

</P>
<P>
   Paintings of crabs adorn the water tower and every street sign
in this waterfront community. Main Street is lined with businesses
like Eddie Heath's Crab Pots and Supplies and Carvel Hall Cutlery,
where they make knives used in picking. At Gordon's Restaurant,
watermen fuel up on coffee and fried-egg sandwiches before dawn.
Streets dead-end at docks where crabbing boats fill nearly every
slip.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, lives have depended on the bounty of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been crabbing and oystering for 60 years,'' said Homer
Tyler, 73. ``I finished the seventh grade and then I went out on
the water.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a waterman and so are his sons. Their days are
spent baiting, stringing and checking crab pots in the bay or
tonging for oysters. Tyler spent 35 years on a skipjack, the
working sailboat that has long since been replaced by motorized
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is what keeps me going,'' Tyler allowed. ``I'm up at 3:30
most mornings in the summer, but I come back in around dinner time.
My fingers don't work too well in winter months. But I love the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Elliott, the son of a sawmill worker, expresses similar
devotion to the crab-picking house at Toddville where he does a bit
of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I love it,'' he exclaimed. ``I can go fishing off the
pier. It's peaceful. There ain't no place else I want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott works at Meredith &AMP; Meredith, founded by two cousins
returning from World War I. Their nephew came into the business
when he came home from World War II. His son, J.C. Tolley, joined
the enterprise in 1963 after a couple of years at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The go-go, online '90s'' have bypassed Toddville, Tolley said.
``We don't have high-tech companies, Kmarts or Wal-Marts. We don't
even have a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are blue crabs and oysters nearby in the bay. For
years, shellfish have supported the families of Toddville.
</P>
<P>
   But with the influx of imported crab meat, Tolley said, ``It's
getting harder for all of us to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much we can do to modernize,'' he said. ``It's
hand work. It's not like you could build a new plant with computers
and robots. There's nowhere to squeeze.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1914, the Phillips family founded a crab-picking plant on
Hoopers Island, just off the Eastern Shore. In 1956, Brice and
Shirley Phillips opened a seafood restaurant in the resort town of
Ocean City, Md. Since then, the family business has exploded _ with
restaurants from Washington, D.C., to West Palm Beach, Fla., and
Phillips ``Maryland-style'' crab soup and frozen crab cakes in
supermarkets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the crab meat in the company's restaurants and packaged
products is much more likely to have come from Asia than from the
Chesapeake Bay. Along with its original Hooper's Island picking
house, Phillips now has plants in Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines. Those foreign facilities supply most of the crab meat
for Phillips frozen products and restaurants, as well some sold to
outside distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The description of ``Maryland-style'' refers to the Phillips
family recipes, not the origin of the crab meat, said Honey
Konicoff, the marketing director for Phillips Seafood. The quality
of the crabcake is more important than where the crab came from,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips sells pasteurized crab meat to distributors at or above
the domestic market price, said Aden King, the company's sale
manager. Labor costs are cheaper in Asia, he conceded, so Phillips
foreign pickers can take more time to provide ``virtually
shell-free'' crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to restaurateurs'' who otherwise have to pay
their own kitchen workers to check for shells, said Mark Sneed,
president of Phillips. The company has also expanded by emphasizing
``value-added products'' such as prepared crabcakes rather than
plain crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed said the seafood market has ``changed dramatically'' in
recent years but domestic crab meat processors ``haven't changed
how they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, domestic crab meat processors have a different view
of the situation. Their pickers are guaranteed the minimum wage,
but most make considerably more because they're paid about $2.25
for every pound they pick. There are spot checks for shells, but
the expense of ``double picking'' would be prohibitive, said Norman
Dorrell, president of Warren Denton Seafood of Broomes Island, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't compete on labor costs,'' said Dorrell. Asians
are ``putting us out of business and I don't see any legal way to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For temporary help, U.S. processors are asking the Clinton
administration to impose quotas or duties on imported crab meat to
give the domestic industry time to adjust to the foreign
competition. Similar relief was provided by the U.S. International
Trade Commission when American sheep ranchers were hard hit by lamb
imports from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tariffs or quotas are only a short-term solution, but (such
measures) might buy time'' for imposing marketing standards and
launching an information. campaign to let consumers know when Asian
crab meat is sold, said Lipton, the marine economist.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers ``may or may not care, but at least they would know
that the crabcakes at a waterfront restaurant didn't come from
local crabs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian crabs are significantly different from the blue crabs
caught in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Southern coast, said
Jack Brooks, who, along with his brothers, runs J.M. Clayton Co., a
Cambridge, Md., seafood business begun in 1890s by their
great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and other domestic processors maintain that the American
blue crab meat tastes better than the Asian variety. They want
federal requirements so the products will be labeled with the
crab's country of origin. Temporary tariffs or quotas will give the
American crab industry time to differentiate their product, like
Florida has done with oranges or Vidalia, Ga., with onions, Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barbara James prays every morning and picks the meat
from a crab every 20 seconds or so. Outside the seafood business,
she said, ``there are no jobs in this town.''

 (Includes a color slide of Gloria Estefan with Meryl Streep and
Angela Bassett in a scene from ``Music of the Heart.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Gloria Estefan doesn't seem to get being a celebrity.
 &HT;    A small figure curled up on a coach at New York's Regency Hotel
on a fall afternoon, Estefan apparently can't master the rules of
divadom.
 &HT;    She serves soft drinks to journalists.
 &HT;    She makes sure her handlers have enough cookies.
 &HT;    She even asks a publicist from Miramax Films when she will have
time for a bathroom break.
 &HT;    ``I never complain about anything in this life,'' says the
singer _ who, only a few years ago, was grievously injured in a
highway accident and told that she would never walk again.
 &HT;    ``When a complaint is on the tip of my tongue, I remember the
day, months after my own accident, when I was able to put my
underwear on myself,'' the 42-year-old Estefan says. ``I could lift
my leg an inch off the ground and maneuver it. That day always
brings everything else into focus, so nothing is a big deal to me
now.
 &HT;    ``I can get up and walk across this room to get myself a glass
of water,'' she says. ``I can hold my child. I can carry her in my
arms. I can run up to my husband and hug him. What else is there in
this life?''
 &HT;    Well, for starters there's a movie career.
 &HT;    The singer will make her big-screen debut in ``Music of the
Heart,'' opening Oct. 29. The film stars Meryl Streep as a violin
teacher who comes to Harlem to start a school music program, with
Estefan in a small but pivotal role as a supportive teacher.
 &HT;    The director is Wes Craven, best known for ``A Nightmare on Elm
Street'' (1984) and ``Scream'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``When I heard Wes was doing a violin movie, I said, `What, is
he going to slit my throat with the strings?''' Estefan says with a
laugh. ``I thought it was a horror movie.''
 &HT;    For the singer, making her film debut _ after rejecting numerous
scripts in the past _ was scary enough without a mad slasher.
 &HT;    ``My husband Emilio and I always knew if a great movie role
didn't come along, we could create our own project eventually,''
Estefan says. ``But I really wanted to get my feet wet outside my
own power base.''
 &HT;    That power base lies in music and the Cuban community, into
which Estefan was born in 1957 as Gloria Fajardo in Havana. Her
father was a soldier in the security detail for the family of Cuban
dictator Gen. Fulgencio Batista.
 &HT;    In 1959, when Fidel Castro seized power, the Fajardos fled Cuba.
Estefan was 2 years old when her family settled in Miami.
 &HT;    Soon, however, her father was recruited into a C.I.A.-backed
brigade of 1,300 Cuban refugees that launched the unsuccessful Bay
of Pigs invasion two years later. He landed in a Cuban prison for
two years.
 &HT;    After his release he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to
Vietnam, where he was exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange, which
his daughter believes triggered the multiple sclerosis which struck
him soon thereafter.
 &HT;    A young Gloria had to tend her sick father and raise her younger
sister, while her mother struggled to support the family by working
as a teacher.
 &HT;    ``Those were very rough moments,'' she says. ``My Dad was a big
guy. My Dad would forget that he couldn't walk and he would fall.
Then I would have to find ways of trying to lift him back up again.
I had to bathe him _ he was very embarrassed.
 &HT;    ``But in retrospect, it taught me so much,'' she adds. ``I
learned how to deal with everything that life throws at you. I
think it toughened me. It taught me how to be patient.''
 &HT;    Young, overweight and burdened with her family responsibilities,
Estefan had virtually no social life, she says. She found joy in
singing and playing her guitar, and devoted herself to school,
earning a scholarship to study psychology at the University of
Miami.
 &HT;    Those plans ended one night at a local club, however, when she
saw a local Cuban-American quartet called the Miami Latin Boys.
 &HT;    The band's leader, Emilio Estefan, immediately fell for the
young girl, and invited her to try singing with the band.
 &HT;    ``I wowed them with my voice because I had so much angst,''
Estefan recalls. ``It came out through my singing.''
 &HT;    Soon the bandleader and the aspiring singer were an item and,
under his guidance, she found her confidence growing.
 &HT;    ``He saw that I had this shell, and said, `You can keep your
shell and still be a performer, but you'll be a tortured one,'''
she recalls. ``So I thought, `I love music. I want people to see
how much I love it.' Slowly, I began to feel more and more
comfortable and lost the weight.''
 &HT;    One year later, the group was renamed The Miami Sound Machine
and released two albums, and the road to success opened before
them. During the early 1980s the band's Spanish-language albums
soared to the top of the Latin American charts.
 &HT;    Life was good for the Estefans, who had married in 1978, but
they wanted more than Latin success. In 1984 they took on the
American market with the dance single ``Dr. Beat,'' which debuted
at number 10 on the U.S. dance charts. The all-English album
``Primitive Love'' (1985), with its hit single ``Conga,'' made
Gloria Estefan an international sensation.
 &HT;    Soon the band became Gloria Estefan and The Miami Sound Machine,
then simply Gloria Estefan. Her solo album ``Cuts Both Ways''
(1989) and its singles ``Can't Stay Away From You,'' ``Anything for
You'' and ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' all hit No. 1 on the charts.
 &HT;    And then, seemingly at the pinnacle, Estefan almost lost it all.
 &HT;    In 1990, as the band was in the middle of a successful tour, a
truck broadsided the tour bus. Estefan suffered broken and
dislocated vertebra in her back, and underwent four hours of
surgery in which two 8-inch titanium rods were permanently
implanted to stabilize and align her spinal column.
 &HT;    The singer credits her husband for her all-but-miraculous
recovery.
 &HT;    ``This man literally didn't leave my side for three months,''
she says. ``He would spend his days lifting me up and putting me
down. I couldn't sleep for more than 45 minutes at a time. He would
get up with me each time and force me to move as much as possible.
In the hall, I would hear him crying.''
 &HT;    Fans sent 4,000 floral arrangements, 11,000 telegrams and 50,000
postcards and letters.
 &HT;    ``In my heart, I knew I would be OK,'' Estefan says. ``I willed
myself not to end up in a wheelchair like my father. And I honestly
think the human mind can achieve miracles.''
 &HT;    The next year, Estefan had a new album, ``Into the Light,'' and
returned to the stage with a yearlong, 29-country tour. She even
got a hit song, ``Coming Out of the Dark,'' out of her health
crisis.
 &HT;    Next up for Estefan is a new Spanish album, due out in March,
and a world tour which will kick off next year.
 &HT;    ``I sing because I want to touch everyone in what I call `that
place,''' Estefan says. ``When people pay to see me, I want them to
know that they have me for that one night. It's personal _ it's
about me and that fan.''

 (Includes a color slide of John Malkovich in a scene from ``Being
John Malkovich.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He's just being John Malkovich.
 &HT;    That is to say, the enigmatic actor is being typically
enigmatic. In New York to promote his latest movie, ``Being John
Malkovich,'' he cuts a businessman-suave figure in a navy-blue
suit, speaks in a decidedly nonmenacing whisper and utters deep
thoughts in bursts of oddly constructed sentences laden with mixed
messages and the occasional SAT-caliber word.
 &HT;    Listen, for example, to his thoughts on the perception, in
Hollywood and among the general public, that he's a screen villain
without peer.
 &HT;    ``It's irritating,'' he says, taking a long drag on a cigarette.
``Look at my films this year: I've played John Malkovich, the king
of France, F.W. Murnau and Herman Mankiewicz. But if people want to
say I only play bad guys, what am I going to do about it?
 &HT;    ``Certainly, I've gotten more laughs in straight plays than most
comedians get in their f---ing lives.''
 &HT;    The frustration in his voice comes across loud and clear.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand, so what?'' he continues. ``I have to look
at it in a secondary and a tertiary way. I'm a saxophonist who got
known for playing the drums. I'm not a movie actor, and I'm lucky
to get another job. So it's already fine _ I'm way ahead of the
game.
 &HT;    ``And it's not a real frustration, really at all,'' Malkovich
adds. ``The camera likes what it likes. They says the camera
doesn't lie, and I say that's what it's for.''
 &HT;    All of which may be a bit hard to follow, but it's nothing
compared to the wonderfully warped ``Being John Malkovich,'' which
will open nationwide on Oct. 29. In the film, Malkovich plays ...
well, John Malkovich, as a put-upon, womanizing and
more-than-a-little-arrogant movie icon.
 &HT;    John Cusack stars as a luckless Manhattan puppeteer who lands a
day job as a file clerk and soon discovers, hidden behind a
cabinet, a boarded-up portal into the mind of John Malkovich.
Cusack and co-worker Catherine Keener promptly hawk tickets to ride
for 15 minutes in Malkovich's head, eventually wreaking havoc for
them and for Cameron Diaz, who plays Cusack's disheveled wife, as
well as for Malkovich himself.
 &HT;    ``I don't think anybody reading `Being John Malkovich' who ever
lived or worked in Hollywood for more than a second would ever
expect this film to get made,'' the actor says.
 &HT;    Why not?
 &HT;    ``Because it's good,'' he says. ``Of course, they probably never
thought I'd make it. If I didn't say yes, then this original,
interesting movie wouldn't get made.
 &HT;    ``You don't see enough original, interesting movies,'' Malkovich
adds, ``and I wasn't going to be the guy to kill this.''
 &HT;    Still, it's a surprise that Malkovich agreed to participate in
the film. He has a notorious disdain for the Hollywood machine _ he
refuses to read any press about himself, for example _ and
ferociously guards his private life with his family in France. Not
to mention the genuine risk of further blurring the line between
reality and fiction.
 &HT;    ``It could be dangerous,'' Malkovich concedes with a shrug. ``It
was a concern, but it was also an unknowable. We'll see.
 &HT;    ``There are two things in the movie about wanting to be someone
else,'' he adds. ``One is very harmless and very good, and that's
that it addresses and encompasses native curiosity and our very
human _ and not very have-able, in today's society _ need to leave
ourselves, to get away from whatever is in our heads or hearts for
some period of time.
 &HT;    ``The second thing, which is more sinister and deeply
concerning, is the celebrity thing, the need to lead a virtual
life, meaning your sorrows and joys and passions aren't as
interesting as mine, of course, or George Clooney's or John
Goodman's,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``We go to McDonald's. We have to decide if we're going to park
the car or go through McDrive, get a Coke or an iced tea. Life goes
on.''
 &HT;    On the less serious side, Malkovich was often amused to find
himself getting instructions from director Spike Jonze on how to
play his character. In other words, Jonze was telling Malkovich how
to play Malkovich.
 &HT;    ``How can you really argue?'' Malkovich says, smiling. ``If
someone says, `You wouldn't do it that way,' what do you do? I'd
say, `OK, how do you think I'd do it?' He'd say, `Well, I think
you'd do it like this ... '
 &HT;    ``I didn't write it,'' he adds with a chuckle. ``I had nothing
to do with it. I just played it.''
 &HT;    Malkovich earned his status as at least a cult icon in going on
three decades of work on television, film and the stage. The
45-year-old Illinois native first made his mark in 1976 as a
founder of the Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theatre Company, with
which he participated in dozens of shows as producer, director
and/or actor. He later scored a hit in New York with Sam Shepard's
``True West'' (1982), which won him an Obie Award. His Broadway
debut in ``Death of a Salesman'' (1984) was followed by ``Burn
This'' (1987), both of which earned glowing reviews.
 &HT;    On television, Malkovich won an Emmy for ``Death of a Salesman''
(1985) and also appeared in ``Heart of Darkness'' (1994). His
latest small-screen project, ``RKO 281,'' will debut Nov. 20 on
HBO. The behind-the-scenes saga of the troubled production of the
classic film ``Citizen Kane'' (1941), it casts Malkovich as
screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz.
 &HT;    Moviegoers know the two-time Oscar nominee for ``Places in the
Heart'' (1984), ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988), ``In the Line of
Fire'' (1993) and ``Con Air'' (1998). One of the industry's busiest
actors, he has a full slate of upcoming projects which, besides
``Being John Malkovich,'' includes ``The Messenger: The Story of
Joan of Arc,'' due out on Nov. 12, and ``Burned to Light,'' with
Malkovich as F.W. Murnau, director of the classic horror film
``Nosferatu'' (1922).
 &HT;    The actor is currently in Canada, filming the mob drama
``Knockaround Guys.'' Early next year, he'll make his
feature-directing debut, after many successful stage productions,
with a drama entitled ``The Dancer Upstairs.''
 &HT;    Clearly Malkovich likes to work, and he takes that work very
seriously.
 &HT;    ``I'm personally happiest when I'm working on a script with a
writer,'' he says. ``After that, I'm happiest when I'm directing a
play.
 &HT;    ``I love acting on the stage,'' Malkovich adds, ``but I'm old
and it's tiring. It's great when you're 25, but I don't have that
energy anymore. That's probably why I do so many films.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``And, despite how much certain people want me to be, I'm not
really very unhappy with myself,'' he says. ``Nor am I particularly
happy with myself.''
 &HT;    Malkovich squints.
 &HT;    ``I'm just pretty OK being who I am and what I am,'' he says.
``I'm used to being me.''

 (Includes a color slide of Anthony Hopkins in a scene from ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'') 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Wall paintings dating from 3000 B.C., depicting evil figures and
piles of skeletons, suggest that people back then loved a good
scare.
 &HT;    Since then, it's been the same story: The ancient Greeks traded
tales of flesh-eating creatures, and the second-century Roman
author Pliny wrote about haunted houses.
 &HT;    But horror stories took on a whole new life _ or living death? _
with the invention of the motion picture.
 &HT;    The earliest film pioneers didn't have to stage spooky scenarios
to frighten their audiences _ merely watching moving pictures was
pretty scary to most people a century ago. When Paris viewers saw a
train speed toward them for the first time in 1895's one-scene
movie ``L'Arrivee d'un Train a la Crotat,'' many ran screaming for
the nearest exit.
 &HT;    Advances in movie technology enabled filmmakers to show us the
demons that the storytellers couldn't, but _ as ``The Blair Witch
Project'' (1999) demonstrated all over again _ sometimes the unseen
is more frightening. Alfred Hitchcock, hailed as ``the master of
suspense,'' said he believed in ``putting the horror in the mind of
the audience,'' not on the screen.
 &HT;    In a way, he was following in the footsteps of those ancient
Greeks, as have filmmakers through the decades, whether their films
were elegantly ambiguous or stomach-turningly graphic.
 &HT;    How well do you remember these films that gave viewers the feel
of reel terror?

can be escaped in only one way. How?
 &HT;    16. What two words appear on the stomach of poor, possessed
Regan (Linda Blair) before ``The Exorcist'' (1973) shows up?
 &HT;    17. Guy (John Cassavetes) agrees to allow ``Rosemary's Baby''

 &HT;    18. What's the significance of the license plate ``CQB 241?''
 &HT;    19. In ``The Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), what are the

and a blonde _ who was usually Greta Garbo's stand-in. And yes,
there are indeed armadillos on the stairs.
 &HT;    2. I bet you said ``Igor,'' didn't you? Well, Frankenstein's

Veidt), in his cabinet ... or so we think.
 &HT;    13. A blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) teaches the Monster to speak.
His first words are ``bread,'' ``good'' and ``friend,'' in that
order.
 &HT;    14. Herbert's experiments earn him _ and the 1985 film _ the
name ``Re-Animator.''
 &HT;    15. ``Scream,'' Price says, ``Scream for your lives!''
Apparently, expressing fear thwarts The Tingler.
 &HT;    16. Regan's abdomen reads ``help me.''
 &HT;    17. Rosemary's rotten hubby asks for, and receives, career
opportunities as an actor.

owner Rory Calhoun.
 &HT;    21. Starling spots a death's-head moth. Actually, tomato

also pictured in the film's memorable poster, covering Foster's
mouth.

 &HT;    23. Gunnar Hansen played ``Leatherface,'' who wields the
chainsaw in the cult favorite.
 &HT;    24. Norman enjoys taxidermy _ his specialty is stuffing birds.
 &HT;    25. Trick question _ actually, no one. Casey Becker, played by
former child star Drew Barrymore, is actually the second ``Scream''
victim. The first, Casey's boyfriend, was not played by a former
child star.

 Not to be released in Canada before Oct. 24, 1999. 
 (Includes a color slide of Sela Ward in a scene from ``Once and
Again.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sela Ward might almost have been waiting for this.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following her five-season run on the acclaimed
drama ``Sisters'' _ which earned her a Best Actress Emmy in 1994 as
the exotic, neurotic Teddy _ Ward chose work judiciously: a few
small parts in movies such as ``The Fugitive'' (1993), ``My Fellow
Americans'' (1996) and ``54'' (1998), the occasional television
movie such as ``Almost Golden: The Jessica Savitch Story'' (1995)
and even the odd quirky sitcom one-shot, as a gorgeous love
interest for ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   All along, she had offers for other drama series, but she always
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore I would never, ever do another hour-long series,'' the
actress says. ``It's just too many hours, too draining.''
</P>
<P>
   All that went out the window, though, when Ward was approached
by ``Thirtysomething'' creators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward
Zwick about a new drama, ``Once and Again,'' which they were
prepping for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The central character was Lily, a newly divorced, 40-year-old
mother of two whose already frenetic life is turned upside down
when she meets and falls for a ruggedly handsome, divorced dad
named Rick _ played by Bill Campbell, best known for ``The
Rocketeer'' (1991) _ who also has two kids.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward read the script, she reports, she was instantly
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``On page one,'' she says, ``in that interview with Lily, where
she's speaking about how all she wants is to feel safe in life, I'm
going, `Oh, that's me!' I make every decision in my life based on
that kind of thing. By the time I got through with the script, I
couldn't get it out of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's instincts were on the money. ABC liked ``Once and Again''
enough to launch it in ``NYPD Blue's'' time slot for a six-week
test in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move: So far ``Once and Again'' is this season's
second-highest-rated new drama, closely trailing NBC's much-hyped
``The West Wing.'' ABC is pleased, and the series will reportedly
receive a Saturday-night slot of its own starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is an offbeat venture for its creators. A
good deal of screen time is spent alternately with Lily and Rick,
in stark black-and-white, speaking into the camera about their
innermost personal feelings. As a result, both actors say they've
gotten a grasp of their characters deeper than usual so early in a
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick is unsure of himself, a little swamped and a hopeless
romantic,'' Campbell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lily is smart, a great mother, neurotic, not self-assured,
vulnerable, funny and a blast to play,'' Ward adds.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic content on ``Once and Again'' is heightened by
dialogue that's vintage ``Thirtysomething'' _ brutally honest and
fraught with human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coined them `the Dream Team of all time,''' Ward says of
Herskovitz and Zwick, who also created the Emmy-winning ``My
So-Called Life.'' ``They write such honest, compelling dialogue. It
was the exact same way on `Thirtysomething' _ that's how real
people actually talk.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing for sure, though: This is not ``The Brady Bunch.'' The
families on ``Once and Again'' enter the picture with plenty of
emotional baggage: Lily's daughter Grace (Julia Whelan) is freaked
out about her mother's new boyfriend, while her 9-year-old sister
Zoe (Meredith Deane) still thinks her mom is going to get back
together with her irresponsible ex-husband, Jake (Jeffrey
Nordling).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rick's kids are similarly messed up: At 16, young
Rick (Shane West) is already having sex _ unlike his dad, at least
in the first few episodes _ and 12-year-old Jessie (Evan Rachel
Wood) is feeling ignored and confused.
</P>
<P>
   It's not happy talk, but it is reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did `My So-Called Life,''' Zwick says, ``it was about
the teen-age experience, and that will be this to some degree. And
it's also subjectively about the experience of love and about
parenting teen-age children. I think that's maybe the fulcrum that
draws those two things together _ I think that will allow us to
actually do a show that's about both. Because, in my experience,
they can't exist exclusive of one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Once and Again's'' young co-stars have been struck by the
show's realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have been divorced twice, actually _ once at 2 and
once at 13,'' West says. ``So a lot of this was like therapy. I got
to see things from a different viewpoint, and it was very easy to
identify with the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Deane says she can recognize the in-family
squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though my parents aren't divorced, I think it's easy to
relate to a character that you can really understand,'' she says.
``Everyday fights with your sister, getting in the way of your mom
_ just being there and being part of a family. It's easy to relate
to.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pivotal figure on ``Once and Again,'' Ward also sees a
lot of honesty in the storytelling, particularly in those scenes in
which Lily and Rick simultaneously rediscover their physical
feelings and are fumbling with each other's clothes like a pair of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I fell so in love with this show,'' she says, ``is
because I think, perhaps unwittingly, they've written something
that celebrates age, that celebrates that at 40 there is life. At
40, there are new experiences _ at 40, you can have the same
feelings and emotions and state of expectancy that you had when you
were 18 and 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, Ward says she isn't at all the harried mother she
plays on her show. At 43, the onetime model is a happily married
mother of two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the semi-sabbatical she took after ``Sisters''
wasn't her idea, she adds. It was just that most of the lead roles
she pursued went instead to younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the reality of Hollywood casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wasteland of roles for particular women,'' Ward says.
``I mean, if you look at the actresses playing opposite the Michael
Douglases and even Harrison Ford, you know, excuse me? They can't
play opposite someone close to their own age? Or even 15 years
younger?''
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz and Zwick planned the ``Once and Again'' trial run to
end with a teasing finale involving a major crisis in the
burgeoning Lily-Rick relationship. How things will work out after
the series returns, they aren't telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did `Thirtysomething,''' Herskovitz says, ``we were
very clear in our minds that we didn't want people to know what was
coming, because somehow knowing what was coming would change the
experience of it happening. That served us very well in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you won't hear Ward complaining about the veil of
secrecy _ or, for that matter, about anything else. She's back in
the spotlight on a hit series and, like Lily, she's on a voyage of
rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my life is just beginning,'' Ward says. ``I don't
think I've ever been happier. I feel right. I feel ... yummy.''

 (Includes a color slide of Gloria Estefan with Meryl Streep and
Angela Bassett in a scene from ``Music of the Heart.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Gloria Estefan doesn't seem to get being a celebrity.
 &HT;    A small figure curled up on a coach at New York's Regency Hotel
on a fall afternoon, Estefan apparently can't master the rules of
divadom.
 &HT;    She serves soft drinks to journalists.
 &HT;    She makes sure her handlers have enough cookies.
 &HT;    She even asks a publicist from Miramax Films when she will have
time for a bathroom break.
 &HT;    ``I never complain about anything in this life,'' says the
singer _ who, only a few years ago, was grievously injured in a
highway accident and told that she would never walk again.
 &HT;    ``When a complaint is on the tip of my tongue, I remember the
day, months after my own accident, when I was able to put my
underwear on myself,'' the 42-year-old Estefan says. ``I could lift
my leg an inch off the ground and maneuver it. That day always
brings everything else into focus, so nothing is a big deal to me
now.
 &HT;    ``I can get up and walk across this room to get myself a glass
of water,'' she says. ``I can hold my child. I can carry her in my
arms. I can run up to my husband and hug him. What else is there in
this life?''
 &HT;    Well, for starters there's a movie career.
 &HT;    The singer will make her big-screen debut in ``Music of the
Heart,'' opening Oct. 29. The film stars Meryl Streep as a violin
teacher who comes to Harlem to start a school music program, with
Estefan in a small but pivotal role as a supportive teacher.
 &HT;    The director is Wes Craven, best known for ``A Nightmare on Elm
Street'' (1984) and ``Scream'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``When I heard Wes was doing a violin movie, I said, `What, is
he going to slit my throat with the strings?''' Estefan says with a
laugh. ``I thought it was a horror movie.''
 &HT;    For the singer, making her film debut _ after rejecting numerous
scripts in the past _ was scary enough without a mad slasher.
 &HT;    ``My husband Emilio and I always knew if a great movie role
didn't come along, we could create our own project eventually,''
Estefan says. ``But I really wanted to get my feet wet outside my
own power base.''
 &HT;    That power base lies in music and the Cuban community, into
which Estefan was born in 1957 as Gloria Fajardo in Havana. Her
father was a soldier in the security detail for the family of Cuban
dictator Gen. Fulgencio Batista.
 &HT;    In 1959, when Fidel Castro seized power, the Fajardos fled Cuba.
Estefan was 2 years old when her family settled in Miami.
 &HT;    Soon, however, her father was recruited into a C.I.A.-backed
brigade of 1,300 Cuban refugees that launched the unsuccessful Bay
of Pigs invasion two years later. He landed in a Cuban prison for
two years.
 &HT;    After his release he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to
Vietnam, where he was exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange, which
his daughter believes triggered the multiple sclerosis which struck
him soon thereafter.
 &HT;    A young Gloria had to tend her sick father and raise her younger
sister, while her mother struggled to support the family by working
as a teacher.
 &HT;    ``Those were very rough moments,'' she says. ``My Dad was a big
guy. My Dad would forget that he couldn't walk and he would fall.
Then I would have to find ways of trying to lift him back up again.
I had to bathe him _ he was very embarrassed.
 &HT;    ``But in retrospect, it taught me so much,'' she adds. ``I
learned how to deal with everything that life throws at you. I
think it toughened me. It taught me how to be patient.''
 &HT;    Young, overweight and burdened with her family responsibilities,
Estefan had virtually no social life, she says. She found joy in
singing and playing her guitar, and devoted herself to school,
earning a scholarship to study psychology at the University of
Miami.
 &HT;    Those plans ended one night at a local club, however, when she
saw a local Cuban-American quartet called the Miami Latin Boys.
 &HT;    The band's leader, Emilio Estefan, immediately fell for the
young girl, and invited her to try singing with the band.
 &HT;    ``I wowed them with my voice because I had so much angst,''
Estefan recalls. ``It came out through my singing.''
 &HT;    Soon the bandleader and the aspiring singer were an item and,
under his guidance, she found her confidence growing.
 &HT;    ``He saw that I had this shell, and said, `You can keep your
shell and still be a performer, but you'll be a tortured one,'''
she recalls. ``So I thought, `I love music. I want people to see
how much I love it.' Slowly, I began to feel more and more
comfortable and lost the weight.''
 &HT;    One year later, the group was renamed The Miami Sound Machine
and released two albums, and the road to success opened before
them. During the early 1980s the band's Spanish-language albums
soared to the top of the Latin American charts.
 &HT;    Life was good for the Estefans, who had married in 1978, but
they wanted more than Latin success. In 1984 they took on the
American market with the dance single ``Dr. Beat,'' which debuted
at number 10 on the U.S. dance charts. The all-English album
``Primitive Love'' (1985), with its hit single ``Conga,'' made
Gloria Estefan an international sensation.
 &HT;    Soon the band became Gloria Estefan and The Miami Sound Machine,
then simply Gloria Estefan. Her solo album ``Cuts Both Ways''
(1989) and its singles ``Can't Stay Away From You,'' ``Anything for
You'' and ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' all hit No. 1 on the charts.
 &HT;    And then, seemingly at the pinnacle, Estefan almost lost it all.
 &HT;    In 1990, as the band was in the middle of a successful tour, a
truck broadsided the tour bus. Estefan suffered broken and
dislocated vertebra in her back, and underwent four hours of
surgery in which two 8-inch titanium rods were permanently
implanted to stabilize and align her spinal column.
 &HT;    The singer credits her husband for her all-but-miraculous
recovery.
 &HT;    ``This man literally didn't leave my side for three months,''
she says. ``He would spend his days lifting me up and putting me
down. I couldn't sleep for more than 45 minutes at a time. He would
get up with me each time and force me to move as much as possible.
In the hall, I would hear him crying.''
 &HT;    Fans sent 4,000 floral arrangements, 11,000 telegrams and 50,000
postcards and letters.
 &HT;    ``In my heart, I knew I would be OK,'' Estefan says. ``I willed
myself not to end up in a wheelchair like my father. And I honestly
think the human mind can achieve miracles.''
 &HT;    The next year, Estefan had a new album, ``Into the Light,'' and
returned to the stage with a yearlong, 29-country tour. She even
got a hit song, ``Coming Out of the Dark,'' out of her health
crisis.
 &HT;    Next up for Estefan is a new Spanish album, due out in March,
and a world tour which will kick off next year.
 &HT;    ``I sing because I want to touch everyone in what I call `that
place,''' Estefan says. ``When people pay to see me, I want them to
know that they have me for that one night. It's personal _ it's
about me and that fan.''

 (Includes a color slide of John Malkovich in a scene from ``Being
John Malkovich.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He's just being John Malkovich.
 &HT;    That is to say, the enigmatic actor is being typically
enigmatic. In New York to promote his latest movie, ``Being John
Malkovich,'' he cuts a businessman-suave figure in a navy-blue
suit, speaks in a decidedly nonmenacing whisper and utters deep
thoughts in bursts of oddly constructed sentences laden with mixed
messages and the occasional SAT-caliber word.
 &HT;    Listen, for example, to his thoughts on the perception, in
Hollywood and among the general public, that he's a screen villain
without peer.
 &HT;    ``It's irritating,'' he says, taking a long drag on a cigarette.
``Look at my films this year: I've played John Malkovich, the king
of France, F.W. Murnau and Herman Mankiewicz. But if people want to
say I only play bad guys, what am I going to do about it?
 &HT;    ``Certainly, I've gotten more laughs in straight plays than most
comedians get in their f---ing lives.''
 &HT;    The frustration in his voice comes across loud and clear.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand, so what?'' he continues. ``I have to look
at it in a secondary and a tertiary way. I'm a saxophonist who got
known for playing the drums. I'm not a movie actor, and I'm lucky
to get another job. So it's already fine _ I'm way ahead of the
game.
 &HT;    ``And it's not a real frustration, really at all,'' Malkovich
adds. ``The camera likes what it likes. They says the camera
doesn't lie, and I say that's what it's for.''
 &HT;    All of which may be a bit hard to follow, but it's nothing
compared to the wonderfully warped ``Being John Malkovich,'' which
will open nationwide on Oct. 29. In the film, Malkovich plays ...
well, John Malkovich, as a put-upon, womanizing and
more-than-a-little-arrogant movie icon.
 &HT;    John Cusack stars as a luckless Manhattan puppeteer who lands a
day job as a file clerk and soon discovers, hidden behind a
cabinet, a boarded-up portal into the mind of John Malkovich.
Cusack and co-worker Catherine Keener promptly hawk tickets to ride
for 15 minutes in Malkovich's head, eventually wreaking havoc for
them and for Cameron Diaz, who plays Cusack's disheveled wife, as
well as for Malkovich himself.
 &HT;    ``I don't think anybody reading `Being John Malkovich' who ever
lived or worked in Hollywood for more than a second would ever
expect this film to get made,'' the actor says.
 &HT;    Why not?
 &HT;    ``Because it's good,'' he says. ``Of course, they probably never
thought I'd make it. If I didn't say yes, then this original,
interesting movie wouldn't get made.
 &HT;    ``You don't see enough original, interesting movies,'' Malkovich
adds, ``and I wasn't going to be the guy to kill this.''
 &HT;    Still, it's a surprise that Malkovich agreed to participate in
the film. He has a notorious disdain for the Hollywood machine _ he
refuses to read any press about himself, for example _ and
ferociously guards his private life with his family in France. Not
to mention the genuine risk of further blurring the line between
reality and fiction.
 &HT;    ``It could be dangerous,'' Malkovich concedes with a shrug. ``It
was a concern, but it was also an unknowable. We'll see.
 &HT;    ``There are two things in the movie about wanting to be someone
else,'' he adds. ``One is very harmless and very good, and that's
that it addresses and encompasses native curiosity and our very
human _ and not very have-able, in today's society _ need to leave
ourselves, to get away from whatever is in our heads or hearts for
some period of time.
 &HT;    ``The second thing, which is more sinister and deeply
concerning, is the celebrity thing, the need to lead a virtual
life, meaning your sorrows and joys and passions aren't as
interesting as mine, of course, or George Clooney's or John
Goodman's,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``We go to McDonald's. We have to decide if we're going to park
the car or go through McDrive, get a Coke or an iced tea. Life goes
on.''
 &HT;    On the less serious side, Malkovich was often amused to find
himself getting instructions from director Spike Jonze on how to
play his character. In other words, Jonze was telling Malkovich how
to play Malkovich.
 &HT;    ``How can you really argue?'' Malkovich says, smiling. ``If
someone says, `You wouldn't do it that way,' what do you do? I'd
say, `OK, how do you think I'd do it?' He'd say, `Well, I think
you'd do it like this ... '
 &HT;    ``I didn't write it,'' he adds with a chuckle. ``I had nothing
to do with it. I just played it.''
 &HT;    Malkovich earned his status as at least a cult icon in going on
three decades of work on television, film and the stage. The
45-year-old Illinois native first made his mark in 1976 as a
founder of the Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theatre Company, with
which he participated in dozens of shows as producer, director
and/or actor. He later scored a hit in New York with Sam Shepard's
``True West'' (1982), which won him an Obie Award. His Broadway
debut in ``Death of a Salesman'' (1984) was followed by ``Burn
This'' (1987), both of which earned glowing reviews.
 &HT;    On television, Malkovich won an Emmy for ``Death of a Salesman''
(1985) and also appeared in ``Heart of Darkness'' (1994). His
latest small-screen project, ``RKO 281,'' will debut Nov. 20 on
HBO. The behind-the-scenes saga of the troubled production of the
classic film ``Citizen Kane'' (1941), it casts Malkovich as
screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz.
 &HT;    Moviegoers know the two-time Oscar nominee for ``Places in the
Heart'' (1984), ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988), ``In the Line of
Fire'' (1993) and ``Con Air'' (1998). One of the industry's busiest
actors, he has a full slate of upcoming projects which, besides
``Being John Malkovich,'' includes ``The Messenger: The Story of
Joan of Arc,'' due out on Nov. 12, and ``Burned to Light,'' with
Malkovich as F.W. Murnau, director of the classic horror film
``Nosferatu'' (1922).
 &HT;    The actor is currently in Canada, filming the mob drama
``Knockaround Guys.'' Early next year, he'll make his
feature-directing debut, after many successful stage productions,
with a drama entitled ``The Dancer Upstairs.''
 &HT;    Clearly Malkovich likes to work, and he takes that work very
seriously.
 &HT;    ``I'm personally happiest when I'm working on a script with a
writer,'' he says. ``After that, I'm happiest when I'm directing a
play.
 &HT;    ``I love acting on the stage,'' Malkovich adds, ``but I'm old
and it's tiring. It's great when you're 25, but I don't have that
energy anymore. That's probably why I do so many films.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``And, despite how much certain people want me to be, I'm not
really very unhappy with myself,'' he says. ``Nor am I particularly
happy with myself.''
 &HT;    Malkovich squints.
 &HT;    ``I'm just pretty OK being who I am and what I am,'' he says.
``I'm used to being me.''

 (Includes a color slide of Anthony Hopkins in a scene from ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'') 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Wall paintings dating from 3000 B.C., depicting evil figures and
piles of skeletons, suggest that people back then loved a good
scare.
 &HT;    Since then, it's been the same story: The ancient Greeks traded
tales of flesh-eating creatures, and the second-century Roman
author Pliny wrote about haunted houses.
 &HT;    But horror stories took on a whole new life _ or living death? _
with the invention of the motion picture.
 &HT;    The earliest film pioneers didn't have to stage spooky scenarios
to frighten their audiences _ merely watching moving pictures was
pretty scary to most people a century ago. When Paris viewers saw a
train speed toward them for the first time in 1895's one-scene
movie ``L'Arrivee d'un Train a la Crotat,'' many ran screaming for
the nearest exit.
 &HT;    Advances in movie technology enabled filmmakers to show us the
demons that the storytellers couldn't, but _ as ``The Blair Witch
Project'' (1999) demonstrated all over again _ sometimes the unseen
is more frightening. Alfred Hitchcock, hailed as ``the master of
suspense,'' said he believed in ``putting the horror in the mind of
the audience,'' not on the screen.
 &HT;    In a way, he was following in the footsteps of those ancient
Greeks, as have filmmakers through the decades, whether their films
were elegantly ambiguous or stomach-turningly graphic.
 &HT;    How well do you remember these films that gave viewers the feel
of reel terror? 
 -0- 
 TEST YOUR TERROR QUOTIENT  
 &HT;    1. Besides rats and armadillos, who shares the count's
Transylvanian castle in ``Dracula'' (1931)?
 &HT;    2. What is the name of Dr. Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant,
who steals an ``abnormal'' brain for his boss in ``Frankenstein''
(1931)?
 &HT;    3. Why was Imhotep, title character in ``The Mummy'' (1932),
buried alive in the first place?
 &HT;    4. The East Indian drug monocane transforms scientist Jack
Griffin into ... who?
 &HT;    5. You too may succumb to lycanthropy, like ``The Wolfman''
(1941), if you have a certain mark on your palm. What mark is it?
 &HT;    6. Graf Orlok, the title character in ``Nosferatu'' (1922), is
far uglier than Dracula. And, unlike his more famous counterpart,
he doesn't perish by a stake through the heart. What destroys him?
 &HT;    7. Like, this guy Merrick (Donald Sutherland) shows up and tells
what title teen that she has to, like, stop some kind of dark evil
forces instead of going to the mall?
 &HT;    8. According to Armand (Antonio Banderas) in ``Interview With

 (Includes a color slide of Sela Ward in a scene from ``Once and
Again.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sela Ward might almost have been waiting for this.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following her five-season run on the acclaimed
drama ``Sisters'' _ which earned her a Best Actress Emmy in 1994 as
the exotic, neurotic Teddy _ Ward chose work judiciously: a few
small parts in movies such as ``The Fugitive'' (1993), ``My Fellow
Americans'' (1996) and ``54'' (1998), the occasional television
movie such as ``Almost Golden: The Jessica Savitch Story'' (1995)
and even the odd quirky sitcom one-shot, as a gorgeous love
interest for ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   All along, she had offers for other drama series, but she always
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore I would never, ever do another hour-long series,'' the
actress says. ``It's just too many hours, too draining.''
</P>
<P>
   All that went out the window, though, when Ward was approached
by ``Thirtysomething'' creators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward
Zwick about a new drama, ``Once and Again,'' which they were
prepping for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The central character was Lily, a newly divorced, 40-year-old
mother of two whose already frenetic life is turned upside down
when she meets and falls for a ruggedly handsome, divorced dad
named Rick _ played by Bill Campbell, best known for ``The
Rocketeer'' (1991) _ who also has two kids.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward read the script, she reports, she was instantly
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``On page one,'' she says, ``in that interview with Lily, where
she's speaking about how all she wants is to feel safe in life, I'm
going, `Oh, that's me!' I make every decision in my life based on
that kind of thing. By the time I got through with the script, I
couldn't get it out of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's instincts were on the money. ABC liked ``Once and Again''
enough to launch it in ``NYPD Blue's'' time slot for a six-week
test in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move: So far ``Once and Again'' is this season's
second-highest-rated new drama, closely trailing NBC's much-hyped
``The West Wing.'' ABC is pleased, and the series will reportedly
receive a Saturday-night slot of its own starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is an offbeat venture for its creators. A
good deal of screen time is spent alternately with Lily and Rick,
in stark black-and-white, speaking into the camera about their
innermost personal feelings. As a result, both actors say they've
gotten a grasp of their characters deeper than usual so early in a
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick is unsure of himself, a little swamped and a hopeless
romantic,'' Campbell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lily is smart, a great mother, neurotic, not self-assured,
vulnerable, funny and a blast to play,'' Ward adds.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic content on ``Once and Again'' is heightened by
dialogue that's vintage ``Thirtysomething'' _ brutally honest and
fraught with human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coined them `the Dream Team of all time,''' Ward says of
Herskovitz and Zwick, who also created the Emmy-winning ``My
So-Called Life.'' ``They write such honest, compelling dialogue. It
was the exact same way on `Thirtysomething' _ that's how real
people actually talk.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing for sure, though: This is not ``The Brady Bunch.'' The
families on ``Once and Again'' enter the picture with plenty of
emotional baggage: Lily's daughter Grace (Julia Whelan) is freaked
out about her mother's new boyfriend, while her 9-year-old sister
Zoe (Meredith Deane) still thinks her mom is going to get back
together with her irresponsible ex-husband, Jake (Jeffrey
Nordling).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rick's kids are similarly messed up: At 16, young
Rick (Shane West) is already having sex _ unlike his dad, at least
in the first few episodes _ and 12-year-old Jessie (Evan Rachel
Wood) is feeling ignored and confused.
</P>
<P>
   It's not happy talk, but it is reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did `My So-Called Life,''' Zwick says, ``it was about
the teen-age experience, and that will be this to some degree. And
it's also subjectively about the experience of love and about
parenting teen-age children. I think that's maybe the fulcrum that
draws those two things together _ I think that will allow us to
actually do a show that's about both. Because, in my experience,
they can't exist exclusive of one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Once and Again's'' young co-stars have been struck by the
show's realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have been divorced twice, actually _ once at 2 and
once at 13,'' West says. ``So a lot of this was like therapy. I got
to see things from a different viewpoint, and it was very easy to
identify with the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Deane says she can recognize the in-family
squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though my parents aren't divorced, I think it's easy to
relate to a character that you can really understand,'' she says.
``Everyday fights with your sister, getting in the way of your mom
_ just being there and being part of a family. It's easy to relate
to.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pivotal figure on ``Once and Again,'' Ward also sees a
lot of honesty in the storytelling, particularly in those scenes in
which Lily and Rick simultaneously rediscover their physical
feelings and are fumbling with each other's clothes like a pair of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I fell so in love with this show,'' she says, ``is
because I think, perhaps unwittingly, they've written something
that celebrates age, that celebrates that at 40 there is life. At
40, there are new experiences _ at 40, you can have the same
feelings and emotions and state of expectancy that you had when you
were 18 and 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, Ward says she isn't at all the harried mother she
plays on her show. At 43, the onetime model is a happily married
mother of two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the semi-sabbatical she took after ``Sisters''
wasn't her idea, she adds. It was just that most of the lead roles
she pursued went instead to younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the reality of Hollywood casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wasteland of roles for particular women,'' Ward says.
``I mean, if you look at the actresses playing opposite the Michael
Douglases and even Harrison Ford, you know, excuse me? They can't
play opposite someone close to their own age? Or even 15 years
younger?''
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz and Zwick planned the ``Once and Again'' trial run to
end with a teasing finale involving a major crisis in the
burgeoning Lily-Rick relationship. How things will work out after
the series returns, they aren't telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did `Thirtysomething,''' Herskovitz says, ``we were
very clear in our minds that we didn't want people to know what was
coming, because somehow knowing what was coming would change the
experience of it happening. That served us very well in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you won't hear Ward complaining about the veil of
secrecy _ or, for that matter, about anything else. She's back in
the spotlight on a hit series and, like Lily, she's on a voyage of
rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my life is just beginning,'' Ward says. ``I don't
think I've ever been happier. I feel right. I feel ... yummy.''

   SCOTUS-RDP (Washington) _ A roundup: The Supreme Court rules
there is no such thing as a crime scene exception to the
requirement for a search warrant; a lower court had said that some
incriminating evidence found at the scene was admissible because it

   DENVER-SHOOTING (Denver) _ Accused Columbine High School killer
Dylan Klebold's parents have notified the local sheriff and two

The legal document filed by Tom and Sue Klebold, is more popularly
known as a ``notice of intent to sue.'' Under Colorado law, state

   INTERNET-BARTER (Undated) _ Since the first cave man exchanged
his favorite club for a neighbor's animal pelt, barter has been an
accepted form of commerce. Now some Internet companies have turned
themselves into virtual trading posts, making barter a way of life.
Such exchanges have become so common that they may in fact be
skewing the financial picture for the Internet industry. Because
these new companies rarely have profits, revenues are often the key
determination of their value. Strong revenue growth, therefore, can
translate into higher stock prices. By Edward Wyatt.

<P>
   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Twelve years ago, the stock
market crashed in the largest one-day fall ever. Now, by some
measures, the stock market is even more volatile than it was then.
Volatility can sharply increase, as it did in 1980, when a leading
sector _ then, energy stocks _ has risen to unsupportable
valuations. It is possible that the current surge in volatility is
foretelling a similar turn in this era's dominant sector,
technology. Not all increases in volatility, however, tell such
stories. New ways of trading, brought on by technology and
financial engineering, can roil the markets until other traders
become used to the impacts generated by such trading. That was true
of institutional block trading in the 1970s and computerized index
arbitrage in the 1980s. And it may be true now of Internet-based
day trading. By Floyd Norris.

ON-LINE AUCTIONS TURN YARD SALES INTO SUCCESS STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a worldwide flea market filled with
millions of buyers, sellers and stuff you never knew you needed or
even imagined existed. You name it, covet it, disdain it, don't
know what to call it _ it's on eBay, the grandaddy and titan of
on-line auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   For the obsessed, it is changing the way people buy, sell and
plan their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given me a whole new life,'' said Penny Walden, 54, of
Seattle, who is about to quit her job as a cancer researcher so she
can sell antiques full time. Her business partner, Sarah Peyton,
35, already has stopped working as a Russian interpreter to handle
the bookkeeping and research end of the business. They say they
have made $100,000 in nine months, and Peyton can stay home with
her infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Their antiques store: eBay.
</P>
<P>
   This success story is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Pick any 20 eBay users at random from across the United States
and Canada, and they are almost giddy talking about their
experiences. Not that eBay is without controversy. Items for sale
have included babies, a human kidney, racist memorabilia and 500
pounds of Dutch marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   There have been scams, like the woman in Hesperia, Calif., who
was arrested for fraud after hawking rare Barbies she did not own.
And few buyers have been spared the inevitable disappointment of
receiving merchandise not as mint or authentic as described.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many buyers and sellers view eBay with evangelical fervor.
They cannot believe the number of customers they're reaching, the
money they are making, the treasures they have found and how it has
changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of mom and pops who used to answer my ads or put stuff
out on garage sales are now becoming computer literate,'' said Jim
Gambino, 37, of Belle Meade, N.J., a laser copier repairman who
collects Beatles memorabilia. ``Instead of putting that Beatles
`Flip Your Wig' game at a garage sale for $20, they're putting it
on eBay and getting $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is a true believer. At the September sale at the
Harvey Clars auction house in Oakland, buyers and sellers swore
that a virtual auction can't begin to compare with the fun of
rummaging through store racks or the thrill of a live auction with
its ``Going! Going! ... Gone!''
</P>
<P>
   There also is the advantage of seeing the item in real life.
``People still want to see, feel, sit in the real thing,'' said
David Van Derlin, 47, manager of Empire Furniture in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   As a dealer, though, he senses he cannot avoid on-line auctions
forever. Even with the biggest antiques store in Humboldt County,
in Northern California, there is still the allure of a worldwide
market.
</P>
<P>
   People do not need a huge inventory to sell stuff on eBay. There
is no need for a store, a license or training. With on-line
auctions, a lot of the old rules of doing business are gone.
Suddenly, people with little or no retail experience are becoming
instant entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days _ circa 1995, before eBay went on line _ there
were many ways to hawk stuff. Garage sales. Classified ads. Flea
markets. Resale stores.
</P>
<P>
   With on-line auctions, you are the dealer, and you have many
more potential customers than the people likely to stop by your
garage sale or the dealers listed in the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, you do not end up selling it for the first price
someone's willing to give you. There is no face-to-face haggling.
</P>
<P>
   The market, not sweet-talk or hardball tactics, decides the
price. The virtual marketplace can turn a hankering for
collectibles and cash into a thriving business, as more and more
people are discovering.
</P>
<P>
   Even shopkeepers see eBay as a bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Like many owners of antiques and specialty shops, Jim Thomason,
59, of A Toy Train Depot in Oakland, had things around for years
that he couldn't sell. Most customers were regulars who had already
seen his treasures.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he decided to try eBay. He sold 45 item, each one for
more than twice the price he had hoped. To reach those customers,
he paid only the 25 cents to $2 that eBay charges to list an item
for sale, plus the 1.25 percent to 5 percent commission.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Thomason said he had an average of 6 1/2 bids on
each item, 200 different bidders in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine how long it's been since I had 200 different
bidders? And that was in just one week,'' he said. ``What eBay does
is give incredible leverage to a small shopkeeper or individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Most customers at Sanderson's Antiques in West Monroe, La., are
either Texas dealers or the occasional tourist. With so little foot
traffic, Lynette and Michael Sanderson kept prices low just to make
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. With eBay, they are close to tripling their income
in less than a year, said Lynette Sanderson, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Sandersons sold a mahogany dining room set on eBay
for $15,100. If the set had been in their store, it would have gone
unsold for months, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a tabulator on their page showed that 1,490 people
had eyeballed the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get that much traffic in our store in a year,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foot traffic at auctions has skyrocketed in recent months. At
eBay alone, the number of registered users almost tripled the first
six months of this year, from 2.1 million in January to 5.8 million
at the end of June, according to Kevin Pursglove, the San Jose
company's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although several Internet giants _ like Amazon.com and Yahoo _
host auctions, and Microsoft and some partners are about to join
the fray, none comes close to eBay in size and scope.
</P>
<P>
   According to eBay's home page, some 3 million items are up for
bid in more than 2,000 categories at any given second.
</P>
<P>
   From the inception of eBay four years ago, some 60 million items
have sold, Pursglove said. Each day, sales worth $6.8 million take
place. The company claims that only 0.30 percent of the sales have
involved fraud.

   MORALS _ WASHINGTON _ Modern studies have shown that damage to

   SYPHILIS-ROCKDALE _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Before this year's Heritage
High shooting, an earlier scandal shook Rockdale County _ the
diagnosis of a cluster of syphilis cases among affluent teens less
than 18 years old. In 1996, as Atlanta was preparing for the
Olympics, 17 teens tested positive for syphilis, more than 200 were
treated, and about 50 acknowledged being part of a ring of kids who
would meet for group sex at each other's houses while parents were
not around. Tonight (Tuesday) a PBS Frontline documentary, ``The
Lost Children of Rockdale County,'' tells the story of the outbreak
and talks to many teens and some parents; it ultimately traces both
the outbreak and the school shooting to teen alienation, peer
pressure and lack of parental involvement. (McKenna, Atlanta

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CATHEDRAL-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ While the Roman Catholic
Church condemned Galileo, new research shows that centuries of
oversimplifications have concealed how hard Rome worked to amass
astronomical tools, measurements, tests and lore. In its scientific
zeal, the Church adapted cathedrals across Europe, and a tower at
the Vatican itself, so their darkened vaults could serve as solar
observatories. Beams of sunlight that fell past religious art and
marble columns not only inspired the faithful but provided
astronomers with information about the Sun, the Earth and their
celestial relationships. By William J. Broad. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA (Undated) _ For most people with asthma, the proper
use of medication, education and self-management can go a long way
to keeping them out of the emergency room functioning at home,
school or work, experts say. But sadly, many patients with the
diseases fail to adhere to the regimen and many others simply do
not understand it. By Denise Grady. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA-TREAT (Undated) _ A rundown of the various medicines
available in the treatment of asthma. By Denise Grady. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Despite the seemingly endless
rise in asthma cases, new treatments for the disease have been
noticeably slow in coming. Within the past two years, for example,
three new drugs have been released to treat migraines, with another
due in the spring. But for asthma, which accounts for more
pediatric hospitalizations each year than any other illness, only
two significant drugs were approved in the same time period,
Accolate by Astra-Zeneca and Singulair from Merck. By David J.
Morrow. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ A new calculation suggests that
dense star clusters, which are sprinkled throughout galaxies in
Earth's cosmic neighborhood, act as assembly lines for tightly
orbiting pairs of black holes and then spit them out of the
cluster. There, they eventually fall together and merge into one.
Next year, if all goes well, scientists will be able to take the
first steps toward testing that theory with a new $350 million
instrument called a gravity wave observatory. By James Glanz. (1200
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MAMMARIES (Undated) _ According to the commonly accepted
``one-half rule,'' the average number of young in a litter is one
half the typical number of mammaries and the maximum litter size is
equal to the total number of mammaries. But studies of naked mole
rats defy that rule, in part, scientists suspect, because of the
docile behavior of the offspring and the protected environment in
which mole rats raise their young. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1250
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LEOPOLD-CONSERVATION (New York) _ In the field of
conservation, Aldo Leopold is a titan. His ``Sand County Almanac''
is a bible of the environmental movement every bit as much as
Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring.'' In Washington, where national
conservation policy has been going through major changes of
philosophy in recent years, his name and ideas are everyday
currency. So it is that in this 50th anniversary year of the book,
which has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still going
strong, Leopold's ideas are being scrutinized afresh. A recent
conference was convened here by the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences,
Arts and Letters to examine his legacy and its relevance for the
future. By William K. Stevens.
</P>

<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on
plastics made from plants, pheromones in frogs and a spider's sun
compass. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Since the mid-1980s, the yearly
total of Americans given diagnoses of brain tumors has doubled, and
it is expected to exceed 100,000 this year. More than half the
increase has occurred in people over 65. Survival rates, too, have
been inching upward, thanks to improved diagnostic techniques and
more precise and inventive methods of treatment, like stereotactic
radiosurgery (a pinpoint form of radiation) and laser surgery with
a gamma knife. Further progress is expected to result from some
still experimental treatments, including immunotherapy, gene
therapy and wafers of chemotherapeutic agents implanted in the
tumor site. By Jane E. Brody. (1275 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-MORNING-AFTER (Undated) _ Frustrated by the continued
spread of HIV, a growing number of AIDS doctors are trying out a
kind of morning-after treatment: an experimental application of
drugs meant to abort infection in a person who was recently exposed
to the virus through unsafe sex. By David France. (1340 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IRONMAN (Undated) _ How grownups with real jobs make the
time to train for physical endurance tests like the Ironman World
Championships in Hawaii. By Jill Agostino. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Zapping a heart back into normal rhythm is so simple a group
of sixth graders can learn how to do it in about a minute, new
research proves. (255 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Yale researchers have developed a new blood test to help
detect ehrlichiosis, a disease carried by deer ticks that often
goes undiagnosed because it lacks a telltale sign like the
bull's-eye rash of Lyme disease. (355 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Cigarettes do help smokers relax _ from tension caused by
smoking, a new study argues. The study, published in this month's
issue of American Psychologist, reviewed research into one of
tobacco's central paradoxes: smokers universally say that lighting
up gives a sense of relief and well-being, but as a group, they
hardly seem all that relaxed. (235 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Heart attack victims who are generally hostile people tend to
be younger, heavier and unhappier than most coronary patients _ and
to get more benefit from a cardiac rehabilitation program, a study
conducted in New Orleans has found. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The 300,000 Americans who may have been exposed to the
hepatitis C virus through tainted blood transfusions before 1992
can take an Internet quiz this week to gauge their risk and order a
free home test kit. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ Optimism and a fighting attitude
may help breast cancer patients cope with their illness, but
positive thinking is unlikely to increase the chances of survival,
according to a study by British researchers. At the same time,
persistent hopelessness may lower a woman's chances of survival. By
Erica Goode. (530 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: How and why
does a chameleon change its colors? (300 words)

<P>
   Q. I am 52 and single and make $62,500 a year. I am vested in a
401(k) plan with a value of $52,000, of which 25 percent is in a
guaranteed interest account, 25 percent is in a stock-oriented
balanced fund, 25 percent in a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index fund,
and the rest in a mid-cap blend stock fund. I contribute 9 percent
of my salary to the 401(k). I also have a $133,000 IRA with $68,000
invested in common stocks, $14,000 in international mutual funds,
and the rest in small-cap mutual funds. I also have a $39,000 stock
account to which I contribute $500 a month. I hope that this
account will allow me to pay off my mortgage early, which has a
balance of $177,000. I have $40,000 in another common stock
account. And I own two condos, with combined market values of
$140,000 and combined mortgages of $69,000. These will be paid off
in 10 years, at which time they will provide about $1,000 a month
income. I would like to retire at age 62. I see that I am heavily
invested in stocks and need to make changes. What do you suggest I
do to be able to retire in 10 years with an income of $4,000 a
month?
</P>
<P>
   I.D., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you realize an average 10 percent growth from your 401(k),
your IRA, and the stock account that is not earmarked to deal with
your mortgage, you would accumulate $677,347 over the next 10
years, presuming continued contributions at the current level.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement you would need about $555,000 in a fixed-income
account to bring you the $3,000 monthly income that, combined with
your expected rental income, would give you the money you require.
And you would have about $122,000 that you could leave in stocks,
with this account calculated to protect you against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't as much as I'd like to see in that last account, but
there are two other factors that should work in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   First is the possibility you will be eligible for Social
Security, which would mean you would have to put considerably less
in the fixed-income account.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the account that you have earmarked to pay off the
mortgage on your primary residence. I presume you are calculating
this stock portfolio should bring you returns in excess of the
mortgage interest rate, and the deductibility of the mortgage
interest provides an extra fillip.
</P>
<P>
   With your $500 monthly contributions and presumed 10 percent
annual portfolio growth, this account would reach $201,162 in a
decade. By that time, of course, 10 years of amortization through
your regular mortgage payments would have taken the balance well
below the current level, so you would be in a position to pay it
off with a tidy bit left over. You could then add this to the stock
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that you now have about 10 percent on the
fixed-income side of the portfolio that is apart from the account
you have earmarked to pay off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that a little more on the fixed-income side would be a
good idea. You might first go through the common stock portfolio in
the IRA, looking for issues with the weakest prospects, and then go
through the taxable account to determine if selling some of these
shares would not have ugly tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that at this point you divert about $25,000 to the
fixed-income side. But I also would look at the menu of options for
your 401(k) to determine if there is an intermediate-term bond fund
that is likely to outproduce the guaranteed interest account.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to slowly build the fixed-income side of the retirement
portfolio, I suggest you allocate 50 percent of your ongoing
contributions there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We started a serious plan for retirement much later than we
should have. At present, my wife and I both have IRAs invested in
the same funds _ United Income and United Science and Technology.
We also have taxable holdings in United Accumulative, United New
Concepts, and in the same two funds we hold in our IRAs. All of
these accounts combined amount to $80,000, and we are adding to
them at a rate of $1,233 per month. The funds have been doing
fairly well, but what troubles us is the 5 3/4 percent upfront fee
we pay every month as we make our payments. In our research, the
Vanguard funds seem to be some of the best in both performance and
the amount of fees charged. We recently opened a money market
account there, but are confused as to which way to go. We are in
our late 50s and have an adequate amount in real estate
investments, but still want to do better at getting diversified
investments before retiring in about five years.
</P>
<P>
   M.W., Seaside, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although the United Science and Technology Class A shares
carry a 5 3/4 percent upfront charge, as you cite, the fund has an
overall expense ratio of 1.05, according to the latest figures from
Morningstar Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is about 70 basis points lower than the typical
expense ratio among its peer funds, so the long-term investor will
eventually find that the upfront charge is a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   More critical is the question of total returns and risk, and in
those categories United Science and Technology is a winner.
Moreover, if you went to Vanguard, you couldn't find a similar
investment. The United fund focuses its portfolio on both health
care and technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The closest you could come at Vanguard is its excellent Health
Care fund, but that is closed to new investors, and wouldn't
provide you with the technology exposure. So in this case the nod
would go to the United fund.
</P>
<P>
   You could make just as powerful an argument on the other side of
the issue by comparing United Income fund with similar Vanguard
issues. Currently United Income invests in a portfolio of
value-oriented large-cap stocks, favoring those with established
payout records. It has a five-year record of 19.54 percent average
annual growth, a 0.89 percent expense ratio, and an average rating
from Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanguard, Vanguard Index Value has a similar portfolio focus,
a five-year record of 20.03 percent, an expense ratio of 0.22, and
an above-average rating from Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard is the logical choice for the parts of a portfolio that
focus on fixed-income holdings, index offerings, and the kind of
plain-vanilla offerings typified by its Asset Allocation and Growth
and Income funds. But beyond that, you need to analyze the options
fairly carefully.

Beauty and the Beast soundtrack wafting throughout the

playground outside, the model train rolling around a track near the
ceiling of the faux Victorian streetscape. And that's just the
trappings. Every 30 minutes, preschoolers are moved to a different
activity, from French to math to creative movement. Tuition runs
almost twice as high as the area average _ it's $12,000 a year for
preschoolers _ but satisfied parents say their children's happiness
is worth it. Yet child development experts warn that high cost does
not equal high quality. Kate Beem. Photo. 45.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATZRIN, Israel _ The Golan Heights would seem an unlikely place
for real estate speculation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Prime Minister Ehud Barak is hinting in talks with
Syria that in return for peace Israel might give back the beautiful
and strategic hills and lush vineyards of the Golan that Israel
captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   So how to explain that developer Motti Cohen is going ahead with
a 52-lot project in the Golan and sold 12 houses in the last two
weeks? And that hundreds more people have come out to visit the
site and seem interested.
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-brainer, says Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's a good investment. If Israel keeps the Golan,
they get a good deal,'' says Cohen, who is among a half-dozen
developers now building in the Golan. ``If Israel gives back the
Golan, the government will get the United States to compensate the
owners. They feel they can't go wrong on this.''
</P>
<P>
   So widespread is the presumption that the United States will
pick up the bill to compensate losses to Israeli farmers,
winemakers, and homeowners on the Golan that opponents of a
giveback are hoping to use the staggering price tag _ some
estimates put it as high as $10 billion _ to dissuade the United
States from backing a Golan deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an acceptance here, an unspoken belief, that Uncle
Sam will foot the bill for this,'' says Avi Zeira, chairman of the
Golan Residents Committee. A tough, native-born Israeli, he is
girding for battle in order to save the Golan, in part by trying to
raise awareness in the US Congress of the costs of a possible peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Americans realize just how much they could be
paying for the anxiousness of Barak and (President) Clinton to
reach a deal? Well, we are going to try to make sure they do
know,'' he added. It's not only insane for Israel in terms of its
security, it's insane for American taxpayers to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeira's calculation of the cost is based on a recent study by
Yoash Tzidon, a retired Israeli Air Force colonel and respected
analyst for the Tel Aviv-based Ariel Center for Policy Research.
Tzidon puts the cost at roughly $10 billion for compensation
packages to cover Israeli agriculture, wineries, water bottling
plants, and the relocation of roughly 17,000 Israeli residents of
the Golan. As much as $20 billion more would be needed, Tzidon
figures, for the Israeli military to put a standing army along the
border and establish antimissile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Zeira's Golan settler group now finds itself in the unique
position of arguing against aid to Israel to a US Congress that
historically has been more than ready to channel foreign aid to
Israel. Currently, Israel receives one-third of the total US
foreign aid package.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the Golan Heights has shifted drastically since
Barak's election. Under former Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, talks with Syria had hopelessly collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's more liberal Labor Party is trying to get the ball
rolling again, but for now Syrian president Hafez al-Assad is
publicly showing no willingness to reopen negotiations. He is
insisting that Israel commit to giving back all of the Golan, to
the border as it existed on June 4, 1967, as a precondition for
talks. That would mean Syria would control the northern bank of the
Sea of Galilee and other valuable water sources now under Israeli
control. Israelis insist if there is any relevant historical
precedent, it is the border established in 1923, which would leave
all of the Galilee and substantial high ground in the Golan in
Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts see Syria's retrenching as last-minute
posturing that could come before a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli left generally accepts a giveback of the Golan as
the only way to achieve peace with Syria and end the conflict in
neighboring Lebanon, in which Syria plays a key role. Syria has
some 30,000 troops in Lebanon and buttresses the Lebanese army,
while Hezbollah guerrilla fighters continue to try to force Israel
out of the 9-mile wide ``security zone'' it occupies in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Zeira, of the Golan Residents Committee, says the reason Barak
and the left can be cavalier about giving up the Golan is because
they know in the end that they will not be the ones paying the
price. The belief that residents of the Golan would be reimbursed
with American cash if they were forced to move runs deep. It is
based, some observers say, on the historic 1979 peace agreement
with Egypt, under which Israeli residents of the Sinai Peninsula
who were forced to leave received compensation packages funded by
US aid.
</P>
<P>
   US diplomatic sources here say they are keenly aware of the
widespread belief in Israel that America would foot the bill in the
Golan, too. Barak discussed the funding of a possible peace deal
with Syria in his meetings with Clinton last month, sources said.
The US position has been that if a deal is cut, the cost should be
shared with other European countries and Japan, and not fall solely
on the US.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of new reluctance to blindly fund Middle East peace
agreements, meanwhile, the US Congress is withholding the first
payment of a promised $1.2 billion to be paid to Israel and the
$400 million to Palestinians for signing the interim Wye agreement
one year ago. The money is expected to go through, but the delay,
observers say, is intended as a message.
</P>
<P>
   As Moshe Zak, an Israeli commentator for the Jerusalem Post,
recently pointed out, ``This delay in receiving vital American aid
forces us to reconsider certain axioms that have taken root in the
Israeli establishment: that the US will bear the financial expenses
of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Schwartz, press attache to US Ambassador Edward S. Walker
Jr., said, ``The United States will undoubtedly play a role in
helping to implement whatever agreement is made. However, the
discussion is premature about any aid that would be part of that.
They haven't even begun the negotiations yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Golan residents are indignant about the land speculation by
other Israelis, most of whom they say are not from the Golan. And
there are many Israelis, including Zak and Tzidon, who feel that
there is no price that can make up for the strategic security that
Israel gains by holding onto the high ground along the northern
border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In the lush vineyards where the Yarden Winery makes Israel's
most prized wines, the sentiment against giving up the Golan is
strong. Executives of the company, one of the most successful
businesses in Israel, are fiercely proud of the wine they have
produced since the early 1970s and are insulted at the thought that
anyone would try to buy them out. The winery is continuing to
produce its wine and plant new vineyards with the faith that Israel
will not give up the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want peace, but we want a good peace,'' said Adam
Montefiore, a senior executive at Yarden. ``But if peace means
ripping up vineyards, what kind of peace is that?''

TWO EXPERTS GAZE INTO THE CRYSTAL BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are a dynamic duo, no matter how you look at it. Merle and
Marshall Goldman are considered among the leading scholars in their
respective fields. She has China, he has Russia. They also know a
bit about the other's country, and are not shy about expressing it
_ or about disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
   Merle, 68, is a professor of Chinese history at Boston
University and a member of the executive committee of the Fairbanks
Center at Harvard, while Marshall, 69, is a professor of Russian
economics at Wellesley College and associate director of the Davis
Center for Russian Studies at Harvard University. Both have offices
(one floor apart) at Harvard's Coolidge Hall. For 40 years, they
have traveled to Russia, and for 20 years to China, often together,
most recently this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   So what insights can they offer into the future of Russia and
China? What is happening with the countries' relations with the
United States? What about the Russia-China relationship? John
Donnelly, the Globe's diplomatic corresponent, recently posed those
questions, and others, to the Goldmans.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the chances of Russia, China and even India forming
a closer alliance to counter-balance the United States's position
as sole superpower?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall Goldman:  &LR; Certainly Russia and China will get closer
together. But I don't see it as a long lasting thing . . . Their
interests are too different.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle Goldman:  &LR; The Russians truly fear the Chinese. They fear
if the Chinese come in large numbers they will take over that area
on the border. I see them coming closer together, but not too
close. There is a long legacy of conflict between Russia and China
and, perhaps more important, China can get much more from the
United States than it can from Russia. Russia is a market, but it's
not the kind of market that the Chinese have in the United States .
. .
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese are worried about the US as the only one great world
power and there is no countervailing power. But the prospect of
China and Russia and India joining together in some sort of
alliance against the United States is low.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall: With one exception. It depends on what the United
States does, because if we go and act as a hegemonic power, and we
try to intervene in, say, Pakistan or Tibet, that may provoke
something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You visited both Beijing and Moscow during the Kosovo war.
What was the attitude toward the United States then?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; When we intervened in Kosovo, the Chinese looked at
this as a precedent that could happen in Tibet or Taiwan. They
really talked about that. The sense is no one is there to stop us
from intervening. If Russia had been stronger, as it had been
during the Cold War, the Chinese believe we wouldn't have done what
we did in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall: The anger in Russia and China wasn't for show. In the
case of Russia, these were the Serbs, their little brothers, (that
the US was targeting.) The irony, of course, is that the Russians
in Chechnya are doing the same thing as we did in Kosovo. On
Russian TV the other day they showed the cross hairs and showed the
bomb going down. But that's on their territory. They still see the
US as being a big bully in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the longterm effect of the US role in Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; I think it's limited.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; I would say it's longer lasting. First there was
NATO expansion. Then, when Kosovo came, it added to the concerns
that the US could do what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   It's like a marriage: tensions build up, the next time you get
into a fight, there's not only the current issue but you bring up
things that have been accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does the United States often take a softer line toward
China than Russia, even when China issues threatening statements
over Taiwan?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; Someone once said that American foreign policy now
has to deal with the declining empire on the one hand and the
rising superpower on the other. It's easier to know how to deal
with Russia, much more difficult to deal with the Chinese, who are
not only a rising political power, but a rising economic power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; That's the major point: Russia was primarily a
military-industrial complex. China is a major economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall: What happens in this process is large vested groups of
special interests in the US don't want to pull the chain on China.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; The Fortune 500 companies were just meeting in China,
and they are just bending over backward, really somewhat kind of
disgustingly, fawning over Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall But it's not just the Fortune 500. It's the consumer.
You're going to take away these cheap Chinese products? You have a
very one-sided balance of trade. The Russians never had that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; The point is, if not the Chinese goods, it's the Indian
goods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; It's going to take a long time for India to catch
up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; Or the Indonesians. China is a very different kind of
rising power. You could have said that Japan in the '30s was
attempting to be both a military and economic power, not unlike
China today . . .
</P>
<P>
   One of the major differences between Japan in the '30s and China
today is that China's internal problems are huge, despite their
growing economy. Visualize a country with 1.3 billion people that
has to feed and clothe that many people. Something that haunts the
Chinese leadership is that this population might explode in some
kind of massive social protest. This has been part of Chinese
history from the beginning of time and it is a major concern for
this leadership.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; There is an irony here. The Chinese are very much
focused on domestic stability and to do this they must continue to
have an expanding economy. To do this, however, they must be able
to find markets for their growing output and we are their best
customer. So we are the key player. Without American markets, the
Chinese would not have been able to develop their industry and
would not be able to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; They would have gone to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; But the Europeans wouldn't let them in.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; I'm not even sure foreign trade is that important.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall: It's an outlet for their industry. In some sense, they
need us now more than we need them. But when it comes to a
showdown, it's very difficult for us to say to Boeing or anybody
else, we are going to let that market go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How should the US address human rights concerns with China?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; If China continues with human rights abuses, there's
not much we can do but speak out at international forums. But China
is affected by that. They do care about their image in the outside
world. They want to be regarded as a mainstream power. They don't
want to be seen as a pariah power. I'm not saying it will stop the
abuses, but it might limit them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can the countries learn from one another now?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; In many ways, Gorbachev was advocating what the Chinese
are doing, that is reform through the existing system, with a
gradual process of economic change and political change. The
Chinese excuse for going slowly in political reform is that if they
go quickly like Russia did, they will have chaos, and that is what
everyone fears _ the dissidents as well as the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; To some extent the Chinese are right because the
point is, once Gorbachev started messing around, it was very
difficult to restrain 70 years of pent-up demands and persuade the
public to move gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's ahead for both countries?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Merle:  &LR; In China, there is genuine social unrest now. In the
short run, there are going to be problems: their banks are close to
bankruptcy, the reforms in the countryside have petered out and
reform of state industries are slowing. But once they get through
this very difficult period, I expect the economy to continue to
grow. The hope is they will continue the gradual political reforms
they have started.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marshall:  &LR; The hope for China resolving these problems will be
very much dependent on markets being open to them. What is
interesting in China is when there are problems people seem to
protest.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, people seem to roll with the punches. How are the
Russians going to get rid of this legacy of corruption, theft and
dishonesty? The economy is beginning to show some growth, but where
will they go from here? There is a general feeling of rot that
pervades everything from Yeltsin down.

SETTING OUT TO SELL ITALY ON A PIZZA CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA DI LEUCA, Italy _ Here, at the southernmost tip of
Italy's heel, Paolo Micheli says, there is nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   Micheli's pizza parlor sits, appropriately enough, on a street
named for Christopher Columbus. Micheli has the same sense of
restlessness that drove the great Italian explorer to look beyond
the safe and the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Micheli has already lived in a half-dozen countries,
including the United States. He left home for the first time at 15,
to work as a busboy at a restaurant on the island of Elba.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama cried,'' he said. ``I cried, too, but I didn't let her
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, something always brings him home to this quaint harbor
village of 1,000, where everyone knows everything about everyone, a
fact that both appeals to and appalls Micheli.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans used to Pizza Hut, Bertucci's, Domino's and other
pizza chains, Micheli's franchising dreams may seem uninspired,
especially in the land that created the pizza pie.
</P>
<P>
   But here in southern Italy, there is no such thing as a pizza
chain. The winding roads of regions like Puglia are lined with
pizzerias, so many that it seems impossible that all of them could
stay open. But they are almost all mom-and-pop operations, the type
and quality of pizza depending on the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   (at)j
</P>
<P>
   Having sampled fare at pizza chains in various American cities
and in London, Micheli was convinced that he could produce a good,
unprocessed pizza that could be made with such consistency that it
could be franchised.
</P>
<P>
   With his brother Salvatore, his sister Adriana, and her husband,
Michele, they approached local businessman Fabio Martinucci, owner
of the village's most popular bar. With Martinucci's backing, they
opened Gnam on the waterfront last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced by Italians, Gnam sounds like ``Yum,'' which is a
common reaction of those who eat one of its pizzas. Micheli and his
partners found a machine that creates a thin, crisp pizza crust
with remarkable consistency. But changing attitudes here about the
desirability of chain food outlets is a bigger challenge than
creating the perfect pizza crust.
</P>
<P>
   Micheli realizes that there is something contradictory about his
wanting to create predictability about something as simple as pizza
in a culture that considers eating to be something more than
subsisting. But, he says, Italians are full of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get crazy here,'' he said, sitting at a table on
the sloping terrace overlooking the sleepy harbor. ``I don't
understand the mentality of people here. I'm not perfect. But
people will wait for two hours at the post office. When they get to
a table, they want things fast, but they expect it to be good,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   (at)j
</P>
<P>
   It is that contradictory expectation _ good food fast _ that
Micheli believes his pizza can satisfy. But finding the popular and
financial backing to translate his dream into a reality has proved
so far elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to open another place. Banks don't give money
easily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Micheli tends to look at things and ask why not, many
people here ask why anyone would want to create a franchise of
something as ubiquitous as pizzerias.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about money,'' Micheli said. ``This is about an
idea. This is about translating what I know about growing up here,
in the south of Italy, and what I have seen, all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his ambition, Micheli is a patient man. He believes
expansion can only be slow, and can only begin locally. If it
doesn't work in southern Italy, it won't work in southern France,
South London, or the South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's 18-hour days and waiting for a break. And for
Micheli, like other big thinkers, it means knowing that a break
might not come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, who knows?'' said Micheli, jumping up to bus a table.
``Next year, maybe I'll be closed. Maybe next year I'll open
something different.''

FINALLY, THE SCANDAL-MONGERS ARE OFF BABBITT'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In all fairness, Carol Elder Bruce bent over
backwards to be thorough and do the right thing by a scandalously
wronged man, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt _ for which she
deserves no credit whatsover.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason (protecting the rear end comes to mind), the
peculiar patois of prosecutors (and especially special prosecutors)
requires that no one ever be let off the hook, including those who
have never really been on it.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is supposed to be par for the course that after an
18-month independent counsel investigation into what may have been
the driest hole in history, Last-Name Bruce can say with defamatory
tentativeness that that the fruits of her labor ``would not support
a finding'' that First-Name Bruce committed perjury or any other
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that her fruits left the record exactly where it
was when politicians and the press began taking supposition and
insinuation to new depths after the 1996 election: blank, empty,
clean, unblemished. Nothing ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what you'd expect regarding someone with a
lifelong and deserved reputation for the highest probity and
integrity as a state attorney general and governor in his native
Arizona, a delightful-in-failure presidential candidate and a
secretary of the interior who in conservation history will belong
with Gifford Pinchot and Stewart Udall in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But this insult to justice occurred nevertheless, with all the
attendant blood shed in the Congress, the press, and then grand
jury rooms, simply because of the frightening ability of the Great
American Scandal Machine to suggest that something might have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   If you went anywhere near political news in the year following
the election, you know about Native American casino cash and
lobyists blocking other Native Americans hunting casino permits in
some remote part of Wisconsin, about White House middlemen,
Interior Department complicity and Babbitt somehow in the
crosshairs of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Fred Thompson's special committee made mountains out of
this molehill, feeding mammouth press interest, prompting de
rigueur calls for an independant counsel from politicians that
Attorney General Janet Reno (who is always damned when she does and
damned when she doesn't) proved unable to resist because of an
astonishing defect in her legal mind that rewards uncorroborated
accusations no matter how implausible.
</P>
<P>
   And Senator Thompson's special committee also made sure that the
evidence _ in person and documentary _ showing what baloney all
this is, and which formed the core of Bruce's belated discovery
that nothing happened, was suppressed from those telegenic,
informative hearings that the American people remember so well and
so fondly.
</P>
<P>
   The mess resulted from an effort to open a casino at a failing
dog track in Hudson, Wis., as an off-reservation facility that
began seven years ago. It had regional Interior support, but none
in the White House, like all such casino efforts in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   After the casino was rejected by department civil servants in
mid-1995, the losers cried foul and pressed lawsuits and political
retribution just as other tribes that opposed the project had
lawyered up and got out their political checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   After 1996, and given disclosure of the Clinton-Gore campaign
and the Democratic Party's ugly ethical record in handling soft
money donations and granting access to donors, things got out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the department's rejection of the Native
American casino-dog track business venture became criminally
``suspect'' simply because the opponents made $300,000 in soft
money gifts to the Democrats. And Babbitt became a suspected
perjurer because of a testimonial conflict between the secretary
and an old friend from Arizona who had been hired by the proponents
to lobby his (now former) buddy.
</P>
<P>
   We now know, after all that junk, that the only evidence ever in
existence proved the casino rejection was handled routinely, and
without Babbitt's involvement in any way, much less with any
political pressure from the White House or DNC on the career
officials involved; there is and never was evidence of a quid pro
quo.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could have stopped all this, but under the unlamented
independant counsel law she insisted that a simple conflict between
two sworn witnesses (even a minor one) must trigger a criminal
investigation, even if it expanded (which it did) to the underlying
casino decision that she said didn't merit further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The result was 18 months, 400-plus witnesses, and 600,000-plus
pages of evidence, as well as defamation and legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The pols and press all had their fun. Now the drill here is to
say the system worked and justice was done.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't and it wasn't.
</P>

PLANT PANSIES IN COOL WEATHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: When do I plant pansies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Eager for cool-season blooms, we sometimes rush and plant
pansies when it's really too warm for these annuals. Although more
varieties are now being touted as ``heat-tolerant,'' I try to avoid
putting them out until Halloween or later. But it can be difficult
to resist those colorful faces _ and the faceless varieties _ at
the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   We did have a brief spell of cooler weather, and many of us
popped pansies into summer-weary beds. Recently, temperatures have
again hovered at the 90-degree mark. I returned home one day to
find newly planted pansies, a gift from a friend, sprawled in the
afternoon sun. At least nighttime temperatures have been lower, and
by early morning the plants had recovered, to my relief.
</P>
<P>
   These lower nighttime temperatures may be enough to keep plants
from stretching too tall. You know how leggy pansies can get in
warm weather. Not attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to pinch the top growth back only about half an inch to
spruce up leggy pansies. This will encourage side branching and
eventually more blooms, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who have not yet planted will find great
selections of pansies at area nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   The pansy plant is generally no more than 8 inches in height and
width, but flower sizes vary, and blooms generally are categorized
as large (3-4 inches), medium (2-3 inches) to multiflora (1-2
inches).
</P>
<P>
   The popular Majestic Giant series features large-flowered
pansies available in six colors and a mix, all with faces. This
1966 All-America Selections winner has a free-flowering habit.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies in the Crown series fall into the medium category and
are available in nine bright, clear colors. The Imperial series is
also in this size category and offers mostly faced flowers in blue,
pink and other colors. Imperial was a 1975 AAS winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the multiflora category, the Crystal Bowl series features
pansies in one clear color without a face. There are 11 colors.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 Maxim colors, including the 1991 AAS winner, `Maxim
Marina,' a light-blue pansy with a dark blue face outlined in
white. All Maxims are faced and fall into the multiflora category.
Universal is another series of multiflora pansies, clear or faced.
There are 13 colors, as well as a mix.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional series are Bingo and Baby Bingo. Bingo cultivars
produce 3 1/2-inch blooms in 14 colors, including some great shades
of blue and rose. The Baby Bingos, like the Bingos, are 8 inches in
height and 6-8 inches in width but produce 2- to 2 1/2-inch
flowers.

   Pansies are late-fall-to-spring bloomers in Houston-area gardens
and, given sun, a rich, well-draining soil and varied use, provide
gardeners a wealth of blooms. Planted en masse, the cool-season
annuals are a colorful ground cover. Large groups of one cultivar
are more effective in a landscape than a couple of this and one of
that. Pansies' compact habit makes them ideal as edging material
and container subjects, complementing taller-growing bulbs such as
tulips and daffodils, taller snapdragons or a collection of herbs.
Organically grown pansy blooms are edible, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am unable to keep tropical plants in bloom. They are on my
deck and get several hours of sun each day. I have learned that
bougainvilleas need to be kept thirsty to get them to bloom, but
even then the blooms have been sporadic. What do I fertilize the
plumeria with to increase blooms? The ginger has never bloomed.
What do I need to do? And what is causing the brown tips on the
ginger leaves?
</P>
<P>
   The nun's orchid is barely alive. I purchased it last spring, in
gorgeous bloom. In the fall, I divided the plant, and now they just
languish. There is little growth, and the leaf tips are brown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Many gardeners do maintain that bougainvilleas color best
after some moisture stress. Boost color by fertilizing monthly with
hibiscus food with a little Epsom salts. But remember,
bougainvilleas, like many plants, have bloom cycles. They are not
in constant color. And some color better at different times of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Plumerias must must reach a certain maturity and produce a
blooming hormone in their tips before flowering. This may take a
year or two if you purchase a rooted cutting. It may take up to
five years for a plumeria to bloom if you start with seed.
</P>
<P>
   Plumeria, or frangipani, does well in sunny areas, and this
tropical responds best to an organic-based, well-draining soil.
Frequent supplemental fertilizing is helpful, because plumerias are
heavy feeders. Plumerias like a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus
fertilizer that has a good amount of potash and trace elements,
particularly iron and magnesium. While plumerias need nitrogen for
good growth, too much will produce a lot of leafy growth at the
expense of flowers. There are fertilizers specially formulated for
plumerias.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you grow your plumerias in containers, mulch to minimize
loss of soil moisture and to keep soil temperatures down.
</P>
<P>
   This fall when the weather cools and you notice the leaves on
your plumeria beginning to yellow, move your plant to a warm spot
for winter. You can keep the plant in the pot, or remove the plant
from the pot and just store the leafless plant. You can wrap the
small root system in newspaper. That's all there is to it. No
fertilizing. No watering. When the weather warms in spring, repot
and return the plant to the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many gingers that will thrive in our gardens, and
they vary in light preferences and bloom times during warm months.
All will grow in filtered sunlight, but some (shell gingers)
tolerate more direct sun when established, while others (peacocks)
will burn in scorching summer sun. All like a well-draining,
organically enriched soil. All like a moist soil, although some are
surprisingly drought-tolerant once established, but none like
extremely wet soil. All dislike cold.
</P>
<P>
   The shell gingers (Alpinia zerumbet) will only flower on growth
that survives winter undamaged by cold weather. This year we had
many blooms from late spring into summer, since we had such a mild
winter. These plants like partial sun. I leave frost-damaged stalks
as long as I can stand looking at them, then remove at ground
level.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden gingers (Curcuma spp.) are spring or summer bloomers.
Spring bloomers produce flowers before or while the foliage is
first emerging; summer bloomers produce a central inflorescence
surrounded by the foliage midsummer to early fall. Spiral gingers
(Costus spp.) produce blooms that attract hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   The low-growing peacock gingers (Kaempferia spp.) produce flat,
iridescent summer flowers daily given a rich, moist, but
well-draining soil. Avoid harsh sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The butterfly gingers (Hedychium spp.) flower in summer and only
once per stalk, so you can remove that stalk at any time after
flowering. More stems will appear. The butterfly ginger's fragrance
is wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Given proper light, moisture and soil, gingers usually thrive
without much care. You can apply a slow-release fertilizer every
three months after growth begins in the spring or use an
all-purpose fertilizer monthly. Mulch, but do not fertilize in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The leaf you sent seems damaged by moisture stress. Try to keep
soil moisture even. Improper light could also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The nun's orchid, Phaius tankervilliae, is a terrestrial orchid
that naturalizes here, but I would mulch well when growing it
outdoors to ensure winter protection. A well-draining, organically
enriched soil is ideal. Some gardeners prefer to grow this plant in
a container. Divide before the plant becomes too crowded _ every
two or three years after flowering. Do not allow water to collect
in the crown to avoid any rotting. Perhaps your divisions had
less-than-ideal roots so have been slow to establish.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants _ of all kinds _ have barely hung on this summer, so
it's good that yours have at least shown some growth. A diluted
application of fertilizer, with water, may give them more energy.
The brown tips are likely a sign of water stress _ either too much
or too little. Avoid hot afternoon rays, too.
</P>
<P>
   Partial morning sun and bright shade in the afternoon is ideal.
This beautiful orchid, native to China, has lush, broad green
foliage and flower scapes up to 3 feet long in late winter-early
spring. The scapes bear numerous and fragrant silvery-white, 4-inch
flowers. The inside of each bloom is reddish-brown. A well-balanced
fertilizer is adequate.

THE NEW CULTURE OF FISTICUFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slam of a fist, the sudden snap of a head, the explosion of
sweat, and the smear of blood as two fighters square off. It's as
old as human history, a rite that incites the instinct even as it
appalls the intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Once mostly illegal here, professional fighting is in a period
of perplexing evolutionary renewal, both as sport and idea. Last
week in New York, in a development sure to elevate the growing
sport of women's boxing, Laila Ali, daughter of Muhammad Ali,
fought her first match, sending her opponent to the canvas before
the fight was a minute old.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Seattle hosted the United States' first
gender-blender boxing match, a spectacle that filled Mercer Arena
with women screaming ``Kill him, Margaret,'' as Margaret MacGregor
squared off against Loi Chow. (She won.)
</P>
<P>
   And in the new sport called ``ultimate fighting,'' a
few-holds-barred combination of boxing, wrestling, and martial
arts, two American men have died.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes ``Fight Club,'' a made-for-controversy movie about
disaffected young men who discover bare-knuckled brawling is a
life-affirming antidote to the ennui of consumer culture.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it seems, the further our official march toward
enlightenment proceeds, the more market there appears to be for the
most elemental of confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quite understand the psychology of it, but people
obviously like the idea of watching people fight,'' says Richard
Lapchick, director of Northeastern University's Center for the
Study of Sports in Society.
</P>
<P>
   No one quite does, though theories abound.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural critic and author Camille Paglia thinks the monotony of
daily life has left the public thirsting for ``gladiatorial''
entertainment that pushes the boundaries of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a middle-class office culture that is very
sterile, very banal, people are looking at computers, all the
physicality of life gone,'' Paglia theorizes. ``These cartoonish
sorts of confrontations are a way to engage physically, if only
vicariously.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, gladiatorial combat was boxing at its most
bloodthirsty. Then, the stakes were literally life and death, the
bloodlust as evident as the gore. When cestus-clad Romans performed
for their emperor, the object was to kill one's opponent, and kill
they did. One champion is said to have bludgeoned more than 1,400
opponents to death.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, American prizefighting was a brutal
bare-knuckle affair that took place in semi-secret locations, its
contestants subject to prosecution if discovered. Fights lasted
until a pugilist was knocked out or couldn't answer the bell.
</P>
<P>
   But if combat as sport has lost some of its savagery with the
adoption of gloves, fixed rounds, and stricter rules, it's never
truly been tamed. As a spectator sport, boxing has been transformed
from weekly occurrence to periodic mega-matches. Still, it remains
popular enough that 1.25 million people ordered the Sept. 18
welterweight championship bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix
Trinidad on pay-per-view, while almost 2 million bought the July
28, 1997, rematch between heavyweights Mike Tyson and Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more regulated boxing has become, the more people
seem to crave even more violent alternatives. Witness the
``ultimate fighting'' competitions that have cropped up in the last
half-decade, brawls arguably as brutal as boxing was in its
bareknuckle days.
</P>
<P>
   Those lightly regulated contests have blossomed in the Ukraine,
Japan, Brazil, England, and Canada _ and in several states, such as
Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia. These are matches
where it's well within the rules to throw a foe to the ground, then
send a flurry of fists to his face.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Douglas Dedge, 31, of Florida, died in Kiev after his
opponent sat on him and repeatedly slammed punches into his head.
In 1995, Eric Crow, 23, of Kansas City, hoping to win a little
extra money for Christmas gifts, instead died of brain damage after
taking repeated punches to the head in a ``Toughman'' contest in
that city.
</P>
<P>
   Now the notion of fisticuffs as elixir for alienated souls has
arrived on the silver screen in the form of ``Fight Club,'' the
dark, dystopic movie about alienated young men who band together to
batter one another in a search for a way to feel alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting hit in the face is one of the ways to be present in
the here and now,'' director David Fincher told London's Sunday
Times. ``When somebody hits you in the mouth and you get that first
rinse of salty something under your tongue, and you spit into your
hand to see what it is, you are truly alive in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd as that idea seems, the film, which opened Friday, seems
sure to fill the theaters, just the way the promise of a slugfest
between two hard-hitters of almost any weight class invariably
captures the American imagination.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not boxing skill we want so much as furious-fisted
combat. How else to explain the delirium when a fight crowd senses
one boxer is dazed and vulnerable, when the aggressor, in fight
parlance, ``moves in for the kill''? Or the derision heaped on De
La Hoya for sitting on what he believed was a lead in his bout with
Trinidad, and thus losing his share of the welterweight title to
the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as any honest fan can tell you, boxing's is an
atavistic appeal. To watch two fighters square off is to move from
the realm of the intellect to that of brutal basic instinct and
thus to surrender to something deep, raw, satisfying _ and
sadistic.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it's both sad and incongruous that the long journey
toward the notion that gender differences should be minimized in
modern society should count, as one of its results, the explosion
of women's boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women seem to be taking on some of the worst aspects of men,''
laments Al Cardarelli, professor of sociology at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, who says the renewed interest in a culture
of fisticuffs represents a reversal of the '60s and '70s interest
in creating a more peaceful social milieu.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the intellectualized idea of equality has opened a door
that gut instinct would prefer to keep closed; for many, there
remains something particularly disquieting about watching two women
beat each other bloody. State auditor Joseph DeNucci, a former Top
10-ranked middleweight, expresses that sense of distaste among the
sport's traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be sounding sexist, but I don't think it is right for
women to get banged and hurt and busted up,'' DeNucci says. ``I
think boxing is a man's sport.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Women are asserting their right to fight in
increasing numbers, and though men may respond with the same
concerned disapproval with which Muhammad Ali initially greeted his
daughter's decision to lace up the gloves, it's unlikely to make
any difference _ as he discovered,
</P>
<P>
   Yet as gloved combat becomes a sport for both sexes, it's
important to remember that boxing remains the Saturn of sports,
greedily devouring its own offspring.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it happens quickly, the way it did for welterweight
champion Benny Paret, who died after a savage pounding by Emile
Griffith in 1962, or for South Korean boxer Duk Koo Kim, who
suffered fatal brain damage in a lightweight title bout with Ray
``Boom Boom'' Mancini in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In ``On Boxing,'' Joyce Carol Oates writes that between 1945 and
1985, ``at least 370 boxers have died in the United States of
injuries directly related to boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   For many others, the toll has been the slower and more insidious
effects of pugilistic dementia, or punch-drunkenness, the condition
that reduced Jerry Quarry, the all-heart heavyweight who in his day
battled Ali and Joe Frazier, to a man-child unable to feed himself
or sign his name, before his death in January at 53. Or which has
rendered former heavyweight champ Floyd Patterson, 64, a sad figure
who often can't recall the hallmarks of his own life. Or even, some
days, the name of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Ali, the most gifted boxer in history, who visits the
most troubling doubts on fight fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get hit. I'm the fastest thing on two feet,'' the
brash young contender said as he prepared to fight Sonny Liston for
the heavyweight title in 1964. He was, and he hardly did. Not then,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But time waits for no fighter, and a decade later, Ali could no
longer dodge the blows. ``It was like death, the closest thing to
dying that I know of,'' he said after his epic 1975 ``thrilla' in
Manila'' with Frazier, a match many fans consider the best
prizefight ever.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, reflexes slowed, skills eroding, Ali,
training for a rematch with Leon Spinks, the rough fighter 11 years
his junior who had taken his championship, spoke the new truth.
``To win, all I need to do is suffer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Who could imagine how much he would suffer? Fight fans have
suffered with him as boxing-induced Parkinson's Syndrome has slowed
his gait and reduced his once famous voice, his quicksilver wit, to
little more than a slow whisper.
</P>
<P>
   For Ali, the fame, the glory, the accomplishment were worth the
loss of physical capacity, says Northeastern's Lapchick, a friend
who says he's heard the former champion say as much.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly America's fascination with all things fistic seems
ineradicable. And yet, if Ali was your childhood hero, if you
listened with your heart in your throat as the end-of-round radio
summaries made it seem as though George Foreman was destroying him
in their October 1974 bout; if you felt a near-religious rush of
joy when miraculous word came that somehow, some way, Ali had come
off the ropes to knock Foreman out in the eighth; if you willed
yourself to believe a 38-year-old Ali could come back to beat
30-year-old Larry Holmes in 1980, if you shook your head in
dejected disbelief when he couldn't answer the bell for the 11th
round; and if you've watched him survive the years since as a mind
imprisoned in a body that barely responds, perhaps you've wondered
if it was really worth it to you, whether you, as a fan, would do
it all over again.

PLANT PANSIES IN COOL WEATHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: When do I plant pansies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Eager for cool-season blooms, we sometimes rush and plant
pansies when it's really too warm for these annuals. Although more
varieties are now being touted as ``heat-tolerant,'' I try to avoid
putting them out until Halloween or later. But it can be difficult
to resist those colorful faces _ and the faceless varieties _ at
the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   We did have a brief spell of cooler weather, and many of us
popped pansies into summer-weary beds. Recently, temperatures have
again hovered at the 90-degree mark. I returned home one day to
find newly planted pansies, a gift from a friend, sprawled in the
afternoon sun. At least nighttime temperatures have been lower, and
by early morning the plants had recovered, to my relief.
</P>
<P>
   These lower nighttime temperatures may be enough to keep plants
from stretching too tall. You know how leggy pansies can get in
warm weather. Not attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to pinch the top growth back only about half an inch to
spruce up leggy pansies. This will encourage side branching and
eventually more blooms, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who have not yet planted will find great
selections of pansies at area nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   The pansy plant is generally no more than 8 inches in height and
width, but flower sizes vary, and blooms generally are categorized
as large (3-4 inches), medium (2-3 inches) to multiflora (1-2
inches).
</P>
<P>
   The popular Majestic Giant series features large-flowered
pansies available in six colors and a mix, all with faces. This
1966 All-America Selections winner has a free-flowering habit.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies in the Crown series fall into the medium category and
are available in nine bright, clear colors. The Imperial series is
also in this size category and offers mostly faced flowers in blue,
pink and other colors. Imperial was a 1975 AAS winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the multiflora category, the Crystal Bowl series features
pansies in one clear color without a face. There are 11 colors.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 Maxim colors, including the 1991 AAS winner, `Maxim
Marina,' a light-blue pansy with a dark blue face outlined in
white. All Maxims are faced and fall into the multiflora category.
Universal is another series of multiflora pansies, clear or faced.
There are 13 colors, as well as a mix.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional series are Bingo and Baby Bingo. Bingo cultivars
produce 3 1/2-inch blooms in 14 colors, including some great shades
of blue and rose. The Baby Bingos, like the Bingos, are 8 inches in
height and 6-8 inches in width but produce 2- to 2 1/2-inch
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies are late-fall-to-spring bloomers in Houston-area gardens
and, given sun, a rich, well-draining soil and varied use, provide
gardeners a wealth of blooms. Planted en masse, the cool-season
annuals are a colorful ground cover. Large groups of one cultivar
are more effective in a landscape than a couple of this and one of
that. Pansies' compact habit makes them ideal as edging material
and container subjects, complementing taller-growing bulbs such as
tulips and daffodils, taller snapdragons or a collection of herbs.
Organically grown pansy blooms are edible, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am unable to keep tropical plants in bloom. They are on my
deck and get several hours of sun each day. I have learned that
bougainvilleas need to be kept thirsty to get them to bloom, but
even then the blooms have been sporadic. What do I fertilize the
plumeria with to increase blooms? The ginger has never bloomed.
What do I need to do? And what is causing the brown tips on the
ginger leaves?
</P>
<P>
   The nun's orchid is barely alive. I purchased it last spring, in
gorgeous bloom. In the fall, I divided the plant, and now they just
languish. There is little growth, and the leaf tips are brown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Many gardeners do maintain that bougainvilleas color best
after some moisture stress. Boost color by fertilizing monthly with
hibiscus food with a little Epsom salts. But remember,
bougainvilleas, like many plants, have bloom cycles. They are not
in constant color. And some color better at different times of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Plumerias must must reach a certain maturity and produce a
blooming hormone in their tips before flowering. This may take a
year or two if you purchase a rooted cutting. It may take up to
five years for a plumeria to bloom if you start with seed.
</P>
<P>
   Plumeria, or frangipani, does well in sunny areas, and this
tropical responds best to an organic-based, well-draining soil.
Frequent supplemental fertilizing is helpful, because plumerias are
heavy feeders. Plumerias like a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus
fertilizer that has a good amount of potash and trace elements,
particularly iron and magnesium. While plumerias need nitrogen for
good growth, too much will produce a lot of leafy growth at the
expense of flowers. There are fertilizers specially formulated for
plumerias.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you grow your plumerias in containers, mulch to minimize
loss of soil moisture and to keep soil temperatures down.
</P>
<P>
   This fall when the weather cools and you notice the leaves on
your plumeria beginning to yellow, move your plant to a warm spot
for winter. You can keep the plant in the pot, or remove the plant
from the pot and just store the leafless plant. You can wrap the
small root system in newspaper. That's all there is to it. No
fertilizing. No watering. When the weather warms in spring, repot
and return the plant to the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many gingers that will thrive in our gardens, and
they vary in light preferences and bloom times during warm months.
All will grow in filtered sunlight, but some (shell gingers)
tolerate more direct sun when established, while others (peacocks)
will burn in scorching summer sun. All like a well-draining,
organically enriched soil. All like a moist soil, although some are
surprisingly drought-tolerant once established, but none like
extremely wet soil. All dislike cold.
</P>
<P>
   The shell gingers (Alpinia zerumbet) will only flower on growth
that survives winter undamaged by cold weather. This year we had
many blooms from late spring into summer, since we had such a mild
winter. These plants like partial sun. I leave frost-damaged stalks
as long as I can stand looking at them, then remove at ground
level.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden gingers (Curcuma spp.) are spring or summer bloomers.
Spring bloomers produce flowers before or while the foliage is
first emerging; summer bloomers produce a central inflorescence
surrounded by the foliage midsummer to early fall. Spiral gingers
(Costus spp.) produce blooms that attract hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   The low-growing peacock gingers (Kaempferia spp.) produce flat,
iridescent summer flowers daily given a rich, moist, but
well-draining soil. Avoid harsh sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The butterfly gingers (Hedychium spp.) flower in summer and only
once per stalk, so you can remove that stalk at any time after
flowering. More stems will appear. The butterfly ginger's fragrance
is wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Given proper light, moisture and soil, gingers usually thrive
without much care. You can apply a slow-release fertilizer every
three months after growth begins in the spring or use an
all-purpose fertilizer monthly. Mulch, but do not fertilize in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The leaf you sent seems damaged by moisture stress. Try to keep
soil moisture even. Improper light could also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The nun's orchid, Phaius tankervilliae, is a terrestrial orchid
that naturalizes here, but I would mulch well when growing it
outdoors to ensure winter protection. A well-draining, organically
enriched soil is ideal. Some gardeners prefer to grow this plant in
a container. Divide before the plant becomes too crowded _ every
two or three years after flowering. Do not allow water to collect
in the crown to avoid any rotting. Perhaps your divisions had
less-than-ideal roots so have been slow to establish.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants _ of all kinds _ have barely hung on this summer, so
it's good that yours have at least shown some growth. A diluted
application of fertilizer, with water, may give them more energy.
The brown tips are likely a sign of water stress _ either too much
or too little. Avoid hot afternoon rays, too.
</P>
<P>
   Partial morning sun and bright shade in the afternoon is ideal.
This beautiful orchid, native to China, has lush, broad green
foliage and flower scapes up to 3 feet long in late winter-early
spring. The scapes bear numerous and fragrant silvery-white, 4-inch
flowers. The inside of each bloom is reddish-brown. A well-balanced
fertilizer is adequate.

   BOSTON _ Evan Lee, an East Boston physician, will never forget
the malnourished, tuberculosis-ridden 15-year-old Somalian refugee
he helped save as a member of Doctors Without Borders, the
humanitarian group honored with the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rich, physician from Lynn, Mass., and another member of
the group, had such a moving experience treating patients whose
illnesses were aggravated by environmental conditions in Uzbekistan
that he is now studying public health at Harvard and hopes to go
abroad again.
</P>
<P>
   And David Kent, a Boston doctor and researcher, will always
remember his work in war-torn Bosnia, when ``the spirit of the
country was the lowest'' and ``people were really despairing
whether it would ever end.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of commitment by Lee, Rich, Kent, and the thousands of
other Doctors Without Borders volunteers from around the world _ to
go wherever war, famine, and other disasters strike _ prompted the
Nobel committee to recognize the group's ``pioneering humanitarian
work'' that rises above ``national boundaries and political
circumstances or sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, formally known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, was
founded in 1971 by French physicians who were frustrated at the
slow response and neutrality of traditional humanitarian
organizations toward refugee crises in developing countries. The
organization has provided a precedent for international
intervention in situations like Kosovo and East Timor in which
civilians are attacked by forces within their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee cited the group's rapid response and its
willingness to place blame as helping ``to form bodies of public
opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Orbinski of Doctors Without Borders used the prize as
an opportunity to remind the world of the horrors still going on
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As entire families are chased from their homes in East Timor
and as thousands more are targeted in conflicts around the world
that don't make the headlines, the Nobel Prize is an important
confirmation of the fundamental right of ordinary people to
humanitarian assistance and protection,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The group's volunteers, from doctors to nurses to engineers,
have served in 80 countries, ranging from Nicaragua to Vietnam,
Ethiopia to Kosovo, Rwanda to East Timor. Volunteers typically
serve several months at a time and work with local professionals in
their area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee, 39, an internist at East Boston Neighborhood Health
Center, knows firsthand the ravages of war, with his multiple
stints in Africa for Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   The patient he will never forget was a 15-year-old victim of
Somalia's civil war, whom he treated for malnutrition and
tuberculosis in a rudimentary field hospital in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a skeleton. She weighed 45 pounds. She literally
couldn't move. . . . I quite frankly didn't think she would make
it,'' recalled Lee, who was at the refugee camps in the early
1990s, and has also served in other parts of Africa in his two
years overseas.
</P>
<P>
   With medical treatment and the caring attention of her mother,
the girl pulled through, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This patient, this child who couldn't move, a month or two
later, she stood up. Things went very well from there. By the time
I left, she doubled her weight, and was a smiling, vivacious
15-year-old girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, 36, an assistant professor at New England Medical Center,
spent nearly six months in war-torn Bosnia in 1994, and was there
when the cease-fire was arranged and the Serbs withdrew their heavy
artillery from around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was far from recovered,'' he said. ``At least
there was some hope by the time I left.''
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, a Doctors Without Borders exhibit of artwork by
Bosnian and Croatian children opened at Codman Square Health Center
in Boston two days ago. The exhibit runs through Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, 37, an internist at Lynn Community Health Center, came
away from his experience in Uzbekistan with a deep sense of
commitment to the group's mission.
</P>
<P>
   The group ``really has its heart in the right place,'' Rich
said. ``It really wants to help populations that are neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first physician organization with links to
Massachusetts that has received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1985, the
award went to the International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War, cofounded by Dr. Bernard Lown of Massachusetts and Dr.
Yevgeny Chazov of the Soviet Union.

A SELF-SERVING GOP VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Senate Republicans stuck their heads in the sand last week
and rejected the global nuclear test ban treaty, they may have put
more than just themselves at risk.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton and Democratic senators warned, the GOPs
self-serving vote _ in which only four Republicans joined Democrats
in voting for ratification _ makes the United States and other
nations more vulnerable than ever to nuclear terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-led rejection was primarily aimed at embarrassing
President Clinton, who made the test ban treaty a major goal of his
administration. Most media reports called the vote a ``major
defeat'' for the president. That's just how the GOP hoped the vote
would be portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the Republican-led vote is a resounding defeat
of a long, arduous effort of both Democratic and Republican
presidents to bring an end to the nuclear arms race and make the
world a safer place. Nations engaging in a nuclear arms race, such
as India and Pakistan, can now continue its testing and implicit
threats to each other, without any justifiable moral admonition
from the United States. Other nations can also use the Senate
rejection as an excuse to escalate their own nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Senate Republicans may have jeopardized the security
of the United States just to enhance their own political security.
But in the end, the GOP may have made itself more vulnerable _ to a
Democratic takeover of the House and Senate in the 2000 election.
The GOP's rejection of the test ban may, on its own, not be enough
to oust the GOP leadership. But consider it along with the other
GOP actions over the past few years that were primarily aimed at
embarrassing, if not destroying, President Clinton and his
administration. It could prove to be the proverbial last straw that
finally breaks the GOP's already shaky grip it has on the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other Democrats have vowed to make the GOP's
rejection of the test ban treaty a campaign issue in the 2000
election. Apparently, so have the Republicans, who are betting that
voters will give them credit for US on top as the world's leading
nuclear power. The test ban, some GOP members argue, would have
weakened the nation's nuclear dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a presidential contender, said if he is
elected, he would re-submit the test ban treaty for US
ratification. Texas Gov. George W. Bush and other Republican
hopefuls such as Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John McCain oppose the
treaty, signaling that the ban may become a definitive issues in
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, voicing the GOP's view,
labeled the treaty deeply flawed; he called in unverifiable, and
said it would harm US efforts to maintain the strength and
reliability of its nuclear arsenal. But that argument flies in the
face of the United States' self-imposed moratorium on nuclear
testing, which was done primarily to maintain and improve its
nuclear strength. This moratorium has not met with Republican
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the test ban treaty would have allowed the United
States to retain its supremacy in nuclear weapons, as it is now
doing under its own nuclear moratorium _ a fact that Sen Patty
Murray, a Democrat from Washington, pointed out during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   If the treaty is ratified by all 44 nuclear powers, the treaty
would have stopped all nuclear tests, established 300 monitoring
stations and, as supporters argued, maintained US nuclear
superiority. Thus far, the treaty was signed by 154 nations,
including the US, but has been ratified by only 51 nations. Had the
United States ratified the treaty, other nations likely would have
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   China, for example, which had signed but not ratified the
treaty, expressed, through its foreign ministry, ``profound
regret'' over the rejection, adding that the United States ``has
great influence in bringing the treaty into effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese foreign ministry said of the rejection that the
``adverse effects are inestimable, and it is of extreme concern.''
It said it had hoped for the US's leadership in nuclear disarmament
and stopping nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foriegn ministry said the rejection ``deals a
serious blow to the whole system of agreements in the field of
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   And US allies such as France and the European Union expressed
``disappointment'' in the Senate rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the right side of this issue, said he would continue
to work ``to strengthen the worldwide consensus in favor of the
treaty'' while continuing to observe the moratorium on nuclear
testing that has been in effect for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not nearly as good as ratifying the treaty _
something that the GOP has been angling to avoid for quite some
time. Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, had reportedly kept the treaty bottled up in his
committee for two years before suddenly bringing it before the
committee a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and other conservative Republicans apparently knew that
they had enough votes to reject the treaty and strategized to give
Clinton and other Democrats little opportunity to lobby lawmakers,
and the public, for support of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Republicans strategy apparently worked, to the
detriment of US leadership and world peace.

A YEAR-ROUND, DO-NOTHING LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the Massachusetts Legislature passes a budget for
fiscal year 2000, fiscal year 2000 _ which began on July 1 _ will
be one-third over. The governor submitted a budget proposal in
January; that gave the House and Senate more than six months to
finalize a spending bill before the old year ran out. In the real
world, people get fired for blowing off important deadlines and
letting crucial assignments go undone. In the State House, they
don't even get embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   And they certainly don't get worried. The Legislature's 200
senators and representatives know that they have absolutely nothing
to fear. Their paychecks aren't going to be docked. They aren't
going to lose their expenses and per diems. Their ``leadership''
bonuses aren't going to be withheld. Most of them aren't even going
to be challenged when they run for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Pay your taxes four months late, and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts will smack you with penalties, interest, and some
pretty dire threats. Ignore the deadlines set by your mortgage
company, and your credit rating will go down the drain. But if you
sit in the Massachusetts General Court and the budget is 102 days
overdue, nothing in the least will befall you.
</P>
<P>
   In 49 states of the union, fiscal 2000 budgets have been signed
and sealed. Only in Massachusetts is the Legislature incapable of
doing its most significant job. For months Thomas Finneran and
Thomas Birmingham _ the House speaker and Senate president _ put on
a show of meeting daily on a State House balcony to reconcile the
differences between the bloated budget passed by the Senate and the
bloated budget passed by the House. And in the end they reconciled
nothing. They simply agreed to include everything.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy One wanted another pile of money for education ``reform;''
he got it. Tommy Two wanted a new way of financing the MBTA; he got
it. A new trust fund to hoard the state's share of the tobacco
settlement? That's in there. A slush fund to reward schools whose
students flunk the MCAS? That's in there, too. About the only thing
that's not in there is meaningful tax relief. The two Tommys agreed
to slo-o-owly lower the state income tax rate by a whopping
two-tenths of 1 percent. Such munificence! When fully phased in,
this tax cut will save a typical family of four less than $5 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   This, Finneran has the effrontery to declare, ``was worth the
wait.'' And the farce isn't over yet. A final budget still hasn't
been reduced to writing or voted on by the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Finneran and Birmingham have accomplished one thing. They
have made it clear beyond cavil that no one in the Legislature,
save the two of them, has the slightest influence or authority over
anything state government does. While the House speaker and the
Senate president were performing their balcony act, the other 39
senators and 159 representatives sat around doing nothing. The
dirty little secret of the Massachusetts Legislature is that two
men make every decision. Everyone else is for show, extras to
impress the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a show that never closes. In the great majority of
states, legislatures convene for only a few months out of the year
_ in some states, for only a few months every other year. In only a
very few states, Massachusetts prominent among them, does the
legislature stay in session year-round. And what do we get from our
full-time solons? One of the highest tax burdens in the United
States, budgets that grow more obese by the year, a contemptuous
disrespect for grassroots reformers, and a reelection-at-all-costs
mindset that has made it all but impossible to defeat an incumbent
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 25 states, lawmakers sit for no more than 90 days a
year. In those states, most of them better governed than this one,
budget negotiations don't drag on for months without end.
Legislators don't succumb to the delusion that their presence is
required year-round. They convene, debate, vote, and go home. It
might astonish Beacon Hill to know that in those states, the sun
continues to rise in the East and set in the West even after the
legislature has adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken longer to agree on a spending document for the
coming fiscal year than it took the delegates to the Philadelphia
convention in 1787 to draft the US Constitution. The message sent
by Finneran and Birmingham is not that the budget is so important
to them that they are taking pains to get it exactly right, but
that it is so unimportant that they couldn't be bothered to get it
done on time.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sphere, failure to perform comes with a price. If
it came with a price in the legislative sphere _ if, for example,
each member of the General Court were fined $50 for every day a
budget was delayed _ budgets would never be delayed. But the House
and Senate _ which is to say, the House speaker and Senate
president _ will never consent to live by the same standards we
mortals must adhere to. They will continue in their arrogance. And
we will go on thinking them incompetent.

   BOSTON _ In the rooftop restaurant on the 17th floor of the
Ritz-Carlton hotel, they danced to music popular half a century ago
with stars in their eyes and a spring in their step, proving, once
again, that love is ageless.
</P>
<P>
   For the 20th year, the city's Commission on Affairs of the
Elderly brought together 60 couples married 50 years or more to
celebrate the longevity of their unions.
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse, in sickness and in health, through
World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II, they stuck
together and made their marriages work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of the men I see out there in the audience,''
Mayor Thomas M. Menino joked Friday in giving the toast, ``and I
have to say, their wives must be saints.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the couples interviewed said that it was love, simple
love, that kept them together _ that and being adept at the fine
art of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   This year's longest married couple _ at 71 years _ was Joseph
and Edith Arena of East Boston, 89 and 88, respectively. They were
married at St. Bridget's Church in Maynard, Mass. _ where Edith is
from _ on Sept. 2, 1928, when she was 17 and Joe, from Boston's
North End section, was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they have two daughters, seven grandchildren, and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to a successful marriage, Edith said, is in ``taking
care of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe said the secret was ``to agree on everything'' and agreed
with Edith, adding, ``especially on finances.'' He recalled that
before he became a labor union organizer at local racetracks, he
sold vegetables from pushcarts in Haymarket and was worth ``exactly
$2.59 cents the day we were married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to respect each other's point of view and
compromise,'' Joe said, ``and never go to bed mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one key to the durability of the marriages of all the
couples at the Ritz was that their definition of love was similar:
Taking care of each other. Most said their love is stronger today
than it was on the day they were wed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never argue, go to bed mad, or fight over money,'' said Robert
Pigott, 71, a retired mail handler, who has been married to
Margaret, 72, for 51 years. They have three children and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words, `I'm the boss,' should never be said in a
marriage,'' said William Janey, 82, of Boston, a retired lieutenant
colonel in the National Guard. ``When the kids come along they have
to pitch in with the chores and we all sit down to dinner at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Janey and wife, Hortense, 78, who worked as a teacher's aide,
have been married 57 years. They raised three boys and two girls.
They met at the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston's Roxbury section,
which they still attend, and say going to church, no matter which
one, is important to keeping a marriage intact. ``When things go
wrong, it's good to sit down to talk to God,'' Janey said.
</P>
<P>
   Big families also make for lasting marriages, said Martin and
Catherine O'Brien of Boston's Charlestown neighborhood, who have
been married 51 years. The O'Briens, 74 and 71, have 10 children,
21 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. ``We help one
another and stay very close,'' said Martin, a Boston firefighter
for 33 years before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine says today's high divorce rate stems from ``kids
having had everything and expecting a lot in marriage. They can't
handle problems.'' She recalled that when Martin was a fireman in
1948, his salary was $51 a week. ``We didn't have health
insurance,'' she said, ``until I had our seventh child.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Betty Kelly of Charlestown, who have six children and
13 grandchildren, said a sense of humor helps during 50 years of
marriage. ``Why did our marriage last?'' chuckled John Kelly, 73.
``She worked nights (in the office of the old Jordan Marsh), and I
worked days (as a construction inspector).''
</P>
<P>
   In one touching moment, though, John looked into his wife's eyes
and said, ``I truly love her.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also what Sal Ciacchella, 92, of the Roslindale area said
of Josephine, 89, his wife of 60 years. ``She is a truly wonderful
woman.'' They are parents of twin daughters. For 53 years, Joe
owned a grocery store in Newton. Josephine worked as a seamstress.
He met her when he went to date her sister. She played the piano
then and he sang. They still do.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton's manager, Henri Boubee, honored the couple by
providing free meals and a free room.
</P>
<P>
   As Enrico and Ida Gambale of Roslindale, parents of two, danced
to Glenn Miller tunes played by the John Rampino Band, they said
their 50 years of marriage have been one long dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman has to give 90 percent,'' said a happy Ida, 70, a
cosmetologist, as Enrico, 84, looked on with a smile. They met, she
said, when Enrico was her girlfriend's butcher. ``He asked me for a
date and we went on the trolley car to go swimming. To me, he is
forever romantic. I tell him he has bedroom eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Robinson, 81, a retired leather worker from Boston who
with Dorothy, his wife of 59 years, had one child, made the most
succinct observation about marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the song, `Sunrise, Sunset,' from `Fiddler on the
Roof?' '' he asked. ``Well, marriage is like that. One day
following another.''

BRINGING OUT THE REAL MARTIN JOHNSON HEADE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1996 a lush little painting of magnolias by Martin
Johnson Heade turned up at an estate sale in Tucson, where it sold
for under $100. The other day, a dealer turned up at the Museum of
Fine Arts to ask curator Theodore Stebbins Jr. and conservator Jim
Wright to authenticate another Heade magnolia. They did. The dealer
turned around and sold it to a private collector in New York for $2
million, a price Stebbins believes is a record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Stebbins is your expert if Heade is your painter. The curator
organized the very first Heade show, at the MFA in 1969, as well as
the current quite ravishing one at the museum _ which is only the
third Heade solo show in history, Stebbins says. The one that came
between his two was a 1980s exhibition of the artist's thunderstorm
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Heade is the hummingbird and orchid painter, the 19th-century
adventurer who made three journeys to Latin America in search of
his subjects, who painted them in front of jungles so humid-looking
they make you want to mop your brow. He started as portraitist and
branched into landscape, but it's as depicter of the sexiest
flowers this side of Mapplethorpe that he's known to the public.
The Boston public knows him better than any other, thanks to the
three dozen Heades given to the MFA by the visionary patron and
American art champion Maxim Karolik, starting in 1945. It's the
largest public collection of Heades, rivaled only by the private
holdings of Detroit collector Richard Manoogian.
</P>
<P>
   The Karolik Heades lived in MFA basement storage before
Stebbins's first show. Not highly regarded by the art-world
establishment of his day, Heade, who lived from 1819 to 1904, was
selling works for $200 when his &UR;  &LR; Hudson River contemporary
Frederick Edwin Church was getting $10,000 for major canvases.
After his death, Heade was almost completely forgotten until 1943,
when a couple of art dealers stumbled on his ``Thunder Storm on
Narragansett Bay'' in a Larchmont, N.Y., antique store.
</P>
<P>
   That find led to Heade's inclusion in a Museum of Modern Art
show called ``Romantic Painting in America'' the same year. His
name began circulating among astute collectors and curators, but he
never achieved the acclaim of his Hudson River counterparts, whose
grandiose landscapes have little in common with Heade's more
intimate and intense ones, although he's sometimes lumped under the
Hudson River heading. He's also called a Luminist by those who see
a kinship between his still seascapes and those of Fitz Hugh Lane,
another painter forgotten and then sensationally rediscovered.
Stebbins says it's pointless trying to fit Heade into any category.
He was an eccentric both professionally and personally. His sheer
weirdness is in large part why he's treasured today _ that, and the
sheer exquisiteness of his painting once he hit his stride.
</P>
<P>
   Which took a while. ``Heade spent 20 years as a bad painter,''
says Stebbins, who has edited those early years out of his new
73-painting show, which is not a full-fledged retrospective. Born
to a farming family in Bucks County, Pa., Heade learned to paint
from his neighbor, the folk artist Edward Hicks. Heade's early
portraits have the stiff, flat, formulaic look of Hicks's
``Peaceable Kingdoms.'' Traveling extensively in America and Europe
in the 1840s and '50s, Heade may have seen the Dutch and Flemish
still lifes that some of his later canvases resemble. Despite the
exposure, Heade remained a hack _ until his 1858 move to the same
New York City building where Church and the other Hudson River
painters had their studios.
</P>
<P>
   In that milieu, he switched to landscape and still life,
developing highly idiosyncratic styles in both. While Church and
Bierstadt were churning out Wagnerian views where mountain ranges
resemble the EKGs of a patient with a wildly irregular heartbeat,
Heade was painting horizon lines as flat as those in Dutch
painting.
</P>
<P>
   Myriad marshes
</P>
<P>
   Salt marshes punctuated by haystacks were his favorite subject.
He painted the marshes of Newburyport, Mass., and North Shore
locations during his frequent forays into New England, and was even
more loyal to these mundane views than to hummingbirds. There are
over 150 marsh scenes _ at last count. Heades are constantly being
unearthed. Stebbins's 1975 monograph on the artist identified 381
paintings by his hand; in the hefty expansion of that tome that
Yale publishes this year, there are 619, with four more discovered
after the book went to press. And as more were discovered, ``we
kept asking if it was too late to squeeze just one more into the
book,'' Stebbins says.
</P>
<P>
   An entire room in the MFA show is ringed with Heade haystacks;
no one, not even Stebbins, has seen them lined up together before.
Stebbins presents Heade as a series painter, even a Monet
forerunner, and offers Heade paintings of haystacks at different
times of day and under varying climactic conditions. Some seem
factual; others, ultra-romantic. Heade packs extremes of light and
shade, wet and dry, into ``Sudden Shower, Newbury Marshes'': He was
brilliant in conveying the passage of time through passing weather,
here through a veil of gray rain falling over a background still
sunlit. Fog and mist enshroud ``The Great Swamp,'' where a farmer
pilots a dinghy through the water to check on whether his haystacks
had gone adrift. The stacks have a mystical presence, like the
post-and-lintel markers at Stonehenge. They're enigmatic
collaborations between man and nature, standing sentry in territory
neither wilderness nor farmland, luring the eye back in space on a
meandering path.
</P>
<P>
   The Heade show is laid out thematically, to characterize him as
a serial, even conceptual, artist. It opens with 16 of the 45 known
``Gems of Brazil,'' a grand, failed project that began with Heade's
journeys south. Only one species of hummingbird lives in eastern
North America. Heade, long obsessed with the little creatures, went
to South America in search of others, which he intended to paint
and publish in a book of chromolithographs. But chromolithography
couldn't replicate the delicate colors of the paintings, and the
project fizzled.

   PLAINSONG &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Kent Haruf. Knopf. 301 pp. $24. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the great nourishments of living close to the earth is
that you get to see time in motion. It bends and sways according to
wheat and dawn and universal law, not man-made schedules, and its
rhythms are as synchronized as a heart beating underneath a rising
moon. The meter of Kent Haruf's quiet novel possesses this same
sense of calm and certainty, so that the story it tells feels as
unadorned and appropriate as muslin in church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainsong'' (a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award)
covers a couple of seasons in the small town of Holt, Colo., on the
high plains east of Denver. Steeped in the taciturn codes and
traditions of the rural West, the novel gives little hint of its
actual time period _ only someone's offhand reference to Nancy
Reagan tells us the setting is roughly contemporary. Not that it
matters: The modern age hasn't really had much impact on Holt,
except for an occasional upgrading of farm equipment and a bus
station that will try to get you there on time.
</P>
<P>
   With its title taken from the vocal melodies of early Christian
music, ``Plainsong'' delivers the stories of several interlocking
lives, their daily dramas played out in relation to and in spite of
one another. The first of these belongs to Tom Guthrie, a tall,
soft-spoken schoolteacher with two young sons whose wife is
somewhere between clinically depressed and just plain miserable.
Ike and Bobby, who are 10 and 9, cope with their mother's bedridden
ennui and her eventual departure by using the age-old tools of
children: They worry to themselves; they buy her perfume at the
drugstore; they get into minor trouble and couldn't really tell you
why. Guthrie, for his part, is equally laconic: Love is not
something talked about much in ``Plainsong,'' and yet you can feel
the depth and emotionality of these characters by the blessed way
they don't often say what they need to.
</P>
<P>
   That particularly holds true for the show-stealers of the novel,
two crotchety old brothers who've lived together out south of town
since time began. We first meet Raymond and Harold McPheron when
Guthrie and his boys go out to help them vaccinate their cattle and
check to see which of their herd will be calving in the spring.
This is Haruf at his best: He knows how to describe a working
spread with dignity and precision, rather than romance or
sentimentality, so that you can feel the intensity of a rancher's
no-nonsense life with metal-cold realism.
</P>
<P>
   The McPheron brothers circled their wagons after their parents
were killed in a truck accident when the boys were teenagers. Since
then they've had little trouble in their lives, or at least not the
right kind of it, as good-hearted Maggie Jones tells them. A
colleague of Guthrie at the local high school, Jones has taken in a
girl named Victoria Roubideaux; locked out of her house by her
mother, Victoria is frightened, alone, and pregnant. Approached by
Jones, who knows them to be the finest of men, the McPherons bring
Victoria into their home; they have to move old boots and machinery
off the kitchen chairs to make room for her, but soon they're
teaching her the finer points of farm reports and cattle markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainsong'' is a sweet novel. Not cloying, but kind and
gracious, and enamored with the simplicity of a story based on
human decency. There's a bad kid in the story just to provide a bit
of agon, a big, scary thug who threatens Guthrie and terrorizes his
boys. And there's sadness aplenty: This is the West, after all,
where animals teach humans how to die simply by possessing shorter
life spans, and where a calf breach can give you plenty of
instruction about the perils of labor. But mostly there is goodness
in ``Plainsong,'' whether in the dear old Mrs. Stearns who
befriends Guthrie's sons or in the mere absence of evil's
complexities. Some of this tone is achieved by the stripped-down
equanimity of Haruf's style, which for the most part conveys
precisely what you need to know. When Guthrie goes to visit his
estranged wife, worried about her decline, we understand that she's
turned it around just by this description of Guthrie's initial
impression: ``She had lost weight since he'd last seen her, but it
didn't appear that she would lose any more.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an atmospheric mood difficult to sustain, and
occasionally Haruf staggers in two equally dire directions: One is
in sounding like bad Cormac McCarthy in his opening pages (high
drama and no punctuation); the other is the unfortunate choice of
the comedic verb form to ``sally forth,'' which Richard Russo has
already overused terribly and which ought to be put out of its
misery. ``Plainsong'' is neither McCarthy nor Russo, and is better
off staying away from either; instead, it is a simple field planted
with one rather unexciting crop, which is the staff of life. That
is the silent asset of this novel, which in its most resonant
moments is as understated and true-blue as Raymond McPheron
himself. When Victoria begins to worry that she may have endangered
the baby she's carrying, Raymond rushes (well, ambles) to console
her. ``I knew of this heifer we had one time that was carrying a
calf,'' he tells the girl, ``and she got a length of fencewire down
her some way and it never hurt her or the calf.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be one of the nicest stories Raymond ever told anybody,
and you can tell it took hold by the fact that Victoria's eyes tear
over with gratitude. It's one of the ways people say they love you
out in Holt, and ``Plainsong'' shows that somebody must have been
listening back.

   NEW RELEASES: ``Election'' _ Alexander Payne's dark comedy,
using high school life as a marvelous metaphor for American
politics, is one of the year's best films. Matthew Broderick, Reese
Witherspoon, and Chris Klein head the outstanding cast. Despite
terrific reviews, it had a lukewarm reception at the box office.

   ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl'' _ Actress Joan Chen gets behind
the camera for this beautifully shot, compellingly acted tale of a
young girl growing up during China's Cultural Revolution. It's
subtle, affectionate, thoughtful, and tough. In Mandarin with
English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frogs for Snakes'' _ Despite a solid cast, headed by Barbara
Hershey as an actress-turned-mobster, this is a pretentious, tired,
inside-showbiz yawner.

the movies. Too bad Emerson College grad Jeff Arch wasn't asked to
contribute. He came up with the original story and screenplay. The
discussions about building up Tom Hanks's character are

RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN GROWS UP TO HEAD VON TRAPP CLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ Richard Chamberlain is bemused, perhaps amused.
</P>
<P>
   He's been asked to find the connecting thread in his diverse
acting experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Start with ``Dr. Kildare,'' take it through ``Shogun'' and ``The
Thorn Birds'' and Hollywood farragos like ``The Towering Inferno''
and ``The Swarm'' and features like ``Petulia'' and ``The Madwoman
of Chaillot.'' Connect those to the interludes in England and some
stage and television performances of ``Hamlet'' and touring with
``My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, well, what about his most recent creepy role,
torturing an emaciated Lauren Bacall to a lingering death in the TV
movie ``Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke''?
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, 64, trim, fit and radiating energy in a sport shirt
and slacks, sits in a chair in a hotel room and takes a thoughtful
swig from his bottled water. He doesn't answer the question, not
directly. But for most of an hour he reviews that crazy variety of
work in Hollywood and in recent independent films. And his roles on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   He also traces his development from ``leading boy'' to leading
man and then character actor, and he describes what it's like
living in Hawaii and touring in ``The Sound of Music,'' which
arrives at Boston's Colonial Theatre Monday and plays there through
Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   He begins by talking about the actor's feel for a role. ``Never
underestimate the actor's instincts,'' he says. ``The actor can be
closer than the writer is to a character.'' He cites Gary Cooper as
an example of someone who ``conveyed extraordinary things about his
character without saying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to go with his instincts in ``Doris Duke,'' he says.
``I could have been creepier. I wanted to play my character with a
ponytail and an Irish accent. The network vetoed it. Some of my
friends didn't like me in it, either. They said, `Richard, you
weren't very nice.' They like you more as a leading man than a
character actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's hotel room is just a stone's throw from the Yale
campus, and it's mid-afternoon of a warm, sunny New England fall
day. But in a few hours, he'll be on a stage set walking through
the doors of his manse high on an Austrian mountaintop to the warm,
friendly applause of a large family audience at the SNET Oakdale
Theatre in nearby Wallingford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find acting rather difficult,'' he says. ``I'm hopelessly
shy and inhibited. When what you're doing is working for you, it
feels great. But it can be difficult before you find out what it is
you want or have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one years ago, a Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein musical called
``The Sound of Music'' was going into rehearsals a few blocks away,
readying for a run in this tryout city before its scheduled opening
in New York. Does it need saying that the rest is history, that
jaded professionals call the durable musical ``The Sound of
Money''? And now, here's Chamberlain, an actor with his rather full
resume, playing Captain Georg von Trapp, the lonely widower/father
of seven children, in a touring production once again telling the
story of Austria's real-life von Trapp family, who fled their
native country in 1938 to escape Nazi repression.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's von Trapp isn't the familiar martinet played by
Christopher Plummer in the 1965 movie. In fact, Chamberlain's is
closer to the more avuncular father figure that Raymond Massey
played to Chamberlain's Dr. James Kildare in the popular NBC
medical drama series that had a five-year run, from 1961 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Chamberlain's ``Dr. Kildare'' was something of a
watershed for the actor. It established his credentials as what he
calls a ``leading boy,'' who evolved into a leading man in some of
television's biggest miniseries, ``Shogun'' and ``The Thorn Birds''
among them. Here's his description of what it takes to be a leading
man: ``Tall, good-looking, a straight shooter, honest, good,
forthright, reliable, upright _ and seldom funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was the leading man in ``Shogun'' and ``The Thorn
Birds,'' he ``had to stand in line'' for both roles. He says
director Peter Weir ``had an eye on Robert Redford'' for ``Thorn
Birds.'' And author James Clavell wanted Sean Connery, a Scottish
actor, for ``Shogun.'' He adds: ``But I was patient. I talked with
Clavell for a couple of days and convinced him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's success as Dr. Kildare also prompted some advice
from British actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke at a lunch at Raymond
Massey's house. ``You're a star,'' Hardwicke told him. ``Now you
have to get your basic training'' as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   So when ``Kildare'' ran its course, Chamberlain essayed summer
stock, hoping he could develope his stage acting technique. It
didn't work: Summer theater was too helter-skelter. So he decided
to try his luck in England with British repertory theaters and a
mix of feature and television work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped off the plane in London and into a job. A director,
James Cellan Jones, thought I might be right for the role of Ralph
Touchet in the six-part BBC-TV serial adaptation of Henry James's
`Portrait of a Lady.' And I kept working after that. Julie
(Christie) and (director) Richard (Lester) wanted me for `Petulia.'
I never got (around to) drama school.'' England provided his escape
from what he calls ``the gravitational pull of the force of
`Kildare' which had made me a `friend in the living room' for five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain went to England for a different milieu. He contrasts
the English theater to Hollywood this way: ``In Hollywood there's
this driving fear that if you're not hot, you might as well be
dead. If you're not going to parties, you might as well be dead.
Actors in England have a different value system. The quality of the
work counts.''
</P>
<P>
   As he moved further away from leading man into character roles,
Chamberlain found acting more interesting. He also developed an
interest in working in independent films where he could be/play
anything he wanted. He could cut loose, open up. He says his most
recent effort in this vein is ``definitely'' his ``best work
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I play an extraordinary character in an independent film we
made in North Carolina called `The Pavilion.' It's adapted from a
Robert Louis Stevenson short story about a banker-swindler-slave
trader. He's living on an island with his daughter whom he may or
may not have slept with.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was noted that this seemed like a surfeit of character
traits, Chamberlain said: ``The more the merrier with me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not working, Chamberlain lives in the Hawaiian
islands. ``Nothing happens there,'' he says. ``I love to play. I'm
good at not working. I can go for long stretches doing it. But then
I get the itch to work. When I was approached by the producer for
`Sound of Music,' I said why not? I've paid my dues. And it's
turned out to be fun being on the road (it's a 40-week tour). It's
like a kids' adventure. The company's all in the same hotel, all
going out and eating together. It's very self-contained. There's
nobody else to go out with.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his role is ``a more interesting part'' than expected.
``I didn't expect this to be the real ensemble it turned out to be.
It's a quality show with a lot of strengths.'' Asked how he feels
about his singing, he responds, ``It's better if you can sing. I
sing pretty well, even though air conditioning sometimes gets me.
I'm a bass-baritone with a low range. I took singing lessons. I've
recorded songs and I did do `My Fair Lady.' I thought `Sound of
Music' would be easier. I thought I'd have time between
performances to do some of my own things, learn Italian and learn
how to use a computer. It turns out to be a big part, even though
not as exhausting as `My Fair Lady.' I do eight shows a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain differentiates television movies, miniseries, and
feature films this way: ``You shoot five pages a day for a
television movie, nine or 10 for a miniseries, and one or two for a
feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a puppet of the director in film acting. He's the boss.
It's extraordinarily mechanical. Everything is dictated by what
scene you're doing. The whole idea is to `beat the machine.' But
it's so exciting once you get the knack. You have to keep your
energy near perfect pitch so that when they say `OK, let's do it,'
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In television, there's an unspoken atmosphere of mediocrity.
The rationale is `we can get by with this.' You work five to six
weeks and you stamp it out. And you get by. It's an oppressive
atmosphere.''
</P>

FINALLY, THE SCANDAL-MONGERS ARE OFF BABBITT'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In all fairness, Carol Elder Bruce bent over
backwards to be thorough and do the right thing by a scandalously
wronged man, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt _ for which she
deserves no credit whatsover.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason (protecting the rear end comes to mind), the
peculiar patois of prosecutors (and especially special prosecutors)
requires that no one ever be let off the hook, including those who
have never really been on it.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is supposed to be par for the course that after an
18-month independent counsel investigation into what may have been
the driest hole in history, Last-Name Bruce can say with defamatory
tentativeness that that the fruits of her labor ``would not support
a finding'' that First-Name Bruce committed perjury or any other
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that her fruits left the record exactly where it
was when politicians and the press began taking supposition and
insinuation to new depths after the 1996 election: blank, empty,
clean, unblemished. Nothing ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what you'd expect regarding someone with a
lifelong and deserved reputation for the highest probity and
integrity as a state attorney general and governor in his native
Arizona, a delightful-in-failure presidential candidate and a
secretary of the interior who in conservation history will belong
with Gifford Pinchot and Stewart Udall in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But this insult to justice occurred nevertheless, with all the
attendant blood shed in the Congress, the press, and then grand
jury rooms, simply because of the frightening ability of the Great
American Scandal Machine to suggest that something might have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   If you went anywhere near political news in the year following
the election, you know about Native American casino cash and
lobyists blocking other Native Americans hunting casino permits in
some remote part of Wisconsin, about White House middlemen,
Interior Department complicity and Babbitt somehow in the
crosshairs of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Fred Thompson's special committee made mountains out of
this molehill, feeding mammouth press interest, prompting de
rigueur calls for an independant counsel from politicians that
Attorney General Janet Reno (who is always damned when she does and
damned when she doesn't) proved unable to resist because of an
astonishing defect in her legal mind that rewards uncorroborated
accusations no matter how implausible.
</P>
<P>
   And Senator Thompson's special committee also made sure that the
evidence _ in person and documentary _ showing what baloney all
this is, and which formed the core of Bruce's belated discovery
that nothing happened, was suppressed from those telegenic,
informative hearings that the American people remember so well and
so fondly.
</P>
<P>
   The mess resulted from an effort to open a casino at a failing
dog track in Hudson, Wis., as an off-reservation facility that
began seven years ago. It had regional Interior support, but none
in the White House, like all such casino efforts in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   After the casino was rejected by department civil servants in
mid-1995, the losers cried foul and pressed lawsuits and political
retribution just as other tribes that opposed the project had
lawyered up and got out their political checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   After 1996, and given disclosure of the Clinton-Gore campaign
and the Democratic Party's ugly ethical record in handling soft
money donations and granting access to donors, things got out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the department's rejection of the Native
American casino-dog track business venture became criminally
``suspect'' simply because the opponents made $300,000 in soft
money gifts to the Democrats. And Babbitt became a suspected
perjurer because of a testimonial conflict between the secretary
and an old friend from Arizona who had been hired by the proponents
to lobby his (now former) buddy.
</P>
<P>
   We now know, after all that junk, that the only evidence ever in
existence proved the casino rejection was handled routinely, and
without Babbitt's involvement in any way, much less with any
political pressure from the White House or DNC on the career
officials involved; there is and never was evidence of a quid pro
quo.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could have stopped all this, but under the unlamented
independant counsel law she insisted that a simple conflict between
two sworn witnesses (even a minor one) must trigger a criminal
investigation, even if it expanded (which it did) to the underlying
casino decision that she said didn't merit further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The result was 18 months, 400-plus witnesses, and 600,000-plus
pages of evidence, as well as defamation and legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The pols and press all had their fun. Now the drill here is to
say the system worked and justice was done.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't and it wasn't.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The players are just tiny names in box scores now, distant
cousins who evoke only traces of the passion their forebears
commanded when Braves Field still stood and Boston was a two
baseball-team town.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Red Sox try to catch the Yankees in the American
League championship, the dwindling fans of the old Boston Braves
are keeping score of the National League series and watching the
ballplayers from Atlanta, whose team traces its roots to New
England, try to eliminate the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it, there's still a few people who
are carrying a torch for the Braves,'' said Dick Johnson, curator
of the New England Sports Museum. ``It's been diluted over the
years, but for some the allegiance for that old team is still quite
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   With a spanking-new ballpark, an impressive record of recent
wins, and a billionaire owner who pantomimes tomahawk chops with
his movie-star wife, the team of Ted Turner and Jane Fonda is
barely distinguishable as the modern incarnation of the club that
left Boston in March 1953 because of sagging attendance.
</P>
<P>
   But if he squints hard enough, and allows his mind to drift back
to the era of President Truman, Mayor Hynes, and the Korean War,
Philip Cahill can easily conjure up images of Warren Spahn, Johnny
Sain, Earl Torgeson, and Willard Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've followed them ever since they left town,'' said Cahill,
76, of Wellesley, who grew up across the street from Braves Field,
now the site of Boston University's Nickerson Field. ``If there's a
Braves game and a Red Sox game on TV, I'll watch the Braves. I will
confess to having a great problem if the two teams were to meet in
the World Series. I know there's a thing called hometown loyalty.
But I'm not sure what I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill may be getting a little ahead of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even among members of the Boston Braves Historical Association,
his allegiance _ following the team through its travels from Boston
to Milwaukee to Atlanta _ is unusual in a society that is as much
about nostalgia as it is about derring-do on the baseball diamond
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really enjoy revisiting that era. It's when I grew up
and went to the games with my father,'' said John Brooks, who was
raised in Newton and now lives in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players were more familiar to me then,'' Brooks said.
``They all seemed pleased to be playing. You could almost see it in
the way they would lean, the way they looked, the angle of their
caps. I just like to bury myself in the memories of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days were 82 seasons long, played by the Red Stockings,
Red Caps, Doves, Beaneaters, Rustlers, Bees, and _ ultimately _ the
Braves. While in Boston, the franchise won 10 pennants, one World
Series (1914), and was followed by fiercely loyal fans who grew
accustomed to pulling for the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division between the Red Sox fans and the Braves fans were
along class and ethnic lines and the Braves were much more the poor
people's team and the team of choice for immigrants,'' said
Johnson, co-author of an upcoming book chronicling a century of Red
Sox history. ``The Red Sox were more of the white-shoe team. The
Braves were blue collar.''
</P>
<P>
   Their young fans clipped newspaper coupons, redeemed at the park
off Commonwealth Avenue in Allston where a nickel bought a ticket
in the third-base pavilion along with other members of the group
known as the Knothole Gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players were very, very approachable and they still are to
this day,'' said Bob Brady of Braintree, who produces a Boston
Braves newsletter every few months.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves returned to Boston in the summer of 1997 with
the introduction of interleague play, their old fans broke out
their faded jerseys and broken-billed caps to celebrate the sons of
Sibby Sisti and Johnny Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred members strong, the team's historical association
holds reunions at which old fans reminisce with aging players like
Tommy Holmes, Ray Martin, Norm Roy, and a pitcher named Art
Johnson, who led the team in strikeouts in 1941 and then blew out
his arm in spring training 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the fans can still tell you the records of the old
Braves players and we can't lie about it because they have one of
those big baseball encyclopedias,'' said Art Johnson who lives in
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our fans favored National League baseball and, of
course, we were almost always the underdog,'' he said. ``You know
how people feel about the underdog? They still think the wrong team
left town. That's their favorite expression: The wrong team left
town.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, the team that stayed has acquired the
loyalties of most of the old Braves followers. And to them, if the
Red Sox were to beat the odds and meet the team from Atlanta in the
final World Series of the century, nostalgia would be little match
for pennant-winning passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody loved the Braves more than I did, but if it's the Red
Sox-Braves in the World Series, that won't put me into a corner for
a second,'' said former state Treasurer Robert Q. Crane, who rode
the streetcar to Braves Field as a kid. ``I did root for them for
the longest time. But there's no residual allegiance. I've never
enjoyed a ballplayer as much as I've enjoyed (Nomar) Garciaparra.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Eskin, another Boston Braves booster, said the only tie
linking the old Braves with the new is the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather see the Mets win, quite frankly, because
they're both underdogs and the Red Sox have a debt to pay to the
Mets,'' said Eskin, alluding to Boston's World Series heartbreak in
1986.

NATURE'S INTERNAL BARBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If a man didn't shave his face or his head and lived to, say,
75 years old, how long would his hair be?
</P>
<P>
   G.R., Mendon, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Rapunzel notwithstanding, neither men nor women can grow head
hair much longer than 4 feet, or facial hair much longer than 2.
Nature has a kind of internal barber. Here's how it works,
according to Dr. Michael Holick, professor of medicine, dermatology
and physiology at the Boston University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The follicles from which hair grows have on and off periods.
``On'' is called the anagen phase. The off period is called the
telogen phase. The anagen, or growing, phase lasts between two to
six years on the scalp, and about two and four years on the face.
</P>
<P>
   Telogen, the off phase, lasts about two to three months, both on
the top of the head and on the face.
</P>
<P>
   During the anagen phase, the follicles are adding keratin, a
protein, to the base of the hair shaft so that it gets longer and
longer.
</P>
<P>
   During the telogen phase, the follicle stops making keratin, and
the shaft gets a little loose inside the follicle. Any kind of
abrasion or pulling, and that hair comes out. That's why you'll
always see a few strands of hair in your comb or brush.
</P>
<P>
   You always have some follicles in the telogen phase, and you're
pulling out hairs that have stopped growing. All the hair from
follicles in the telogen phase loosens and falls out before the
anagen phase in those follicles kicks in again.
</P>
<P>
   Then why don't we go bald for a few months when the telogen
phase starts? Because fortunately not all our follicles follow the
same schedule. They don't all turn on and off at the same time.
While some are off, many are still on, busily growing longer and
longer hair.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the math of hair length. A hair on your head grows 1/2
to 3/4 of a foot per year, for up to six years. It can get only
about four feet long before the follicle switches off and that hair
falls out.
</P>
<P>
   Face hair grows 1/4 to 1/2 a foot per year, for up to four
years. It can only get two feet before the facial follicle switches
off.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Holick has isolated what appears to be the stimulus that
controls this on-off cycle. It's called parathyroid hormone related
peptide. PTHrP for short. It builds up in the follicle, finally
reaching a level that triggers the telogen phase.
</P>
<P>
   Holick has made a molecule that works like PTHrP, and on mice,
it turns follicles off and the mice lose their hair. Mickey Mouse
bald as Telly Savalas.
</P>
<P>
   He has also made a molecule that blocks the effects of PTHrP,
and when that's used on the mice, their hair never stops growing.
Minnie Mouse with the tresses of Crystal Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work in humans? Holick is about to find out. He's
seeking government approval to try a topical treatment on cancer
patients who have lost their hair because of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for bald guys, though. The Yul Brynner look is caused
by the outright death of follicles, not because they're on a
temporary telogenic time-out. No follicle, no hair.
</P>

BONING UP ON CALCIUM INTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Osteoporosis is no laughing matter. And yet, each day, as I suck
down enough yogurt to choke a goat, I wonder if maybe our national
obsession with calcium consumption isn't just a tiny bit funny.
</P>
<P>
   Got milk? You bet. How could I not get milk with the dairy
industry on my case? Virtually every magazine I pick up has another
article about calcium. Where to get it. How to get it. How to make
sure you're getting enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   And the ads are everywhere. I'm looking at one featuring photos
of Tracey Ullman as four different characters, each wearing a milk
mustache, with a caption that reads: ``There's one person I won't
be. A woman with osteoporosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Women should be careful to get enough calcium in their teens and
20s, when bones are developing, advises Ruth S. Jacobowitz, author
of ``150 Most-Asked Questions About Osteoporosis.'' A youthful diet
of black coffee and cigarettes can come back to haunt you when
you're older, in the form of hip and spinal fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, young women don't think much about
osteoporosis, but by midlife most are aware that lack of calcium
can lead to bone loss, to breaks, to shrinking. One day you notice
that an older friend or relative is looking through the steering
wheel instead of over it. ``That won't happen to me,'' you say to
yourself, and run off to gobble up as much calcium as possible
before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I have developed calcium-related anxiety. At night,
just before I close my eyes, I wonder, ``Did I get enough calcium
today?'' I turn off the light and toss and turn and worry. Maybe I
should get up and eat some calcium-rich ice cream. Or chew a couple
of Tums. The ice cream calls out to me. Consuming enough calcium
can be fattening.
</P>
<P>
   Post-menopausal women who aren't on hormone replacement therapy
should have 1,500 mg of calcium a day. According to a food chart in
Jacobowitz's book, that's the equivalent, more or less, of two
8-ounce containers of plain yogurt (415 mg each), a cup of collards
(357 mg), plus a half-can of sardines, bones and all (372 mg). Or,
alternatively, nine cups of ice cream (176 mg per cup), give or
take.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you go about it, no matter how carefully you plan,
it's not easy to take in so much calcium every day, even with
calcium-fortified foods such as juice and cereal available. And
it's not just a simple matter of eating calcium-rich foods. Certain
foods must be eaten cautiously because they hinder calcium
absorption. Sodas. Caffeine. Too much salt. Oxalic acid, found in
spinach, parsley, and a variety of other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Until somebody invents a calcium-fortified potato chip, the only
way I'm going to get 1,500 mg of calcium every day is to take
supplements. At the drugstore, I find a bewildering variety.
Calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate. Calcium from oyster shells.
Calcium gluconate. Calcium lactate. All kinds of calcium with or
without magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin K. It seems foolish to make a
choice without the advice of a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   They're offering free samples of a new calcium supplement. It's
chocolate and chewy. Yummy, in fact. I decide to buy some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful with these, ma'am,'' the pharmacist says, in a tone
that suggests he's handing me an explosive device. ``Don't eat more
than three a day.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember Jacobowitz's warning that too much calcium can upset
your body chemistry and may actually be harmful. It can cause
kidney stones, various intestinal unpleasantries.
</P>
<P>
   Too little calcium. Too much calcium. Does worrying about your
calcium intake hinder calcium absorption? I wouldn't be surprised.
</P>

 BOSTON: ... project fizzled.

<P>
   The paintings survived. They have the preciousness and precision
of Faberge eggs. The introductory ones in the MFA are framed in
fours, in windowlike panes outlined in gold moldings, an odd
presentation Stebbins says was probably the doing of their previous
owner, British art historian Kenneth Clark. The paintings are pas
de deux between a male and female of each species, engaged in what
humans read as flirtatious conversations, with swordlike beaks
sometimes aiming toward each other, as if zeroing in for a kiss.
Heade went beyond Audubon descriptiveness: He'd even pair
hummingbirds that didn't share the same habitat, inventing
fictional turf wars between them. He's got a whole aviary's worth
of species in the 1870 ``Tropical Landscape with Ten
Hummingbirds,'' a chockablock fantasy that suggests Bosch. On the
other hand, in the interest of accuracy, Heade stocked up on
hummingbird skins in Rio, to prompt his memory of their dazzling
colors _ including a pink that shrieks across the room even in
small doses.
</P>
<P>
   The flaring orchids, with their hot-hued, beckoning interiors,
are erotic _ especially in tandem with those pointy-beaked birds.
They were considered erotic in Heade's time, too. Orchids were
sometimes omitted from 19th-century books on the meanings of
various flowers, because they were so blatantly sexual to Victorian
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Heade's flowers make you want to know more about his take on
nature. ``For Church and the Hudson River painters, nature was a
fixed, Emersonian Garden of Eden,'' says Stebbins. ``Heade was
their age, but a generation ahead of them. To him, the tropics were
not fixed but in flux, not an Eden but a dangerous, malarial place.
Heade saw the tropics as Darwinian, with species competing for
survival, a place of rot and decay offset by eggs in a nest
suggesting rebirth.''
</P>
<P>
   Heade's orchids stand up for themselves, poised and receptive
vessels. The magnolias he painted late in his career, after moving
to Florida and marrying, at age 64, swoon in submission. Made at a
moment when Impressionism was coming to the fore, they're sleek and
seamless, with nothing of that style's flickering paint
application. Heade had his one fling with Impressionism before the
term was coined, in the stippled strokes of his 1868 ``April
Showers.''
</P>
<P>
   Flower power
</P>
<P>
   Once Heade sketched a flower, he'd recycle the same bloom in
painting after painting. It's a modernist approach, and a practical
one. Stebbins has hung a quartet of apple-blossom canvases in a
row, emphasizing how different the same bloom can look in various
surroundings, like a diamond in different settings. Hovering
against a cloudy void, the flower is an icon. Plopped into a
nautilus shell in a suffocatingly cluttered Victorian interior,
it's a mere accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Heade had lapses. The one huge work in the show, the 1887 ``View
From Fern-Tree Walk, Jamaica,'' is bland in both color and
composition, as if its scale had diluted it. The room of seascapes
is uneven. The stunner is the painting that was key in Heade's
rediscovery, ``Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay,'' a scene of
blackness overtaking sailboats on a glassy sea. Pale birds are
silhouetted against dark sky, and vice versa. A jagged line of
lightning divides the picture vertically, offsetting a horizontal
sandbar where a tiny figure is taking down a sail whose voluptuous
white folds prefigure those magnolia petals of a couple of decades
later. Other figures are carrying off oars, an everyday activity in
a scene that balances the transient and timeless.
</P>
<P>
   Heade also had a sense of humor. One little work that isn't in
the MFA show, alas, is a wacko image, ``Gremlins in the Studio,''
recently bought by the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. It's a
painting of one of Heade's marsh paintings, propped up on
sawhorses, with a cartoonish gremlin cavorting underneath.
</P>
<P>
   After Boston, the Heade show heads to the National Gallery of
Art in Washington, D.C., then winds up its tour at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. Although the MFA organized the exhibition and
Boston is its first stop, it's not in the Gund Gallery, the
museum's largest and most high-profile temporary exhibition space,
but in the smaller Torf Gallery. In the rotunda adjacent to Torf,
the MFA has installed a small and none-too-stellar selection of
paintings by Heade's contemporaries: They seem almost deliberately
chosen to make Heade look even better. In a hallway off the
rotunda, Stebbins has hung R. J. Thornton's ``Temple of Flora''
prints, published in London from 1799 to 1807: Their in-your-face
foreground flowers suggest Heade's bizarre compositional format _
birds and orchids shoved to the front of the picture plane, set
against jungly dampness.
</P>
<P>
   For a broad context for Heade, and one that gives him stiffer
competition than the rotunda display, stroll through the American
paintings galleries. Here you can take in the Luminism of Lane or
Sanford Gifford, and William Harnett's trompe l'oeil still lifes
that share the velvet seductiveness of Heade's magnolias. Here you
can even compare the gritty, white, full frontal flowers of Georgia
O'Keeffe to his sleekly groomed ones. These works flesh out the
Heade exhibition, which would have benefited from a sampling of the
early portraits and even those ``Gremlins.'' Tucked into Torf, the
show feels somewhat incomplete. And that, because what is there is
so splendid, feels sad.

   SCI-CATHEDRAL-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ While the Roman Catholic
Church condemned Galileo, new research shows that centuries of
oversimplifications have concealed how hard Rome worked to amass
astronomical tools, measurements, tests and lore. In its scientific
zeal, the Church adapted cathedrals across Europe, and a tower at
the Vatican itself, so their darkened vaults could serve as solar
observatories. Beams of sunlight that fell past religious art and
marble columns not only inspired the faithful but provided
astronomers with information about the Sun, the Earth and their

   SCI-ASTHMA-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Despite the seemingly endless
rise in asthma cases, new treatments for the disease have been
noticeably slow in coming. Within the past two years, for example,
three new drugs have been released to treat migraines, with another
due in the spring. But for asthma, which accounts for more
pediatric hospitalizations each year than any other illness, only
two significant drugs were approved in the same time period,

   SCI-MAMMARIES (Undated) _ According to the commonly accepted
``one-half rule,'' the average number of young in a litter is one
half the typical number of mammaries and the maximum litter size is
equal to the total number of mammaries. But studies of naked mole
rats defy that rule, in part, scientists suspect, because of the

   SCI-LEOPOLD-CONSERVATION (New York) _ In the field of
conservation, Aldo Leopold is a titan. His ``Sand County Almanac''
is a bible of the environmental movement every bit as much as
Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring.'' In Washington, where national
conservation policy has been going through major changes of
philosophy in recent years, his name and ideas are everyday
currency. So it is that in this 50th anniversary year of the book,
which has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still going
strong, Leopold's ideas are being scrutinized afresh. A recent
conference was convened here by the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences,
Arts and Letters to examine his legacy and its relevance for the

it is expected to exceed 100,000 this year. More than half the
increase has occurred in people over 65. Survival rates, too, have
been inching upward, thanks to improved diagnostic techniques and
more precise and inventive methods of treatment, like stereotactic
radiosurgery (a pinpoint form of radiation) and laser surgery with
a gamma knife. Further progress is expected to result from some

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... started singing. ...''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lennox has one of richest voices in pop music, and is arguably
the best white female soul singer. In the early days, Eurythmics
material was often shaded toward the dark side. On that first tour,
Lennox was in Boston, riding in a cab to her hotel. Discussing
Eurythmics, she called them a ``serious'' band and said, pointedly,
``This is not good-time rock 'n' roll.'' Lennox laughs when that
anecdote is recalled and says, ``I hope I have developed a sense of
humor since then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did the `Sweet Dreams' album,'' says Stewart, ``Annie
was living in a basement, we had just broken up, we had no idea
whether we were going to have a record. It was all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing ``Dreams''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lyrics are a blueprint of your soul at the time,'' Lennox
picks up, ``but you don't sit down and say `I am going to do this
kind of song now.' It is actually just the soul speaking, and David
has this very special thing where he (helps) make it happen. It is
a little hard to explain what he does, something typical of what we
write, but that day (we wrote `Sweet Dreams') I was very depressed
and we were trying to write something and it didn't fit and I
sulked about it, and then without talking I said listen to this
little rhythm'' _ she sings it _ ``and then all of a sudden I got
this idea and in five minutes the whole thing was done. It wouldn't
have happened if I hadn't been with Dave, because he kind of
instigates things.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart compares Lennox to another singer with whom he's
recently worked, Bryan Ferry. (Stewart helped produce Ferry's next
album of original work, not the upcoming covers album ``As Time
Goes By.'') Ferry, he says, is severely self-critical and suffers
from writer's block and the same goes for Lennox. The music is a
collaborative process, but the lyrics are just about always
Lennox's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go, `Ahh . . . it's rubbish,' '' says Lennox, ``and he goes
`No, no' while he's organizing it. It's got so much to do with
self-actualization. You feel there's nothing there and it's very
odd. Nevertheless, I think I've grown in my confidence about my
abilities and the thing that really helped that was us working
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The first single from the new album is ``17 Again.'' It begins:
``Yea, though we venture through the valley of stars / You in all
your jewelry and my bleeding heart / Who couldn't be together and
who could not be apart / We should have jumped out of that airplane
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, quite obviously, autobiographical, and it was the first
song they cowrote for the album. ``I think Annie was sitting at
home at her grand piano,'' says Stewart, ``and she had something
that she really liked. And she said, `You've got to start
somewhere.' I liked it straightaway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got this (melody) line in my head,'' says Lennox, ``and
you sort of sit and stare at the line. That's how I get the words _
I sit and stare at it. And then I go through all the things that
rhyme and see what fits. It's sort of biblical _ going through the
valley of death, the shadow of death, fame also. We face an awful
lot today, that whole process of being revealed in such a public
way. The differences between us two _ we couldn't be together and
could never be apart. And that part about the airplane _ we should
have jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's a curious bit. Where does that come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very vicious and excruciating journalists in
Britain,'' says Lennox. The acerbic critic Julie Burchill ``had
written that we should die famously (that way). Why do people write
like that? You know there is something in you that is hurt. The
airplane was our aspirations and ambitions, if you like, so we
should have jumped out because we are not worth anything. It was
hard not to fall because we were up there in the ether of stardom.
What a place to be. I had so many crashes that I could not feel at
all. I kept on crashing and crashing with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``17 Again'' is, ultimately, full of hope, as are
Eurythmics. The song circles back at the end to the chorus of
``Sweet Dreams.'' Says Lennox: ``It's like full circle. When you
were 17 it is an extraordinary moment, after childhood and
pre-adulthood. You think you know everything, but you don't know
anything and yet it is a special time.''

SEIFERT HITS THE CENTURY MARK BY DEFEATING FAMILIAR TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carolina Panthers coach George Seifert came out
of the tunnel for warm-ups, and a huge roar went up in the nearby
end zone. The applause seemed even louder and warmer than Seifert
had a right to expect, dressed as he was, in the garb of a
turncoat, a black Panthers polo shirt over a pair of khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Were there really this many San Francisco 49ers fans willing to
cheer for a rival coach, just because he had once been theirs? Were
they nostalgic for the old days, and perhaps so unconcerned about
what Seifert's 1-3 Panthers might do to their own depleted team,
that they could blithely cheer their lungs out for him?
</P>
<P>
   One look in the direction of that frenzied end zone explained it
all. At the very moment that Seifert stepped onto the grass at
Candlestick, Jerry Rice ran out of the Niners' locker room about
100 feet away. The cheers were for him, not for Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   The returning coach slipped onto the field in relative peace and
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But his exit? Well, that was different.
</P>
<P>
   He left a winner, which is the way he usually left the field at
Candlestick, so it wasn't all that different, except for the black
shirt and the fact that he had to squint into the sun on the
visitors' sideline all game.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of statistics, arcane and otherwise, to
suggest the significance of this victory. It was Seifert's 100th
regular-season victory as a head coach in the NFL. He has a 100-33
regular-season record, making him the quickest coach ever to hit
the century mark for wins. Don Shula, the runner-up, had 35 defeats
before his 100th victory.
</P>
<P>
   The win also kept alive Seifert's distinction as the head coach
with the highest winning percentage in history. Vince Lombardi, at
.741, was closing fast. A win by the 49ers would have dropped
Seifert down to .740 and second place. But the Panthers won, 31-29,
in a game of anarchy, a game that looked as if it could have been
moved to the parking lot without a substantial drop in quality of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert had beaten his successor, Steve Mariucci, in their first
meeting since Eddie DeBartolo and Carmen Policy dispatched Seifert
to his fishing boat in January 1997. Mariucci had never before lost
a regular-season game at the 'Stick, and here was Seifert upending
him, delivering a devastating blow to 49ers prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about as worn as I can ever remember after a game,''
Seifert said, in what amounted to a major concession. He tried all
week to pretend that meeting the 49ers meant nothing special.
Barely five minutes into his postgame news conference, he said:
``If we were in Washington and won this game, I'd be on top of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Wesley Walls, the discarded 49ers tight end in Carolina
colors, said: Nonsense, or some football-player version thereof.
``He was really excited,'' Walls said. ``I could tell, even though
he was good at playing it cool. He'll probably get mad at me for
saying this, but it's 49ers week, and whenever it's 49ers week,
it's special.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, Seifert's daughter, Eve, and son-in-law
Bill Dunkle, found him as he started to leave the field and gave
him big hugs. His wife, Linda, stayed back at their new home in
Charlotte, avoiding all of the emotions of the day. But Eve and her
husband own a coffee shop in Larkspur, Calif., and they had to be
at the homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   They went down on the field late in the fourth quarter, when
Carolina had a comfortable lead. The 49ers pulled within two points
in the final minute and a half, and Eve started worrying that she
had counted unhatched chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only supposed to come down if he won,'' she said,
``and so I was thinking, `Shoot, should I race back up?''
</P>
<P>
   He started talking about her father's career in San Francisco,
and what this game meant, but quickly stopped herself. ``I'm not
going.''
</P>
<P>
   During those last crazy minutes, Seifert paced in tight circles,
head down slightly, almost averting his eyes from the field. It was
a familiar scene for Bay Area sports fans and for television
broadcasters, who have always treated footage of an excited George
Seifert as if it were buried treasure. Mariucci and Jon Gruden, the
new breed of Bay Area coaches, show more emotion before the first
commercial break than Seifert has revealed in his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert chatted amiably with Mariucci before the game, both men
with their hands in their pockets. At the end, he found a weary
Jerry Rice leaving the field and gave him a quick embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be a 49ers fan,'' Seifert said matter-of-factly.
``I grew up with them. The Bay Area is home to me. That'll always
be there, down deep, at gut level.''
</P>
<P>
   That was as animated as he became publicly, except for a
conversation a few minutes later, when he was asked for the name of
his daughter's coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you give it a plug?'' he replied enthusiastically, then
started gushing, like any proud parent. ``It's called the Java
Cafe. They've done a great job with the place. It's a lot of fun,
and it has a wonderful hostess ... my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, George, there it is, a plug for your kid. You win. Again.

49ERS COACH FACES THE SORRY TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The stride isn't as purposeful as it used to be.
The grimace is stretched rubber bands. The voice, a lifeless
monotone of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is no exclamation point in Steve Mariucci's
world right now. The facts have hit him flush in the yap one too
many times for him to pretend any longer. His is not football's
dream job any more, and he knows it as only someone with a
foot-sized knot in his gut can.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci endured his first home loss as head coach of the San
Francisco 49ers Sunday, a 31-29 defeat at the hands of the Carolina
Panthers, and he couldn't dress it up as anything other than the
kick in the sweetbreads that it was. He couldn't claim, as is
mathematically the case, that if the season were to end today, the
49ers would still obtain a place in the NFC playoffs. He certainly
couldn't boast that he was steering a very special ship, because he
would look far too much the fool.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he acknowledged the world as it is _ a grim and forlorn
place, where nothing can be taken for granted, and history is not a
guide to the future but an immense dark hand pointing accusingly at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's . . . we've been good, we've been lucky, we've
been able to respond,'' he said when asked to address the end of
his 19-game winning streak in the 415.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some close ones, some barn-burner type games here.
We've won in overtime, we've had last-second field goals, we've had
come-from-behind-type games. You don't want to make a living like
that. You'd like to get ahead right away, and have the people go
home early. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Then he gathered himself, took a breath, and dropped the punch
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not reality any more.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it surely isn't. Mariucci, though, seems to have realized it
at last, and very much the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the listless way he tried to enumerate the excuses
he could have used. Maybe it was knowing that the architect of the
49er legacy, Bill Walsh, was standing over his shoulder, in spirit
when not in fact. Maybe it was seeing George Seifert, the man who
followed Walsh, across the field with that fisherman's squint of
his wearing the silly teal-and-black of Carolina. Maybe it's
finally understanding that the empire cannot stand proudly forever,
what with Steve Young, Terrell Owens and Garrison Hearst in civvies
and the cornerbacks in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Steve Mariucci has finally lost his cheery, sometimes even
cockeyed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of that optimism Sunday afternoon. He wasn't
even outwardly angry about the myriad breakdowns that caused them
to fall two touchdowns behind a tea that in the old days wouldn't
have been within two touchdowns. That, was then. This is now, and a
hell of a hard now it is at that.
</P>
<P>
   The two defensive touchdowns they scored Sunday nearly hid the
fact that their most effective offensive weapon was kicker Wade
Richey. The defense allowed 300 passing yards to Steve Beuerlein,
which Beuerlein hadn't done in six years, and the third time it had
allowed 300 yards to any quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci knows it, and surely coached like it Sunday. He made
what seems now to have been a significant tactical error not
letting Wade Richey try a 51-yard field goal on the first
possession of third quarter and the boys down, 24-16. He cited the
wind as a factor, but mostly he didn't want to put his paycheck in
Wade Richey's mouth, even though the offense under the oddly
skittish quarterback Jeff Garcia was doing nothing of note.
</P>
<P>
   True, he was doing what 49er coaches have done since Walsh _
disdaining the field goal as the mark of a sissy-boy, denying the
greatness of the system and its practitioners. But the system is
being placed in the hands of lesser talents now, and in the new
pie-fight NFL, the Walshian idea of standard of play is simply no
longer applicable.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks saw these days coming; indeed, some saw them coming
10 years ago, which turns the corner from prescience into
stupidity. Mariucci surely sees them now, and even when his words
hide the truth, his actions and body language expose it all the
more.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have won their three games by a total of 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost their three games by a total of 62. Sunday's was
the closest of the three, and yet the most galling. And even if you
want to make the perfectly reasonable claim that every team in the
NFL is either 3-3 or ought to be, the fact is the 49ers didn't used
to be any team. They won all the time; more impressively, they
routinely covered large point spreads, which means that in their
prime they won by a lot of points, and to do that, you dominate
your inferiors.
</P>
<P>
   There is no domination in these 49ers. There may be survival,
but there won't be another take-it-for-granted game this year; you
think happy thoughts about the Dec. 2 game at Cincinnati at your
peril.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci won't. He knows better now. Those cleat marks in
his face are all the education he needs.

SWEET DREAMS AGAIN FOR LENNOX AND STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Annie Lennox and David Stewart _ former lovers,
forever the best of friends, and once again musical collaborators _
share a couch in a hotel suite high above Manhattan. Together
again, as Eurythmics. It's the morning after their televised
reemergence, where they played a truncated ``hits'' medley on the
``Saturday Night Live'' 25th-anniversary show. ``Bizarre, a
one-second sprint,'' says Lennox. ``It reminded me of comedians _
you've just got to go boom, boom, boom,'' says Stewart. Today,
they're moving a little slowly, still jetlagged after the flight
from London and suffering, perhaps, from a bit too much wine after
the show. They didn't join the cast party; they celebrated on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade apart, these two are one and they are happy
together. The warmth and respect are apparent as they swap stories,
employing gentle humor and self-deprecating wit. It is evident on
their glistening new album, ``Peace,'' which will be released by
Arista on Tuesday. It is an unabashedly uplifting effort, strong,
confident, and soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed when we first played the songs live in the studio
they had a more ominous feeling,'' says guitarist Stewart, ``and
then when we played them (later) it was really up.''
</P>
<P>
   Up it is.
</P>
<P>
   As Eurythmics, Lennox and Stewart sold more than 30 million
records. They don't see this phase of their group as a comeback or
reunion. They've both been working, Lennox scoring with the solo
albums ``Diva'' and ``Medusa,'' for which she won Grammys; Stewart
operating at a lesser commercial level, releasing two albums with
his band, the Spiritual Cowboys, the latest being 1995's
``Greetings From the Gutter.'' He also produced scads of artists.
And, really, Eurythmics never ``broke up'' per se; they just
dissipated. Strangely, Stewart notes, ``even though we haven't been
playing or making records in 10 years, we have never been off the
radio. So there are a lot of people who are 18 or whatever who have
heard us on the radio, but never seen us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennox and Stewart share a laugh at their own expense about how
old that makes them feel.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-date worldwide tour they are now on does hop across
continents, but it's a far cry from their road warrior days _ ``We
played 283 gigs one year, or something,'' says Stewart _ and there
are only two US dates, Nov. 4 in Los Angeles and Nov. 9 in New York
at Madison Square Garden. They plan on riding out 1999 and seeing
if, in 2000, they feel like touring. Maybe yes, maybe no. Lennox is
married to Israeli film director Uri Fruchtmann and has two
daughters; Stewart is unmarried but has a girlfriend. Priorities
have changed over time. Neither seems to want to reenter the pop
world at a frenzied pace.
</P>
<P>
   All proceeds from the current tour benefit Amnesty International
and Greenpeace. ``We have hooked our souls into working with these
organizations,'' says Lennox, ``and I feel it empowers me as an
individual to do that. I want to work for them. I mean, I want to
do what I'm doing (musically) but I also want it to benefit people.
It actually just gives me a feeling that I exist when I'm doing
that, and that keeps me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   As to this reemergence, ``There is no master plan,'' insists
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion for John
</P>
<P>
   Lennox, 44, and Stewart, 46, got back together again last year.
``It was for John Preston, a guy who was head of RCA in England
when we were sort of successful,'' says Stewart. ``He was a really
lovely guy from Scotland, really young, and all the people in the
industry loved him. We did this as a surprise for him. There were
all these people there in this tiny place with curtains across the
stage. Everybody was having a nice time, and all of a sudden
somebody stood up, gave a speech, and then said, `Anyway, for John,
Eurythmics' and the curtain opened. We played 10 songs, acoustic,
and he was crying his eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another. They did a breast cancer benefit,
performed on the Brit Awards, and received a Lifetime Achievement
Award. They started working on tunes again at the Church, a London
studio they co-own. ``It just started happening,'' says Stewart.
``We would sit down, have a glass of wine, and start writing a
song. We realized we had written about eight or nine songs and that
made an album.''
</P>
<P>
   What is their motivation, as this quintessential band of the
'80s returns at the close of the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, just to do it,'' says Lennox. ``To have a dream and a
burning desire to achieve it. Just getting the opportunity to do
it, to make it, create it.''
</P>
<P>
   As to ambition, Stewart laughs and says, ``I have been plagued
by it. It is nonstop. I was just showing my girlfriend the other
day, some early stuff, a video, and I realized that in looking at
myself, I was fulfilling a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   They met when he was 23 and worked in a health food shop, and
she 21, a Scottish dropout of the Royal College of Music. They
originally played in the excellent, but largely overlooked, new
wave band the Tourists. But that was Pete Coombes's project. Lennox
and Stewart were not focal points. The two began a romance and
split to form Eurythmics. The romance ended; the band took off, and
in 1983 Eurythmics became one of the first of the MTV-aided video
sensations. People wondered: Sure, they look great, but could they
actually play?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart recalls their first club gig in Los Angeles, where Bob
Dylan (who became a friend later) and other musicians were in the
crowd, with a prove-it atttitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were born in the video generation,'' says Stewart. ``And
when we arrived everybody already knew who we were. Everybody was
confused about the video age: Does it mean no one is singing or
playing anymore? Fortunately, we were good. When they came to see
us live, they ended up loving it. When Annie started singing . . .
''

   Recent movie reviews from The Boston Globe:
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``All the Little Animals'' An allegory about the
healing power of nature, made with the English love of nature and
eccentricity. Christian Bale stars as a troubled boy fleeing from a
cruel stepfather, finding refuge with John Hurt's cranky old
hermit, whose life work is saving animals and burying the ones he
can't save. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS) 1/2 ``Breakfast of Champions'' Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s
Vietnam-protest-driven novel is transformed into an uneasy misfire
of an anti-consumerism cartoon. Bruce Willis gamely unravels as an
unhappy used-car king, Nick Nolte bravely plays his cross-dressing
sales manager, and Albert Finney lurches in to offer sage if
cockeyed advice as Vonnegut's stand-in. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``Earth'' The second of Deepa Mehta's films named
for the four elements of antiquity is a rightly horrific depiction
of the slaughter that followed the partition of British India in
1947. Seen though its impact upon a supposedly neutral Parsee
family, the clash between Hindus and Moslems is put in context as a
ghastly (10 million dead) conclusion to British colonialism.
(Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``Fight Club'' A dark, sizzling comedy of male
rage. Brad Pitt stars as an anarchic soap salesman bent on world
domination, and Edward Norton plays the corporate drone for whom he
plays evil angel. The two start an underground ``fight club'' whose
pugilistic members become Pitt's own private neo-fascist army. The
film ultimately collapses into explosive silliness, but
audaciousness and style carry it until then. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) 1/2 ``Get Bruce!'' Half-documentary, half-testimonial
focusing on Bruce Vilanch, the fey writer of what Hollywood calls
``special material'' (remarks at award ceremonies and the like).
His satisfied customers include Billy Crystal, Robin Williams,
Whoopi Goldberg, and Bette Midler and there are interesting
glimpses of their working methods. But the film doesn't much try to
give us the man behind the gags. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) ``Lucie Aubrac'' Claude Berri's film is based on the
real-life heroics of a French woman during the Nazi occupation. The
story of how she managed to snatch her Resistance-fighter husband
from Klaus Barbie, the butcher of Lyon, emerges in handsomely
crafted but curiously stilted fashion. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``Stiff Upper Lips'' Entertaining sendup of
Merchant-Ivory, D. H. Lawrence, and a few other British cultural
icons of Edwardian and later vintage. A batty family journeys from
its stately home to Italy and then India, where it gets into the
same sorts of trouble that Lawrence, E. M. Forster, Stella Gibbon,
and others have turned into big-screen bywords. Georgina Cates
stars as the impetuous heroine. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) ``The Story of Us'' Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer
give it a good try, and even a warm one, in Rob Reiner's comedy
about a couple coming apart after 15 years of loving but wearing
marriage. The behavioral details are good, but the tone and
resolution are too sitcom-like in tone: We don't feel we've covered
enough ground in enough depth and complexity. (R)

BLAIR WITCH'S NEXT PROJECT: VIDEO MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my father wanted me to fall asleep when I was a kid, he
told me the following, oft-repeated story: ``It
</P>
<P>
   was a dark and stormy night. We were all seated around the
campfire. The captain said to his trusty lieutenant, `Come,
Antonio, and I'll tell you a story,' and the story went like this.
`It was a dark and stormy
</P>
<P>
   night . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' is the ultimate ``dark and stormy
night'' movie. Three student filmmakers head to the woods to make a
documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch and disappear. A
year later, their footage is found. That's it. No plot. No real
character development. No special effects. Nothing except the
genius of some college kids from Central Florida University using
about $35,000, some second-rate equipment, and their ingenuity to
scare the wits out of an audience mostly composed of their
contemporaries. The only ones more frightened than the kids are the
heads of every Hollywood studio, who watched this no-budget college
project horrify most of their big-budget summer releases.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Blair Witch'' co-director Eduardo Sanchez put it in an
interview with Britain's ITN network, ``We broke all of Hollywood's
rules; people digged the whole underdog thing. It was like these
guys coming out of nowhere . . . they have no money, and they just
have a good idea and they break every rule that Hollywood has
etched in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, ``The Blair Witch Project'' hits video stores in
both the VHS and DVD formats. Fueled by a $15 million advertising
campaign, about 428 times the movie's cost, and a flurry of
interest on the Internet, the distributors and retailers expect the
home video sales to dwarf the approximately $125 million the movie
made in American theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan Entertainment, the film's savvy distributor, has added
several enticing special features to the home-video versions. Both
the VHS and DVD versions include the Sci-Fi Channel special ``The
Curse of the Blair Witch,'' a pseudo-documentary on the
pseudo-documentary. It includes interviews with ``experts'' on the
Blair Witch and other bits and pieces of fictional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD includes conversations with the actors and filmmakers,
and the DVD-ROM adds a map of the Black Hills Forest, a dossier,
and ``special'' access to the various Blair Witch Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some video stores are planning midnight ``Blair Witch'' parties,
and on-line home-video providers, such as DVD Empire, are tossing
in ``Blair Witch'' necklaces to the first 1,000 customers who
pre-order the feature film. They are also selling the DVD for
$20.95, 30 percent below the list price of $29.98.
</P>
<P>
   What's the fuss? It's really not a very scary movie, especially
for those who were terrified by Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho,''
Steven Spielberg's ``Jaws,'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``The Shining.''
There are dozens of redundant shots of woods and darkness with the
actors seeming more angry than scared. But that's also part of its
charm.
</P>
<P>
   `Us vs. them'
</P>
<P>
   Many theatrical releases, inflated by big budgets and handsome
stars, create an ``us vs. them'' mentality, born of the dichotomy
between what's on the big screen and who's sitting in the little
seats. ``Blair Witch'' invites us in. Made for chump change with
equipment easily available at the mall by students at a school with
a film department dwarfed by the University of Southern California,
New York University, and Boston University, ``Blair Witch'' is the
first guerrilla movie to hit the financial jackpot. While not a
brilliant movie, it is a brilliant notion created by some very
smart kids.
</P>
<P>
   When Truman Capote wrote ``In Cold Blood,'' he used the
conventions of the novel to create a work of nonfiction.
Essentially, the filmmakers have done exactly the opposite by using
the conventions of nonfiction filmmaking to create a work of
fiction. That's not new. Albert Brooks did it in 1979 when he
satirized a PBS documentary in ``Real Life'' and it certainly had
its apotheosis with Rob Reiner's mockumentary, ``This Is Spinal
Tap,'' one of the biggest hits on DVD. But all of the early
pseudo-documentaries wore their pseudo on their sleeves. They let
you in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Blair Witch'' characters are played by actors who use
their real names _ Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua
Leonard _ helping to maintain the illusion that the story is
fact-based. The film looks like the sort of messy home-video
footage associated with ``America's Most Wanted.'' It looks
believable.
</P>
<P>
   According to several sources, the actors were never told what to
expect, so when they look scared and surprised, they are. While the
movie may not be ``truthful,'' the performances are. It's precisely
that sort of authenticity that the audience responds to.
</P>
<P>
   The film also plays to the ever-burgeoning Internet crowd that
spends hours a day interacting with itself. In my memory, it's the
first film that advertised its Internet affiliation with a
full-page ad in Variety, declaring over 20 million hits at
Blairwitch.com following its opening weekend. The Internet
connection energized the ``Blair Witch'' phenomenon: Fans entered
chat rooms, discussed the film, and felt that they were a part of
what has become the ``Blair Witch'' experience. The various maps,
affidavits, and testimonials associated with the different Web
sites lent another level of creative authenticity to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, while ``The Blair Witch Project'' may not be the
scariest movie ever made, it has Hollywood executives shaking in
their portfolios. The people who give out the outrageous
multimillion-dollar, multiyear contracts are asking why they spend
$50 million on a picture and watch it get destroyed by a bunch of
kids from a podunk film school.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple. The college students had the one thing
going for them that hasn't been seen in the Hollywood Hills in many
moons _ originality.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem up ahead. The prequel to ``Blair Witch,''
an investigation of the witch's early years, is in pre-production
with a start date planned for later this year or early January in
Halifax, Nova Scotia. The budget is bigger. They're shooting it in
35mm color, and the cast wants to be paid big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some enterprising Canadian film students will borrow a few
thousand dollars and some antiquated equipment, hire a few no-name
actors, and make a documentary on the making of the prequel. Or,
even better, maybe some young film student out there has another
idea that no one's ever thought of. That would keep the Hollywood
executives bewitched.
</P>
<P>
   These kids proved that they could make millions with a new idea,
and if ``The Blair Witch Project'' accomplished nothing else, that,
in itself, is a major victory.

HIGH-FLYING SALMON GIVES PASSENGERS A FRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The passengers were just settling in for a
flight from Redding to San Francisco when suddenly, on climb-out
for 26,000 feet, this red, foul-smelling juice started flowing out
of the overhead baggage compartment and onto the passengers below.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the passengers shouted, one screamed, and all tried
to shield themselves from the pervasive red juice. It was sticky,
foul and just kept coming, dripping on the passengers despite their
best efforts to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane angled for higher altitudes, the juice seemed to
move to the rear of the plane, as if alive in the baggage
compartment. Meanwhile, one of the passengers aboard, Larry
Ivancitch of Glendora, just smiled nervously.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane leveled off, the juice stopped, and a flight
attendant opened an overhead bin _ and a wet, slippery 30-pound
salmon fell out, right into the lap of one of the horrified
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Ivancitch had caught the fish earlier that day
from the Sacramento River, then had taken it aboard the plane and
had stowed the fish in an overhead bin as carry-on baggage.
</P>
<P>
   WILDLIFE WATCHING: This past year has been one of wildlife
revelations for field scout Rich Callas, a California Department of
Fish and Game biologist who has been tracking deer and elk using
global positioning radio transmitter collars.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Callas tracked Deer 369 for two months, during
which it moved infrequently, holding its range. Then at 12:16 one
morning, it suddenly covered 15 miles in a seven-hour span. Once
the deer was motivated, Callas said it completed 25 percent of its
migration in one 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   The study will allow the Department of Fish and Game to track
elk and deer in order to learn precise timing of their habitat
preferences as the species migrate between summer and winter range.
That information can later be used to protect valuable habitat
niches on their migration routes.
</P>
<P>
   PARK MAINTENANCE: Voters have financed land purchases of 91,000
acres in Alameda and Contra Costa counties for 59 parks in the East
Bay Regional Park District. But now rangers are trying to figure
out how to finance the maintenance of these parks. The bond money
is earmarked for land purchases, not park operations.
</P>
<P>
   The idea now being floated is a small tax on landowners in East
Bay counties, though it would face a very difficult two-thirds
required yes vote at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bond measure for the March 2000 ballot to fund
state parks, with some money for regional and city parks, will
require only a simply majority.

the price of recycled polyethylene terephthalate plastic, or
``PET,'' is $7 a ton. In fact, PET, from which plastic soft drink
and beer bottles are made, is recycled at about 7 cents a pound, or
$140 a ton. The most recent price quotations for reycled aluminum
cans show they are bringing from 27 cents to 42 cents per pound, or
$540 to $840 a ton, in various markets.

PERSONAL HEALTH: BRAIN TUMORS ARE ELUSIVE, VARIED AND NOT ALWAYS
DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth had undergone a mysterious personality change that defied
psychiatric explanation. Charles awoke each morning with a severe
headache that eased as the day progressed. Kathleen experienced
partial facial paralysis, slurred her words and drooled. Marlys
suffered a grand mal seizure that rendered her unconscious for
about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   All four had different kinds of brain tumors. Ruth's was benign
and grew slowly, but it was not detected for years, too late for
treatment that could have saved her.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' tumor was malignant, and despite the best therapy
available at the time, he succumbed to primary brain cancer within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen's tumor was also malignant, but it had not started in
the brain. Rather, it turned out to be the spread of a lung cancer
that ultimately took her life.
</P>
<P>
   Marlys was the lucky one. Her benign tumor was detected by
modern imaging while it was small and in an area that permitted
surgical removal without any harm.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons yet to be determined, brain tumors are becoming more
common, especially in older people. The latest well-known victim is
Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, whose small tumor
was surgically removed this month at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. Although the nature of the tumor has not been
revealed, O'Connor, 79, will be undergoing several weeks of
radiation therapy, which is typically used to prevent the spread of
cancer from cells that may have escaped the surgeon's scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, the yearly total of Americans given
diagnoses of brain tumors has doubled, and it is expected to exceed
100,000 this year. More than half the increase has occurred in
people over 65.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates, too, have been inching up, thanks to improved
diagnostic techniques and more precise and inventive treatments,
like stereotactic radiosurgery (a pinpoint form of radiation) and
laser surgery with a gamma knife. More progress is expected to
result from some still experimental treatments, including
immunotherapy, gene therapy and implanted wafers of
chemotherapeutic agents.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 percent of brain tumors are primary _ that is,
tumors that start in brain tissue. Half of these are brain cancers,
and half are benign tumors that can nonetheless become life
threatening because they grow inside a skull that cannot expand. As
they do, they can press on vital tissues, which may sometimes
preclude their removal.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 80 percent of brain tumors are secondary,
originating from cancers elsewhere in the body _ although, as in
Kathleen's case, the primary cancer is sometimes not detected until
after the metastatic brain tumor has been found. Lung, breast and
colon cancers, as well as melanomas, often spread to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculatin about the possible causes of
brain cancers, and especially their apparent increase. About 5
percent are hereditary. Among suggested environmental factors are
low-energy electromagnetic fields from objects like cellular
phones, power lines and household appliances, although considerable
research into the matter has yet to yield any definitive evidence
of such a risk. To be sure, high-dose radiation delivered to the
head, including therapy for brain tumors, can increase the risk of
brain cancer. There is no link, however, to low-dose radiation
delivered through diagnostic X-rays or workplace exposure to
ionizing radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But industrial chemicals may be a problem. Workers regularly
exposed to substances like acrylonitrite, vinyl chloride,
formaldehyde, lubricating oils, N-nitroso compounds, phenols,
pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organic solvents
develop brain tumors with greater than average frequency. Pregnant
women and parents of infants should be especially careful to avoid
such chemicals because animal studies indicate that exposure in
utero and in infancy incurs the greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Also, pregnant women would be wise to take supplements
containing vitamins C, A, E and folate through their pregnancies. A
three-continent study indicated that the children of women who took
such vitamins were half as likely as the children of nontakers to
develop brain tumors before age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Benign brain tumors can often be treated successfully, although
there may be lasting effects, depending on size and location. But
because the most common type of brain cancer, glioblastoma
multiforme, is fast-growing and highly invasive, and because early
symptoms of brain tumors often mimic other problems, delaying
diagnosis, brain cancer is associated with a five-year survival
rate of only 30 percent. This rate is half that for cancers
overall, but still much better than the survival rates for cancers
of the lung, pancreas and esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with brain tumors is their ability to grow silently
for years and, when they finally do produce symptoms, become
confused with other problems like migraine headaches, inner ear
problems, epilepsy or stroke. For example, Kathleen, who had speech
problems and drooling, thought at first she might have had a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone with symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting, memory loss, personality or behavioral change, hearing
problems, difficulty walking, decreased sensation, seizures or
blurred or double vision underwent a thorough workup for a brain
tumor, it could easily overwhelm the health care system. But if
such symptoms persist or keep recurring, patients should insist on
being examined for possible brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   A proper diagnostic workup should include a complete
neurological exam, including abstract thinking and memory tests and
a scan of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of choice depends on the patient's age (children
under 3 are generally not given radiation therapy), the size and
location of the tumor, the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation
and chemotherapy, and the general health of the patient. The three
common cancer treatments _ surgery, radiation therapy and
chemotherapy _ are most often used for brain tumors as well. But
there are now highly sophisticated ways of ``operating'' on the
brain, including the use of pinpoint radiation and laser beams that
can destroy the tumor without damaging normal surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of clinical trials are also under way, exploring
the potential of new chemotherapeutic techniques and immunotherapy.
In fact, patients are often encouraged to enroll in a trial. More
than 200 such trials are listed in the National Cancer Institute's
Physician Data Query database. It is available by phone, (800)
422-6237, or via either of these Internet sites:
cancertrials.nci.nih.gov or cancernet.nci.nih.gov.

her, that she wanted to be, not just a percussionist, but a solo
percussionist, which was virtually unheard of in classical music.

ALBRIGHT TO SEE PEACE'S HIGH PRICE IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Special units had special names. There
was the Cut Hands Commando and the Bloodshed Squad and the Burn
House Unit. There was the Born Naked Group, which stripped people
of their clothing before killing or mutilating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attacked everybody. We feared nobody,'' boasted Josep
Sonah, a 19-year-old veteran of the rebel horde responsible for
eight years of torture, murder, and mayhem in this tiny West
African nation. ``We were very bold. Everyone is knowing our hot
tempers.''
</P>
<P>
   During nearly a decade of insurgency driven by little more than
a lust for spoils and the sheer thrill of killing, rebels chopped
off the limbs of thousands of civilians, kidnapped children to
serve as ammunition bearers and front-line fighters, put whole
villages to the torch, and drove nearly a million people _ a fifth
of the population _ from their gutted homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this violence-racked nation, where a peace, of sorts,
has finally descended, that Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright began a six-nation African tour on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The end to the savagery came at a price: The government had to
grant the perpetrators not only amnesty but a share of political
power and control over the nation's mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   As Sierra Leoneans swallow this bitter pill, Albright arrived
here in the capital Monday to show that the United States cares
about Africa. In her weeklong tour of the world's most troubled
continent, Albright will also travel to Nigeria, Guinea, Mali,
Kenya, and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stopover here will last only a few hours, it is
still more attention than the brutalized and impoverished nation of
5 million people has typically received from the West during its
long nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped in to defend Albanians being driven out of Kosovo,''
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy to
Africa, said at a Freetown news conference earlier this year. ``But
Africans have to defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone is famed for its wealth of diamonds. These days,
however, the national symbol might as well be the raw stump of an
arm or a severed hand flopping to the red mud. Hideous things
happened here.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitation camps for amputees are overflowing with victims
of machete- and ax-wielding rebels whose sadism, especially over
the past two years, far surpassed the usual savageries of a bush
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an organized campaign of terror,'' said Corinne
Dufka, a Freetown-based researcher for Human Rights Watch and
author of a detailed report on the terror. ``Instead of just
killing, they hacked off arms to show their power over people. The
atrocities were methodical and deliberate.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, those who wreaked that horror are swaggering back to the
capital to claim their economic and political reward for stopping
the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   For the peace of Sierra Leone is the devil's peace, a desperate
UN-brokered deal that essentially grants amnesty to leaders and
followers of the Revolutionary United Front _ a ragtag movement of
no discernible ideology _ and guarantees them jobs, positions of
influence, and other boons in exchange for an end to violence.
There's even talk of granting pensions to the now idle but still
heavily armed guerrilla ``liberationists,'' many of whom fought
under such noms de guerre as Captain Crazy Cool and Dr. Blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect situation, but it was the best agreement
under the circumstances,'' said Francis Okelo, United Nations
special envoy to Sierra Leone. ``At least there is an end to the
fighting. At least the country can breathe again.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, with no Western power willing to take direct
action in ending the bloodshed, it seemed the best deal possible
for President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, one of the few democratically
elected leaders of an African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah defends the accord. ``After so much pain, suffering, and
destruction, what has been achieved from the peace agreement should
not be measured only in terms of what . . . has been given away to
the rebels,'' he told Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as billions of dollars of Western aid flow to Kosovo,
and as an international military contingent rides to the rescue of
Indonesia's East Timor, only a modest trickle of assistance is
reaching Sierra Leone. Aside from a few dozen UN observers and a
request for a broader international force from UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan, no peacekeeping force has been dispatched there,
although private relief agencies from the United States and Europe
are on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   By the grim standards of Africa, the death toll of Sierra
Leone's civil war is not especially remarkable: an estimated 50,000
civilians and combatants killed in a series of revolts, coups, and
counter-coups since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But few conflicts of this decade can match the Sierra Leone war
for gruesomeness, with rebels led by former Army Corporal Fodaj
Sankoh adopting amputation as their terror trademark. Thousands of
men, women, and children had their limbs cut off by rebels as a
sort of calling card _ ``double upper-limb amputation,'' the
removal of both arms, was a macabre specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Angola, in Cambodia, in most places of war, you will of
course find many, many people who have lost limbs, usually legs or
feet to land mines,'' said Alexis Randin, a prosthetics specialist
with Handicap International, a French aid organization. ``But only
Sierra Leone has these terrible numbers of upper limb amputations.
It's shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Even three months after the halt of hostilities, surgeons from
the aid group Doctors Without Borders spend long shifts in the
tents of the War Wounded Camp _ a settlement set in a former
tropical resort studded with palm trees _ tending dangerously
infected stumps or, too often, removing the remainder of arms that
refuse to heal. Almost all victims are civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A Human Rights Watch report prepared by Dufka _ a war
photographer for Reuters news service before joining the New
York-based watchdog agency _ documents how rebels high on cocaine,
in a January attack on Freetown, burned people alive, abducted
children to serve the militias, gang-raped women and girls, and
removed hands and arms with practiced machete blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebel who cut my hands had a white T-shirt with `Captain 2
Hands' written in what looked like blood,'' recounted a 42-year-old
man named Osman. ``My 4-year-old son was screaming, `Don't cut off
my papa's hands.' But they did it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   On the UN's index of human development, Sierra Leone ranks last
_ the worst place on earth. Nonetheless, the country managed
democratic elections in 1996, although President Kabbah was
overthrown in a 1997 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a Nigerian-led West African force, Kabbah was restored
to office in 1998, while the junta, led by Major Johnny Paul
Koroma, fled to form another rebel faction.
</P>
<P>
   But Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front kept Sierra Leone in
such bloody turmoil that Kabbah earlier this year yielded to quiet
US and British pressure to accept a deal described as ``peace at
any cost'' _ one granting the rebels amnesty for war crimes,
positions of power in government, status as a political party, and
effective control over the country's diamond fields and other
mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told we must forgive these war criminals for what they
did,'' said Muctarr Birma, 30, whose left arm was chopped off at
the elbow last January. ``That is very hard because we would prefer
justice. But the world turns its face from Sierra Leone. We have no
choice.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most mornings, Bob Spina Jr. is up by 5 and out the door before
his wife and three daughters are awake. It is still dark, but he
gets in a 15-mile run, a 60-mile bike ride or a swim before most of
his neighbors in Massapequa, N.Y., are putting filters in their
coffee makers.
</P>
<P>
   He is back in time to help get the girls ready for school and
give his wife, Lori, time to take her own five- or six-mile run.
Then it's off to work, as a real-estate and estate lawyer. But the
day's workouts are not done: after all, as Spina says, training for
an Ironman triathlon _ a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a
26.2-mile run _ is a job in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give up things,'' said Spina, 36, who is in his sixth
triathlon season and plans to compete in the Ironman World
Championships in Hawaii on Saturday. His training regimen takes 20
to 25 hours a week. ``Golf went first,'' he said. ``I haven't
played basketball in three years. I had to make the choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with a commitment to regular exercise knows that
sticking to it requires motivation and discipline. But
increasingly, amateur athletes and the people who train them are
borrowing a tool from the workplace, time management, to plan and
keep to a schedule that works for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a client comes to me and says, `I want to work out every
day; what do I do?''' said Cheryl Richardson, a personal coach near
Boston and the author of ``Take Time for Your Life'' (Broadway
Books, 1998), ``I tell them that we need to make a list of the top
10 things that are draining their energy'' _ a messy office,
dealing with their children's teachers, or anything else they have
been putting off _ and ``then let's take the next 30 days and clear
off your plate and prepare your life so you can succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she asks her clients to figure out what type of person they
are. ``Are you a morning person or a midafternoon person or a night
person?'' she said. ``Do you prefer to work out alone? Do you like
taking exercise classes? Do you need variety?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I tell them to take out a calendar, and for the next six
months let's figure out when you're going to work out five days a
week or three days a week, and write it in there _ in pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Weisman, 43, has her workouts scheduled for every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, without fail. In January, when her
daughter Hope was 3 months old, she joined Brad Schoenfeld's
Personal Training Center for Women in Scarsdale, N.Y., which
provides one-on-one regimens with personal trainers. She has lost
about 20 pounds and says she feels better all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to be motivated,'' said Ms. Weisman, who has a
20-year-old son in college. ``With the baby, it's very easy to put
exercise last. But now I make it part of my day _ like on Mondays,
I know I go food shopping, then I go work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, author of the book ``Sculpting Her Body Perfect''
(Human Kinetics), which comes out later this month, says the
professional women who work out at his center schedule their
workouts around their jobs and family obligations. ``Most women do
it before work, from about 7 to 9 a.m.,'' he said. ``Housewives can
come whenever they want, but they also have to manage it into their
day. Many of them have to get a baby sitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Many gyms have day care rooms for parents who have to bring
their children, but Ms. Weisman, who lives in Larchmont, N.Y., says
she still keeps her daughter with her during workouts because she
does not yet crawl around much. And on days she does not go to
Schoenfeld's center, she said, she manages to do some other type of
workout, and she always does it with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Hope for a walk or I can take her on the bike,'' she
said. ``As you get older, it gets harder and harder. I was a young
mother, but now that I'm older I want to be able to do everything
with her that I could do with my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people even manage to make their workouts part of their
work. ``It's an extension of how I live,'' said Ms. Richardson, the
personal coach near Boston. ``I wrote the last chapter of my book
when I was on a 15-mile bike ride with a hand-held tape recorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Page, 54, the former Minnesota Vikings star who is now a
justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, has been making exercise
part of his routine for 20 years. He says he rises at 5:15 every
morning with his wife, Diane, and they run six to eight miles
together _ no matter what the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The key is exercising first thing in the morning, he said,
adding: ``Then it's not a matter of fitting it in. It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   And it helps, he said, to have friends along. ``Some come by our
house, others meet us,'' he said. ``There's no plan or rhyme or
reason to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson agrees that working out with friends is an
excellent way to stay dedicated to an exercise program. ``Find a
partner and do it with a partner,'' she said. ``Every morning, meet
someone at the track. It's an opportunity to nurture a friendship
and get exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hardest part is balancing job, family and the need to
spend hours exercising. ``It's a constant struggle,'' said Spina,
the lawyer training for the Hawaii Ironman. ``What's the right
thing to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``The sacrifice is there not only from me, but from the whole
family,'' Spina said. ``It's a commitment for the whole family _
even the kids are on board.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final 10 to 12 weeks before an Ironman competition, he
picks the workouts over going home. But, he said, his family
understands, because it is only short term. The rest of the year,
he added, his family comes first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an imaginary line that you can't cross or the family
part of your life falls apart,'' he said, ``and I've seen it happen
to other people. You have to be careful. You have to juggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson says you have to set up your workout program _
whether it is five times a week or three times a week _ so that you
succeed. ``If you're going to work out at lunch, run for 20 or 30
minutes, don't schedule an hour run,'' she said. ``If you have to
squeeze it in, the chances of blowing it off are greater.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no right way or wrong way to work out, she said _ it
needs to be your way. ``Once you clear your plate,'' she said,
``you can begin to succeed, and then build on that success.''

&HT;        LITTLETON CONGRESSMAN TALKS HEART TO HEART ON COLUMBINE
LESSONS LEARNED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Tania Anderson  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 -- On a recent trip to Russia, Tom Tancredo
was introduced as the congressman from Littleton, the man who
represents the city where the worst school shooting in history took
place.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the first-term Republican lawmaker knew that the
incident had changed his life - and his role as a lawmaker. And on
the six-month anniversary of the school shooting in Littleton,
Tancredo's role on Capitol Hill continues to develop.
</P>
<P>
   No longer simply the congressman from Colorado's 6th district,
Tancredo, after Littleton, looked at his grandson differently. He
wondered what kind of role he should play in the three-year-old's
life. And the incident made him reflect on his role as a parent to
his own adult children.
</P>
<P>
   ``How good a parent was I just because our kids never picked up
a gun and went to school and shot anybody? Am I satisfied that we
gave them a good solid moral underpinning?'' Tancredo said recently
in his Washington office. ``You realize that there are such
enormously powerful influences that sometimes conflict with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tancredo, who lives less than a mile from Columbine, was
watching CNN on April 20 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on
a shooting rampage. The immediate feeling of helplessness and
frustration swept Tancredo as the words ``Columbine High School,
Littleton, Colorado'' were stripped across the bottom of the
television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost surreal in that you can't believe you're seeing
that,'' Tancredo said. ``It took a while just to sink in and then
you begin to pray that this is going to end without loss of life or
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he lives so close to the school, Tancredo did not
know any of the victims or the families of the shooters. Tancredo's
first response was to call local sheriff's departments to find out
details. He was originally told that the death toll had reached 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like there was nothing you could do to address the pain
that so many of your neighbors and constituents were
experiencing,'' Tancredo said. ``How do you make it better? That's
really it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first test of the shooting's influence on Tancredo came this
summer when the U.S. House of Representatives voted on the juvenile
justice bill that would require background checks at gun shows,
child safety locks on handguns, and ban importation of large
capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Although he received more than $10,000 in campaign contributions
from gun rights groups - the highest amount of the three Colorado
congressmen who receive gun rights contributions - Tancredo voted
in favor of all three measures. However, the entire bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that he would have voted against the legislation if
the school shooting had never happened. And he said he would have
never fought for federal funding for school safety hotlines, a
program launched in August. His role as the congressman from
Littleton additionally got him appointed to a congressional
committee on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have never spent months to implement such a thing in
Colorado if it had not been for Columbine,'' Tancredo said.
``Certainly I am doing things today that I would not have done
otherwise.''

<P>
   Until about three years ago, Dawn Bosquez, a 30-year-old
resident of Denver, was getting most of her medical care for asthma
in emergency rooms. About once a month, she would wake up unable to
breathe and would frantically call an ambulance or friend to rush
her to the hospital, where she would be given oxygen and inhaled
medications to bring the attack under control.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a doctor would prescribe a short course or ``burst'' of
prednisone tablets, a powerful corticosteroid drug, to ease the
inflammation in her lungs that was bringing on the attacks.
Corticosteroid inhalers were recommended, too, but Ms. Bosquez
tended to try them and then quit. For a few weeks she would feel
better. But then, as the prednisone wore off, the cycle of
breathlessness would begin again.
</P>
<P>
   At one point she was referred to a specialist, but she found him
coldhearted, ignored his advice and never went back.
</P>
<P>
   She began to suffer side effects from all the prednisone: she
put on weight, and a hump grew on the back of her neck. And after
one particularly harrowing night in the emergency room, a doctor
who had pulled her through several crises told her that if she did
not get her asthma under control, it might kill her.
</P>
<P>
   At the doctor's urging, Ms. Bosquez made an appointment with Dr.
Esther Langmack at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center
in Denver, a leading asthma hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since that visit, Ms. Bosquez has not been
back to the emergency room. Daily use of inhaled medicines has kept
her so healthy that she has needed prednisone only once. The ugly
bulge on her neck has disappeared. And she has learned to manage
her children's asthma, along with her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority of people with asthma, the proper use of
medication, education and self-management can go a long way to keep
them out of the emergency room and keep them where they want to be,
at school or work,'' Dr. Langmack said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bosquez said: ``I knew I had asthma. I was born with it. It
runs real strong through my family. But I didn't know what I could
do about it. Nobody ever taught me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, she is trying to talk her brother into seeing Dr.
Langmack, too, because his asthma is nearly as bad as hers used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   There are many patients like Ms. Bosquez, doctors say: people
who spend much of their time wheezing and hacking, always on the
threshold of the emergency room, not realizing life does not have
to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   For most patients, the key to living with asthma is accepting
that it is a chronic disease, often lifelong, that must be treated
with daily doses of medication, even when the patient is feeling
fine. Asthma attacks are a symptom of lung inflammation, and simply
treating the attacks does not help that underlying condition, any
more than taking aspirin for a toothache will fix the cavity that
is causing the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Because asthma is often brought on by allergies to molds,
pollens, animal dander, dust, dust mites and other airborne
``triggers,'' most patients are urged to keep their homes as free
of irritants as possible. That usually means getting rid of carpets
and other dust collectors, enclosing mattress and pillows in
special covers and banishing cats, dogs, birds and other
warm-blooded pets, if not from the home entirely, at least from the
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   For many patients, sinus problems and respiratory infections
like colds and flu are important triggers of attacks, and patients
with asthma are taught to track their symptoms carefully when they
are ill so that they can take extra medicine to prevent a crisis.
They are also urged to get a flu shot every year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Adkinson, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins
asthma and allergy center in Baltimore, said: ``From the point of
view of coping, there are two major groups that have the most
difficulty. One is children, with asthma severe enough to interrupt
their normal lives. They have ongoing attacks, middle-of-the-night
emergency room visits, a lot of time out of school, and it becomes
so unpredictable that the family feels out of control and, indeed,
things are out of control. They need a comprehensive management
program to restore the child to the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   The other patients who have trouble coping, Adkinson said, are
people who develop asthma after the age of 30, more often women
than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical of many diseases that hit people in midlife who were
otherwise healthy, they start out with a lot of denial,'' Adkinson
said. ``They think it's not asthma, they put off care and don't
listen to what they're told. They're often psychologically not
prepared to accept a diagnosis of a disease they're going to have
to cope with for the rest of their lives. We have to get them to
recognize it. We have great drugs that can control asthma and
maintain a high quality of life in the vast majority of patients,
probably 95 percent or more. But despite that good prognosis, this
middle-aged group often takes a number of years to settle into a
regimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for asthma, like that for any chronic disease, works
best when it is individualized for each patient.
</P>
<P>
   To help Ms. Bosquez, Dr. Langmack said: ``I ended up doing
several things. One was good education about asthma, which she'd
never had. I also started her on a high-potency inhaled
corticosteroid.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dr. Langmack prescribed Serevent, a drug with
long-lasting effects that opens the airways and is used to help
prevent attacks in some patients, like Ms. Bosquez, with severe
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bosquez also learned how to use a peak-flow meter, a device
that patients blow into to determine how well their lungs are
functioning. When asthma is worsening, the peak flow often
decreases before the patient notices any symptoms, and can be a
signal that more preventive medication is needed to head off
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also addressed two other problems,'' Dr. Langmack said,
explaining that Ms. Bosquez had sinus and digestive disorders that
aggravated her asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic sinus problems are a frequent trigger of asthma attacks.
Ms. Bosquez's sinus infections were treated with antibiotics, and
she was taught a technique for rinsing mucus and other secretions
out of her nasal passages. And because her sinuses were also
chronically inflamed, Dr. Langmack prescribed a corticosteroid nose
spray.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem that Dr. Langmack treated Ms. Bosquez for was
gastroesophageal reflux, a condition like heartburn in which
stomach acid backs up into the throat and can irritate the airways
and touch off asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawn has done really well,'' Dr. Langmack said. ``I credit her
with learning about her asthma and how to look for symptoms and
when to call us. But not everybody's like that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some patients do everything they are told to do, and still their
asthma rages out of control and responds only to oral steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, they're relatively rare among asthmatics,'' Dr.
Langmack said. ``But they are the folks who run up huge medical
costs for themselves and nationally for the entire country. They
are a focus of research here. What is it about these people that
makes their asthma so difficult to control?''
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, both adults and children who wind up in the
emergency room because of asthma are there because they have not
been using preventive medicines or peak flow meters, or keeping
track of their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In a small study at the National Jewish hospital, researchers
found that children, even those supervised by parents, used their
steroid inhalers far less than they were told to use them. Their
average use was 58 percent of what was prescribed, and among those
who had the worst flare-ups, the average use was only 14 percent.
And yet all the families had passed a quiz indicating they had a
basic understanding of asthma management.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers knew how much medication had been used because,
unbeknownst to the families, they had attached monitoring devices
to the patients' inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to skipping their medicine, both the patients and
their parents failed to tell the truth in records they were asked
to keep. More than 90 percent of them exaggerated how much
medication they had used.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Bruce Bender, an author of the study and head of the
division of pediatric behavioral health, said it was not fair to
blame the patient. ``Asthma takes a lot of work,'' he said. ``You
have to take daily medication, at fixed intervals, and sometimes in
response to changes in symptoms. And inhalers are fundamentally
unpleasant devices. Many patients have at least two inhalers that
have to be taken at different times. The more you ask patients to
do, the less they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, many patients and families do not get the proper
guidance. ``They're just handed a prescription and told to use it,
without an in-depth explanation of the disease,'' Bender said.
``You can hardly expect them to take it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   When asthma goes out of control, Bender said, doctors should
consider the possibility that the patient is just not taking enough
medicine, and not admitting it.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, doctors should ask patients whether they are
using their medication ``in a nonthreatening way so that they'll be
open and honest instead of telling you the answer they think you
want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who do understand the disease may harbor stubborn
attitudes that are hard to overcome. ``People think you should take
as little medicine as you need, and if you feel OK, you should
stop,'' Bender said. ``But we're treating asthma asymptomatically.
Your airways can have inflammation even when you feel fine.'' Then
suddenly, he said, it can flare up.
</P>
<P>
   Flare-ups tend to be milder in people who use corticosteroid
inhalers, but, he said, some patients hesitate, for fear of side
effects from the steroids.
</P>
<P>
   It is also human nature for people to deny illness. ``There is a
desire to not see yourself as sick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives commonly report that patients with asthma,
in between coughs and wheezes, will insist that they are just fine
and do not need their inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What to the rest of us would be very uncomfortable, they get
used to,'' Bender said. ``Some obstruction, some coughing, that's
daily life. It's normal to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to break through misconceptions and denial is for
patients to find doctors that they like and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are more likely to be adherent if they have one of
those Marcus Welby kind of doctors who takes the time to listen and
talk and explain,'' Bender said. ``But doctors are under great
pressure to see more patients in less time. They don't have time to
sit and talk to patients. Are we undermining the relationship in a
way that will make patients less adherent and more likely to get
sick and wind up in the hospital?''
</P>
<P>
   Medications that are easy to use can go a long way toward
getting people to follow their doctors' orders. Pills like Accolate
and Singulaire, which help to ease inflammation and are not
steroids, are becoming popular with patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have evidence that they control bad asthma as well as
the steroids,'' Bender said. ``But from the evidence so far,
patients are more willing to take them. We still have to come back
and ask the behavioral question: Is it better to give people the
best medicine, if they won't take it? Or should we give them a
medicine that is slightly less effective, but easier to take? It's
the question of the millennium.''

NEW TREATMENTS FOR ASTHMA HAVE BEEN SLOW IN COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the seemingly endless rise in asthma cases, new
treatments for the disease have been noticeably slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two years, for example, three new drugs have
been released to treat migraines, with another due in the spring.
But for asthma, which accounts for more pediatric hospitalizations
each year than any other illness, only two significant drugs were
approved in the same period, Accolate by Astra-Zeneca and Singulair
from Merck.
</P>
<P>
   These drugs, taken as pills, address the chief problem with
asthma treatments: the sheer inconvenience of juggling multiple
inhalers and other medications. But the new pills have not been
proved to be as effective as the inhaled corticosteroids that are
part of standard asthma treatment. Nor do they eliminate the need
to carry special inhaled drugs for asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma therefore offers an enormous potential bonanza for
pharmaceutical companies. Worldwide sales of asthma drugs should
top $7 billion this year and swell 74 percent by 2003 to $12.2
billion, according to Wall Street analysts. Analysts say that any
new treatment that eliminates the need for multiple inhalers could
easily reap more than $2 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, asthma is the only disease category we cover where
the death rate is rising,'' said Ian Sanderson, a managing director
at S.G. Cowen Securities. ``That proves that the disease is not
being treated properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamie Bryan, for one, sees room for improvement. Ms. Bryan, a
music teacher in Bellview, Neb., gets up half an hour earlier than
she normally would each day just to supervise her children's asthma
treatments. Her three children, ages 9 to 13, take 10 medications
among them, including six inhalers and four types of pills. Even
with insurance, her pharmacy bill is more than $1,500 each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my younger children, this is far too much medication for
them to deal with,'' Ms. Bryan said. ``It would be better if the
medication were more convenient to take. Most of this isn't put
this in your mouth and swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and health officials say advances in medications have
been hindered by the complexity of the disease, as well as the
legacy of misconceptions about it. In a theory that now seems
laughable, scientists once thought asthma was a psychological
illness. Only in recent decades have doctors started to recognize
it as a chronic inflammation of the lungs, which requires daily
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology in the 1950s and the 1960s wasn't very good,''
said Dr. Linda Ford, an allergist in Omaha, Neb., and the past
president of the American Lung Association. ``We didn't know
anything about allergic antibodies.'' Now, she said, ``We know that
90 percent of asthma is allergic by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries have led to more effective asthma drugs, like
the inhaled corticosteroids that are ``still the gold standard in
asthma treatment,'' Dr. Ford said. Since 1991, the National
Institutes of Health has stressed their use to reduce inflammation
in the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But the inhaled steroids are cumbersome and carry potential side
effects. Other new drugs have limited benefits. The national
institutes recently recommended that long-acting drugs called beta
agonists (like Serevent by Glaxo-Wellcome or Foradil by Novartis)
be given along with inhaled steroids to help prevent a sudden
narrowing of the airways known as a bronchospasm. But if used
alone, some doctors warn, the beta agonists can prevent someone
from realizing his condition is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these drugs, like inhaled steroids, work well with
asthma,'' said Dr. Michael McDermott, the attending physician for
adult emergency services at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. ``But
with a lot of these drugs, people are just casting about with
chemicals. Until there's a real breakthrough, most of the new
treatments are just hustles for the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The drugs that have caused the most excitement in recent years
are Accolate and Singulair, part of a new class of drugs called
leukotriene modifiers. Regarded by some scientists as breakthrough
therapies, these drugs block leukotrienes, chemicals that can
trigger asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   When Acculate and Singulair were introduced, doctors and drug
industry analysts believed they would become popular alternatives
to inhaled corticosteroids. As pills, Acculate and Singulair can
easily be swallowed, and Singulair even comes as a chewable tablet
for children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the health institutes give these pills only limited
support. The leukotriene modifiers can be considered as an
alternative therapy to low doses of inhaled corticosteroids in mild
asthma cases, NIH guidelines say, adding that more studies are
needed ``to establish their roles in asthma therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Astra-Zeneca and Merck have promoted their asthma medications
aggressively, with big dividends. Singulair's sales are projected
to swell 320 percent from some $500 million this year to $2.1
billion in 2003, according to S.G. Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   Several other new drugs are expected to be very popular with
asthma sufferers. Glaxo-Wellcome filed a new drug application in
March for Advair Diskus, an inhaler that combines a long-acting
bronchodilator with a corticosteroid. Company officials say the
Advair Diskus, which is still awaiting approval, would simplify the
asthma drug regimen for patients who use numerous inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also have hopes for several drugs in the early
stages of development. SmithKline Beecham is experimenting with a
drug that inhibits phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme known to cause
inflammation. The company's drug, Ariflo, is in early stages of
testing for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are testing inhaled medications that they hope
will eliminate the need for daily doses of inhaled steroids.
Immunex Corp. of Seattle is developing Nuvance, a compound that
blocks interleukin-4, a chemical that is released as part of the
body's normal immune response and is present at high levels in the
lungs of people with asthma. Blocking interleukin-4, researchers
theorize, will reduce asthma symptoms. If Nuvance eventually wins
approval, the company said, it will be given as an inhaler used
only once a week.
</P>
<P>
   The interleukin blockers are not expected to reach the market
for several more years, but doctors hope that a similar compound,
E25, may be introduced in 2001. Developed by Novartis and
Genentech, E25 neutralizes a chemical that is a cause of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're testing the drug on severe and moderate
asthma patients,'' said Jorg Reinhardt, head of pharmaceutical
development for Novartis. ``People will use it once or twice per
month, but they may have to still use an inhaled steroid or beta
agonist.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that new asthma treatments are so infrequent, it should
come as no shock that E25 would sell at top dollar. Analysts
estimate that a one-year treatment of the drug will cost around
$10,000, making it one of the most expensive medicines available.

ON LANGUAGE: STAKE IN THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, Oct. 24.) 
(EDS: Items in boldface should be set in italics.) 
(th) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stiffen those linguistic sinews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is important to  &UR; put &LR;   &UR; a &LR;   &UR; stake &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR; 
 &UR; ground &LR; ,'' said Gov. George W. Bush, ``and to say, `Enough is
enough,' when it comes to trying to dig up people's backgrounds in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years before, a Democratic candidate, Paul Tsongas, used
the same metaphor of determination in a Des Moines speech: ``The
Iowa caucuses are an integral part of any sense of American
politics, and I intend to  &UR; put &LR;   &UR; my &LR;   &UR; stake in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; 
here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a metaphor of determination, with a Western flavor. It
is rooted in, or has a stake firmly planted in, the laying of a
claim to a piece of territory, owned by nobody, for mining or farm
use. The rush for land after the Civil War popularized the phrase
(along with  &UR; doing &LR;   &UR; a &LR;   &UR; land-office &LR;   &UR; business &LR; ). The stakes
driven in the ground were the markers used to post the boundaries
of a homestead; this led to another phrase,  &UR; to &LR;   &UR; pull &LR;   &UR; up &LR; 
 &UR; stakes &LR; , which means ``to move on'' to greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   George Dubyuh's use of  &UR; stake &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR;  immediately
called to mind a similar trope called up by his father, President
Bush, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990: ``A  &UR; line &LR;   &UR; has &LR; 
 &UR; been &LR;   &UR; drawn &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; sand &LR; .'' This expression may have
stemmed from the circle drawn in the sand around the Syrian King
Antiochus Epiphanes in 168 B.C. by the Roman envoy Popilius Laenas,
who ordered the king to agree to withdraw his forces from
Alexandria before he could step out of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   It is very unlikely that President Bush had this episode in
mind. Despite the elder Bush's passive construction, the phrase
evoked the Alamo legend, in which William Barret Travis, besieged
by a Mexican army, used his sword to draw a line in the ground (or
sand), saying, ``Those prepared to die for freedom's cause, come
across to me.'' One hundred eighty-nine did, and died. The
president's son, George W., in a fund-raising letter opposing Ann
Richards' election as governor of Texas in 1990, wrote, ``When Col.
Travis drew the  &UR; line &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; sand &LR;  at the Alamo, he
discovered immediately who had the courage to stand and fight for
the Texas Republic.'' Three weeks later, President Bush used that
metaphor challenging Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   As a new political campaign approaches, metaphors of intestinal
fortitude, or gutsiness _ cool, courageous determination _ will be
at a premium. Not all are suitable in making the antiflinching
point; for example,  &UR; stick &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; your guns &LR; , first used in 1881 as
a variant of  &UR; stand &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; your &LR;   &UR; guns &LR; , might backfire on a
proponent of gun control.  &UR; Stand &LR;   &UR; your &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; , however, has a
stalwart image, especially because it was extended beyond military
use in ``On Liberty'' by John Stuart Mill in 1859: ``It is not easy
to see how it (individuality) can  &UR; stand &LR;   &UR; its &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; .'' (A
similar construction, the 17th-century  &UR; stand &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; one's
pan-pudding &LR; , never caught on in America and is unlikely to be
recommended by political debate consultants.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hold &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; line &LR; , however, has a nice connotation of military
firmness with an overlay of college-football bravado. It is the
same symbolic line as that  &UR; drawn &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; sand &LR; , as if between
 &UR; two &LR;   &UR; stakes &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; . The related  &UR; hold &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; fort &LR; 
suggests that someone else act with fortitude until aid arrives; it
is derived from a message that Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman of the
Union Army sent to the garrison at Allatoona, Ga., in 1864:
`` &UR; Hold &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; fort &LR; , for I am coming.'' They then  &UR; drew &LR;   &UR; a &LR; 
 &UR; line &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the sand &LR; ,  &UR; put &LR;   &UR; their &LR;   &UR; stakes &LR;   &UR; in &LR;   &UR; the &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; 
and  &UR; stood &LR;   &UR; to &LR;   &UR; their &LR;   &UR; pan-pudding &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of all the above is  &UR; to &LR;   &UR; shift &LR;   &UR; one's &LR;   &UR; ground &LR; ,
sometimes a necessary maneuver but inviting the derogation
 &UR; shifty &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NUTRACEUTICALS
</P>
<P>
   A spelling controversy is about to explode about the word that
means ``a food or part of a food that has a medical or health
benefit, including the prevention and treatment of disease.'' Plain
bread supplemented with calcium, vitamin D, folate, dietary fiber
and a shot of St. Johnswort or whatever becomes a  &UR; nutraceutical &LR; ,
unless you prefer to spell it  &UR; nutriceutical &LR; , with an  &UR; i &LR; , as in
 &UR; nutrition &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   I checked it out with the coiner, Dr. Stephen L. DeFelice, now
the head of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine. His
spokesman explained that the 1989 coinage is spelled  &UR; nutra &LR; , with
an  &UR; a &LR; , on the analogy of  &UR; pharmaceutical &LR; , with its Greek root
 &UR; pharmak &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Reached directly, however, DeFelice said, ``To tell you the
truth, I was drinking grappa in Rome one day and  &UR; nutra &LR;  sounded
better than  &UR; nutri &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That asserts ``coiner's privilege,'' and the enhanced, enriched,
jazzed-up food _ as both noun and adjective _ is spelled
 &UR; nutraceutical &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   PHLOGGING IT
</P>
<P>
   ``The real writer is one/who really writes,'' writes the poet
Marge Piercy. ``Talent/is an invention like phlogiston/after the
fact of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fooling With Words: A Celebration of Poets and Their
Craft,'' the TV documentarian Bill Moyers, quoting this poem, asked
the author about the meaning of the unfamiliar word  &UR; phlogiston &LR; .

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people know that the Roman Catholic Church once waged a
long and bitter war on science, and on astronomy in particular. But
that seemingly well-established fact of history, it turns out, is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that the church condemned Galileo, new research
shows that centuries of oversimplifications have concealed how hard
Rome worked to amass astronomical tools, measurements, tests and
lore.
</P>
<P>
   In its scientific zeal, the church adapted cathedrals across
Europe, and a tower at the Vatican itself, so their darkened vaults
could serve as solar observatories. Beams of sunlight that fell
past religious art and marble columns not only inspired the
faithful but provided astronomers with information about the Sun,
the Earth and their celestial relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, solar images projected on cathedral floors
disclosed the passage of dark spots across the Sun's face, a
blemish of change in heavens that theologians once thought to be
without flaw.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``The Sun in the Church'' (Harvard, 1999), Dr.
John L. Heilbron, a historian of science, reveals the remarkable
ubuiquity of the solar observatories, which were little known to
modern scholars. And he shows that the church was not necessarily
seeking knowledge for knowledge's sake, a traditional aim of pure
science.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, like many patrons, it wanted something practical in
return for its investments: mainly the improvement of the calendar
so church officials could more accurately establish the date of
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   When to celebrate the feast of Christ's resurrection had become
a bureaucratic crisis within the church. Traditionally, Easter fell
on the Sunday after the first full moon of spring. But by the 12th
century, the usual ways of predicting that date had gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   To set a date for Easter Sunday years in advance, and thus
reinforce the church's power and unity, popes and ecclesiastical
officials had for centuries relied on astronomers, who pondered
over old manuscripts and devised instruments that set them at the
forefront of the scientific revolution.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heilbron, the church ``gave more financial and
social support to the study of astronomy for over six centuries,
from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages
into the Enlightenment, than any other, and probably, all other,
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Heilbron, 65, is professor emeritus and vice chancellor emeritus
at the University of California at Berkeley and a senior fellow at
Worcester College, Oxford, England. He lives in England and travels
widely to study old solar observatories.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Heilbron said he was
astonished by the old instruments, which he first saw eight years
ago in Bologna, Italy, at the Basilica of San Petronio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church itself was beautiful, somber,'' Heilbron recalled.
``When the sun crawled across that floor, there was nothing else.
That's what you had to look at. It was intense.''
</P>
<P>
   After discovering that other churches throughout Europe had
solar observatories, he produced a book rich in old drawings,
equations, geometrical figures and astronomical lore.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Owen Gingerich, a historian in Cambridge, Mass., at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, praised the work as
re-creating a lost world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important piece of scholarship,'' Gingerich said.
</P>
<P>
   In the book and an article in The Sciences, a journal of the New
York Academy of Sciences, Heilbron shows that the observatory
findings (usually made in sight of a cathedral altar) often
contradicted church dogma of that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuits, for instance, used the observatories to confirm
theories about the movement of the Earth that they were forbidden
to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, Heilbron said, observatories were built in
cathedrals and churches throughout Europe, including Rome, Paris,
Milan, Florence, Bologna, Palermo, Brussels and Antwerp. Typically,
the buildings, which were dark inside, needed only a small hole in
the roof to allow a beam of sunlight to strike the floor below,
producing a clear image of the solar disk. In effect, the church
had been turned into a pinhole camera, in which light passes
through a small hole into a darkened interior, forming an image on
the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   On each sunny day, the solar image would sweep across the church
floor and, exactly at noon, cross a long metal rod that was the
observatory's most important and precise part. The noon crossings
over the course of a year would reach the line's extremities _ the
summer and winter solstices, when the Sun is farthest north and
south of the Equator. The circuit, among other things, could be
used to measure the year's duration with great precision.
</P>
<P>
   The path on the floor was known as a meridian line, like the
north-south meridians of geographers. The rod, in keeping with its
setting and duties, was often surrounded by rich tile inlays and
zodiacal motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments lost much of their astronomical value around the
middle of the 18th century because of advancements in the
telescope. But, as Heilbron writes, the observatories still played
a significant role because the solar timepieces were often used to
correct errors in mechanical clocks and even to set time for
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   One of the observatories also impressed Charles Dickens, who in
his book ``Pictures from Italy'' wrote that he found little to like
in Bologna except ``the Church of San Petronio, where the sunbeams
mark the time among the kneeling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the surviving cathedral solar instruments are lovely
anachronisms that baffle most visitors, who are usually unaware of
their original use or historical importance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view of the Church's hostility toward science
grew out of its famous feud with Galileo, condemned to house arrest
in 1632 for astronomical heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Since antiquity, astronomers had put the Earth at the center of
planetary motions, a view the church had embraced. But Galileo,
using the new telescope, became convinced that the planets in fact
moved around the Sun, a view Nicholas Copernicus, an astronomer
from Poland, had championed.
</P>
<P>
   The censure of Galileo, at age 70, gave the church a black eye
that lasted into modern times. Pope John Paul II finally
acknowledged in 1992, 359 years later, that the church had erred in
condemning Galileo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard S. Westfall, a historian of science, in 1989 wrote
that Rome's handling of Galileo made Copernican astronomy a
forbidden topic among faithful Catholics for two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Heilbron claims. The church's support of astronomy was
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church tended to regard all the systems of the
mathematical astronomy as fictions,'' Heilbron wrote. ``That
interpretation gave Catholic writers scope to develop mathematical
and observational astronomy almost as they pleased, despite the
tough wording of the condemnation of Galileo.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, Heilbron examined four cathedrals: San Petronio
in Bologna, Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rome, Saint Sulpice in
Paris and Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   For the great Basilica of San Petronio, he showed how a solar
observatory was erected in 1576 by Egnatio Danti, a mathematician
and Dominican friar who worked for Cosimo I dei Medici, the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, and who advised Pope Gregory on calendar reform.
The church observatory produced data long before the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   By 1582, the Gregorian calendar had been established, creating
the modern year of 365 days and an occasional leap year of 366
days. Danti was rewarded with a commission to build a solar
observatory in the Vatican itself within the Torre dei Venti, or
Tower of the Winds.
</P>
<P>
   The golden age of the cathedral observatories came later,
between 1650 and 1750, Heilbron writes, and helped to disprove the
astronomical dogma that the church had defended with such militancy
in the case of Galileo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most well known of the rebel observers was Giovanni
Domenico Cassini, an Italian astronomer who gained fame for
discovering moons of Saturn and the gaps in its rings that still
bear his name, as does a $3.4 billion spacecraft now speeding
toward the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1655, Cassini persuaded the builders of the Basilica of
San Petronio that they should include a major upgrade of Danti's
old meridian line, making it larger and far more accurate, its
entry hole for daylight moved up to be some 90 feet high, atop a
lofty vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most illustrious nobles of Bologna,'' Cassini boasted in a
flier drawn up for the new observatory, ``the kingdom of astronomy
is now yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The exaggeration turned out to have some merit as Cassini used
the observatory to investigate the ``orbit'' of the Sun, quietly
suggesting that it actually stood still while the Earth moved.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini would use his observations to try to confirm the
theories of Johannes Kepler, the German astronomer who had proposed
in 1609 that the planets moved in elliptical orbits not the circles
that Copernicus had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that meant the Earth over the course of a year would
pull slightly closer and farther away from the Sun. At least in
theory, Cassini's observatory could test Kepler's idea, since the
Sun's projected disk on the cathedral floor would shrink slightly
as the distance grew and would expand as the gap lessened.
</P>
<P>
   Such an experiment could also address whether there was any
merit to the ancient system of Ptolemy, some interpretations of
which had the Earth moving around the Sun in an eccentric circular
orbit. Ptolemy's proposed changes in distances were less than
Kepler's, in theory making the two easy to distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   For the experiment to be successful, Cassini could tolerate
measurement errors no greater than 0.3 inches in the Sun's
projected face, which ranged from 5 to 33 inches wide, depending on
the time of year. No telescope of the day could achieve that
precision.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was run around 1655, and after much trial and
error, was successful. Cassini and his Jesuit allies, Heilbron
writes, confirmed Kepler's version of the Copernican theory.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1655 and 1736, astronomers used the solar observatory at
San Petronio to make 4,500 observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great topic,'' Heilbron said from Belgium, adding that
he was planning to write at least one more book on the hidden
influence of the solar observatories.

CHAMELEON COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How and why does a chameleon change its colors?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two groups of lizards commonly called chameleons,
and they change colors in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   True chameleons belong to an Old World family called
Chamaeleontidae, with two genuses and about 85 species. They have a
variety of colorations, which they can change, to a greater or
lesser extent, by concentrating or spreading out the pigmentation
in skin cells, called melanophores.
</P>
<P>
   The process is under the control of the autonomic nervous
system, and the change is not just a matter of color matching.
Rather, it is a complex response to a variety of conditions,
including light and temperature, but also ``emotional'' factors
like fear or triumph in battle with another chameleon.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Illustrated Animal Encyclopedia (Macmillan),
the strength of the light is apparently the most important factor,
and for certain species, this sometimes results in camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the flap-necked chameleon, Chamaeleo dilepis, an
African species, turns green when among leaves and yellow or
reddish-brown when on bark. However, in response to a threat, it
turns blackish-green, with yellow and white spots.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the other group sometimes called chameleons, anoles
(which are new-world relatives of the iguana in the genus Anolis),
have a limited color-change system under the control of hormones,
rather than nerves.

`FIGHTING SPIRIT' IS LITTLE HELP IN CANCER FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(th) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Optimism and a fighting attitude may help breast cancer patients
cope with their illnesses, but positive thinking is unlikely to
increase the chances of survival, according to a study by British
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, persistent hopelessness may lower a woman's
chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, which appeared in the Oct. 16 issue of The
Lancet, an international medical journal, found that of the women
who agreed with statements like ``I feel like giving up,'' only 58
percent were alive or in remission five years later, compared with
72 percent who did not report feeling hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that a ``fighting spirit'' helps cancer patients
survive longer, the researchers noted, ``has been embraced with
enthusiasm, especially by practitioners of alternative therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the results, they continued, suggest that ``such claims
should be far more cautious and circumspect.''
</P>
<P>
   A small number of women who scored high on a scale measuring
clinical depression also had an increased risk of dying within five
years, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret Watson, a consultant clinical psychologist at the
Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton, England, and the lead author of
the report, said that because a positive attitude did not seem to
prolong survival, she hoped the findings took away ``any burden of
guilt'' for women who had ``difficulty feeling positive all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for women to feel that they should go
on fighting,'' Dr. Watson said, ``but many women who have fought
will very likely have times when they don't feel like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The results indicate that doctors need to watch for signs of
depression and hopelessness in cancer patients and offer treatment,
Dr. Watson added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that something can be done about this,'' she
said. ``Doctors can be more rigorous in trying to diagnose these
emotions in their patients, and in so doing improve their quality
of life and maybe their quantity of life, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Watson and her colleagues followed 578 women with
early-stage breast cancer over a five-year period. At the end of
five years, 50 of the women had suffered a relapse and 133 had
died. The remaining 395 women remained in remission.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the study who showed a ``fighting spirit,'' as measured
by a frequently used questionnaire called the ``Mental Adjustment
to Cancer'' scale, showed no significant difference in survival
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Watson said the study, one of the largest to examine the
effect of psychological state on disease outcome, was carefully
designed ``to be credible to the cancer doctors, so it wouldn't
easily be dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also cast doubt on the idea that some people are more
likely to die of cancer because they suppress negative emotions
like anger and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the study who showed a high degree of emotional
control, indicating on questionnaires that they had trouble venting
anger or other negative emotions, were no more likely than other
patients to die or suffer a relapse within the five years.

PLASTICS FROM PLANTS  
 FROGGY'S SEX APPEAL  
 SPIDER'S SUN COMPASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to the future, plastics researchers want to say
one word to you: Plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a complex feat of genetic engineering, scientists at the
Monsanto Co. have developed a plastic-producing plant, one that may
some day help reduce the plastics industry's heavy reliance on
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic is a biodegradable one, a member of a family of
compounds called PHAs. It has long been known that PHAs are
produced by certain forms of bacteria from glucose, and some
companies have sought to develop bacterial production of these
plastics on an industrial scale. They have been deterred by high
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Monsanto scientists took the approach that since plants are
low-cost producers of natural fibers, perhaps they could also be
low-cost producers of plastic, getting the necessary carbon not
from expensive glucose but from the atmosphere. The researchers,
who described their work in the journal Nature Biotechnology, set
about trying to insert bacterial genes into two types of plants,
rape and thale cress.
</P>
<P>
   Most genetic engineering projects involve one gene; the Monsanto
work eventually involved four, and the alteration of two metabolic
pathways, for the synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids. The
results were plants that produced significant quantities of a type
of PHA called PHBV. But much work remains before such a process
could become commercially viable.

   Scientists in Australia have revealed more secrets behind the
sex lives of amphibians, discovering the first frog pheromone.
</P>
<P>
   Pheromones are chemical signals secreted by one member of a
species that induce a behavioral response in another. With sex
pheromones, which have been found in many species, the behavioral
response is this: the opposite sex is driven wild.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian scientists, from the University of Adelaide, used
very sensitive chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques to
analyze water in which they kept specimens of a type of tree frog,
Litoria splendida.
</P>
<P>
   They noticed one compound that showed up only in the male frogs'
water, secreted from glands in the head. This compound, which they
gave the wonderful name splendipherin, is produced in amounts that
are 10 times as great in breeding season as at other times of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   To test whether the chemical was a pheromone, the researchers
applied a small amount to a gauze pad and put it in the water about
three feet from a female. The results were startling: within 20
seconds, the female frog became more alert, then sat on the pad and
refused to budge.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sun compasses, which use polarized light as a direction finder,
are not unknown in the natural world. Some bees and ants have them,
though they are usually just specialized areas of the eye that is
otherwise used for sight.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists led by a Swedish zoologist has now
discovered a different kind of sun compass, in a spider. Like a
fashion model with her sunglasses pushed up onto her hair, the
spider, Drassodes cupreus, has a secondary pair of eyes on top of
its head that act as filters to determine the degree of
polarization.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary eyes are oriented roughly at right angles to each
other. Light that is polarized in one direction _ that is, the
light waves are vibrating in the same plane _ is reflected strongly
by a mirrorlike structure in the eye, while light whose plane of
polarization is rotated by 90 degrees is barely reflected at all.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, suggest that the
spider compares signals from the eyes to determine the degree of
polarization of the light, and thus the position of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The spiders' behavior seems to confirm that they use this system
to navigate. They are active mainly at dusk, when sunlight is
polarized largely in one direction, which makes it easier for the
spiders to pick up polarization cues.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frustrated by the continued spread of HIV, a growing
number of AIDS doctors are trying out an experimental treatment: an
application of drugs meant to abort infection in a person who was
recently exposed to the virus through unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Called post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, the emergency
treatment incorporates the same powerful, toxic drugs commonly
given to people with AIDS. Only in this case, the drug regimen is
initiated in the hours after suspected exposure, and months before
a blood test can verify infection.
</P>
<P>
   There is no proof that the treatment works, and few insurance
companies are likely to cover the cost, around $2,500 including 30
days of drugs, lab tests and doctors' visits. But on the basis of
successful experiments on animals and studies of transmission from
mother to child, many clinicians think it is at least plausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body of evidence now available provides pretty solid
indirect evidence that this works in preventing infection,'' said
Dr. David Henderson, a deputy director at the Warren G. Magnuson
Clinical Care Center, part of the National Institutes of Health, in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment seeks to attack the virus after it attaches to a
lymph cell but before it has a chance to burrow into the nucleus
and begin reproducing, within two to three days. The aim is to
contain and eradicate the viral invasion before it can embark on
its destructive path through the body. For this reason, the
clinicians say, prompt treatment is essential. Most clinics aim to
treat in the first few hours of a suspected exposure, and 72 hours
is considered the absolute latest.
</P>
<P>
   Round-the-clock PEP clinics have proliferated in the past 18
months, with public or nonprofit ones opening in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Boston and Providence, R.I. Patients can call at any
hour after an exposure, and be connected to a screening counselor _
who weeds out people with improbable risk behavior, like kissing _
and a doctor and all-night drugstore, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Next month in New York City, Dr. Bernard Salick plans to begin a
pilot PEP program at his for-profit clinic in New York City, the
first one based at a private practice. Even before opening, the
demand is astounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of calls we get is beyond belief,'' said Dr.
Gabriel Torres, a medical director at the practice who has been
trying the treatment on his own patients. ``I had a guy calling me
on day 2 from Albany who was driving at 90 miles an hour to get to
me in time. I kept saying, `Just pay attention to the road!'''
</P>
<P>
   It will take thousands more cases and many more years before any
conclusions can be drawn about how well, or even whether, the
method works.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how effective these medications are in a preventive
mode,'' said Dr. Michelle Roland, director of San Francisco General
Hospital's Positive Health Program, ``they are never going to be
100 percent effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, early indications are favorable. In San Francisco, a
city-run PEP clinic treats an average of one new patient a day, and
a joint study by the city and San Francisco General Hospital found
no HIV transmission among 436 sexually active patients who had
received the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly believe there is some efficacy to this, or I
wouldn't do it,'' said Dr. Joshua Bamberger, the medical director
for special projects at the San Francisco Department of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last
year that it ``cannot definitively recommend for or against'' the
treatment, citing a lack of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting area that we're all watching very
closely,'' said Dr. Robert Janssen, the deputy director of the
centers' Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Surveillance and
Epidemiology. This summer, the centers established a national
registry for doctors to report their PEP experiences. It will be
years before the data can be analyzed, Janssen said.
</P>
<P>
   The standard PEP regimen is similar to the one used for a decade
whenever a health care worker is accidentally exposed to infected
blood or needles. It used two antiretroviral drugs, AZT and 3TC,
for seven to 30 days, depending on how early the treatment is
started. Many doctors also add one of the powerful new class of
anti-HIV drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, like Sustiva or navirapine.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates are encouraged by successes in blocking HIV in other
settings. Transmission rates from mother to child have been reduced
to less than 5 percent from 25 percent with prophylactic
treatments. Retrospective studies of the thousands of health care
workers who have taken PEP suggest that such workplace treatments
are 81 percent effective in thwarting infections.
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolating from these findings, the New York state Department
of Health last year recommended that PEP be routinely prescribed in
emergency rooms to rape victims whose assailants cannot be found.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the treatment was not widely available to
people who fell into more typical risk categories: those who
engaged in unprotected intercourse with a partner known or
suspected to be HIV-positive, whether through carelessness or
condom error. These lapses are especially dangerous among gay men
in cities like New York and San Francisco, where one-third of them
harbor the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overwhelming majority of people getting PEP treatment
were never infected to begin with. HIV is not easily transmitted;
fewer than 1 percent of those exposed to the virus through rectal
or vaginal contact will become infected, and the numbers are
smaller for oral or penile contact.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects can be severe in the short term, including nausea,
headaches and hallucinations affecting three-quarters of patients,
the health institutes report. Long-term effects are believed to be
minor, as long as the drugs are taken for short periods.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts have raised some concern about PEP, which
they fear may be misconstrued as something of a morning-after
alternative, a pharmacological substitute for latex condoms and
good sense.
</P>
<P>
   Especially troublesome, they say, is the prospect that its
availability may undermine a commitment to proven prevention
methods like abstinence, needle-cleaning, and safer sex. If so, it
risks causing more transmissions than it is averting.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is little evidence that this is happening. The San
Francisco study found that 56 patients returned within a year for
another round of PEP. But Bamberger said it was clear in follow-up
interviews that their behavior had not altered because of the
availability of medication.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this fear has kept most PEP clinics from promoting their
services too widely, their directors say. Boston's Fenway Community
Health Center has treated 74 PEP patients, mostly gay men, in the
past year and a half, but has refused to advertise the program in
the community for fear of sending the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to offer the information to people who ask, but we
don't want to do social marketing,'' said Fenway's medical research
director, Dr. Ken Mayer. ``We are very concerned about the specter
of some people using lots of medication and knowingly exposing
themselves to HIV. If you rely on it as the magic bullet, a
chemical condom, people are going to get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Each PEP clinic also provides extensive counseling to patients,
capitalizing on what Mayer called an ``educable moment.
</P>
<P>
   The PEP procedure itself, with its toxic side effects, may also
help to underscore the need to return to vigilant behavior, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Dan Feldman, 30, a neuropsychology fellow
at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, in New York.
Just 36 hours after he had reason to believe he had been exposed to
HIV, his doctor put him on a 30-day PEP course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good reinforcer for staying with safe sex,''
Feldman said. ``I kept thinking, `Thank God I'm just doing it for
30 days and not the rest of my life.'''

LITTLE FEAT STILL TRYING TO FILL THE LARGE SHOES OF LOWELL GEORGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a cold night in December 1978, Little Feat played Will Rogers
Auditorium in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And played. And played. One hour, two. More. Encores.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the lights came up and the roadies began unplugging the
amps, the two universal signals for ``go home now _ show's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Only, we wouldn't go home. We cheered and we cheered, and after
a long, long time the roadies began plugging the amps back in. The
lights came back down, a huge cheer went up, and a large man in
white overalls walked up to the mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people are crazy,'' said Lowell George, and the band lit
into another half-hour or so of funky rock 'n' roll. It is one of
the sweetest rock 'n' roll memories I have.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, on June 29, 1979, George (the Feat's
founder and best guitarist, vocalist and songwriter) would be dead
in an Arlington, Va., hotel room. He was only 34, he was on his
first solo tour, in support of his first solo LP, ``Thanks, I'll
Eat It Here,'' and he died of a heart attack, at least partially
brought on by his weight and fondness for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell George got crazy, did too much of everything, played a
mean slide guitar, wrote wonderfully weird _ and sometimes
wonderfully straightforward _ songs, and left us too soon.
</P>
<P>
   And now, 20 years later, he's often overlooked altogether as one
of America's greatest rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
   George grew up in California, played oboe and saxophone on Frank
Sinatra records, started a folk-rock group called The Factory in
1965, joined Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention _ you can hear him
on Zappa's 1970 album ``Weasels Ripped My Flesh'' _ and formed the
Feat in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   It was, then, his band: He was the group's main songwriter and
lead singer, and only guitarist; here, too, he has been overlooked.
When people think of great slide players, guys like Duane Allman
and Johnny Winter come to mind: George wasn't as flashy, but he had
a touch and an ability to say a whole lot in a little space.
</P>
<P>
   And he shaped the band as a true American hybrid, combining New
Orleans funk, rock 'n' roll, soul and country into something that
was almost magical _ at least on their finest LPs, 1972's ``Sailin'
Shoes'' and '73's ``Dixie Chicken''; the title track of the latter
gave the band an enduring rock-radio staple. They were, for a while
there, a perfect rock 'n' roll band _ funny, musically thrilling,
and not quite popular enough to be truly mainstream, a cult act in
the best sense of the word. One could certainly hear touches of
Zappa _ and Captain Beefheart _ but George never sounded like
either of them.
</P>
<P>
   Within just two years, though, there were problems: Guitarist
Paul Barrere and keyboardist Bill Payne began taking the band in a
jazzier (and far less satisfying) direction; George wrote only one
song for 1977's ``Time Loves a Hero.'' And by the next year, the
rift was even more obvious. Barrere and Payne wanted to be Weather
Report (or something) and there were long stretches at the Fort
Worth show where George wasn't even onstage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad end; the band broke up in the spring of '79, George
went out on the road, and died after a sold-out solo performance in
Washington, D.C., always a Feat stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk, at the time, of his re-forming the band without
Payne and Barrere, and taking full control again. What happened
instead was far sadder: Payne and Barrere re-formed the group in
1988. And, wonder of wonders, the sound this time was an imitation
of the funky good-time rock 'n' roll of the George-led band; hey,
they knew what the fans wanted, even if they didn't used to want to
give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   And far fewer fans want it these days. The Feat ambles on, a
decent oldies act but utterly rudderless, banking on the past
glories (and, really, the sound that George was largely responsible
for) and playing clubs, such as Fort Worth's Caravan of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George's legacy slips into the shadows just a little
bit more every year. If you haven't ever heard ``Sailin' Shoes''
and ``Dixie Chicken,'' go get them. Two other good bets are the
live ``Waiting for Columbus'' and the
hits-and-rarities-and-live-versions collection ``Hoy-Hoy!'' But
whatever you get first _ or go back and listen to again _ don't
forget this man.

MUST-TAPE TV: TUESDAY HAS MORE MUST-SEE SHOWS THAN THURSDAY EVER
DID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been hearing about the breakdown of NBC's steamroller
Thursday-night lineup for a while now, the rap being that it's
tired, it's repetitive, it has outlived its brash usefulness. True,
all of it. We are far along enough in the new season to note that
although ``ER'' has returned to its blood-gushing glory, Thursday
has, as Anthony Edwards' Dr. Greene might put it, slipped into a
state of creative paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Such dismal news would otherwise prove immensely frustrating for
those of us who set aside at least one night for tube vegetation.
But there's an alternative to Thursday-night blahs: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bastion of highly rated but lackluster comedies like
``Home Improvement'' and screaming newsmagazines we simply
tolerated until 9 p.m., when you, me, everyone, clicked on ``NYPD
Blue'' and exhaled, Tuesday has become what Thursday used to be: a
night so singularly devoted to sophisticated television that the
promo slogan ``Must-See TV'' wasn't followed by a ``yeah, right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more convincing: Tuesday offers something Thursday rarely
did. Choices. Sure, I remember when a superior ``Chicago Hope'' was
opposite ``ER'' (it returned there this season), and when ABC
offered the fine alternatives ``Nothing Sacred'' and ``Cracker.''
But they turned out to be offerings for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Few venture away from NBC on Thursdays. This devotion has always
baffled me. Why viewers stayed with ``Union Square'' a few seasons
back, ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Jesse'' last season, and appear
willing to do the same this year with the new Neil Patrick Harris
series ``Stark Raving Mad'' (it drew 17 million viewers last week
to rank No. 7) would make for an interesting psychological inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the scene on Tuesday. And if my e-mails are
legitimate, this is causing the most frustration viewers have felt
since we were forced to choose among Fox's ``Costello,'' NBC's
``Encore! Encore!,'' UPN's ``Clueless'' and the off button.
</P>
<P>
   This came to mind recently after I plopped in front of the set
at 7 p.m. to catch ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' on the WB, only to
be politely reminded by the ``JAG'' fan in my household that the
engaging military drama was about to begin over on CBS. I was
already taping the still-surging sitcom ``Just Shoot Me'' on NBC,
while wondering if ABC's Heather Locklear-laden ``Spin City'' would
provide more enjoyment or whether it was worth catching the new
half-hour ``Ally,'' the funny episode in which Ally (Calista
Flockhart) attacks that woman in the supermarket over the last bag
of chips.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise one may feel during the 7 p.m. hour can't be
ascribed to that time period alone, however: The entire
Tuesday-night lineup, hour by hour, show by show, network by
network, has become a lose-lose proposition. Taping one program to
watch another still means you're missing something.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's 8 p.m. adult comedy, ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' has always prided
itself on supplying a fast-moving half-hour full of quick-witted
one-liners and Jenna Elfman, but the same could be said of the
just-as-adorable ``Will &AMP; Grace'' on NBC. Fact is, in its second
season, ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' a bubbly buddy comedy noted originally
for having a gay lead character, is now merely a good sitcom with
quick pacing, sharp writing and a crack supporting cast that's as
good as any series on network or cable.
</P>
<P>
   Also at 8 p.m. is ``Party of Five,'' the Fox drama that's
showing its age but is aggressively sharpening the thorns on its
prickly characters, including that never-satisfied Neve Campbell
and Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is primed to leave for her new show
with a bang, playing out a sexaholic story line on poor, tired
Scott Wolf's Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``60 Minutes II'' is on CBS, and ``Angel'' follows
``Buffy'' on the WB. Watching either eliminates ``Sports Night,''
airing at 8:30 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   I know some of you have reservations about ``Sports Night'' _
I've got the e-mail to prove it. But I renew my admiration for the
comedy series that is snappy and gratifyingly complicated. William
H. Macy, introduced last week as a stodgy and so far rather
humorless (and therefore funny) consultant hired to improve the
late-night cable show's ratings, could be just the thing the series
needs to bolster its own Nielsen numbers. (I can't imagine ABC
holding onto this low-rated series even if it matches last year's
audience levels, though.)
</P>
<P>
   If there's a weak link here, it's at 7:30 p.m., where choices
include a creatively faltering ``It's like, you know ...'' on ABC,
Fox's ``That '70s Show,'' NBC's worn-out ``3rd Rock From the Sun''
and the silly UPN rookie ``Shasta McNasty.'' But that's fine. Just
stick with the hourlong ``JAG'' or ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which leads us to 9 p.m. and the disheartening
head-to-head battle between the romantic drama ``Once and Again''
on ABC and the courtroom/family series ``Judging Amy'' on CBS. Both
of these female-skewing dramas have high production values; fresh,
lively characters; and so many reasons to live.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Once and Again'' was the series I initially watched
while taping ``Judging Amy'' for later, I've since flip-flopped,
but not because subsequent episodes of ``Once and Again'' have
proved disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy'' has simply been so intoxicating, so
entertaining, so intellectually satisfying, so Tyne Daly sassy _
its cases involving children's rights through the eyes of the
courts, parents, law enforcement agencies and children's services
have been eye-opening _ that I want to see it right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Seems you agree: ``Judging Amy'' has surged past ``Once and
Again'' in the Nielsens, ranking No. 10 last week, with 11 million
viewers. ``O and A'' ranked No. 24, with 9.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, ``Once and Again'' may or may not make room for the
time slot's permanent tenant ``NYPD Blue,'' (it has been reported
that ABC wants to keep ``Once and Again'' right where it is). If
``NYPD Blue'' does return there, it should prove interesting for
``Judging Amy'' star Amy Brenneman. She was last seen on ``Blue''
as a mob-influenced cop and love interest of David Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. I'll give ``NYPD Blue'' a few episodes to win back my
loyalty. But I'm taping it.

WHICH NEW SHOWS WILL SEE SWEEPS AND WHICH WILL GET THE BROOM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which network series will live and which will die is being
decided right about now, four weeks into a new season that's hardly
the creative apocalypse we initially warned you about. Of course,
it's not the richly textured season that the network executives and
producers so breathlessly promised, either. But is it ever?
</P>
<P>
   As the networks implement strategy in preparation for the
November sweeps, it's easy to determine what's going well, what's
going wrong, and what needs more time to find an audience. Because
November is so economically crucial, shows that disappear next
month are considered to be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But good news first. ``Third Watch,'' NBC's frenetic ``ER'' in
the streets, is showing glimpses of staying power, as is the
network's political drama ``West Wing'' and its ``Law &AMP; Order''
spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.'' Also doing well:
the female-driven law show ``Family Law,'' starring Kathleen
Quinlan and airing Mondays on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it's the CBS drama ``Judging Amy,'' with Amy
Brenneman as a rookie judge, that has shown the most promise.
Airing at 9 p.m. Tuesdays, the series, which has distinguished
itself with clever writing, high ideals and a solid supporting cast
led by Tyne Daly, attracted a little over 16 million viewers and
ranked No. 12 in last week's Nielsens. And all without much
critical buzz.
</P>
<P>
   It built viewership over its lead-in, ``60 Minutes II,'' and
clobbered ``Once and Again,'' the ABC romantic drama that received
good reviews and whose promos alone generated water-cooler
word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Judging Amy'' is the second-highest-rated new show
behind NBC's dismally reviewed ``Stark Raving Mad,'' the Neil
Patrick Harris sitcom that seems to owe its viewership to its
Thursday-night time slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy'' may be pulling away from ``Once and Again,'' but
that drama, about love developing between a pair of 40-ish
divorcees, is in no danger of getting booted. Some watchers I've
talked with consider Sela Ward's Lily a bit too upbeat and perfect
to be a divorcee eight months removed. Those viewers have bailed,
calling it ``unrealistic.'' (I have to disagree with this on a
couple levels: People react to divorce in differing ways, and the
ex-wife of Lily's new beau is emotionally unstable enough to
balance the scales.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC is so pleased with ``Once and Again's'' ratings (it placed
27th last week) that it may leave the series in its Tuesday-night
spot and find another place for permanent tenant ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   This has reportedly infuriated ``Blue'' creator and executive
producer Steven Bochco. ABC thinks audiences will follow the show.
I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' was somewhat rejuvenated with the exchange of Rick
Schroder for Jimmy Smits, but its story-line redundancy is a sure
sign of old age. And star director Paris Barclay is now off
preparing the new ``City of Angels'' for a midseason launch on CBS.
I think a different night would kill ``Blue'' within two seasons,
tops.
</P>
<P>
   But, in TV, this is a time for heightened emotions. Surely the
cast members of ``Manchester Prep,'' the TV version of the teen
film ``Cruel Intentions,'' were shocked when their show got canned
before it aired. And what's Mike O'Malley thinking, now that his
second consecutive show (remember ``Life With Roger''?) has bitten
the dust? NBC axed ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' after two episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Get Real,'' which offered a pilot I thoroughly enjoyed
(although my colleagues shook their heads in amazement), has
staggered out the gate. Same with Chris Carter's dark drama,
``Harsh Realm.'' Just as wobbly: ``Cold Feet'' on NBC, ``Work With
Me'' on CBS, ``Wasteland'' and ``Oh Grow Up'' on ABC, and ``Shasta
McNasty'' on UPN.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been shocking to see viewers hightail it away from
``Action.'' Critics adore the Fox sitcom, about a film producer
willing to sell his soul for success, but many viewers have found
it ``revolting,'' as one reader told me. Fox will shelve the series
during November, bringing it back Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   And what about David E. Kelley's experimental ``Ally''? It
doesn't look good. What is essentially a well-edited clip show has
garnered so little interest, you have to wonder whether Fox
research showing that viewers wanted to see more of Calista
Flockhart meant they just wanted her to gain some weight.
</P>
<P>
   With new episodes of ``Ally McBeal'' returning as soon as this
baseball mess is over, the most interesting aspect of the two
series will be comparing the tiny Ally and the REALLY tiny Ally.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a series I'd watch.

FAT'S IN THE FIRE, ONCE A DIET BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans are overweight. We eat too much junk food and exercise
too little.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids are overweight, too. Our pets are too fat and the
problem is getting worse with every generation. At least, that's
what the reporter said the other night. He went on and on about it.
He was sort of skinny, though, and you know I got the impression
that he thought the rest of us just want to be fat.
</P>
<P>
   But he's probably allergic to Twinkies and chocolate, so he
wouldn't understand our problem anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I got to thinking about what he said as I sat eating a
large bag of chips while I waited for my pork ribs to baste. You
know, he's right. We are getting a little big in the britches.
Maybe I do need to start exercising every day and laying off the
Kool-Aid a bit. OK, maybe not every day because I just don't do
Mondays, but I could exercise several days each week if I put my
mind to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to start my new exercise plan right after the New Year
begins. If all this Y2K doomsday stuff is correct, there is no
point to me suffering for the last few months of civilization as we
know it. I might as well enjoy these last moments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I will go ahead with my new diet plan. I've read
several books on the subject and I looked at the labels on a bunch
of diet pills. I compiled all the information and I've come up with
a great new four-day diet plan that's guaranteed to help you lose
weight without emptying your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1: You can have four small, nutritious meals over the course
of the day or you can have a chocolate bar for breakfast. You must
eat the chocolate before 10 a.m. or you will gain weight.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2: You have a choice between a large bowl of orange rinds
for breakfast followed by a delicious dish of grape skins for lunch
and dinner OR you can jog to the grocery store and eat a pint of
Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream as you walk home.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3: How about a delicious protein shake for breakfast and
lunch followed by a sensible dinner? Or you can drink 12 glasses of
water and eat a ribeye steak with a plain baked potato.
</P>
<P>
   Day 4: You've suffered enough. Have some pizza, but don't eat
all of the crust. Wash it all down with a glass of prune juice.
</P>
<P>
   Day 5: Time to weigh! Go to the bathroom, remove everything,
floss and shave twice. Sit in a hot place and perspire for two
hours, then step on the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to deduct 10 pounds for stress and tension. (Hey,
burdens weigh you down.) Congratulations, you're well on your way
to leanville.
</P>
<P>
   This is a surefire, can't-miss diet plan. I tried it myself and,
incredibly, I lost 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs diet pills when you've got good old American ingenuity
to rely on?

CELEBRATING AN ECOLOGIST'S ELOQUENCE AND VISION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Wis., Vt., Mo.)   By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ The onetime chicken coop known almost reverently
as The Shack still stands, rough-boarded and stark in the middle of
a clearing surrounded by tall pines, oaks and maples planted
decades ago by the former occupant and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin's only concession to comfort is a magnificent stone
fireplace. Implements for dealing with the land and its wild
inhabitants festoon the walls or lie casually about. Saws. Shovels.
An auger. A box containing bird-banding equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It was at The Shack, in south-central Wisconsin about an hour's
drive north of Madison, that the ecologist Aldo Leopold _ one of
the half-dozen most influential thinkers of the last 150 years on
the relationship of human beings to the rest of nature _ gleaned
many of his insights and sharpened his ideas. He collected a lot of
his observations and thoughts in a small volume of essays published
50 years ago this month, titled ``A Sand County Almanac and
Sketches Here and There.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowning essay, ``The Land Ethic,'' argued that humans had a
moral obligation to respect and protect the rest of the natural
world. Human ethics and the human sense of community, he held,
should be expanded to include not just people but also the land and
its wild inhabitants. This land ethic, he wrote, ``changes the role
of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain
member and citizen of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A thing is right,'' he wrote, ``when it tends to preserve the
integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is
wrong when it tends otherwise.'' In one form or another, this idea
is at the heart of the modern conservationist's credo.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold may be less than a household word to many Americans,
perhaps most. But in the field of conservation he is a titan. ``A
Sand County Almanac'' is a bible of the environmental movement
every bit as much as Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring.'' In
Washington, where national conservation policy has been going
through major changes of philosophy in recent years, his name and
ideas are everyday currency.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that in this 50th anniversary year of the book, which
has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still going strong,
Leopold's ideas are being scrutinized afresh. A recent conference
was convened here by the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and
Letters to examine his legacy and its relevance for the future. And
two new books about his work have just been published:
</P>
<P>
   ``Aldo Leopold: For the Health of the Land; Previously
Unpublished Essays and Other Writings,'' edited by Dr. J. Baird
Callicott and Dr. Eric T. Freyfogle (Island Press/Shearwater
Books).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essential Aldo Leopold: Quotations and Commentaries,''
edited by Dr. Curt D. Meine and Dr. Richard L. Knight (University
of Wisconsin Press).
</P>
<P>
   The science of ecology has advanced rapidly and changed greatly
in the last half century, and some of Leopold's writings are a bit
outdated. Nevertheless, the central strains of his thought have
remained remarkably durable, said Dr. Meine, a conservation
biologist and writer based at the International Crane Foundation in
Baraboo, Wis., and an organizer of the Madison conference.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every major idea, trend and enterprise in modern
conservation, especially in the 1990s, was anticipated or advocated
by Leopold: Setting aside protected wilderness. Treating predators
not as pests to be eliminated but as essential ecological actors.
Deliberately restoring the health of ecosystems degraded by human
activity, from replanting prairies to reintroducing wolves. Using
fire to regenerate landscapes. Taking entire ecosystems with their
full, diverse panoply of species, rather than just individual
species, as the main focus of conservation efforts. Treating people
and their needs as an integral part of the ecosystem to be
protected or restored rather than as something separate from
nature.
</P>
<P>
   More eloquently and effectively than anyone else, perhaps,
Leopold applied the insights of the emerging science of ecology to
conservation and set it all in a guiding philosophical context.
</P>
<P>
   But Leopold did not live to see his influence grow. One week
after ``A Sand County Almanac'' was accepted for publication by
Oxford University Press, in April 1948, he hurried from The Shack
to help fight a fire on a neighbor's land. There he had a heart
attack and died at 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never saw the impact of those essays; he would be very
pleased,'' said Dr. Susan Flader, a historian and Leopold scholar
at the University of Missouri at Columbia. But, she said, he was
also a low-keyed, humble person who would probably feel ``that the
attention should be focused on the land.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Leopold was born in Iowa in 1887, a vibrant
tradition of conservation thought and values had already been
established in America. Henry David Thoreau had argued that
humanity could save itself not by destroying wilderness, but by
becoming one with it.
</P>
<P>
   George Perkins Marsh, a Vermont naturalist, had written that
nature, left alone, is basically stable and that wherever humans
go, ``the harmonies of nature are turned to discord.''
</P>
<P>
   Leopold cut his intellectual teeth in a more utilitarian
tradition established by Gifford Pinchot, the nation's chief
forester under President Theodore Roosevelt. Pinchot believed that
while forests should serve society's economic needs, destroying
them wantonly for short-term gain was self-defeating in the long
run. Thus, conservation along scientific principles was essential.
</P>
<P>
   With a master's degree in forestry from Yale University in hand,
Leopold went to work for Pinchot's Forest Service in the Southwest.
As one of the first conservationists to advocate the setting aside
of protected wilderness areas, he was instrumental in establishing
the first such Federal area, in the Gila National Forest of
Arizona. He had no illusions about the limits of such actions,
however: ``Any wilderness program,'' he wrote, ``is a rear-guard
action, through which retreats are reduced to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other interests especially engaged him in the Southwest: the
whole complex of landscape processes, like fire and erosion, that
shaped the vegetative mosaic of the region, and what was then
called game management. The first interest would in time ripen into
an appreciation of a landscape or an ecosystem as an integrated
community of living things. The second would lead to a remarkable
epiphany in which his view of the role of predators reversed by 180
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, wolves, mountain lions and grizzly bears were
generally considered ``varmints,'' as Flader puts it, and Leopold
was an enthusiastic exterminator of them. But in a famous ``Sand
County'' passage, he wrote of shooting an old wolf and reaching her
``in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes.'' He came
out of the experience believing that wolves were as essential to
the healthy functioning of nature as were the deer that the
exterminators in those days thought they were protecting.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Wisconsin, he spent much of the time and energy of his
last years fighting a bitter battle about overpopulation by deer.
Like many present-day ecologists, Leopold believed that in the
absence of predators, too many deer strip the landscape of
vegetation, thereby altering the entire web of life in negative
ways.
</P>
<P>
   As his thoughts evolved, they focused more and more on what he
called the health of the wild landscape as a whole, which, to him,
was the paramount conservation concern. To him, the elimination of
wolves and the proliferation of deer degraded the landscape's
health, making forceful corrective action necessary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leopold's thought was influenced not least by the emergence of
ecology as a science, and in particular by two concepts: that
nature is an interdependent community of living things, and that an
ecosystem is ``a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of
soils, plants, and animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Leopold took his in-the-round view of nature to the University
of Wisconsin, where he became a professor in 1928. (His progression
of thought is symbolized by the transformation in the title of his
professorship from game management to wildlife management to
wildlife ecology.) In 1935, Leopold and his wife, Estella, bought
the 80-acre abandoned farm on which The Shack stands, and there for
the next 13 years, on weekends, they and their five children (all
of whom later became accomplished naturalists) bonded with the land
and used it as their ecology laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   It was also at The Shack that Leopold indulged a pioneering
passion for ecological restoration. Many of the trees the family
planted on the desolate, played-out land failed to take root at
first, and when they did and eventually grew into a thick forest.
The result represented an artificial garden as much as it did a
restoration of the original prairie-savanna ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   If Leopold were doing it today, he would undoubtedly do it
differently, said Wellington (Buddy) Huffaker, the executive
director of the Aldo Leopold Foundation Inc., which now owns the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold was also a prime mover in a more accurate,
scientifically based effort at the university arboretum in Madison
to restore examples of Wisconsin's original ecosystems. There,
thick, waving prairie grasses much taller than a man's head testify
today to the beginnings of a restoration movement that has grown
into a vital and far-flung enterprise across the United States. It
is this restorationist impulse, some experts believe today, that
holds the most promise for the future of conservation.
</P>
<P>
   But to tinker intelligently with nature, Leopold wrote, it is
necessary first to save as many wild species as possible _ ``to
keep every cog and wheel'' of an ecological structure only dimly
understood by humans.
</P>
<P>
   As was made clear at the recent Madison conference, Leopold
fully recognized that the human mark on the natural world is
inevitable and indelible, and must somehow be accommodated. He also
believed that despite the establishment of protected public lands,
the outcome of the conservation struggle would be determined mostly
on private land.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the land ethic. Freyfogle, an editor of one of the new
Leopold books, believes that Leopold came to that philosophical
proposition only after exploring other options for protecting
private land and finding them insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Today, conservationists are largely recapitulating Leopold's
progression: while they continue to argue that there are sound
economic and utilitarian reasons for insuring a healthy landscape
(as did Leopold), they are more and more putting their eggs in the
basket of morality _ saving creation.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold's thought needs to be updated, it was suggested in
Madison, to take account of ecologists' later insights. For
example, it is now clear that nature is in a constant state of
flux, not static balance, even in the absence of human disturbance.
Some participants called for expanding the land ethic to include a
new ``consumption ethic'' that would, for example, make it morally
unacceptable to cut down pristine forests to build wasteful,
oversized houses.
</P>
<P>
   But the land ethic itself, many say, remains ahead of its time.
It has yet to become a general societal norm; land is still viewed
mostly as a commodity, as human slaves were before societal ethics
were expanded to include them.
</P>
<P>
   As Leopold wrote in ``Sand County,'' ``there are some who can
live without wild things, and some who cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mechanized, electrified, increasingly virtual world where
economic concerns are dominant, many can.
</P>
<P>
   So it remains to be seen whether society at large will ever
embrace the simple Leopold proposition that people must pay the
rest of nature the same ethical and moral respect that they pay
themselves. Leopold's disciples hold that if people cannot live
with the rest of nature without destroying it, then modern human
society is not a worthy one.

TIGUA INDiANS RAKING IN GAMBLING BUCKS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ In what was once a crumbling barrio on the edge
of El Paso, a small band of American Indians has defied the state
of Texas by erecting a 24-hour money machine called the Speaking
Rock Casino.
</P>
<P>
   The glittering gaming house, made of fake adobe and decorated
with Pueblo Indian motifs, reportedly brings in about $60 million
per year. It is lifting the tribe of 1,200 Tiguas out of poverty
while making it a political force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the poorest of the poor,'' said Elias Torrez, 40, who
was the tribe's governor when the casino opened in 1994, a year
after the Tiguas began their high-stakes bingo games. ``Now we have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from bringing material gains, Speaking Rock's success has
instilled a new pride among Tiguas, some of whom had hidden their
Indian heritage in the face of prejudice. A Franciscan friar at the
neighboring Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church said elders remember
being stoned while performing traditional dances on the feast of
St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were treated with a lot of disrespect,'' said Jesus Padilla
Sr., 49, tribal sheriff of what is formally known as the Ysleta del
Sur Pueblo tribe. ``We didn't have shoes; we bathed in the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Silvas, 61, another member of the tribal council, recalled
bitterly: ``People would say, `Here comes this dirty Indian.' Now
everyone wants to be a Tigua.''
</P>
<P>
   And it pays to be one.
</P>
<P>
   In December, each Tigua received a payment of $15,000, up from
$8,000 the year before. This year's share of casino profits has not
been set.
</P>
<P>
   Filbert Candelaria, 37, the tribe's acting governor, said of
last year's payout: ``Some people used it wisely. Others spent like
crazy, buying cars and trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that stockbrokers and bankers were on hand to give
investment advice when the checks were distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Casino earnings have also financed the tribe's purchase of the
local Mobil lubricant distributor, a separate fuel distributorship,
a chain of Running Bear convenience stores and a 68,000-acre spread
near Valentine valued at $6 million. The tribe uses the land for
recreation and plans to start a dude ranch there for American and
European tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The first of a chain of tribe-owned fast-lube outlets will open
this winter. Also planned are a shopping center, a hotel, a
spring-water bottling facility and a wind-powered generating plant,
said Alberto Alvidrez, 27, a tribal council member.
</P>
<P>
   Such a turnaround in Tigua fortunes is all too rare.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe members are descendants of 305 Tiguas _ ``hostages''
according to their account, loyal subjects according to the Spanish
_ brought out of New Mexico after a Pueblo Indian revolt in 1682.
Whether captives or not, 100 Tigua braves did help colonial forces
recapture the lost territory a dozen years later. In 1751, Madrid
granted them 36 square miles in Ysleta, but the document was lost
by the time El Paso annexed the area in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   Tiguas served as scouts for the Texas Rangers and for the U.S.
Cavalry during the Apache campaigns. Legend has it that several
enemy scalps were incorporated into an old adobe wall in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Most Tiguas became farm laborers on the bottom rung of the
social ladder. By 1902, visiting scholar J. Walter Fewkes found
only a few Tiguas left and predicted their extinction. But an
effort aided, if not orchestrated, by attorney Tom Diamond finally
won the tribe federal recognition in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Tiguas have never had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   They are given hiring preference at the casino and other tribal
enterprises, meaning that every member who wants a job has one,
Candelaria said. A dozen years ago, unemployment among tribe
members was above 40 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Families have moved into 25 spacious, Santa Fe-style homes
complete with fireplaces and two-car garages on a sprawling tract
just outside El Paso; an additional 31 homes are nearing
completion. Although the largest is 3,500 square feet, the average
cost per house in the first phase was $80,000 and within guidelines
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which gave the
tribe a $1.92 million grant, said HUD spokesman Scott Hudman. The
site was improved with $4 million in casino earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's senior citizens receive meal tickets for the
casino's Wyngs restaurant. After school, children are bused to free
Tiwa language and culture classes at the tribe's new
library/education center. Later, they can tap a college scholarship
fund. Soon they'll have a recreation complex with a gymnasium and
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The bingo games and Las Vegas-style gambling draw heavily from
El Paso and neighboring Juarez, Mexico, as well as from communities
in nearby New Mexico and from Midland-Odessa in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a salmon-pink bingo table one recent evening were
trucker Jerry Zenkner and his wife, Debbie, of Des Moines, Iowa.
They had just delivered a load of frozen pork bellies in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Rock flourishes despite its legal dispute with the
state. Gov. George W. Bush contends that Texas law forbids the
casino's sea of 1,000 chiming and flashing slot machines, bounded
by tables where poker and a blackjack derivative called Tigua 21
are played.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit, filed in September by Texas Attorney General John
Cornyn, will determine the casino's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's illegal,'' said Tigua Police Chief Raul Takiashi
Candelaria, 34, the acting governor's younger brother. ``But it's
our sovereign right to do it, and we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows tribes to operate types of gambling that are
permitted in their state. The Tiguas contend that Texas'
legalization of the lottery opened the door for their gaming
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas lottery is ``like a giant slot machine with 10,000
terminals,'' Diamond said last year. ``This is just a political
move. ... The tribe is of the opinion that this involves (Bush's)
running for president of the United States, and this is a
grandstand play to just look good to some religious
conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible snag is a 1987 federal law that, among other
things, specifically ruled out Tigua-sponsored gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we broke a treaty. It's 200 to 1,'' the former governor,
Torrez, said dismissively, referring to Washington's spotty record
of adhering to Indian treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's sudden, casino-induced wealth has not come without a
price.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, 200 people have been removed from the tribal
roll on grounds that they were not at least one-eighth Tigua _
meaning that at least one great-grandparent was a full-blooded
Tigua.
</P>
<P>
   Disenfranchised members lost tribal benefits, subsidized housing
and jobs. Some said they were forced out at gunpoint after refusing
to heed eviction demands. One, Grace Vela, who ran the tribal
seniors' center, said she was led out of her home in handcuffs. The
tribe denies that guns were drawn or that handcuffs were used.
</P>
<P>
   Victims blame greed and say it's tearing the tribe apart.
</P>
<P>
   Tigua leaders are unapologetic and assert that non-Indians had
slipped onto the roll through corruption in the 1970s. Unity has
never been better, insisted the Tiguas' official spokesman, a
non-Tigua political and marketing consultant named Marc Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiated cash settlements were subsequently given to those who
lost homes. Vela said she received $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spoke out (against the expulsions), you'd be thrown out
with them or be punished,'' said a Tigua who supports the current
leadership but declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.
``It was sad. We had to look the other way when neighbors of 17
years were taken from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the tribe's dynamic governor, Vince Munoz, was
unceremoniously removed from office amid allegations of official
misconduct. But members said they were told that the leadership is
investigating questionable payments during Munoz's tenure. Munoz
did not return calls left on his home answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tiguas are now an economic power and have been very
generous, helping people in need and donating $100,000 to restore
the church,'' said the Rev. Steve Stowe, a friar at the mission
church overlooking the casino. ``The downside is the evictions, the
infighting and lack of unity. All the way around, it's been a mixed
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the tribe paid $1 million for the return of its most
sacred object, a drum called the ``juanchido,'' after accusing a
former war captain, Marty Silvas, of stealing it. Silvas was
acquitted of theft charges, arguing that he had a lifelong right to
protect the drum. Silvas said an unknown party removed the drum
from a hiding place and sold it to the tribe through an attorney.
He and his brother, ex-tribal Gov. Manny Silvas, were ``banned''
for not returning the drum, then expelled for not having Tigua
blood, which they dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to punish people who disobey or (are) sacrilegious,''
explained Raul Candelaria, the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders bristle at the criticism and at the attention the
expulsions have received in local news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they check out the 40 to 50 evictions by the city of
El Paso every day for nonpayment of taxes?'' asked Candelaria, the
acting governor. ``Why the bad press? We are a thorn. El Paso is
controlled by little circles of rich people, and now they're
worried because we're asserting our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribal leadership has scored some victories as well. The
Tiguas, for example, successfully campaigned against a plan by El
Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez to locate a bus depot in a congested area
near the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   And their officials don't hide their eagerness to play politics.
The tribe hired former Texas lottery chief Lena Guerrero as its
lobbyist in Austin, the state capital, and in the past 18 months
has donated more than $200,000 to political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all losers,'' Filbert Candelaria said jokingly, referring
to the tribe's contributions to such star-crossed Democrats as
gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro, who received $89,000, and
attorney general hopeful Jim Mattox, who got $46,000.
</P>
<P>
   About $36,000 went last spring to Ramirez's challenger, Barbara
Perez, prompting the mayor to make the Tiguas themselves an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they call themselves a sovereign nation and don't want us
to get involved in their internal politics, then they shouldn't get
involved in ours,'' Ramirez fumed. During the campaign, the mayor
took out a full-page ad that declared in bold letters, ``SHAME ON
THE TIGUAS.'' It accused the Tiguas of trying to put Perez in
``their back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigua leaders seethe when anyone questions their right as U.S.
citizens to participate in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us to be illiterate Indians who don't speak up,''
said Candelaria, the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their bad luck at picking winners, the Tiguas say
they'll continue to exercise whatever political influence they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you had a tribe that might give $100 to a candidate,''
the acting governor said. ``Now we're able to finance a whole
campaign, and that scares the El Paso political establishment.''

LABOR IS BACK _ AND IT'S BACKING GORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spending the past week in Los Angeles observing the national
AFL-CIO convention as it endorsed Al Gore for president convinced
me that organized labor has ended its three-decade decline in
political influence and may be on its way to being a major player
again _ not as strong as it once was, but stronger than it has
been.
</P>
<P>
   As in every organization devoted to human endeavor, there is a
tug of war between the idealistic and the pragmatic, the ideal and
the attainable. The hearts of some in labor's leadership _ thinking
of union colleagues whose jobs have been cut from under them by
corporate mergers and foreign competition from low-wage countries _
were torn. Should they, sensing Gore's apparent momentary
vulnerability, hold out for promises of an even more labor-friendly
executive stance? Or should they recognize the vice president's
lifelong attitude toward wage-earning America and reward his
history of instinctive friendship with loyalty in his moment of
need?
</P>
<P>
   When the chips were down, the membership chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you have to say about labor,'' remarked Texas
businessman and lifelong political activist Bernard Rapoport, ``it
rewards its friends.''
</P>
<P>
   What can labor actually give at this point? Help in the
primaries, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   It can't begin to match the millions poured into George W.
Bush's coffers by wealthy contributors, some motivated by the Bush
campaign's impressive advance latch on money and its smell of
success. Labor can compensate for the GOP's overpowering money
advantage with only one ingredient: numbers. People. Quiet block
workers willing to ring doorbells and round up neighbors in
personal, one-on-one contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the easy access of conservatives to megabucks for TV
extravaganzas, it looks like a contest between the tortoise and the
hare. There are so many phone numbers to dial, so many blocks to
walk, so many individual conversations needed to counter commercial
television's ubiquitous impact with its costly and cleverly
scripted political spots.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget: The 68 affiliated unions of the AFL-CIO have
13 million members. Counting families dependent on the
bread-earners' wages, they potentially speak for the interests of
one American in every five. And if organized labor's volunteers can
reach out to other unorganized wage-earners with a commonly
appealing message, their influence could be potent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's David vs. Goliath,'' said one labor activist with whom I
talked, saying that Bush is looking for scores of ``fat cats,''
each of whom will raise tens of thousands of dollars for him.
``Obviously, we're not in that league. We'd have to find a million
people to contribute $100 apiece. Even that sum would be
sacrificial for some of our members. But we're working at it. We're
way ahead of them in shoe leather!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't sell labor short. When its volunteer troops are motivated
to mobilize against their corporate nemeses, they've been known to
do impressive things.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, labor-associated families accounted for only 13 percent
of those who actually showed up at the polls to cast ballots. That
was labor's low point, and the year that aggressive conservatism
triumphed. Republicans took the House for the first time in 20
years and began their essentially anti-labor reign.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, thanks to the quiet, productive work of AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney's newly invigorated leadership team, labor _
with minimal fanfare but a lot of shoe leather _ turned out 22
percent of all those who cast ballots. A 70 percent gain! Clinton
and Gore were re-elected handily. Democrats gained seats in the
House. Last year, with labor's help, Democrats inched even closer,
within five of retaking the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's crucial convention vote to back Gore for the
nomination was almost anti-climactic. Sweeney had lobbied hard for
the endorsement _ which, when it came, was overwhelming. Fifty-two
unions for, two against, with a few abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when the national convention formally opened, its
delegates were moved to repeated outbursts of spontaneous applause
by a fiery speech delivered by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
On Wednesday, when Gore appeared, his humor was intact and his
manner relaxed. His spirited presentation and the enthusiastic
crowd reaction offered a fairly convincing answer to journalists
who keep whining that Gore is dull and colorless.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the delegates' thunderous response to the
Gephardt and Gore speeches, a speech critic cited two factors. For
a crowd to be set on fire like that, he said, the speaker first
must be saying things he obviously means. Second, the audience must
be not only ready but eager to be ignited. A combination of things
are sticking in workers' craws.
</P>
<P>
   In a period of unprecedented business prosperity, wage-earning
families are struggling to stay even. Since 1990, corporate profits
have risen by 108 percent. Executive salaries increased by 481
percent. Workers' wages are up only 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the GOP Congress, help is down for public schools.
HMOs keep squeezing medical care, making it more expensive.
Employers are outsourcing more work, sometimes threatening to move
American factories overseas unless workers accept cuts in health
and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by what I saw and heard in Los Angeles, the accumulating
grievances of wage-earning Americans who see their families' upward
mobility stymied and living standards stalemated while the
corporate sector amasses unprecedented wealth are reaching a
combustible point. Whether a unified labor movement can sustain
that drive and urgency until November of next year will be the
test.

LINKING BREASTS, BEHAVIOR AND SIZE OF LITTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Wash., Mass., Fla.)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though much has been said and thought about the female breast,
there remains one aspect that has received little consideration:
the actual number that a woman has, with two accepted as the
immutable standard.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, humans, like other mammals, can vary in their numbers
of nipples and more rarely breasts, raising this little-pondered
question: Why do humans, or for that matter any mammals, have the
number of mammaries that they do?
</P>
<P>
   The few people who have considered this question, including
Aristotle and Alexander Graham Bell, have discovered that mammals
follow what is now known as the ``one-half rule.'' According to the
rule, the average number of young in a litter is one half the
typical number of mammaries and the maximum litter size is equal to
the total number of mammaries.
</P>
<P>
   (Humans conform perfectly to the rule with two breasts and a
typical litter size of one-half that, and a standard maximum litter
size, without fertility drugs, of two.)
</P>
<P>
   It has remained largely a mystery, however, why mammals so
slavishly follow this rule.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a new study on naked mole rats, a curious breed of
mammal that breaks the one-half rule, suggests that the reason for
having what seem to be so many extra mammaries may be to keep
sharing and fighting to a minimum in the largest litters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals turn the one-half rule upside down,'' said Dr.
Paul W. Sherman, behavioral ecologist at Cornell University who
with colleagues published a new study on mole rat mammaries in a
recent issue of The Journal of Mammology. Naked mole rats are able
to break the rule, having many fewer mammaries than it dictates,
because they are good at sharing, even when there are more than two
pups for every teat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Avery N. Gilbert, biological psychologist at a private
research firm, Synesthetics Inc., and the namer of the one-half
rule, said, ``With a lot of pups you could have one pair of very
large mammary glands, but with only two spigots that would involve
a lot of sharing'' _ a behavior, he said, that is in short supply
among most young mammals. He added, ``It's tough down there in the
huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and colleagues, Dr. Stanton Braude of Washington
University and Dr. Jennifer Jarvis of University of Cape Town in
South Africa, discovered that naked mole rats tend to bear about 11
young and tend to have 11 mammaries. In the biggest litters, there
can be as many as 28 pups.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other animals that fight over access to teats _ most
famously pigs whose vicious scrambling for the more milk-rich
mammaries near the mother's head spawned the phrase ``sucking hind
teat'' _ mole rat young do not fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no jostling or shoving or grabbing onto a nipple,''
Sherman said. ``They just take turns without any aggression
whatsoever and mother doesn't have to adjudicate.''
</P>
<P>
   They do not need to fight, researchers suggest, because their
mother is heavily pampered, unlike most mammalian mothers who have
to leave the nest to find food for themselves and whose milk can
sometimes be in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   In mole rat colonies, as in bee or ant colonies, only a single
female reproduces with the others at her beck and call. Fed and
protected by members of the colony, the reproductive female appears
able to provide so much milk that the young can all amicably share
to satiation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in other social mammals, mothers are also cared for,
though to a lesser degree, and in those groups females also tend to
have more young per mammary than the one-half rule would dictate.
</P>
<P>
   But why not have more mammaries anyway so that even mole rat
young need not ever wait for their milk? Sherman said the fact that
naked mole rats do not have a nipple for every pup in their largest
litters suggests that females have only as many mammaries as
absolutely necessary, possibly because mammaries may carry a high
cost.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said, mammaries are openings to the outside
world that carry the risk of mastitis, a sometimes dangerous
infection. Mammary tissue also carries the risk of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   While cooperative sharing of teats may be rare in many mammals,
in some it is out of the question. Dr. John Eisenberg, curator of
mammals at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said that in
marsupials, a group including kangaroos and opossums, the young are
born as tiny, fetuslike creatures that must find a way to a teat
and latch on, remaining attached until they are fully developed. In
such cases, young that do not find a nipple are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   There is even some evidence that in opossum mothers the number
of offspring far exceeds the number of nipples, creating an instant
struggle for access and an early lesson in the survival of the
fittest, Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also discovered that the number of mammaries an
individual had was highly variable and that the left and right
sides of mole rats often had different numbers of mammaries, with
totals ranging from 9 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tended to think of every species as having a
set number of mammaries and nicely matched pairs as well, Sherman
said, with animals built otherwise being viewed as rare
aberrations. Sherman suggests instead that variation in mammary
number may be much more common than researchers had thought.
</P>
<P>
   In some bats like the false vampire, there are extra teats known
as pubic teats found around the groin. Typically mammaries tend to
appear along the so-called milk line running from the armpit into
the groin.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if these extra teats in bats ever produce milk,
said Dr. Nancy Simmons, the curator of mammals at the American
Museum of Natural History, but even without milk they are of great
use to baby bats. Hanging upside down, a young bat grabs the pubic
teat with its mouth and wraps its legs around its mother's neck,
hanging on safely as the mother flies about.
</P>
<P>
   Even humans exhibit more variation in nipple and breast number
than is widely recognized. Dr. G. Gregory Gallico III, plastic
surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, said both polythelia,
the condition of having extra nipples, and polymastia, the
condition of having extra breast tissue, are viewed as harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say these conditions can also be quite common, with
some estimating that about 1 percent of the population carries
either an extra nipple or extra breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who have them probably never know,'' said Gallico,
explaining that accessory nipples can look like little more than
moles or brown dots.
</P>
<P>
   But while largely viewed as benign medical oddities, extra
nipples and in particular extra breasts, which Gilbert says have
been reported in the clinical literature to weep milk during
pregnancy, can also be viewed as a kind of evolutionary tinkering
in increased mammary number in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, however, such evolutionary experimentation was
viewed in a much more sinister light. Dr. David D. Hall, religious
and cultural historian at Harvard Divinity School, said that during
the witchhunts in America and Europe, women suspected of being
witches were often searched for extra nipples or breasts
particularly in the groin area. Known as witches' marks, the
nipples were thought to be used to nurse cats, dogs and other more
fantastical creatures, known as their familiars.

   On television, zapping a heart rhythm back to normal looks so
simple a class of sixth graders probably could learn it in a
minute, right?
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, they can, according to a Seattle study
published today in the journal Circulation. Researchers there gave
15 sixth graders a one-minute demonstration _ no questions allowed
_ of how to use an automated external defibrillator, a twin-paddle
electrical device used in cases of sudden cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The students were then asked to do what they had watched, and
they were able to use the device correctly in an average of 90
seconds _ only 23 seconds longer than needed by a control group of
paramedics using the device for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the study was not to argue for replacing Game Boys
with defibrillators in sixth graders' backpacks, but rather to make
the case that the devices should be more widely available. Every
minute of delay in restoring heart rhythm cuts the odds of survival
by 10 percent, and previous studies have estimated that greater
access to the devices could save 50,000 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this study proves that AED's are extremely easy to use,
it's important that you can't just arrive on the scene of an
emergency and hook someone up to the device,'' wrote Dr. Gus Bardy
of the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle, the
paper's author. ``You need training to learn how to assess the
emergency and determine if it's CPR, an AED, the Heimlich maneuver
or something else the patient needs.''
</P>
<P>
   DIAGNOSIS: TEST ZOOMS IN ON TICK-BORNE AILMENT
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale and the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station have developed a new blood test to better detect
ehrlichiosis, a disease carried by deer ticks that often goes
undiagnosed because it lacks a telltale sign like the bull's-eye
rash of Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis causes fevers, aches and other
flulike symptoms. But without a rash as a tip-off, health officials
suspect, most infections go undetected. Even when the disease is
suspected, testing has been slow and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of diagnosed cases has grown steadily in
Connecticut since ehrlichiosis was first identified in 1994; more
than 100 cases were confirmed there last year, said Dr. Jacob IJdo,
a rheumatologist who led the Yale research team.
</P>
<P>
   The new, simpler blood test, described in an article to be
published in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical
Microbiology, should help researchers address many unknowns
surrounding ehrlichiosis, including its range, prevalence and its
long-term course. ``It's like the early days of Lyme disease,''
IJdo (pronounced EYE-doe) said in an interview. The test was
developed by researchers for Yale and for the State of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   IJdo described the disease, which can usually be treated with
antibiotics, as ``very variable'' in its severity. Most cases
resemble the flu, with high fevers, headaches and muscle cramps. In
a few cases, the fevers have been accompanied by drops in white
blood cell count that have left patients open to fatal infections.
</P>
<P>
   IJdo said patients should not suspect ehrlichiosis with every
runny nose in the summertime. But people who know they have been
bitten by a deer tick and who have what seems to be a severe flu
during the warm-weather months should consult a physician.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: RIDING THE CYCLE OF STRESS AND SMOKE
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes do help smokers relax _ from tension caused by
smoking, a new study argues.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the October issue of American
Psychologist, examined one of tobacco's central paradoxes: smokers
say that lighting up provides a sense of relief and well-being, but
as a group, they hardly seem that relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, conducted by Dr. Andy Parrott, a psychologist at
the University of East London, found that adult smokers report
higher levels of stress between cigarettes, that teen-agers report
increased tension as they move from experimental to regular smoking
and that former smokers report lower or similar stress levels than
current smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott conceded that one explanation could be that people with
higher levels of stress are drawn to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, he said, smokers are suffering the whipsaw
effect of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular smoker needs nicotine to maintain normal moods,''
Parrott wrote, ``and suffers from unpleasant feelings of
irritability and tension between cigarettes when his or her plasma
nicotine levels are falling.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that pointing out the link between nicotine and
stress could be useful in helping smokers face the undeniable
stress of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN HOSTILE HEART PATIENTS FACE REHAB
</P>
<P>
   Heart attack victims who are generally hostile people tend to be
younger, heavier and unhappier than most coronary patients _ and to
get more benefit from cardiac rehabilitation programs, a study
conducted in New Orleans has found.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has established that a pattern of hostility or
unexpressed anger can greatly increase the odds of contracting
heart disease, perhaps because anger can drive up blood pressure.
Other studies have found that adding psychological counseling to
standard cardiac rehabilitation programs can help prevent future
heart attacks in patients with depression.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, Dr. Carl J. Lavie, a cardiologist at the
Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, and a colleague, Dr. Richard V.
Milani, reported finding high levels of hostility in 65, or 13
percent, of 500 heart attack victims. They found that the hostile
patients had higher levels of weight, cholesterol, anxiety and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ``before'' differences were striking, so were the
``after'' changes. ``The patients with high levels of hostility got
dramatically greater benefits from the rehabilitation program
compared with other patients,'' said Lavie, even though the program
included only general counseling about diet, exercise and the
patients' state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of high hostility levels dropped 40 percent, and
the hostile patients reported bigger than average gains in energy,
mental health and general health.
</P>
<P>
   Lavie said he hoped the research, published this month in The
Mayo Clinic Proceedings, would ``raise the level of concern
directed at behavioral factors in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though physicians are aware of the role emotions play in
promoting risk of heart disease, Lavie said, ``It's easier to
address cholesterol and weight or things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   RISKS AND REMEDIES:FOR HEPATITIS C, A TEST AND A QUIZ
</P>
<P>
   The 300,000 Americans who may have been exposed to hepatitis C
through tainted blood transfusions before 1992 can take an Internet
quiz this week to gauge their risk and order a free home-test kit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a far-ranging effort was begun to trace and notify
these patients, who had transfusions before reliable screening
became available in 1992. But many recipients may not be notified
for months or even years, so the American Liver Foundation is
offering the test and kits as part of National Hepatitis Awareness
Week, available at www.liverfoundation.org or at (888) 888-HEPC.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Bodenheimer Jr., a liver specialist and professor of
medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,
described hepatitis C as a serious but slow-moving disease. ``Many
people infected with it are unaware, because it can be asymptomatic
for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, especially those who contract the disease later in
life, it may have no affect on their health, he said. In others, it
can lead to the progressive scarring called cirrhosis, or to liver
cancer. Hepatitis C kills about 10,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is most often treated with a combination of
interferon alpha, which stimulates the immune system, and
ribavarin, an antiviral compound. But the treatment is expensive,
is effective in only 40 to 50 percent of patients and has
significant side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bodenheimer said, people at risk should take the test for
hepatitis C. ``Not to be alarmist, but it is the leading cause of
liver transplants,'' he continued. ``What is crucial is early
detection and awareness so that people can make important decisions
about their health care.''

A SOOTY CLINTON CALLS THE SENATE'S KETTLE BLACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we count down the final 15 months of Bill Clinton's
presidency, the time has come to think of him as a ``lame duck'' _
a president whose term is expiring and whose power is declining
because nobody cares what a soon-to-be-former officeholder wants to
do.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton doesn't see himself as a lame duck. There are things
he wants to do. There are laws he wants passed, treaties he wants
ratified. The 42nd president of the United States wants to be
remembered for something other than fooling around with an intern
and beating the rap in an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   So. That nuclear test ban treaty he'd been touting was a big
deal to Clinton. It was a symbol _ to him, at least _ of his
stature as a world leader. Its ratification would have contributed
to a presidential legacy that transcended the scandals and the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It is perfectly understandable that the Democratic president was
ticked off when the Republican-controlled Senate rejected the
treaty by a 51-48 vote. It would have been more understandable, of
course, if he hadn't set the stage for his own defeat by playing
politics with an issue that he would like us to believe is above
politics.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Clinton was well aware that he could never
muster the two-thirds vote required to ratify the treaty _ and that
his best hope for avoiding an embarrassing defeat was to reach an
agreement with the Senate to delay a vote until after the 2000
elections. But he demanded a vote, gambling that the Republicans
would not risk the fallout of rejecting a politically correct
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that Clinton would react to the Senate's action by
accusing his opponents of political gamesmanship when in fact it
was his political gamesmanship that tripped him up.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it wasn't ironic at all. Maybe it was exactly what we
could have expected from a president whose favorite tactic is to
turn reality upside down in hopes of gaining some political
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Clinton to be up to his neck in partisan politics
and simultaneously accuse the other side of being up to its neck in
partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   In this case _ as in so many others _ Clinton's duplicity went
beyond the simple matter of misrepresenting which games were being
played by which gamesmen. That part was just politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse was his outrageous claim that Senate Republicans had
compromised the nation's security and the safety of the world by
rejecting the nuclear test ban treaty. The truth is the opposite:
Ratification of the treaty would have jeopardized the ability of
the world's lone remaining superpower to protect itself and its
allies from nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a treaty like this is that the outlaw nations
who pose a threat to the rest of us won't obey the agreement even
if they are party to it. Does anyone actually believe that China
and Iran, for example, would suddenly shut down their nuclear
weapons programs just because they had signed and ratified a
document that many experts say is completely unenforceable?
</P>
<P>
   But the United States would obey the treaty. We always obey the
treaties. Because we're the good guys. Because we are honorable,
dependable and trustworthy _ not to mention hopelessly naive when
it comes to the intentions of less honorable nations.
</P>
<P>
   Curtailing the proliferation of nuclear arms is certainly a
legitimate and desirable goal for the United States and for the
world. But it's not a goal that can be achieved by trading the
security of the U.S. and its friends for the illusion that our
enemies share our commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, perhaps, an anti-nuclear treaty can be devised that
addresses the problem of proliferation without leaving the world's
preeminent nuclear power vulnerable to tyrants and troublemakers
who covet our status.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the U.S. Senate has fulfilled its
responsibility by saying ``no'' to a dangerous treaty. Clinton's
deceitful portrayal of what happened should make all Americans glad
that he is in the lame-duck phase of his presidency.

OKLAHOMA CITY: IT'S MORE THAN OK AS A VACATION SPOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ We bring up Oklahoma today because, frankly, no
one else will.
</P>
<P>
   That's the consensus of a recent survey conducted by the
Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation. In a telephone poll,
just 2 percent of 514 respondents from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri
and Kansas said they would consider the Sooner State as a vacation
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   That must hurt state officials who have spent $2.5 million on a
campaign to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this report shows us is that we need to spend more money
on advertising,'' Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin, head of the state's Tourism
and Recreation Commission, told The Associated Press after the
survey's release.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.2 billion question _ matching the amount of money spent
annually in Oklahoma by domestic travelers _ is whether an
advertising campaign can spur tourism. In the survey, respondents'
top two reasons for not visiting Oklahoma were ``no desire to go''
and ``nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent visitors to bustling Oklahoma City may dispute the latter
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The state's capital is approaching tourism development with an
earnestness no doubt inspired by the state motto: ``Labor omnia
vincit,'' or labor conquers all things.
</P>
<P>
   Construction sites dot the landscape, billboards tout new
businesses, and locals gather to gawk at all the action downtown,
where a renaissance is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest (tourism) problem for Oklahoma City isn't
`misconception,''' said Doug Stafford of the Oklahoma City
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``It is `no conception.' People think
about Oklahoma, and they think Cowboys, Indians and prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, `Where are the tepees?'''
</P>
<P>
   What visitors will find instead of tepees are dozens of new
theaters, museums, restaurants and attractions. Many of them are
part of the $300 million Metropolitan Area Projects program,
approved by voters in 1993. Among such projects under construction
are a sports arena, an art museum, a convention hotel, a history
center and a music hall.
</P>
<P>
   Already complete are the renovated and expanded convention
center and the new 12,000-seat Southwestern Bell Bricktown
Ballpark, home of the Oklahoma Redhawks, a Class AAA baseball team
affiliated with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing most of the spotlight, however, is the new Riverwalk.
The milelong, 4-foot-deep canal made its debut July 4, when more
than 250,000 spectators gathered on its wide sidewalks and
low-slung bridges.
</P>
<P>
   If the canal's water taxis remind visitors of a certain Texas
town, that's OK with Oklahoma City tourism officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could consider San Antonio to be our biggest competitor for
the tourism dollar,'' Stafford said. ``We did a lot of research and
found that most tourism attractions center on water. We said, `Hey,
we don't need all these streets.'''
</P>
<P>
   The canal runs through the heart of Bricktown, a century-old
warehouse district that was all but abandoned in the 1950s. The
neighborhood takes its name from the red-brick buildings. Several
fountains, a waterfall and more than 300 trees were added along the
canal, which was dug so that its sidewalks are at basement level of
surrounding buildings. This design provides for multiple levels of
canal-side dining and retail display.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute water-taxi tour is short on narration and long on
potential.
</P>
<P>
   During an August visit, a sweaty but cheerful driver pointed out
attractions and construction sites to tourists melting in the
105-degree heat as they passed restaurants such as Chileno's and
Monkey Moose Grill and the ballpark with its shops and eateries and
then crossed under Interstate 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming up to our most popular attraction,'' she chimed
as we approached the looming freeway. ``Shade.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation for the Oklahoma City visitor isn't limited to
the canal's single mile. More appealing and practical is the
Oklahoma Spirit Trolley, also created by Metropolitan Area
Projects.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in May, the trolley bus service runs on a downtown route
and a western route. The latter makes stops at the city's
stockyards and fairgrounds. The trolleys run every day, with fares
starting at 50 cents. A three-day pass costs $2.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown route provides an unnarrated tour past some of the
city's top attractions, including Bricktown, City Hall, the Myriad
Botanical Gardens and the Oklahoma City National Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is being built on the site where the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by a bomb in 1995. The fence
surrounding the construction site is still one of the city's most
frequently visited attractions; at any hour, you can see people
attaching notes, flowers and stuffed toys to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of tragedy and hope, the fence is cleared periodically.
The mementos are cataloged and will become part of the memorial's
archives.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, expected to open in April, will comprise two
massive gates, a reflecting pool, and 168 glass-and-granite chairs,
one for each of the people killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the memorial's dusty construction site is another
construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of earth are being moved to make way for an arena complex
that will house sports contests, concerts and exhibitions. The
20,000-seat arena will allow the city to host such high-profile
events as NCAA basketball tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The arena illustrates Oklahoma City's tourism-development
philosophy: Build it, and they will come.
</P>

DESPITE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA, U.S. EXPORTERS STILL WAITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pacific Northwest wheat farmers, California and
Florida citrus growers, and poultry and meat producers from around
the country were delighted in April when China, as a goodwill
gesture to the United States, agreed to end years of bans against
importing their products.
</P>
<P>
   But six months after President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji celebrated the deal at a joint news conference, not one of
the agricultural groups has seen any benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A review by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer has found that China
has not followed through on its promise to immediately remove
barriers to the purchase of the U.S. agricultural products. In the
most glaring example of the deal's false start, China has twice
agreed to send inspectors to California to start the process of
buying that state's citrus, and both times China has canceled the
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the deal is still intact, just moving slowly.
But grower groups say they believe the agreement was essentially
scuttled when NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the
United States accused China of spying. The grower groups say they
don't believe the deal will have any impact unless China is
admitted to the World Trade Organization, a complex step that was
supposed to be unrelated to this agricultural agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, it was our understanding that this was going
to be a really big deal, but it didn't turn out to be,'' said Toby
Moore of the USA Poultry &AMP; Egg Export Council. ``From our
perspective, it has done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bilateral agricultural agreement was announced at an April 8
news conference by Zhu and Clinton, who said the pact would be
``highly important for our farmers.'' The agreement was signed two
days later in Washington by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, and
was supposed to be effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, China agreed to lift longstanding bans on
the export of U.S. citrus, grain, beef and poultry. China had been
banning the import of wheat and other grains from the Pacific
Northwest for 26 years, citing concerns over a wheat disease called
TCK smut. China also had a 16-year ban against citrus from
California, Florida and other states, citing concern over fruit
flies, and had sharply limited importation of meat and poultry,
citing concerns over the U.S. inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   The bans, which Barshefsky called ``unfair trade barriers,'' had
cost American farmers billions of dollars in sales, according to
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledge that they are disappointed with the
turn of events, but say they believe the deal is still in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a slow start in implementation, but expect that
things should move forward again,'' the Department of Agriculture
said in response to inquiries by the P-I. ``We believe this
agreement is a fundamental breakthrough for American agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy did not return calls seeking
comment, but a U.S. trade official says there have been some
incrementally positive developments. In June, the United States
held a meat seminar in China, showing how the U.S. meat inspection
system works, and China and the United States have held several
scientific exchanges aimed at resolving Chinese concerns over the
quality of U.S. foods.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade official, who asked not to be named, said the two
countries haven't even finished translating the April agreement
from English to Chinese, and acknowledged that the downturn in
U.S.-China relations as a result of the bombing seemed to have
stalled implementation of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it needs to move forward,'' the trade official
said. ``We've just started re-engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   One China expert said the collapse of the deal was predictable
once the United States had rejected a separate, and supposedly
unrelated, offer China made in April of concessions to win
admission to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the U.S. side failed to endorse the Chinese (World Trade
Organization) offer, I thought there was a significant possibility
the bilateral agricultural agreement would become a casualty of the
whole affair,'' said Nicholas Lardy, a China specialists at the
Brookings Institution. ``If there is some improvement in relations,
maybe we can get them to live up to it, but in the short run, I
don't think there is a high probability of success.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. growers face other obstacles _ their products are currently
being smuggled into China through Hong Kong, China had a bountiful
wheat crop of its own this year, and China maintains high tariffs
against some U.S. agricultural commodities. But the collapse of the
bilateral agricultural agreement is a major disappointment for U.S.
growers who have been hurt by a variety of economic factors and are
eager to be able to sell to China's vast population.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Florida Citrus Mutual issued a news release calling
the bilateral agreement ``a fantastic opportunity,'' and predicted
exports this season. Today, council executive vice president Andy
LaVigne has no such hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it down the road to have a large impact on the
citrus industry, but to date it hasn't had any,'' he said. ``Until
the political unrest is settled, that's where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   California Citrus Mutual President Joel Nelson said China has
twice scheduled inspection teams to come examine how well
California growers are trapping fruit flies, but the trips, a
necessary first step before exports can begin, were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything from accusing them of spying to blowing up their
embassy has hurt us,'' Nelson said. ``This season I would
anticipate very few shipments to China.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, wheat growers are also waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was supposed to be separate from the whole WTO accession
deal, but we suspect not much will go until they finish negotiating
all of the different areas for China's accession,'' said Chris
Holdgreve, assistant director of the Wheat Export Trade Education
Committee. ``We're holding off on any celebration until we actually
see a ship go into port with Pacific Northwest wheat on it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although disasters _ from hurricanes to earthquakes
to political unrest _ can be devastating for anyone, they can be
particularly hard on children. But the special health needs of
these youngest victims often go unmet, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Children, for example, absorb nutrition in smaller doses than
adults, but few relief workers recognize that giving them a single
large meal a day, as is sometimes done with adult victims, is
insufficient. Children suffering from malnutrition should not be
treated with many common drugs, including certain antibiotics, and
they need special instruction and supervision in basic hygiene to
keep them from getting and spreading infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several pediatric health organizations have joined to
produce a handbook, ``Helping the Children,'' and a training
program for relief workers who deal with refugees and victims of
disasters to help deal with children in these situations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen Olness, a co-author of the manual and director of the
Center for International Health, affiliated with Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, said children under 15 represent
about half of all victims of natural and man-made disasters. Of the
23 million refugees in the world, about 11 million are children,
she said. Dr. Olness, a pediatrician with 30 years' experience as a
disaster and refugee volunteer, presented the manual here last week
at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a
sponsor of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are more susceptible to disease, and develop
dehydration, malnutrition and fatigue more quickly than adults,''
she said. ``In addition, the psychological trauma children
experience impacts their overall health and may affect their
personalities, behaviors and learning abilities throughout life.''
</P>
<P>
   The handbook, whose other authors are Dr. Anna Mandalakas and
Dr. Kristine Torjesen of Case Western, is aimed at relief workers
who are not child health experts. It covers such health issues as
sanitation, health assessment, infection control, treatment,
nutrition, psychological stress and children's vulnerability to
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Errol Alden, deputy executive director of the pediatrics
academy, said children have such particular needs that they should
be addressed early in a relief process, ``not as an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Olness also says there has been more awareness in the last
decade that children, particularly those separated from their
families, need protection from adults who would subject them to
sexual and emotional abuse, particularly in refugee situations.
</P>
<P>
   Alden agreed. ``You must first secure the safety of children in
disaster situations where the rules and structures of society break
down and kids are vulnerable to predators who would abuse them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the manual had been endorsed by the International
Pediatric Association, based in Paris, which represents some 150
children's health groups worldwide. ``The pediatricians of the
world, who don't always concur on every issue, agree on this manual
and hope it is made more widely available.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the book, the initiative is expanding access to a
weeklong course developed by Dr. Olness to train relief workers in
managing pediatric problems during humanitarian emergencies. Dr.
Olness said the program had applied for grants to take the course
overseas so that relief workers in other countries can be trained
to teach others about children's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross says it recognizes the special needs of
children in natural disasters and is increasingly enlisting
volunteer mental health professionals to help people cope with the
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd,'' said Leslie Credit, a
Red Cross spokeswoman, ``we had almost 250 mental health workers
deployed in North Carolina, New Jersey and other hard-hit areas
trying to educate people on how to deal with loss and stress,
including how it affects children differently than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, like adults, react initially with fear, disbelief and
stress, she said, and later may experience frustration, anger,
depression and problems with sleep and appetite. In addition,
children may start acting younger than their age, perhaps reverting
to bed-wetting and thumb-sucking, and suffer nightmares and fear of
being separated from their parents, Ms. Credit said.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson &AMP; Johnson Pediatric Institute, in Skillman, N.J., is
providing corporate support for reproducing and distributing the
manual worldwide. Printed copies are available for $12.50 by
calling (877) 565-5465. It will also be accessible on the Internet
early the next year at the following Web site:

`LAWRENCE': SHIFTING SAND BENEATH A HEROIC IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few historical figures have been as vigorously mythologized as
T.E. Lawrence, the British soldier and archaeologist who helped
lead the Arab Revolt against the Turks during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, of course, started the process himself with a
theatrical self-portrait in ``Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (1926), and
David Lean galvanized that legend with his stunning 1962 epic,
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' a movie that immortalized its hero against
the sweeping desert vistas of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest biography of Lawrence, Michael Asher, an explorer
and author, attempts to sort fact from fiction, retracing his
subject's travels across the Arabian peninsula while sifting the
biographical record for inconsistencies and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Asher is an Arabic speaker who lived with a traditional Bedu
tribe for several years, and he uses his intimate knowledge of the
Arabian desert to provide the reader with a palpable sense of the
beauties and hardships of life in that part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But while his narrative account of Lawrence's role in the Arab
Revolt often rivals Lean's movie in sheer drama, his portrait of
the man himself is decidedly more problematic, relying on
paint-by-numbers Freudianisms to decipher this most enigmatic of
men.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this volume Asher harps on Lawrence's masochistic
nature as an overarching explanation for the twists and turns of
his life. He argues that Lawrence (who was subjected to fierce
beatings by his domineering mother) developed an acute fear of pain
as a boy, and that the courage he would later exhibit in battle
stemmed from his willful ``flight forwards'' toward the very thing
he dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   Asher also suggests that the most infamous incident in ``Seven
Pillars'' _ involving Lawrence's capture, torture and homosexual
rape by the Turks of Dara'a in November 1917 _ may have been
invented (or exaggerated) by Lawrence as a means of
self-humiliation, as an act of public expiation for his failure to
carry out a mission strategic to the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   On other debated points in his life, Asher argues that Lawrence
was homosexual by nature but probably never consummated his
passion, given the horror of physical intimacy he developed as a
child. Contrary to some commentators, he contends that Lawrence in
all likelihood did ride back through the desert alone to rescue a
man named Gasim who had become separated from the Aqaba raiding
party, but he argues that Lawrence lied in ``Seven Pillars'' when
he claimed that he traversed the Sinai by camel in a mere 49 hours
to deliver the news of the capture of Aqaba to the British at Suez.
</P>
<P>
   Asher suggests, as others have before him, that Lawrence was an
expert at ``massaging the truth,'' both in manipulating public
opinion in his official capacity as a British officer during the
war and later as a writer intent on mythologizing his own exploits.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Arab slaughter of a Turkish column at Tafas in
September 1918 and the subsequent massacre of Turkish and German
prisoners (an incident some critics have taken as evidence that
Lawrence was a bloodthirsty sadist), Asher questions Lawrence's
actual involvement in the killing, suggesting that his penchant for
self-sacrifice ``may have obliged him to assume responsibility for
savage acts in which he personally had played no part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' Asher writes, ``there is a sense in which Lawrence,
the masochist, liked to absorb the sin and suffering of the world:
the duplicity of the British he bore on his shoulders, together
with the inconstancy, cruelty and barbarousness of the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy Lawrence had absorbed Victorian preconceptions of the
East as ``a place of mystery and exoticism,'' and throughout his
life he would romanticize the Arab peasant as a kind of noble
savage, possessing a childlike faith and certainty that eluded his
own ``insanely rational'' mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Lawrence genuinely tried to see things from an Arab
point of view,'' Asher writes, ``and did so more successfully than
most, his technique of `empathy' remained a method of control. He
believed the traditional Arabs morally superior to Europeans
because they were `primitive' and therefore `innocent,' but not
intellectually so. The reality of his privileged position was
stated frankly when he wrote: `Really this country, for the
foreigner, is too glorious for words: one is really the baron in
the feudal system.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asher argues that Lawrence saw the Arab leader Feisal and the
Arab Revolt as ``an expression of his own rebellion'': against his
mother, against the establishment, against the status quo. He also
points out, however, that the paternalistic Lawrence believed that
he alone could provide the Arabs with the leadership they lacked by
using the malleable Feisal as his surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the daring raid on Aqaba (which put the last
Ottoman Red Sea port in Allied hands and provided the Arabs with a
supply base in Syria), Lawrence was able to convince his British
superiors that he was ``the indispensable conduit through which
arms and money must flow to the Arabs.'' This, in turn, helped him
to persuade the Arabs that he was essential to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of rallying his Arab troops, Lawrence had
repeatedly reassured them that they were fighting for their own
independence, not to further Allied objectives, even though Britain
had already signed the Sykes-Picot agreement with France, cynically
vowing to carve up the Middle East between themselves in the event
of an Allied victory.
</P>
<P>
   Asher suggests that ``the wily intelligence officer who had at
first accepted the realpolitik of sacrificing Arab priorities to
those of the Allies became increasingly plagued by doubt,'' and
that he felt considerable guilt over his determination to raise
these ``tides of men'' on a sham promise. But while Lawrence
promised his old friend Feisal that he would fight the French for
the Arab cause in Syria after the war, he instead settled down to
write ``Seven Pillars.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence died in 1935 in a motorcycle accident in the English
countryside. A monument was later erected in the old Anglo-Saxon
church of St. Martin at Wareham in Dorset, complete with a stone
effigy of Lawrence wearing an Arab headdress and robe.

WHEN YOU GO: OKLAHOMA CITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Getting there: There is a romantic way to reach Oklahoma City,
but you have to start in Fort Worth, Texas. Amtrak has begun daily
service between the cities. Passengers arrive in the old Santa Fe
Depot, currently undergoing renovation in the downtown area. Trains
depart Fort Worth at 5:25 p.m. daily, arriving in Oklahoma City at
10 p.m. Trains depart Oklahoma City at 8:25 a.m., arriving in Fort
Worth at 1 p.m. They make several stops, including Norman and
Ardmore, Okla., and Gainesville, Texas. One-way fares on the
Heartland Flyer start at $24. Call 800-872-7245; access
www.amtrak.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lodging: Most of the city's hotels are found north of the
airport, where you'll find something for every budget.
Unfortunately for those wishing to stay downtown, choices are few.
Consider the Westin Oklahoma City (800-937-8461), where rates
reflect its position as the only luxury hotel downtown, or go for
the more budget-priced Super 8 Bricktown (800-800-8000).
</P>
<P>
   The Westin will be getting some competition early next year with
the opening of the 311-room Renaissance Hotel, which will be
connected to the Myriad Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
ACTIVITIES: &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Take a ride on the Bricktown Canal on a water taxi. The
narrated tours allow you on and off privileges all day. Cost is $5;
$1 for age 5 and younger. Call 405-234-8294.
</P>
<P>
   _ Explore the myth and reality of the Old West at the National
Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center. The museum
displays everything from masterpieces by artists Frederic Remington
and Charles Russell to artifacts such as rodeo trophies and barbed
wire. The museum is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Admission is $6.50; $3.25
for age 12 and younger. Call 405-478-2250.
</P>
<P>
   _ Savor the exotic flora of the 17-acre Myriad Botanical
Gardens. The gardens' focal point is the seven-story Crystal Bridge
Tropical Conservatory. The conservatory is open 9 a.m.-6 p.m.
Admission is $4; $2 for age 12 and younger. Call 405-297-3995.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Omniplex bills itself as a museum for the mind, offering
three museums, a planetarium, a greenhouse, and spaces dedicated to
African art and American Indians. Kids particularly enjoy the
Hands-On Science Museum. Hours vary. Admission is $7.60; $6 for
children.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Dining:  &LR; Visitors will find plenty of familiar chain
restaurants here. Head to Bricktown, though, and you'll discover
casual restaurants with character and tasty food:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pearl's Crabtown is part of a local chain that includes
Pearl's Oyster Bars. The New Orleans-inspired menu features Shrimp
Creole, Pecan-Crusted Catfish, and deep-fried specialties such as
oysters and clams. After dinner, head upstairs to the Left Field
Sports Grill with its small but busy off-track betting parlor. Call
405-232-7227.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Varsity, another local chain, offers pizza, pasta,
burgers, ribs and plenty of cold brews in a friendly sports pub
setting. Call 405-235-5525.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chelino's serves up Tex-Mex comfort foods such as cheese
enchiladas and sizzling fajitas on two decks overlooking the new
canal. If it is hot out, go for the Shrimp Cocktail _ a massive,
thoughtfully spiced soup filled with seafood and fresh avocado.
Call 405-235-3533.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach's boasts perhaps the best location in Bricktown. The
restaurant's terrace overlooks the right field of Southwestern Bell
Bricktown Ballpark. On game days, sports fans can watch the action
while feasting on barbecue, pizza and signature ales.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Life is unfair, as President John Kennedy memorably
observed.
</P>
<P>
   The scorched-earth campaign for the Senate in New York already
figuratively resembles Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's Civil
War march through the South, burning everything in sight. When it
is over, reputations will be in ruins. Fairness will not enter the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   Will this race be about issues? Much lip service will be paid to
that noble concept, and in fact the two contenders have serious
policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   But, nope, this is about personalities. Mostly, hers.
</P>
<P>
   This is inevitable. It's the way politics is.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Clinton, as a pioneering female in politics,
has always been super-visible, super-admired, super-loathed and
super-investigated. Nothing about her life as Bill Clinton's
partner has been what most wives would consider normal, in public
or private.
</P>
<P>
   How many other women live under threat of indictment from a
special prosecutor for several years and feel compelled to defend a
husband who is an acknowledged philanderer _ and are not only still
standing but slugging it out?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's campaign swing this week through New York
state highlights both her problems and her blessings as a candidate
on the ballot for the first time in her own right. Everyone in the
country knows she is running and knows who she is. The press is on
her case, big time.
</P>
<P>
   Her likely GOP opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is no
political pipsqueak and is legendary for a ruthlessness that
matches her own. He shares her take-no-prisoners mentality.
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot compete with her for national star power. He
cannot win by campaigning as the better man. He must rely on
bringing her down.
</P>
<P>
   There are no precedents. If Eleanor Roosevelt had run for public
office instead of contenting herself with using her husband's
stature to push for her own policy goals, we might have something
to go by here. As it is, no prior president's wife has had the
inclination, the political will or the independence to stand before
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is out there alone. Okay, that's the way a
campaign is supposed to be. One name on the ballot. And anything,
it seems, is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the mayor are engaged in what is
statistically a dead heat. Sometimes one is up and the other down,
sometimes the reverse. But they have never been far apart in the
polls and neither has ever held a decisive lead. This is truly a
battle royal.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans have tried to scare her out of the race,
complaining about her lack of state residence, her blind defense of
her husband's sins, her mortgage financing, her ignorance of local
issues, her Secret Service protection at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   If they think this will work, they badly underestimate her. She
has a long public record of digging in her heels when either she or
her husband is under attack. She believes that the best defense is
a good offense.
</P>
<P>
   She bought a New York home and refinanced the original dubious
mortgage arrangement. She went a long way toward defusing the
infidelity issue by addressing it and forgiving the president in
Talk magazine, after which she shot up 10 percentage points in the
New York polls.
</P>
<P>
   Her unfamiliarity with local issues can be easily solved. She is
a quick study and she is now focused. Besides, the
Manhattan-oriented Giuliani is not exactly immersed in upstate New
York issues either.
</P>
<P>
   The White House travel cocoon is a more difficult problem. As
first lady, she, as well as her husband, gets death threats. She
simply is not free to wander the New York countryside or fly the
skies on commercial airliners without official protection.
</P>
<P>
   But to defuse the complaints, she must figure out a compromise
between the law's requirements and the actual cost of using
government transportation that is not for official purposes. Under
federal election rules, she and her key staffers already repay the
government for the cost of a first-class commercial airline ticket
each time they fly on a military aircraft. But since she must use
an entire military jet, the costs far exceed the reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   It will never be totally possible to separate her duties as
first lady from her role as Senate candidate, but voters will
accept some common-sense judgments. The Republicans go too far in
complaining that taxpayers should not pick up the tab for a Middle
East trip she is planning next month as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Of course this has political implications for a state with a
large Jewish voting bloc, but from now on everything has political
implications, in this country or abroad. To say the first lady
should be grounded for her entire last year in office or abandon
her duties in that role is ridiculous. She has a history of travel
abroad as a good-will ambassador promoting equal rights for women
and further trips are a natural extension of her prior activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nemesis Kenneth Starr resigned his job Monday as
independent counsel without clearing the first lady of allegations
of lying about her role in her former law firm's missing records,
the firing of White House travel office aides and strange fiddling
with FBI records of Republicans. Asked about that, Starr said,
tersely, ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that his successor, Robert Ray, may yet indict her
hangs in the air but is highly unlikely. His official report on the
probe, however, is not going to be kind and may appear next summer
just in time to mess up her Senate campaign. Why would we not be
surprised?

   Turkish journalist Nadire Mater faces up to six years in prison
for interviewing 42 Turkish army conscripts who fought in their
country's civil war against the Kurd guerrillas. These Kurds have
been fighting for more than a decade to carve a separate state out
of a portion of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Mater edited the interviews and wrote a preface for ``Mehmed's
Book.'' The interviews give a picture of life on the southeastern
front of the war from the Turkish draftee's perspective. The book
was published in April.
</P>
<P>
   An Istanbul court banned the book in June and ordered the
seizure of all remaining copies. Mater was charged with Article
159, ``insulting and belittling the military.'' If she is found
guilty of the charges, she could be sentenced to prison for a
period of one to six years.
</P>
<P>
   Mater, as a freelance correspondent out of Istanbul, has covered
the civil war for Inter Press Service (IPS), a global news agency.
She interviewed the Turkish soldiers in order to give these
``heroes in the mountains'' a chance to talk. ``Since they are the
heroes,'' she said in a telephone interview last week, ``we should
listen to what they are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mater said she worked on the book ``in order to know the war
better _ what is it?'' Some of the Turkish draftees she interviewed
are Kurds but they do not support the independence movement nor the
militant PKK (Kurdistan Worker's Party). Nevertheless, they were
sent to fight people of their own ethnic origin. And their feelings
needed to be told, too.
</P>
<P>
   An English translation of selections from the soldiers' book was
published in the latest issue of the British periodical ``Index on
Censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In these interviews, the soldiers talk of evacuating Kurdish
villages and burning them down, of shooting old men, women and
children. They speak of the corruption in the military, of mine
detectors that don't work, of officers getting the better food, of
taking PKK guerrillas as prisoners then summarily executing them.
</P>
<P>
   The men outline the horrors of war, especially a civil war. As
one conscript put it: ``Down there you are fighting scores of wars.
Psychologically you are fighting against yourself as well as your
adversary. Whether you actually take part in a conflict or not, you
are a part of it; you have to protect yourself. If you don't want
to harm them, you are believed to be on the other side ... The
toughest of all the wars you fight is against your own presence
there against your will: your civil war against yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the interviews may insult and belittle the military, but
they are really a denunciation of the Turkish government and a
political system that has treated the Kurds as second-class
citizens and refused to make serious overtures to solve their
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to prosecute journalists in Turkey. So Mater faces
charges under Article 159: ``insulting and belittling the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a republican parliamentary democracy, but ``there is
no jury system in Turkey,'' according to Mater. She will be tried
before a three-judge panel: ``Three judges and one prosecutor _
it's a crew,'' as she put it with a rueful laugh. ``It makes no
difference, sometimes, whether you have a good lawyer or not. It
depends upon the political winds.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Staff of the Turkish military wrote a letter to the
court, Mater said, which her lawyer obtained. And in the indictment
against her, the General Staff is listed as an informer. And the
charges in the indictment, she claims, came directly from this
letter.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Turkey had a tradition of protecting freedom of
the press, Mater laughed: ``A tradition? No. (laughter) No.
Unfortunately, no. It's a pity.'' Mater has been arrested and held
in a detention center more than once while trying to pursue a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Once, she was detained with two Finnish journalists. At the time
Turkey's prime minister was holding a press conference in Helsinki
and talking about freedom of the press in Turkey. One of the
detained Finnish reporters called his editor in Helsinki and, much
to the prime minister's embarrassment, the editor asked the prime
minister about the detainment. Needless to say, the reporters were
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Political winds.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mater faces six years in prison _ for insulting the
military.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here for Americans, who sometimes think
newspapers and the media go too far, are too nasty and should be
regulated, or at least restrained, by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't insulted the American military, or the government, or
the president _ at one time or another? Should we all be locked up?
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press reporters recently uncovered an alleged
civilian massacre that occurred during the Korean War. The
reporters interviewed a number of veteran American soldiers who
fought in the Korean War and admitted gunning down 400 South Korean
refugees trapped underneath a bridge at a hamlet called No Gun Ri
in South Korea. If the accounts are true, these reporters have done
our nation a great favor and deserve serious consideration for a
Pulitzer Prize. And the soldiers who talked deserve our deep and
sad appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   The American people must know how we conduct wars. We must know
the injustices committed in our name, or we cannot begin to correct
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense has been denying the massacre for
nearly half a century. Finally, after the AP stories, the
department promises a serious investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Would there have been a Tailhook news story and subsequent
investigation had it not been for good journalism and reporters who
didn't have to fear government reprisal? That story and its
consequences put a halt to that kind of sexual partying and sexual
harassment in the military. The news story helped correct a wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope the political winds blow in favor of Nadire Mater
and the charges are dropped, but she has no constitutional
guarantees to protect her from government abuse of power and
threats of prosecution _ and, unfortunately, no jury of her peers
to see that justice is done.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson here.

Olympics, 17 teens tested positive for syphilis, more than 200 were
treated, and about 50 acknowledged being part of a ring of kids who
would meet for group sex at each other's houses while parents were
not around. Tonight (Tuesday) a PBS Frontline documentary, ``The

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Maria Diaz works full time weekdays cleaning rooms at
a hotel in the glitzy Galleria, but the $850 she brings home each
month doesn't put enough food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   So when months went by with no response to her food stamp
application, Diaz had a choice: Feed her two children or clothe
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My money wasn't lasting, so I had to pay half of the electric
bill and half of the telephone bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The working mother, her 13-year-old son, Christopher, and
8-year-old daughter, Cynthia, at first resigned themselves to
eating less. After a few months, though, Diaz, who is separated
from her husband, contacted a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her name tops a list of poor mothers in Houston who are
suing the Texas Department of Human Services for illegal
foot-dragging in the processing of food stamp claims.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, recently updated, comes at a time when Texas
leads the nation with a decline of more than a million people from
its food stamp rolls since 1995 _ a 41 percent drop vs. a national
drop averaging 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 13 percent of Texas households are either
hungry or threatened with hunger, according to a study released
last week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Only New Mexico
and Mississippi are worse off.
</P>
<P>
   Even as food stamp rolls plummeted, the number of poor families
in Texas did not. In Harris County, 27 percent of people at the
poverty level did not receive food stamps four years ago. Now, 68
percent of Houston's poor who qualify for food stamps do not
receive them, an analysis of government records shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see really high poverty rates with 13 percent
considered `food-insecure' and this big drop in food stamp rolls,
there's a real disparity there that Texas is going to have to
examine,'' said Celia Hagert, a policy analyst at the Center for
Public Policy Priorities in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, the distraught Diaz turned to Mario
Caballero, a lawyer for Gulf Coast Legal Foundation. She had
applied for food stamps in July and still had no response in
September. Next came Mayra Zamora with a strikingly similar tale.
Soon word of legal help had spread to an entire community of women
complaining of the same plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had scores of clients come in and say, `I applied three
months ago, four months ago. I haven't heard anything.' Client
after client saying the same thing over and over. This was going on
in a massive scale,'' said Caballero.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he sought local and state data from DHS that gave
substance to the anecdotal stories. In an 11-month period beginning
September a year ago, DHS' Gulf Coast region, including Houston,
had processed only 85 percent of its food stamp claims within the
30-day time frame that federal regulations require. Fifteen of
every 100 applicants were being held at bay, the numbers show.
</P>
<P>
   The Diaz lawsuit cites a 1991 court decision in a similar case,
Robertson vs. Jackson. A federal court in that case found the state
of Virginia in serious violation of federal timeliness standards
for processing food stamp claims and described the state's delays
as an ``intolerable, heartless and blatant disregard of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The court then ordered the state to process all claims in the
first month in at least 97 percent of all cases. Texas, the Diaz
suit notes, has set a goal of processing at least 95 percent of
applications on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency is investigating families too much prior to an
application being approved,'' Caballero said. ``That's why the
applications are behind. I can't say for sure that I can tie it to
Gov. (George W.) Bush, but the last three years have been bad.
People can draw their own inferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas DHS officials do not deny a problem exists, but they
insist they are not intentionally trying to discourage the needy
from getting nutritional help. Unlike the cash payments of
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps act as a
nutritional supplement not only for families on welfare but also
for the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a handout. It's to supplement a person's nutrition,
and once again the children are key here. These are services for
people who qualify. One day it may be you or me, God forbid,'' said
Hoxi Jones-Carranza, a DHS spokeswoman in Houston. ``We in no way
want to deny anyone their benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   DHS officials say the food stamp logjam arose for a myriad of
reasons: a high turnover of DHS employees as the booming economy
lures them to better-paying jobs, a constantly changing staff that
lacks adequate training, and even the agency's own success in
preventing benefits from going to those who don't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the USDA awarded the state human services agency a
record $19.7 million bonus for its ``accurate handling'' of the
federally funded food stamp program in 1998. Republican Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry praised DHS, saying the national honor shows that
``Texas can deliver social services in very efficient, effective,
and technologically advanced ways to the benefit of taxpayers and
needy families alike.''
</P>
<P>
   However, DHS officials acknowledge now that the gains they made
in accuracy resulted from more thorough investigations, with
supervisors carefully reviewing each application. That zealous
effort, in turn, has slowed the process.
</P>
<P>
   Several needy Houstonians and their advocates voice the belief
that Texas' drastic drop in the food stamp rolls is a symptom of
frustration with a system that is fraught with hassles.
</P>
<P>
   Food stamp recipients lose confidence in the system and drop
out, said Caballero. ``It's a combination of hassles and delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said each time she applies to renew her family's food
stamps (every three months), she gets a letter telling her a time
and date for her appointment to be interviewed. Usually, the letter
arrives only a day or two before the appointment and she has to
scramble to get time off from work. It often takes a full day and
accomplishes nothing.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls arriving by bus to the DHS office downtown at 8 a.m.
three times, only to wait with many others all day long. By 4 p.m.
or so, she or someone else would get up to ask (again) when they
could get their appointments. Several times, she would be told,
after waiting all day, that the person who was to interview her
wasn't even there.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, agrees Virginia Flores, another Houston woman who is a
plaintiff in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to ask for an appointment, they treated me
badly,'' she said. ``They look down on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there three or four times. One day, I showed up at 8
a.m. and they just talked to me through the little window at the
receptionist's desk. I waited several hours and the person who was
supposed to interview me never showed up. I finally called the
supervisor and she was no help either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `Come back on Monday, and when I'd go back, they'd
say, `Check back on Friday,''' she said. ``It just went on like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   DHS has offered to settle the suit, Caballero said, but so far
no out-of-court agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, improvements are under way, said Sherron Heinemann, a
DHS spokeswoman in Austin. She said that after stepped-up training
for the workers on how to schedule and interview, 94.9 percent of
Harris County food stamp applications in September were processed
within the required 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is very important to do two things when we're
providing services. One is that we provide accurate benefits to
those that qualify and that we also do that in a timely manner,''
Heinemann said. ``The timeliness, particularly in (certain)
regions, is not what we would like it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diaz case is set to go to court in May. Despite the sudden
improvement in September, the fact remains that Houston has one of
the highest food stamp denial rates in the state, Caballero said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until her lawyer stepped in, Diaz said, that her
treatment by the state agency suddenly improved. She agreed to take
part in the lawsuit to change the system for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still know other people who don't have a lawyer. They are
being treated the same way I was,'' she said. ``I hope this will
change that for everybody because it's not fair.''

   Systems has a work order / job ticket tracking system called the
AR System (Action Request System). I spoke with Stephen Veneruso
and Vicki Beckvar about the possibility of using that program to

that it is very customizable and Vicki and Stephen are pros at it.

   We would have to buy more licenses. They are sold in blocks of 5
for $10,000.00 each. The licenses are floating which means that the
software can be installed on everyones workstation, but only 5
users can use it at the same time.

   I asked Stephen and Vicki about working with them on this and
they were agreeable. Stephen said that it would be mid-February
before they could begin working on it.

   PHOTOGRAPHY IN TUSCANY
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like the names of photography workshops in Tuscany. I
understand they fill up quickly, so I'd like to make arrangements
as early as possible for next year. _ Randy Chase, Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. Tuscany, Italy, with its lovely towns and serene countryside,
is a popular region for photography workshops, and tour operators
say their programs often do fill up early. But you may be a little
too early; some have not yet finalized the details of next year's
programs, but expect to do so in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Toscana Photographic Workshops holds sessions every year in
Buonconvento, a small town near Montalcino. Next year, about 60
one-week workshops will run from June to August. Several weekend
sessions will be offered in September and October. Students and
teachers are housed in traditional Tuscan estates. The classes are
limited to 14 students, and prices begin at $1,350 a week including
accommodations and workshop and lab fees. Information: (39-05) 1636
0519, fax (39-05) 1399 626; Web address www.tpw.it.
</P>
<P>
   For one week each summer, the Toscana Foto Festival in Massa
Marittima, a small city in the foothills of the Colline
Metallifere, presents workshops (this year they ran from July 11 to
18). They cover portraits, fashion, infrared and news photography.
Courses are limited to 20 people and cost from $352 to $468.
Housing in small hotels is extra and ranges between $250 and $400 a
week, double occupancy. Meals are not included. Information:
(39-05) 6690 2756, fax (39-05) 6694 0095; www.cometanet.it/tff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Florence, the chief city in Tuscany, Click Up holds fashion
and still-life photography courses throughout the year for
beginning and advanced photographers. Sessions last a minimum of 16
days and range from $1,190 to $1,935. The school also offers
three-day workshops for $365. Prices do not include food or
housing; a list of hotels will be provided on request. Information:
telephone and fax (39-05) 5229 8548; www.clickup.net.

   HALLOWEEN ON THE HUDSON
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm entertaining my two Halloween-obsessed nephews, ages 5
and 8, next weekend. Do you know of any events in the Hudson
Valley? _ Patricia Buford, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Scary stories, costume parades and guaranteed ghost sightings
are among your options.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Hudson Valley, which manages several historic houses
along the river, has organized a Legend of Sleepy Hollow Weekend at
the Philipsburg Manor and Sunnyside estates Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, from 6 to 9 p.m., visitors to
Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow, about 25 miles north of New
York, can wander the grounds, which will be haunted by ghosts and
other frightening characters, including the Catskill Witch and the
Headless Horseman. Spooky tales will be told in the 18th-century
barn. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, there will be
more storytelling, as well as games, pumpkin carving and
demonstrations of traditional farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-minute drive away, at Sunnyside, Washington Irving's home,
there will be scarecrow-making, shadow-puppet plays and readings
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Reservations are
required for the haunted woodland walks.
</P>

<P>
   On the other side of the Hudson River, the town of Nyack (an
hour's drive from New York) will be host to its 14th annual
Halloween Parade, which the town claims is one of the largest
outside New York City, attracting some 30,000 spectators. It's an
elaborate community event, with theme floats, school bands and
hundreds of Halloween revelers showing off their costumes. The
parade is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday at McCalman
Field on Midland Avenue. Assembly is at 4 p.m. Anyone can join in.
Adults must pay a $2 registration fee if they wish to be judged in
the best-costume contest. Prizes will be awarded in Memorial Park.

   Systems has a work order / job ticket tracking system called the
AR System (Action Request System). I spoke with Stephen Veneruso
and Vicki Beckvar about the possibility of using that program to
create a separate tracking system for our department. I understand
that it is very customizable and Vicki and Stephen are pros at it.
</P>
<P>
   We would have to buy more licenses. They are sold in blocks of 5
for $10,000.00 each. The licenses are floating which means that the
software can be installed on everyones workstation, but only 5
users can use it at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Stephen and Vicki about working with them on this and
they were agreeable. Stephen said that it would be mid-February
before they could begin working on it.

   BEHIND THE MYSTERIES OF MASKS
</P>
<P>
   Over the millenniums, masks have been disguises, ritual objects,
protective instruments, mystical sources of strength, scarifying
devices and _ often _ works of art. Nearly 150 choice examples are
on view through Jan. 2 at the St. Louis Art Museum in ``Masks:
Faces of Culture.'' Thirty of them will be shown with their
complete costumes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from nearly 50 countries on six continents, ``Masks''
explores design, imagery and purpose of masks, which can be found
in nearly every culture, age and region.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes familiar faces, like an Egyptian mummy
mask and an Apollo 15 space helmet, and introduces lesser known
examples, particularly from rural Europe, Central America and
Siberia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Organized thematically, the exhibition begins with a gallery
that studies the Paleolithic origins of masks, starting with a
reproduction of the Lascaux caves in France, where the earliest
known image of a mask, used by hunters 17,000 years ago, was found.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes a section of ritual and celebratory masks that were
used to signify coronations and changes in status or title.
</P>
<P>
   A section on festival masks features 25 costume ensembles and
masks from Caribbean, Mexican, African and European carnivals and
rites of renewal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the masquerade pieces in ``Men as Women,'' and an
area with masks that figured in Greek, Japanese Noh and other
theater traditions. Darth Vader's facial armor and Scar's mask from
``The Lion King'' are on view, too.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Masks'' will move to the Field Museum in Chicago, Feb. 19 to
May 14, 2000, and to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, June 25
through Oct. 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Art Museum, 1 Fine Arts Drive in the Forest Park
section, is open Tuesday through Sunday, and admission is free.
Admission to ``Masks'' is $8, $6 for students and seniors, $4 for
children. Information: (314) 721-0072, extension 204, or

   SOUTH AFRICA MOVES TO CUT HIGHWAY DEATHS
</P>
<P>
   South African authorities say that the government is stepping up
efforts to make the country's notorious roads safer after a bus
crash last month killed 26 British tourists and highlighted the
dangers of driving in South Africa. Earlier this month, even as
reform measures were being considered, 19 people were killed and
dozens hurt in a crash in the Eastern Cape Province, bringing the
death toll to 79 in less than three weeks. Even by the standards of
South Africa, where speeding, drunken driving and unlicensed
drivers are common and traffic enforcement is rare, the toll has
been remarkably high. President Thabo Mbeki and others have worried
publicly about the effect that the bus crashes will have on the
country's reputation, which is already suffering because of its
high crime rate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most significant step taken so far has been to lower the
speed limit for long-haul buses, to 62 miles an hour from 75. A
number of other ideas remain on the drawing board, most notably
proposals that buses receive annual inspections and that passengers
on long-distance bus trips be required to wear seat belts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Automobile Association says that unless the
government also hires more traffic enforcement officers and makes
it harder to get licenses and easier to lose them, the country will
continue to have too many car accidents, according to Petro Kruger,
an association spokeswoman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A total of 9,068 people died in motor-vehicle accidents last
year, which, based on a population of 42 million, the number the
Transportation Department works from, means nearly 22 out of every
100,000. (Last year's figure for the United States, according to
the U.S. Department of Transportation, was 15.3 per 100,000.)
</P>
<P>
   With many new bus companies popping up in recent years, visitors
to South Africa should do what they can to check out the carriers
they will be using, Ms. Kruger said. The Automobile Association,
(27-11) 799-1736, will provide basic information about companies'
reputations and safety records.

   A BRITISH WEB SITE OFFERS Y2K ALERTS
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to travel by rail in Japan on Dec. 31, don't panic
if the train suddenly stops at midnight. The interruption, expected
to last only 10 minutes, is intended by Japan Rail as a precaution
against Y2K disruption. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are in Britain or France, and plan to celebrate the new
century whizzing through the Channel Tunnel by train, forget about
it _ Eurotunnel has canceled all commercial trains through the
tunnel on the night of Dec. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These travel tidbits, with implicit warnings, are among the many
that can be be found on a Web site inaugurated last month by
Britain's Foreign Office (www.fco.gov.uk). Designed as a guide for
the British public and British businesses, the Web site consists of
``country statements'' relating to the Y2K preparedness of other
countries _ 55 as of this writing, expected to increase to about
100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other implicit warnings are not to find yourself short of
cash in Taiwan at the end of the year, because banks there will be
closed from Dec. 31 through Jan. 3, 2000, to avoid the risk of
disruption. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you travel abroad at all over New Year's, be aware
that money may be hard to come by. In Mexico, for example, the
central bank is working with its U.S. and Canadian counterparts to
increase the number of notes and coins in circulation from late
December through early January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, most developed countries come off well in
the Foreign Office ``statements.'' While the Web site states that
almost anything can happen, it says that little disruption is
likely to occur in most major cities of North America, Western
Europe or Asia (including Japan and Thailand), or in Australia,
Brazil, Hong Kong or New Zealand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers to the United States are warned about ``problems with
the potential readiness of airports and transit services in small
communities and rural areas.'' The site also notes that while the
pharmaceutical industry is ready for the date change, there may be
supply problems if people decide to stockpile prescriptions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems exist in Russia _ where 400 of the 00
airports are described by a Russian official quoted by the Foreign
Office as ``sure to have some Y2K difficulties'' _ and in China
(where ``hospitals face the problem of large numbers of items of
equipment with imbedded chips and the difficulties in getting
adequate information from suppliers''). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those shortcomings could be rectified by the end of the year,
but anyone traveling to either country would be wise not to count
on it.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATING PICASSO IN BARCELONA
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso Museum in Barcelona, Spain, will hold a double
inauguration on Tuesday, adding two medieval mansions to its
exhibition space and unveiling in them what the museum considers to
be its most important temporary exhibition ever, ``Picasso:
Interior and Exterior Landscape,'' on view through Jan. 30. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The expanded museum, which opened in 1963 in a former
13th-century mansion, now comprises five adjacent medieval
mansions, or palaces, on Montcada Street, Nos. 15 to 23. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gray stone Gothic buildings, with significant Renaissance
and neo-classical renovations, belonged to local gentry until they
were bought successively by the Barcelona City Hall for the museum.
The museum expanded into a second mansion in 1970 and a third in
1982. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The newest additions, which increase the museum's size by a
third, will be used for temporary exhibitions, starting with the
show on landscapes. It features 117 paintings and 95 drawings,
engravings and ceramics, lent by 13 foreign museums, including the
Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Picasso Museum in Paris,
as well as by private collectors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show focuses on Picasso's art from 1917 until his death in
1973, including his Cubist work. That complements the museum's
permanent collection, on display in the first three mansions, which
is strong on his formative work from 1890 to 1904, encompassing his
Blue Period (1901-1904) and the years 1895 to 1904, when he lived
in Barcelona not far from the museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum, (34) 93-319-6310, is open Tuesday to Saturday from
10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed Monday.
Admission to the permanent collection is $4.50; the temporary
exhibition is $5.15 and a ticket for full access is $7.75.

MORE FLIGHTS TO THE CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 24)  
(lh) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Caribbean has long held a special allure for vacationers,
but even today the logistics involved for most Americans to get to
such islands as Nevis, St. Vincent, Bequia and St. Bart's usually
require a minimum of three flights, including at least one leg on a
puddle jumper. Not only does that make even a long weekend to those
islands nearly impossible, it also cuts deeply into a vacation. And
after American Airlines replaced most jets with turboprops last
year on routes between San Juan and other Caribbean islands, travel
time to many Caribbean destinations increased even more.
</P>
<P>
   But this winter, help is on the way, with more flights to more
Caribbean destinations.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, shortly before the start of prime vacation season in
the Caribbean, Trans World Airlines will begin adding nonstop
round-trip flights to San Juan, Puerto Rico _ but not the one or
two extra flights that airlines usually add during high season at
beach or ski resorts. TWA will add 12 daily flights year round _ a
400 percent increase over its current three nonstops. Eight of the
new flights will serve six cities on the mainland; Los Angeles;
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Orlando, Fla., will have TWA service to
San Juan for the first time. A fourth and fifth daily flight will
depart from Kennedy Airport in New York, and in Boston, the current
five-day-a-week flight schedule will be replaced with two daily
flights while St. Louis will gain a daily nonstop. TWA will also
add a daily nonstop between San Juan and Aruba, a new market for
TWA, and three daily nonstops between San Juan and Santo Domingo,
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are increasing service to the Caribbean, where
many officials complain that they are losing tourists who stay over
a night or more to other regions because of limited air service and
high fares. But others in the travel trade, including tour
operators in the United States, cite prices, rundown hotels and
little to do but water sports.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR-ROUND NONSTOP SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, United Air Lines will begin nonstop service each
Saturday and Sunday between Chicago and St. Thomas, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, and between Washington and St. Thomas. The flights are
intended to be year-round, not just seasonal. On Dec. 1, Delta Air
Lines will begin first-time nonstop service between Atlanta and
Aruba and Atlanta and St. Maarten, with one flight a day on each
route. Continental Airlines will begin daily nonstops from Newark,
N.J., to St. Thomas on Dec. 16, a route it suspended after
Hurricane Georges damaged much of the island's infrastructure in
1998. And beginning Dec. 18 and continuing at least through June,
it will fly on Saturday from Newark to Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines will begin two daily nonstops Dec. 15 between
Miami and Marsh Harbour, the Bahamas, and the next day TWA will
begin Thursday-to-Monday daily nonstops between La Guardia Airport
and Grand Bahama Island. And US Airways has begun daily nonstop
service between Philadelphia and Nassau. Although not in the
Caribbean, the Bahamas is a member of the Caribbean Tourism
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While more flights usually mean more convenient schedules and
lower fares, even TWA's big increase in flights to San Juan is
unlikely to bring sizable permanent fare cuts because a big
majority of passengers to Puerto Rico and the Caribbean are leisure
travelers, most of whom fly on discounted advance-purchase fares.
But to call attention to its new nonstops, TWA has a sale on 14-day
advance-purchase fares on those routes for travel originating
between Nov. 1 through Dec. 11 and ending by Dec. 15. These
round-trip fares include Los Angeles to San Juan for $398, instead
of the current $845 (aboard a connecting flight); St. Louis to
Santo Domingo for $348, instead of $627; and New York to Aruba for
$298, instead of $644. Reservations must be made no later than
midnight Nov. 5, and other restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stelzer, TWA's senior vice president for planning, listed
several reasons why TWA decided to go into Puerto Rico with such an
immediate strong presence. ``American Airlines' decision to serve
the Caribbean largely from Miami provided an opportunity for us,''
he said. Another reason is that the Caribbean has made a gradual
recovery from Hurricane Georges, the strongest storm to hit Puerto
Rico in 70 years. (Last month's Hurricane Floyd inflicted
relatively limited damage.) And, Stelzer said, ``our new planes
have given us the flexibility to go where we expect growth to take
place,'' and the airline expects increased traffic to San Juan and
beyond. TWA is adding 50 jets this year, and will add another 125
in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   SAN JUAN SEEN AS HUB
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Rosello, the governor of Puerto Rico, expressed gratitude
for TWA's new flights, and if other Caribbean officials are
disappointed that only two of the flights will go someplace other
than to San Juan, they've been careful not to express it. But since
American Airlines pulled most of its jets off its routes between
San Juan and other islands in the spring of 1998, replacing them
with turboprops operated by American Eagle, American's commuter
carrier, officials on those other islands have clamored for more
jet service.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines said that it substituted turboprops because
flying jets on those routes cost it millions of dollars. TWA has
apparently made a similar calculation, since its passengers
connecting to TWA in San Juan for other islands will travel on
19-seat Beechcraft turboprops. Beginning in mid-November, pending
government approval, Trans World Connection, TWA's commuter airline
operated by Gulfstream International, will fly from San Juan to St.
Thomas, St. Croix, St. Kitts and St. Maarten. Early next year it
will add Tortola and Virgin Gorda, bringing the number of Trans
World Connection flights to more than 50 a day. Each of those
destinations will be new for TWA except St. Maarten.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are also adding first-time service in the region.
They include United and Continental, which will begin new service
on Nov. 1 between San Juan and St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. Maarten
and St. Kitts, a result of separate code-share flights with
Gulfstream. On Nov. 19, American Eagle will add seasonal flights
from San Juan to Anguilla, Tortola, St. Kitts and St. Maarten, and
on Dec. 2 will reinstate a daily round-trip between San Juan and
Grenada. Last month it started a daily nonstop between San Juan and
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Two Caribbean airlines are also expanding service to the United
States. A few months ago BWIA added twice-weekly nonstop flights
from Kennedy Airport to St. Kitts. Air Jamaica, which has almost 50
flights a day between the United States and the Caribbean,
including three daily flights to Atlanta, recently began flying
five nonstops a week between Kennedy and Barbados, continuing to
St. Lucia, and two nonstops between Kennedy and Grenada, continuing
to St. Lucia, as part of a code share with Delta. And in one case,
a new airline has been added. Philip J. Pierre, tourism minister of
St. Lucia, announced that a new regional airline, Eastern Caribbean
Express, will begin operations to at least a half-dozen islands
next year.

LITTLE CHIP, BIG BUSINESS: INDUSTRY MAKES NOISE OVER TINY DSP
SEMICONDUCTORS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By TRICIA SERJU-HARRIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After placing a pair of black headphones over your
ears, the sound in the room becomes slightly muffled.
</P>
<P>
   People across the room explaining the controls for the digital
music player in your hand can still be heard. A phone rings in a
distant office.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at Texas Instruments' campus in the Houston-area city
of Stafford point out a special feature on the Lyra digital audio
player _ a simple button labeled ``DSP.''
</P>
<P>
   Then something happens that makes these seemingly ordinary
headphones turn magical.
</P>
<P>
   You push the button and all outside noise _ the people talking
across the table, the phone ringing down the hall _ disappears,
replaced by the purest quality of music ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Though digital signal processors _ specialized semiconductors
that can be programmed _ can be found in virtually every mobile
telephone, they are quickly finding their way into a host of new
consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evolution of the digital world will be powered by DSP,''
boasts Leon Adams, worldwide DSP strategic marketing manager at
Texas Instruments. ``The applications are unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   DSP is considered by Texas Instruments to be the processor that
will take consumers closer to the technology-rich world of ``Star
Trek,'' with such products as portable universal translators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look like science fiction, but it's our digital
future,'' proclaims Texas Instruments in a video on DSP technology.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make DSP chips, including Texas Instruments,
Lucent Technologies and Motorola, are quickly making deals with
companies like Cisco Systems, which makes routers and servers for
the Internet, and Thomson Electronics, which makes the Lyra and
other electronic products.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said in September it would use DSPs from Texas Instruments
in upcoming versions of its Aptiva personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DSP is already in the cordless phone. In fact, there are
already more DSPs than (personal computers),'' said Sidney Burrus,
dean of the George R. Brown School of Engineering at Rice
University.
</P>
<P>
   One of the benefits of DSP is that apart from being a fast chip,
it specializes in turning analog signals _ such as sound or light _
into digital information that can then be manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a DSP-enhanced speakerphone could be used in
conference calls to isolate the voice of one individual while
eliminating all extraneous noise.
</P>
<P>
   With DSP, sound is turned into data, and the processor is
controlled by software that tells the chip to look for a speaker's
voice. The voice is enhanced, allowing that person to come through
digitally clear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first applications of DSPs include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet audio players that allow music to be downloaded off
the Web and played on devices that are smaller than a deck of
cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadband modems that dramatically increase Internet
connection speeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital still cameras.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   But the DSP is more than gee-whiz. It's also big biz.
</P>
<P>
   The use of DSPs has grown 26 percent since 1998, partly because
the tiny devices are flexible and can fit into new, fast-changing
niches. Projections have the market jumping to $13.6 billion in
2003 from $3.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing three years ago that DSPs were going to be a
struggling company's salvation, Texas Instruments _ better known in
its heyday for making calculators and guidance systems that guided
bombs during the Persian Gulf War _ decided to focus most, if not
all, of its corporate energy on improving and selling the DSP.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear how important this chip is to Texas Instruments. The
company sold off 14 divisions while making 15 acquisitions to build
a stronghold in DSPs and analog chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have refocused our company on the DSP and analog segments
of the semiconductor market because they are large, fast-growing
and we have a commanding position in both segments,'' said Greg
Delagi, a Texas Instruments vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments currently leads the industry in the number of
programmable DSPs sold to the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company didn't invent the DSP, it was one of the
pioneers in the DSP industry, introducing the first commercially
viable DSP chip to the market in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company has a 47 percent market share, followed by
Lucent Technologies with 28 percent of the DSP market, Motorola
with 13 percent and Analog Devices with 9 percent, said Will
Strauss, president of Forward Concepts, a Tempe, Ariz., market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based company also is making large investments in the
study of DSP. In March 1996, it donated $7 million to Rice
University to fund long-term cooperative research projects
involving DSP and information engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work on longer-term research ideas, not on product ideas,''
Burrus said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems has used the company's DSPs in several of its
products, including remote access servers, which provides Internet
users dial-up access, and multiservice access routers, which direct
data flow on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``DSPs are a fundamental device in fueling the convergence that
is taking place in the telecommunications and data networking
industry today,'' said Lou Santora, vice president of engineering
for Cisco's Remote Access Business Unit, adding that DSP chips
becoming more powerful and less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   DSPs vary range in price from $2 each to $200 each, based on the
needs of the applications.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forward Concepts, Texas Instruments' DSP chips are
found in one out of three modems shipped worldwide; one out of two
digital cellular phones shipped worldwide; and in nine out of 10
high-performance disk drives shipped globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased functions, better call quality, smaller size and
better battery life in the cellular phone are good examples of what
DSP technology is enabling,'' Delagi said.
</P>
<P>
   Among its other myriad uses are helping consumers shop online
and doctors assist with operations using Web technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``DSP is a lot like the peanut,'' said TI's Adams. ``It's
incredible what you can do with it.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Fans of the PBS ``Newshour'' must have noticed by now, with
gratitude let's hope, that the program has gained two new
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Ifill, lately of NBC, and Ray Suarez, from National Public
Radio, made their debut with informed and informative interviews,
she on the new Supreme Court season, he on the mega-merger between
Sprint and MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   On a busy news day, they were joined by Jim Lehrer, the
program's proprietor, who talked with Defense Secretary William
Cohen about the debate over the nuclear test ban treaty, and by
Margaret Warner, who took a look at the Gore campaign. Terence
Smith was off for the evening, but as media correspondent since he
joined up last year, he has been doing an enterprising job on a
significant beat.
</P>
<P>
   We all have our ``Newshour'' favorites as well as features we
can do without. I tired of hearing from Mark Shields and Paul Gigot
even before they began popping up on cable, and I rarely find the
round tables of editors and other folks from here and there
particularly stimulating. Still, they all have their good nights.
</P>
<P>
   More steadily reliable are Kwame Holman, who has been with the
program since 1983 and seems able to get the gist of any subject on
short notice, and Paul Solman, who brings energy and an appropriate
touch of skepticism to his reports on business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite innovations, the interviews with officials and with
experts remain the inimitable strength of the ``Newshour.'' Its
chronic problem is the periodic lapse into formula, owing to a
guest who doesn't have much to say or the knack to say it or to a
desperate interviewer who settles for questions like ``And what do
you think about that, senator?'' Some evenings can be wearing, and
the hope is that fresh high-quality talent can stave off the
occasional yawn.
</P>
<P>
   But such talent cannot come cheap. Even if Ms. Ifill took a cut
from her pay as a commercial-network personality, she must command
a substantial salary by PBS standards, and presumably nobody wants
to court a discrimination suit by paying Suarez much less. Where is
``Newshour'' getting the money for its evidently increased budget?
Alas, the answer in part must be the commercials that have grown
like sores on this purportedly noncommercial endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commercialization of public broadcasting is being
done discreetly (the ``Newshour'' viewers who time their watching
can avoid the plugs with which the program begins and ends),
advertising of any sort runs smack against the ideal of public
broadcasting as an oasis in a desert of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ads are more stylish than others, but all are an
affront to the highest hopes of the enterprise. There is something
about a commercial that does not love common sense. On the
``Newshour,'' only the Mercedes-Benz ads, with their droll use of
old movies and their understated, allusive lines, can give viewers
the feeling that they are watching something approaching a level of
sophistication that public broadcasting proclaims for itself at
fund-raising time.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the high-class audience has to settle for vacuous
slogans from the CIT group about ``money well lent'' and the
dismaying sounds of David Brinkley ending his career as a flack for
Archer Daniels Midland. (Maybe that's grist for Smith.)
</P>
<P>
   The grants from foundations, like the Pew Charitable Trusts,
which supports Smith's work, and the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, which pays for the new ``Newshour'' unit on health
policy and Social Security, come without the commercial stigma, but
they do not suffice.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that programs even as distinguished as the
``Newshour'' have to succumb to market imperatives, it puts the
nation on notice that public broadcasting in the United States is
fated never to be able to make it in an unadulterated form. I don't
mean that Lehrer and his associates are in imminent peril of going
soft on Archer Daniels Midland, a company that evidently hopes to
shine up its spotty image by association with the likes of Lehrer
and Brinkley. But the influence cannot be wholesome. The
``messages'' themselves are an insult to viewers' intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   This is not by way of begrudging Ms. Ifill (a former
correspondent for The New York Times), Suarez or the rest of the
``Newshour'' team their good fortune: as things go on television
news, they are doing more than most to earn their salaries. What is
disheartening is that in the clutter of what passes as news on the
networks, on cable, on the Internet, so little remains untouched by
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the best of the commercial news programs, soft features
keep gaining (no day seems to pass without attention to a medical
wonder) and international news is slighted. Journalists become
entertainers, and production gizmos proliferate even while the
programs cover the same stories in the same ways.
</P>
<P>
   An hour given to Supreme Court issues and the ramifications of a
corporate merger and a nuclear treaty will not be found anywhere
but on the ``Newshour,'' but such reporting is not deemed important
enough for a government subsidy that would completely free it from
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, welcome, Mr. Suarez; welcome, Ms. Ifill. May you do the jobs
you are capable of doing unhindered by advertisers. I hope you feel
you are being paid your due. I am sure that despite the grouching
of critics, you can accept your good fortune in good conscience.
You deserve a gibberish-free environment; it's not your fault if
that is inconceivable in a gibberish-dominated public forum.

<P>
   The weather pattern in the East resembles a situation that would
precede a snowstorm during the winter. Expansive high pressure
building into New England will transport unseasonably chilly, dry
air into the region. A disturbance moving through the Great Lakes
will draw milder, moist air northward into the Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with warm, humid air along the Gulf Coast will
become active with a band of showers spreading northeast toward the
Ohio Valley. However, the air mass is generally not cold enough to
sustain snow and the disturbances are too weak to produce
widespread precipitation. There could be a narrow swath of wet snow
later Tuesday night in the northern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will dominate the Northeast, though clouds will spread
quickly into the Middle Atlantic States. Increasing onshore winds
in the Southeast will trigger a few showers near the Carolina
coast. The weather will turn dull and cool in the Ohio Valley ahead
of a weak cold front.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed rain and snow showers are expected in the upper Middle
West. A surge of warmer, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico will
rise over the dome of cool air in the South causing abundant clouds
and patches of showers from the East Texas coast to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Upslope flow along the east slopes of the Rockies in southern
Colorado and New Mexico will lead to low elevation drizzle and wet
snow in the mountains. High pressure over the northern Rockies
should sponsor sunny and warmer weather from the Southwest to the
north Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SECOND PEAK
</P>
<P>
   The peak of the hurricane season occurred about five weeks ago,
on September 11, the date on which more than 90 percent of the
time, a tropical storm or hurricane is present in the Atlantic
Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. However, during the declining days of the
hurricane season, there is a smaller maximum in the frequency of
storms that takes place in the middle of October. Indeed, the
emergence of hurricane Irene late last week and now tropical storm
Jose, which formed Monday near the Windward Islands, matches this
lesser peak in tropical storms. Both storms come after a three-week
lull in activity in the Tropics.

WILDLIFE WATCHERS HAVE A LOT TO LOOK AT IN CALIFORNIA'S PACIFIC
WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By GEORGE LAUER   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ This is an unusual year in the Pacific
waters off Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife watchers are spotting record numbers of blue whales and
sea birds. Gray whales are dining differently _ in new spots, on
different food and at different times _ and dying in inordinate
numbers up and down their migration trail from Mexico to
Washington. Huge eruptions of bait fish, krill and algae are
showing up in unusual circumstances up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   All this may be a series of coincidences, insignificant in the
larger picture. They may be connected to residual effects of El
Nino, or tidal shifts or weather changes or some other influences
no one has considered yet. But no matter what the cause, the effect
is a particularly good year to watch wildlife on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanic Society Expeditions, which operates regular
whale-watching day trips from San Francisco, has logged in the past
two months the most productive trips in the organization's 27-year
history. In August, on one of the society's trips through the Gulf
of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, whale watchers saw 30
blue whales, a one-day record. In September, another one-day trip
spotted 32 seabird species, a record in the Society's 16 years of
keeping records of bird sightings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I make a big deal about talking about how these are
not whale-watching trips, they're wildlife expeditions,'' says
David Wimpfheimer, the naturalist who led the Oceanic Society's
record sea bird trip in September. ``I like to stress that we're
looking at all kinds of marine life because sometimes you just
don't see whales. But that really hasn't been the case this year.
We're seeing a lot of whales as well as a lot of other wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine experts up and down the Western seaboard agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting time on the ocean right now,'' said
Will Borgeson, aquarist at the University of California Bodega
Marine Lab. ``The weather is fairly clement, making it easy for us
to observe things and we're seeing some significant algae blooms,
some krill and bait fish in places we don't generally see them.''
</P>
<P>
   For several days off Bodega Bay last month, acres of ocean were
turned into a chocolate sea, an eerily matte reddish brown that
robbed the water of its usual luster. Known as a ``red tide,'' the
dinoflagellate algae bloom attracted swarms of bait fish
(anchovies, most likely), which in turn attracted all kinds of
larger life under water _ whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions _ and
hundreds of birds above water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little at a loss to explain it all, but there's no
question this is proving to be a very productive year along our
coast,'' said John Calambokidis, one of the most respected whale
researchers in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks off Bodega Bay down to Point Reyes,
for instance, we saw 20 to 30 blue whales and large concentrations
of sea birds in specific areas, and that puzzles us,'' Calambokidis
said. ``If the numbers are up significantly of a certain species,
you'd think there would be a more dispersed distribution, but it
doesn't seem to be working out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   At some spots along the coast, probably where the krill is more
plentiful, blues are coming closer to shore in larger numbers than
usual. Krill, a pink shrimplike creature the size and shape of a
chubby earthworm, travel in huge swarms and are the favorite food
of the gigantic blue whale, the largest creature ever to live on
earth. Blues, which can grow 100 feet long and weigh more than 200
tons, have to eat several tons of krill a day. They go where
pickings are plentiful and easy.
</P>
<P>
   Calambokidis said the West Coast hot spots this year appear to
be from Bodega Bay to the Farallones, parts of the Monterey Marine
Sanctuary and the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Calambokidis is associated with Cascadia Research in Olympia,
Wash., which is conducting a whale photo identification project.
Over the past 14 years, Cascadia has individually identified more
than 1,000 blue whales and more than 800 humpback whales along the
California coast. Pigmentation and other unique markings on flukes,
fins and heads allow researchers to identify individuals.
</P>
<P>
   They don't get names. ``We give them affectionate numbers,''
Calambokidis said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The research has revealed larger populations of blues and
humpbacks along the California coast than previously thought.
Cascadia estimates about 2,000 blue whales and about 700 humpback
whales call California's coastline home.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown low reproductive rates among humpbacks in
these waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why, just like we don't know why so many grays
are dying this year,'' Calambokidis said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more than 40 grays have washed up dead or been
stranded along California's shore. Last year's total was 30.
</P>
<P>
   Gray whales are typically bottom feeders. They suck up sediment
from the ocean floor, sift out nourishing organisms and jettison
the rest. This year, they've been spotted out of season along their
migration trail, lunge feeding on krill and eating bait fish, like
their cousins, the blues and humpbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their unusual behavior and their high mortality rate all
suggest some sort of food related problems,'' Calambokidis said.
``We're concerned, certainly, but this could just be a cyclical
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such close scrutiny of whales is a relatively new thing so it's
difficult for researchers to see the big patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of hard pressed to say what normal is,'' he said.
``We can certainly say this is an unusual year, but beyond that, we
just don't know.''

SCOTT TUROW LOOKS AT JUSTICE SERVED IN `PERSONAL INJURIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic

<P>
   ``Personal Injuries'' &QL; 
By Scott Turow &QL; 
(Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many lawyers publishing novels these days, but there's
no one better than Scott Turow. He doesn't just churn out
bestsellers. He WRITES them, with intelligence and depth and a feel
for our fascination with the nether regions of the law _ those back
rooms and muted conversations in which the truth comes out, deals
are struck and destinies, however illustrious or tawdry they might
be, are made.
</P>
<P>
   Turow finishes a book like clockwork, every three years:
``Presumed Innocent (1987),'' ``The Burden of Proof
(1990),''``Pleading Guilty (1993)''and ``The Laws of Our Fathers
(1996).'' Now, we have ``Personal Injuries,'' a novel meant not so
much to entertain as to make us think about ambition and
compromise, and their affect on how justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most layered and introspective book Turow has written.
That doesn't mean it's his best _ there are whole chapters that
will try a reader's patience _ but it's certainly his most
ambitious. And in Scott Turow, ambition can be a mighty impressive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The character at the center of ``Personal Injuries'' is Robbie
Feaver (pronounced ``favor''), a personal-injury lawyer who with
his partner has been caught shortchanging the IRS. In this
instance, tax evasion is less a crime than convenient leverage _ on
the heels of the IRS agents comes U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who
offers to keep Feaver out of jail if he will provide evidence
against judges suspected of taking payoffs from lawyers (Feaver
among them) in exchange for favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are several judges in question, but the one Sennett really
wants is the powerful Brendan Tuohey, the man most likely to become
chief judge of Kindle County, the fictional setting of Turow's
novels. In his effort to get Tuohey, Sennett sets up an elaborate
ruse that includes fake lawyers, fake clients and fake
personal-injury cases. Project Petros, as the sting is called, will
go on for months, with Robbie Feaver attempting to record judges as
they sniff at, then swallow, his bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Turow uses these circumstances to create some memorable
characters, all laden with contradictions. Stan Sennett is an
ambitious man whose righteous convictions are served by devious and
often cutthroat tactics. Evon Miller, the FBI agent brought in to
pose as Feaver's associate and latest lover, grapples with her own
secrets (she is a poor imitation of Thomas Harris' Clarice Starling
in ``The Silence of the Lambs'') while she tries to fend off
Feaver's amorous attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The crooked judges are colorful even as they flirt with disaster
on Robbie Feaver's surveillance tapes. Barnett Skolnick is a
rambling but likeable dimwit (``There are dead men,'' Feaver says,
``who are not as dumb as Barney Skolnick'') who owes his place on
the bench to the tactics of his brother, a thug named Knuckles.
Sherman Crowthers is a huge and powerfully spoken Black man, once
one of the best defense attorneys in the county, now a judge who
rules his courtroom with rough eloquence and intimidation. And
Brendan Tuohey, the biggest prize, hides his avarice under a veneer
of serenity, protected by the loyalty of the lackeys around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the real enigma is Feaver himself, a pretty boy who appears
to have slept with every woman he has ever met (he would have sex
with a spoon if it seemed willing), yet remains devoted to his
wife, who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Feaver starts the book
as a sleazy yukster, a used-car salesman in an Italian suit and a
perpetual tan, but grows in substance and stature until we almost _
ALMOST _ understand what women see in him. By the end, he is the
novel's symbolic Good Man, and he deserves the emphasis. Caught
among the criminals, the cops and the lawyers, he is the key to all
of their ambitions, but is left with nothing to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having created such a dense abundance of character, Turow tells
his story with a surprisingly heavy hand. This is his most
descriptive book, and that's not such a good thing. He gives us the
details of everything _ rugs, desks, buildings, courtrooms,
clothing, people and, most annoyingly, the minutiae of surveillance
(it seems as if we receive an inventory of Robbie's cameras and
microphones every time he approaches a judge over the long months
of Project Petros). Once, when Robbie walks through an innocuous
patch of woods on his way to a golf-course meeting with Brendan
Tuohey, Turow describes not only the trees and the land around him,
but the settlers who had walked that way a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some slow going, and that, unfortunately, is one of
the lingering impressions of this book: ``Personal Injuries,''
which is 400 pages long, could have lost 50 and been better for it.
There's also the matter of its narrator. George Mason, who is
Robbie Feaver's attorney, begins the novel in the first person,
establishing himself as the teller of the story. His voice fades in
and out, however, giving way without warning to an omniscient
narration in the many scenes during which George is not present
(private conversations between Evon and Robbie, for example, or
between Evon and Robbie's dying wife).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your mood, you'll think this reappearing ``I'' is
arty or distracting. Or maybe, if you're feeling very generous,
you'll choose to look at it as a lawyer's tactic. After all, as
George tells us from the start, ``This is a lawyer's story, the
kind attorneys like to hear and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want action, look elsewhere. But if you want a glimpse of
the legal profession through one of its own (Scott Turow still
practices in Chicago), this is not a bad place to be. His mistakes
are a writer's mistakes, something most lawyer-novelists don't have
the talent to make. If you want proof, just wait three years. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;

   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL;

   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

BEAGLE BRIGADE HOUNDS SMUGGLERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ They're really cute. but that's not why they're there.
</P>
<P>
   If you've flown from a foreign country into the Bush
Intercontinental Airport you may have seen them. A couple of small
dogs _ beagles wearing green coats with the words Beagle Brigade.
They're working the baggage claim area where international
travelers pick up their luggage before going through customs.
</P>
<P>
   Those dogs _ and their handlers _ are employees of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. They're looking for what the USDA calls invasive species _
critters from another place that can cause trouble here.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 200 years, we've seen several thousand foreign
plant and animal species become established in this country. The
USDA estimates they cause about $140 billion a year in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of those invasive species arrive in the luggage of
international travelers. The USDA works closely with commercial
importers of food, for example, to hold down dangers there. The
mango you buy in the grocery store has been treated with hot water
to kill any pests it might contain. The mango you pick in someone's
back yard in Mexico is the one that has the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   But if you try it at Intercontinental, you're going to have to
deal with Sam and April. And Dennis and Pat.
</P>
<P>
   That's Dennis Brillhart and his beagle partner Sam, and Pat
Sheffield and April, the beagle. They're plant protection K-9
officers at Intercontinental. All of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield and Brillhart get paid more. But then again, both go
beyond the basic requirements for their job and have science-based
master's degrees. April and Sam? They work for dog treats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE WAY TO A DOG'S HEART ... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the reasons why beagles were chosen to do the job
of sniffing out food brought into this country by travelers. Like
most dogs, they have a keen nose for odors. But additionally,
beagles just love to eat. So when they successfully ferret out food
they get a small dog treat to encourage them to find more.
</P>
<P>
   Since they tend to average about 20 hits a day, the officers
have to cut usual dog treats into small bits. ``Otherwise,'' quips
Sheffield, ``the dogs would get too fat to fit into their cages.''
</P>
<P>
   The beagles are trained to find not just food, but specific
kinds of foods. You may legally bring into this country fish,
cheese, bread, candy and a wide range of other food items _ just as
long as they are processed and won't cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   So, the dogs, who come mostly from animal shelters all over the
nation, go to school for about three months to learn to distinguish
what odors are no-nos. Dogs are then matched with their handlers to
learn how to work together. When the dogs reach two-thirds of their
average 15-year lifespan, they are retired and homes are found for
them _ often with their long-time handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the dogs are only a tool, like the large X-ray
machines other USDA staffers at airport use to look inside checked
baggage. Say the dogs spot something and it's bananas. Now,
bringing in bananas from South America is OK. Bananas brought from
other areas aren't. A two-legged USDA staffer makes the final
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
'FESS UP OR FACE A FINE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I watched April and Sam work the baggage. Tails
wagging, they found friends everywhere. Who's afraid of a 20-pound
beagle _ another reason why they're chosen. Usually, their handlers
don't mind if you give them a pat or two. But don't pat the larger
dogs looking for drugs. A drug dog's reward isn't food but play
from their handlers. Patting them distracts them from their work.
</P>
<P>
   If April or Sam finds something in your luggage or back pack,
they'll just sit down. Sheffield or Brillhart will look at your
customs form to see if you've declared that food. If there's no
mention of it, they'll ask. Tell them. If you do, and it's
something that shouldn't be coming into this country, they'll just
confiscate and destroy it. Try to conceal it and and you're going
to be hit with an on-the-spot fine up to $100.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to a woman the day I was there who concealed some
fruit in a fried chicken container.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs find all sorts of weird things. A couple of weeks ago,
someone decided to bring back a live chicken in carry-on luggage.
Not something exotic like a fighting cock. Just an ordinary hen.
</P>
<P>
   Brillhart and Sheffield have worked together enough so that they
tend to finish each other's sentences. When asked about their
canine partners, Brillhart says, ``If our dogs could write a
report,'' and Sheffield finishes, ``we wouldn't have a job.''

   ALBRIGHT-AFRICA (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ Shortly after holding
a three-year old girl with a missing arm, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday met the leaders of a rebellion known
for hacking off the limbs of civilians and urged them to stick to a
fragile peace agreement to end this country's eight-year civil war.
Albright was on the first day of a week-long visit through Africa.

   WEB-CAMPAIGNING (Undated) _ The modern campaign headquarters is
no longer a rented storefront decorated with bumper stickers,
bunting and empty soda cans. It is open any hour of the day or
night. And it isn't a place at all, just an address starting with
www. If in 1996 a candidate could prove hipness simply by posting
an electronic version of a campaign brochure on the World Wide Web,
White House hopefuls for 2000 are learning to use their Internet
sites to raise money and rally troops. The Web page is the new
whistle stop, a way for candidates to bring their messages to more
people a day than they can reach on the campaign trail. By Tina
Kelley.

   PUERTORICO-NAVY (Washington) _ A presidential panel recommended
Monday that the U.S. military be allowed to resume live firing
exercises at a Navy base in Puerto Rico but ordered the range shut
down in five years, despite demands from the territory's governor
that the base be closed immediately and all bombing halted. Since
April, when a Marine pilot killed a Puerto Rican guard in a bombing
accident on the Vieques base, Puerto Rican activists have occupied
the base while the territory's politicians have argued that the
base represents an unacceptable threat to the island's livelihood
and environment. By Elizabeth Becker.

   NY-PSYCHOLOGISTS-UNION (New York) _ The New York State
Psychologists Association is joining the American Federation of

push by psychiatrists to limit the scope of psychologists'
practice. By Steven Greenhouse. (1200 words)

   NISSAN-CUTBACK (Tokyo) _ The Nissan Motor Co. has stunned Japan
and the global automotive industry with details of an unprecedented
overhaul plan that makes cuts far deeper than had been expected at
the No. 3 Japanese auto maker and will reverberate throughout the
economy. Under the plan, designed by the company's aggressive new
chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, Nissan will close three
plants, eliminate 21,000 jobs, halve its supplier base, close 10
percent of dealerships and return to profitability in the next
fiscal year, which will start April 1. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA (Undated) _ For most people with asthma, the proper
use of medication, education and self-management can go a long way
to keeping them out of the emergency room functioning at home,
school or work, experts say. But sadly, many patients with the
diseases fail to adhere to the regimen and many others simply do
not understand it. By Denise Grady.

<P>
   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Twelve years ago, the stock
market crashed in the largest one-day fall ever. Now, by some
measures, the stock market is even more volatile than it was then.
Volatility can sharply increase, as it did in 1980, when a leading
sector _ then, energy stocks _ has risen to unsupportable
valuations. It is possible that the current surge in volatility is
foretelling a similar turn in this era's dominant sector,
technology. Not all increases in volatility, however, tell such
stories. New ways of trading, brought on by technology and
financial engineering, can roil the markets until other traders
become used to the impacts generated by such trading. That was true
of institutional block trading in the 1970s and computerized index
arbitrage in the 1980s. And it may be true now of Internet-based
day trading. By Floyd Norris.

MOLINARI STUNS REPUBLICANS BY SWITCHING FROM BUSH TO McCAIN  
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stole one of Gov. George
W. Bush's most influential New York backers Monday, dealing a blow
to the Texan's presidential campaign in a crucial state.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that stunned Republicans around the country, Staten
Island Borough President and former U.S. Rep. Guy Molinari publicly
withdrew his support for Bush at a New York news conference and
handed his endorsement to McCain, who stood beaming at his side at
the Vietnam Memorial in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, the father of former Rep. Susan Molinari, who has also
endorsed McCain, will become the senator's New York chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, who ran the 1988 New York campaign of former President
George Bush and urged the governor to follow in his father's
footsteps, said he decided to ``place principle above politics'' by
swinging his support to McCain, whom he described as having a
``fierce streak of independence'' on issues even when they conflict
with those of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are looking for leaders. Sadly, there aren't many
out there anymore who will stand up independently for what they
believe,'' Molinari said. ``Too many candidates, both Democrat and
Republican alike, define their beliefs and shape their convictions
by taking polls. John McCain is a notable exception, and I respect
him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bush as ``the present front-runner'' in the race
for the 2000 GOP nomination, Molinari said he still has ``great
respect and admiration'' for the governor, whom he once called
``the best candidate'' for president in 2000. But Molinari added
that he has no reservations about switching his time and political
resources to helping McCain beat Bush in the New York state primary
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Molinari served together in the U.S. House for
several years, and the senator said he was ``humbled'' by his old
friend's decision to back his candidacy. With his help, McCain
said, ``We can win New York.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush tried to shrug off the the desertion.
``That's what happens in politics,'' he said during an Arizona
campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker also sought to
play down the significance of Molinari's switch by emphasizing that
the governor still has the support of New York's two top elected
Republicans _ Gov. George Pataki and New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we have a really strong organization in New York,
and we hope to have Guy Molinari's support when Gov. Bush wins the
nomination,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari dismissed reports that he decided to pull his support
for the Texas governor because of an on-going feud with Pataki. The
two men, Republican sources said, have often disagreed over how to
direct Bush's New York campaign effort. Their disagreements came to
a head recently when, the sources said, Pataki insisted that Bush
forego a visit to Staten Island earlier this month in favor of
making three stops in Manhattan boroughs considered to be
Democratic strongholds. Molinari was said to have taken the
decision as a ``personal snub.''
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Molinari was also upset over Empire State
Development Corp. Chairman Charles Gargano being recommended by
Pataki to run Bush's state campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Molinari, when pressed about it, said Pataki ``played no
role'' in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush is considered the top contender for the GOP
nomination, McCain has been moving up in recent polls. Bush still
maintains a commanding lead among registered Republicans and
independents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the senator has declined to criticize or engage Bush
directly on issues, except to say, as he did Monday in a speech to
Vietnam veterans, that he's unclear what Bush's positions on issues
are.
</P>
<P>
   McCain seems in favor of engaging Vice President Al Gore on a
number of issues, including the recent Senate defeat of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   McCain challenged Gore, who is running against former Sen. Bill
Bradley for the Democratic nomination, to a debate on the issue
Sunday. He accused Gore of playing politics with the treaty by
remaining silent before the vote and then airing a campaign
commercial critical of Republican senators, including McCain, for
voting to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president was completely absent from the debate. I do
not know of a single senator who was called or written to by Vice
President Gore urging his or her support for the CTBT,'' McCain
said ``I've always found it more useful to support a treaty before
it is actually voted on, but better late than never, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ... vice president sincerely wants to enhance the
treaty's prospects in the future, he should think about debating
its merits rather than disparaging the motives of its opponents,''
McCain said, reissuing his challenge to Gore to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Gore would gladly debate McCain if he became
the Republican nominee.

 &HT;        NASA Awards $20 Million to Small Businesses 
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct.18 - NASA will give $70,000 each to 220 small
businesses in 34 states for research and development, in the first
phase of a program to help little firms conduct work related NASA
missions that have commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   Three Houston firms won awards in the first phase of NASA's
Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR), which will
allocate a combined total of $20 million for 290 research and
development proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Astro Technology of Houston is one of the recipients. The
six-person firm will get $70,000 to develop fiber-optic sensors for
a robotic hand that NASA already uses on its space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   Astro then hopes to put the sensors on the commercial market for
a variety of uses, such as deep-water oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go after those programs that have commercial
potential,'' said Astro president David Brower.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created SBIR in 1982 to help small businesses conduct
research and development that benefit federal agencies, as well as
the private sector. 40 percent of the proposals chosen for Phase I
will be chosen for Phase II, which will allocate an additional
$600,000 each to proposals that stand a good chance in the
commercial market.

ANALYSIS: MILITARY COUP UNLIKELY TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Pakistan's new dictator, Gen. Pervaiz
Musharraf, essentially told the nation Sunday that he had to
destroy democracy temporarily to save it.
</P>
<P>
   His was a familiar message in a country where military despots
have ruled for 25 of its 52 years. Many in Pakistan, including some
in the liberal intelligentsia, desperately want to believe in the
general after a decade of corrupt, incompetent and often autocratic
elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But if history has a lesson to teach in Pakistan _ a still
feudal society of 150 million where more than two-thirds of adults
cannot read _ it is that each episode of repressive military rule
makes democracy weaker, not stronger, say some social critics and
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The generals promise democracy, but are too impatient to wait
for voters to boot out bad elected leaders. They give lip service
to an open society, but crush dissent. And when these men,
unschooled in the arts of managing a government or an economy,
finally hand power back to politicians, the problems still loom
large.
</P>
<P>
   With his ramrod demeanor and personal vow of integrity,
Musharraf embodies the hope that an honest tough guy can fix what
ails Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In his nationally televised address Sunday evening, he promised
to root out corruption, restore the economy and ``true'' democracy,
show restraint with Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and respect freedom
of the press _ which he somewhat ominously said he trusted would
``play a positive and constructive role.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that as Pakistan's ``chief executive'' he was ready
to resume talks with its rival and neighbor, India.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly meant to reassure a world nervously eying a
coup in an avowedly nuclear power, and more particularly the United
States _ which has yet to decide whether to support a continuing
economic bailout _ and which has been pressuring Pakistan to resume
negotiations with India.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's offer of talks was regarded with skepticism in
India. The general, who was Pakistan's army chief, is held
responsible here for having brought his country to the brink of
all-out war with India this summer over a portion of the Himalayan
territory of Kashmir called Kargil.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries want Kashmir for their own and their conflict
over the area has flared periodically since they were created from
the British Indian empire in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   If a leader is to judged by his record, Musharraf has not had an
auspicious beginning. The Kargil conflict, the most notable action
of his year-long tenure as army chief, was a diplomatic fiasco. For
more than two months, Indian troops battled to drive out hundreds
of infiltrators now believed to have been mainly Pakistani army
regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's incursion ended ignominiously when the now-deposed
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, bowed to American pressure and called
for the unilateral withdrawal of the Pakistan-backed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pearl Harbor, the operation was brilliant tactically, but
disastrous strategically, said Stephen P. Cohen, an expert on the
Pakistani army at the Brookings Institution in Washington. And
India has not forgotten or forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a government here which would perceive Pervaiz
Musharraf as the man behind the Kargil misadventure,'' said P.R.
Chari, director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in
New Delhi. ``So they're not going to feel like kissing and making
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those who doubt that relations with India will markedly
improve say it is unlikely the general will create any new large
scale mischief soon because he is confronting a more serious and
immediate problem: Pakistan's crumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Its economic lifeline has been endangered by the coup. Pakistan
is awaiting a $280 million installment of a $1.56 billion line of
credit from the International Monetary Fund, but the military
takeover may further jeopardize the loan, which had already been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is down to about $1.5 billion in foreign exchange
reserves, at most enough to pay for two months of imports _ oil,
food and other essential commodities. Their loss could lead to even
greater hardships for Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the most important voice in deciding whether
to go forward with the loan, has not yet stated a position.
American officials have condemned the military takeover and called
for a return to democracy, though not for Sharif's restoration. And
they are clearly worried about the prospect of a nuclear-armed
Pakistan disintegrating economically.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the American ambassador, William B. Milam, described
Musharraf as ``a moderate man who is acting out of patriotic
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have business with governments, good governments and bad
governments,'' he said. ``We will have to do business with this
government. I don't know how much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the military is unlikely to pursue the
deeper social reforms that would produce a more educated, assertive
electorate. Most of Pakistan's federal budget now goes to the
military and debt service. And the military has always jealously
guarded its share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that Pakistan has not devoted significant resources
to health, education, repairing irrigation canals?'' asked Gowher
Rizvi, a former professor of international relations at Oxford
University who now directs the Ford Foundation's South Asia
operation. ``It's because the military takes the largest chunk of
the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Musharraf said he had had no choice but to
sacrifice a limb (the constitution) in order to save the body (the
nation). But one could also say that Pakistan is like a body
builder who has over-exercised one portion of his anatomy (the
military), while others (democratic institutions) have withered.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the weakness of Pakistan's democracy are
complex. It has a landed feudal class that was not subjected to
vigorous land reforms as in India. The country never developed mass
political movements of the poor and oppressed. Its bureaucracy is
highly politicized and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   And it has a military that sees itself as the last bastion of
honesty and stability _ and has often short-circuited the slow,
painful and flawed democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military could do good if the leaders of the new
government are truly brilliant, economically informed, politically
adept, principled, tolerant of genuine dissent and protective of
human rights,'' said George Perkovich, a South Asia expert. ``But
men of such virtue are extremely rare anywhere, let alone in
Pakistan.''

CLINTON TO MEET WITH GOP LEADERS AFTER VETOING FOREIGN OPERATIONS
SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton stepped up his showdown with
Republicans as he vetoed a foreign operations spending bill Monday
and called on congressional leaders to meet with him to resolve the
2000 budget impasse.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, enmeshed in a spending dilemma of their own
creation, agreed to a White House session Tuesday, contending
Clinton has conceded there will be no money taken from the Social
Security surplus. But Clinton accused them of already spending the
surplus, making the issue a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said there will be another stopgap spending measure
necessary to avoid a government shutdown. A 21-day temporary
spending agreement expires at midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to finish the job the American people sent us
here to do _ reach real results in educating our children, fighting
crime, protecting the environment _ then we have to put politics
aside and seek common ground,'' Clinton told reporters after
vetoing a $12.6 billion foreign operations bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that spirit, I am inviting the congressional leadership to
come here and meet with me and our economic team at the White
House, to see if we can agree on an overall budget framework,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The session would be the first this year on the budget.
Republicans initially intended to avoid a summit with the president
because they felt they had lost past battles to curtail spending
amid the budget surpluses, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the White House
wants to meet with congressional leaders ``to talk about how we can
complete this spending cycle on the budget without touching Social
Security. That's music to my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton told reporters that Republicans already have spent
portions of the surplus and ``everyone but them'' has acknowledged
it. He cited a recent Congressional Budget Office report that
Congress was on track to spend $16 billion to $30 billion of Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in being able to walk out of here and win a
(political) battle on whether they spent the Social Security
surplus or not _ as a matter of fact, they have, and it's been
acknowledged for months, but that's not the point. The point is, we
need a responsible budget here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey and other Republicans, however, received a letter from CBO
stating that, using different budget numbers, Congress was not
dipping into the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he vetoed the foreign operations bill because it
excluded his spending priorities, including removing money for the
Middle East peace process and funding to Russia to continue
dismantling some nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me to be the next big chapter in the new American
isolationism right after the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,''
Clinton said, linking the foreign operations bill to the Senate's
rejection last week of the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign operations spending bill was $2 billion less than
Clinton requested and $2.7 billion less than the 1999 spending
level.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said the GOP version was ``a responsible measure to
make the investments critical to U.S. national security without
spending one penny of the Social Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 spending bills, but Congress has yet to complete
work on all of them. The 2000 fiscal year began Oct. 1. The
president has signed five spending bills and rejected two. Three
others are pending on his desk and may face a veto. Congress is
still working on three others, including the Labor, Health and
Human Services and Education bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both Armey and Clinton said a second stopgap spending measure
will be needed this week. Armey said the temporary spending likely
would be extended by another week.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to adhere to their pledge not to spend the Social
Security surplus without major spending cuts, Republican leaders
last week agreed to reduce spending across-the-board in the
remaining three measures, contending cutbacks would amount to 1
percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the reductions
would amount to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a devastating cut to hundreds of thousands of
families around this country,'' Lockhart said, citing spending
reductions in education, services for women and infants, and for
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're more concerned at this point with losing a
political fight and less concerned with getting this done in a way
that makes the right investments and guards our fiscal
discipline,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans this week will consider, and then defeat,
Clinton's proposed tax increases on tobacco companies and plan to
close corporate loopholes. The vote would be a symbolic statement
on their efforts to hold the line on both tax increases and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leadership plans for resolving the budget problem
such as creating a ``13th month'' or delaying tax credits back to
the working poor have been denounced by other GOP members as well
as Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a front-runner for the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Pew Research Center for People and the
Press found the approval rating for Republican leaders in Congress
fell to 34 percent, its lowest level since June 1997 when it was 33
percent. However, Clinton's approval rating stood at 59 percent.

COURT UPHOLDS SEARCH WARRANTS ARE NEEDED AT CRIME SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is no exception for crime scenes to the
Constitution's requirement of a search warrant, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday. The unanimous opinion overturned a West Virginia
man's conviction for murdering his wife and reaffirmed a principle
the court established 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man's conviction may have been influenced by photographs the
police took from a briefcase they found at the scene and opened
without a warrant. The photographs, introduced at the 1996 trial of
the man, the Rev. James Flippo, over his objection, suggested that
he was having a homosexual relationship with a member of his church
and provided a possible motive for killing his wife, a crime that
he told the police had been committed by an unknown intruder.
</P>
<P>
   In allowing the photographs into evidence, the trial court said
the police ``were clearly within the law'' to examine ``anything
and everything found within the crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was a misstatement of the law, the unsigned Supreme
Court opinion said Monday, one that ``squarely conflicts'' with a
1978 precedent by which the court rejected a ``murder scene
exception'' to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A warrantless search by the police is invalid unless it falls
within one of the narrow and well-delineated exceptions to the
warrant requirement,'' the justices said Monday, noting that there
was no emergency or danger to the police or others that would have
precluded getting a warrant after the site of the crime, in a
remote state park, had been secured.
</P>
<P>
   The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld Flippo's
conviction and his prison sentence of life without parole. The
minister's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, brought by the public
defender's office in Charleston, W.Va., presented an issue that was
evidently so clear to the justices that they proceeded to decide it
without hearing arguments or calling for further briefing. That is
a once-common practice that is now relatively rare, given the
court's deep divisions on many important issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1978 precedent, Mincey vs. Arizona, the court saw the
question as equally obvious when it unanimously rejected the
Arizona Supreme Court's creation of a ``murder scene exception'' to
the warrant requirement. In that case, homicide detectives
conducted a warrantless, four-day ``exhaustive and intrusive''
search of the apartment where the defendant had fatally shot a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the state's argument that the man had forfeited any
reasonable expectation of privacy by shooting the officer in the
first place, the court said that ``this reasoning would
impermissibly convict the suspect even before the evidence against
him was gathered.'' The opinion, by Justice Potter Stewart,
continued: ``the mere fact that law enforcement may be made more
efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday, Flippo vs. West Virginia, No. 98-8770,
addressed only the application of the 1978 precedent, sending the
case back to the state courts with other issues unresolved. State
prosecutors remain free to argue, for example, that Flippo in
effect consented to the warrantless search by summoning the police
to the vacation cabin, where he said both he and his wife had been
attacked. The state is also free to argue that the photographs did
not play an important role in his conviction, and that their
introduction at the trial was ``harmless error'' in light of other
incriminating evidence presented by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the other developments on a generally quiet day
at the Court.
</P>
<P>
   RAILROAD SUITS: For the second time in six years, the justices
agreed to decide whether suits brought under state law against
railroads for accidents at grade crossings are pre-empted by the
federal law governing grade-crossing safety.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 Supreme Court decision on the subject, CSX Transportation
vs. Easterwood, has caused considerable confusion in the lower
courts. That decision held that if federal money had been used to
install warning devices at crossings, and the devices met federal
standards, people could generally not sue on the ground that the
devices were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the case the court accepted Monday, Norfolk
Southern Railway vs. Shanklin, No. 99-312, raises the further
question of whether, in order to bar lawsuits, officials of the
Federal Highway Administration, which runs the federal program to
improve grade crossing safety, must have inspected a particular
site and approved the selection of the particular devices.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, imposed
that further requirement in upholding a $430,000 jury verdict won
by the widow of a man who was killed when a train hit his car at a
rural Tennessee grade crossing that was equipped with reflective
warning signs but not with an automatic gate.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Norfolk Southern is arguing that the appeals
court's approach requiring specific on-site inspection ``cannot
reasonably be administered.'' The appeals court said the
requirement was necessary because if railroads could avoid
liability simply because federal funds had been spent, while at the
same time the federal agency was not required to check on whether
the money was used properly, then ``no one is responsible for the
safety of the motorists who use the crossing.'' A $3 billion
federal program helped pay for improvements at 30,000 grade
crossing over the past 25 years, cutting fatalities by more than
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   EXPANDED ARGUMENT: The court took the unusual step of
rescheduling a case that was argued earlier this month for a second
argument, early in the new year, and of instructing the lawyers to
address additional questions at that time. The case is Slack vs.
McDaniel, No. 98-6322, an appeal by a Nevada prison inmate whose
effort to challenge his murder conviction through a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus was denied by the lower federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Antonio Slack, initially filed his petition before
the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 took
effect, imposing new hurdles to habeas corpus review. In accepting
his appeal last spring, the justices assumed that the new law did
not apply. But now they evidently believe that it might, and have
asked the lawyers to address the new law's potential implications
for prisoners like Slack, who seek to add new issues to an existing
habeas corpus petition. One question is whether the new issues
should be treated as a second petition, which the 1996 law
essentially bars.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key early backer of Texas Gov. George W. Bush
defected to a rival presidential campaign on Monday, offering
another reminder that the race for the Republican nomination is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Congressman Guy Molinari, a name with
considerable clout in delegate-rich New York GOP circles, switched
his allegiance to Sen. John McCain of Arizona in the latest a
series of bumps for what had been the smooth-running Bush campaign.
Although Bush remains the clear frontrunner in the GOP contest, his
efforts to set himself apart from the pack have alienated some
important factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush angered Republican lawmakers by accusing them of
trying to balance the federal budget ``on the backs of the poor.''
Then he seemed to go after social conservatives by saying that his
party sometimes seems obsessed with ``an image of America slouching
toward Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush's once-surging poll numbers, while still
impressive, have begun to level off. He continues to hold a
commanding lead in every credible poll, capturing more than 40
percent of the vote in a six-person race.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more I wonder if George W. hasn't `Forest Gumped' his
way into this,'' said New York pollster John Zogby, referring to
the movie character with an uncanny knack for turning up at the
right place at the right time. ``We're one inch from a real race.
Whether or not it will happen, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one suggests that Bush is an any immediate danger of
losing his frontrunner status, there are enough uncertainties to
give his rivals hope. He is scheduled to participate in the first
of a series of presidential debates on Dec. 2, giving the other
candidates a chance to exploit any gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers are also bracing for a bruising ad campaign by
rival Steve Forbes, the only candidate who can match Bush's
campaign bankroll. Forbes, a millionaire magazine publisher, is
preparing a series of ads that will attack Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will engage and do what I'll call contrast advertising when
the time comes,'' one Forbes adviser said. ``I'm not going to tip
my hand by saying when that will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the concern in Bush's camp, the candidate's media
experts recently tested possible Forbes attack ads, as well as
Bush's likely response, on focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's McCain, who has emerged as Bush's closest rival in
some recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he drops four or five points and McCain moves up four or
five points, it's a race,'' Zogby said of the polls. ``McCain has
the potential to take off. People can visualize him as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, a leader in the effort to coax Bush into the race,
said he changed his mind after comparing the two candidates. The
former Republican congressman currently serves as Staten Island
borough president, a job that gives him considerable clout in a
heavily Republican section of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frontrunner always starts to fade. This could become a
real horse race,'' Molinari said. ``Somebody had to emerge as a
challenger. I think it's pretty clear at this point that John
McCain is that Number 2 challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, who once called Bush ``the best candidate the
Republican Party can put forward,'' said he was stunned when Bush
criticized congressional Republicans. Molinari had personally
lobbied lawmakers to support the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave him such tremendous support, and then he turned
around and bit them,'' he said. ``There is some ill will about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also scored points with Molinari by urging conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan to leave the Republican Party. Bush said
Buchanan should stay with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded to Molinari's defection with a terse
statement inviting him to reboard the Bush bandwagon ``when Gov.
Bush becomes the Republican presidential nominee.''

PENTAGON ASKS FOR DIALOGUE TO END STANDOFF ON TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration pleaded Monday for
Puerto Rico's political leaders to open discussions with the
Pentagon on resumption of target practice on the island of Vieques
after a presidential panel failed to find a compromise acceptable
to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon panel, appointed at President Clinton's request,
recommended that the Navy and Marine Corps should be permitted to
use the target range for 130 days a year in order to get forces
ready for possible combat.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old bombing range has been closed since April 19
when a Marine pilot mistakenly targeted a range observation post,
killing a Puerto Rican security guard working for the Navy, and
wounding four civilian personnel working on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello and allies in Congress have
demanded a permanent end to Navy bombardment and a phased Navy
withdrawal from the island, where more than 9,300 civilians reside
on a swathe of land about 10 miles from the bombing range.
Rossello's representative in Washington reiterated those goals
after the four-member panel's report was released.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the panel's report, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said he would await the outcome of ``further discussions'' before
making his recommendation to the president on the future of the
bombing range. Cohen said he had asked the panel members to have
further talks with representatives of Puerto Rico, Vieques and the
Navy in an effort toward ``achieving consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon panel also recommended immediate Navy closure of an
8,000 acre ammunition depot; phased Navy withdrawal from 16,000
remaining acres by 2005; and Navy support for economic development
and studies of residents' claims that 58 years of target practice
has contributed to a high incidence of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After the panel released its report Monday, Hillary Rodham
Clinton broke months of public silence on the topic and issued a
statement during a visit to upstate New York in which she expressed
support for the Puerto Rican campaign to end the Navy's use of the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live ordinance training should not take place on a small,
inhabited island,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``There should be an
immediate and permanent end to the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton echoed the Clinton administration's call for
continued efforts at compromise, however, saying: ``I hope the
parties will keep working on this matter to the satisfaction of all
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of New York's 2.6 million Hispanics are U.S.
citizens born in Puerto Rico and Mrs. Clinton is hoping for their
support in her pending run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic lawmakers from electorally important states, including
California, New York, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey and Arizona, have
also taken up Puerto Rico's demands that the Navy should leave
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Alcides Ortiz, director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs
Administration and the representative for Puerto Rico's governor in
Washington, D.C., rejected the panel's recommendation for
resumption of live fire training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to negotiate,'' Ortiz said. ``I don't think
anything has changed _ the permanent cessation of the bombing
exercises is not open for negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said that the Rossello administration will only discuss
Navy withdrawal and the transfer of Navy-owned land to Puerto Rico,
as well as cleanup operations at areas where exploded and
unexploded ordnance pose a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, where dozens of protesters have camped out on the
target range since April to prevent resumption of bombing,
demonstrators expressed concern that the Navy might use the panel's
recommendation to resume target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ventura, president of the Fishermen's Association of
Southern Vieques, said it remains ``unacceptable that the Navy
start exercises again,'' adding that fishermen would continue their
civil disobedience protest.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig accepted some of the
recommendations of the report and said the Navy will immediately
take steps to improve the Navy's relationship with the people of
Vieques, including seeking a meeting with Puerto Rico's leaders to
map greater economic assistance, the return of Navy-owned land and
construction of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said he had asked the Pentagon-funded think tank, the
Center for Naval Analyses, to study possible alternatives to the
training facility on Vieques that began operations in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have believed from the beginning of the current situation
that both the legitimate national security needs of the United
States and the needs of the residents of Vieques can be
accommodated,'' Danzig said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the president believes that the Pentagon panel has established the
basis for a ``open and free dialogue'' among officials from the
Pentagon, the Navy, residents of Vieques and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Clinton is hopeful that the parties will find
a solution that balances national security with the needs of the
people of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon-dominated panel included Frank Rush, acting
assistant secretary of defense for force management policy; former
House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.;
retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard Neal; and retired Navy Vice Adm.
Diego Hernandez, a native of Puerto Rico.

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Mental health professionals, including social
workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, may expect to see an
increase in psychological difficulties among certain groups of
people as the year 2000 approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these individuals believe that the year 2000 will mark
the beginning of the apocalypse. Cults and extreme religious sects
have been predicting an apocalyptic conclusion to the 20th century
for quite some time. Similar problems occurred a thousand years ago
when a segment of the population believed that the world was coming
to an end around the 1,000th anniversary of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   This pre-millennia tension is increasing in some circles because
of the belief that our technology is going to fail, and that our
society will become chaotic and return to primitive-like existence.
</P>
<P>
   Other mental health authorities predict increases in suicides
and domestic tensions within families before the end of the year.
Unfortunately, if enough people believe that terrible events are
going to occur because of a predestined prophecy, then they may act
out their beliefs in spite of objective reality.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting variation of this ``millennium madness'' is
known as the ``Jerusalem Syndrome.'' An Israeli mental health
professional, Dr. Yair Bar-el, is credited with identifying and
naming this problem. Dr. Bar-el, who directs a psychiatric hospital
in Jerusalem, first noted the problems in the early 1970s. This
rather bizarre psychological condition seems to affect visitors to
Jerusalem, causing them to believe that they are on a mission from
God and proclaim that they are ancient religious figures. Jesus,
Moses and the Virgin Mary are the three most frequent choices, but
Samson, John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene have also emerged as
assumed identities.
</P>
<P>
   Often, these individuals tend to have pre-existing psychiatric
problems, but interestingly enough, a smaller sub-group appears to
have no history of psychological difficulties prior to the
development of the Jerusalem Syndrome. Some of the effected
individuals don white sheets, toga-like clothes and start singing
hymns or preaching. The afflicted generally recover after a week or
so and usually express embarrassment and a lack of willingness to
discuss their departure into ``never-never land.''
</P>
<P>
   An influx of long-term visitors has already begun to settle in
Jerusalem. Preparation is beginning to be made to deal with the
anticipated increase in ``Jerusalem Syndrome'' that is expected to
occur in the next few months.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1987, the stock market seemed to go crazy, with
prices first soaring and then plunging _ a process that culminated
in the crash 12 years ago Tuesday. The volatility, which was
greater than at any time since the 1930s, stunned and scared
investors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by some measures, the stock market is even more volatile
than it was then.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true in the NASDAQ market, where sudden
price moves are more common than at any time since the NASDAQ
composite index was created in 1971. The market of large stocks, as
reflected by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, is not as
volatile, but it, too, is far less steady than it was a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That volatility has grown to the point that most investors have
become inured to big daily moves. Only a decade ago, the NASDAQ
composite averaged about one big day _ defined as a close at least
1 percent above or below the previous day _ each month. So far this
year, it is averaging three such days every week.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider how rapidly a new high for the NASDAQ index can
crumble. Twenty years ago, in October 1979, the index plunged 8.5
percent within three days of setting a record. That came after the
``Saturday Night Massacre,'' when Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve
chairman, abruptly announced a change in Fed policy that sent
interest rates skyrocketing and soon brought on a recession. Until
this year, that was the record for biggest fall within a week of
setting a record.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, the index fell 9.7 percent in five trading days
amid a sharp selloff in the technology issues that have come to
dominate it. The current plunge is not quite as steep, with the
index down 7.8 percent since it peaked last Monday. That makes it
the third-sharpest decline from a record close in NASDAQ history.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid increases in volatility reflect forces both within the
stock market and outside of it. Volatility can sharply increase, as
it did in 1980, when a leading sector _ then, energy stocks _ has
risen to unsupportable valuations. It is possible that the current
surge in volatility is foretelling a similar turn in this era's
dominant sector, technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not all increases in volatility, however, tell such stories. New
ways of trading, brought on by technology and financial
engineering, can roil the markets until other traders become used
to the effects generated by such trading. That was true of
institutional block trading in the 1970s and computerized index
arbitrage in the 1980s. And it may be true now of Internet-based
day trading, which has made it possible for individual speculators
to trade much more rapidly, and with lower trading costs, than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of volatility presumably says little about the
underlying economy or the long-term trend of stock prices, and as
such is relatively benign. The 1987 crash in significant part
reflected such volatility. The then-popular fad of ``portfolio
insurance,'' which held that profits could be locked in by selling
stock index futures when prices began to fall, led to widespread
selling of such futures into a market that could not cope with the
selling and did not fully understand what was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of volatility is changes in macroeconomic
conditions, particularly the level of interest rates. Expectations
of such changes can drastically affect the expected value of future
profits and cause widespread shifts in investment patterns. Rising
interest rates played a role in 1987, as well as in a minor upswing
in volatility in 1994, and probably have something to do with the
current increase.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a chief cause of volatility is the long-term movement
of the market itself, which affects investor attitudes and
expectations. The 1973-74 bear market, the worst since the Great
Depression, ended an era in which a large part of the public
thought that stocks were an investment likely to rise forever, and
volatility rose drastically. Similarly, it began to rise again in
1982, when a long period of poor returns ended with the market's
upward explosion. That shook the belief that the stock market was
permanently a poor investment.
</P>
<P>
   All those types of volatility may be present today, to one
degree or another. But the current volatility seems most similar to
that of 1980, when energy stocks climbed so high that they
represented 30 percent of the valuation of the S&AMP;P 500. That was a
far greater percentage of the market than energy represented in the
underlying economy. But the prevalent economic forecast of the era
was for ever-higher prices for oil and other natural resources as
the world ran short of almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of such a run the buyers are primarily momentum
players, who are interested in the stocks not because they see them
as valuable but because they have been going up for so long. In
addition, the sector is expanded by new stocks that go public with
more hope than experience and whose business plans depend on a
continuation of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   That may also be happening now, with technology stocks as the
oil shares of this era. They now make up a quarter of the S&AMP;P 500,
far more than their share of gross domestic product or corporate
profits. The proportion is even more extreme in the NASDAQ, where
the five largest computer-technology companies _ Microsoft, Intel,
Cisco, Dell and Sun Microsystems _ together account for a third of
the value of the more than 4,000 stocks in the index.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, fluctuations in technology stock prices have been the
largest cause of volatility in the stock market this year. Internet
stocks peaked in April and then tumbled. While they had recovered a
good part of their losses before slipping again in last week's
selloff, they had not reached new highs. The larger technology
companies did recover, however, enabling the NASDAQ composite to
reach last week's peak.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That kind of volatility _ brought on by shifts in the values of
the dominant stocks of an era _ probably has more significance for
the market than for the economy as a whole, although it can be a
wrenching process for areas that based their economies on a growth
industry that faltered. It took Texas years to recover from the end
of the oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in NASDAQ volatility has been going on for several
years, but it accelerated last year and kept growing this year. To
some extent, that simply reflects the volatility of the
now-dominant technology stocks. In that regard, the NASDAQ
composite is a very different index now from what it was a decade
or more ago, when it was often used as a proxy for the movement of
smaller stocks. Nonetheless, the rise in volatility is eye
catching.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the NASDAQ composite rose or fell at least 1 percent in
23 percent of the trading sessions, and it rose or fell at least 2
percent on 7.5 percent of the trading days. Both were the highest
for that index since the deep bear market of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Another way of looking at volatility is to compute the standard
deviation of daily percentage returns. That has the advantage of
better taking into account long-term trends in the stock market. A
market that went up half a percent every day would be a phenomenal
bull market, but the standard deviation would be zero.
</P>
<P>
   By that measure, volatility in the NASDAQ market set a record in
1987, with a standard deviation of 1.57 percent, easily exceeding
the 1974 peak of 1.12 percent. That was a record that stood until
1998, when the figure hit 1.66 percent. So far this year, it is
1.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the S&AMP;P 500, the volatility explosion is not nearly as
great. On average, there are about two days a week with a
percentage change of at least 1 percent, compared with three for
the NASDAQ. But that figure is higher than for any full year since
1974, slightly exceeding the 1987 figure. The standard deviation of
daily returns, however, is down to 1.18 percent so far this year
from 1.28 percent in 1998. Those are the two highest figures since
1987, but they are far below that year's figure of 2.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That this year's volatility is primarily a reflection of the
lively market in the stars of the era, the technology stocks, is
shown by the relative peace and quiet shown in the market for small
company shares, as measured by the Russell 2000 index. That index
is less than half as likely as the NASDAQ composite to rise or fall
by a percentage point on any given day.

U.S. AND TALIBAN OFFICIALS DISCUSS BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With the Islamic Taliban movement of
Afghanistan under a threat of U.N. sanctions if it does not turn
over a Saudi-born militant for trial in the United States, a
Clinton administration envoy met with a Taliban representative
Monday in New York to press for action.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban leadership has been shielding the militant, Osama
bin Laden, who is wanted in connection with bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. The Taliban have
proposed asking an international group of Islamic scholars to look
into the case and perhaps find a way to meet the American request.
But they have always stopped short of actually agreeing to place
bin Laden in American custody.
</P>
<P>
   The American envoy, Michael A. Sheehan, the State Department's
coordinator for counterterrorism, said in an interview after the
talks with the Taliban representative, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, that
the United States was ``always prepared to talk to them about ways
in which the resolution can be implemented.'' But the bottom line,
he said, is that bin Laden must be surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid represents the Taliban in New York. The movement
controls most of Afghanistan, but it does not yet hold the
country's U.N. seat because of opposition from the United States
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Security Council gave unexpectedly strong backing
to a resolution to impose sanctions in 30 days that will freeze the
Taliban's economic assets abroad and curtail international flights
by the national airline, Ariania, if bin Laden and one of his chief
aides are not turned over.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats were surprised last week when two Islamic
nations on the Security Council, Bahrain and Malaysia, joined in a
unanimous 15-0 vote for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said in a recent interview, though, that the Taliban's
leaders do not have cash stored abroad and that the sanctions would
hurt only Afghan traders and other middle-class citizens who use
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Monday was the first between the United States and
the Taliban since the resolution was proposed by the United States.
Sheehan said that he described the move in the Security Council as
just another step to put pressure on Afghanistan. ``We're going to
keep putting more bricks on the pile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been talking with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan
and the United Arab Emirates, the only three nations that have
diplomatic relations with the Taliban government, a senior State
Department official said Monday, adding that there appeared to have
been some progress, including with Pakistan. U.N. officials say
that the Taliban gets the strongest sustained support from
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in the region, including Iran and Tajikistan,
aid the remnants of the government ousted by the Taliban. That
government, a coalition of factions that often fought one another,
came to power with American backing after the fall of the last
pro-Soviet government and continues to fight the Taliban in
northeast Afghanistan. In a recent report to the Security Council,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that all outside military aid had
to stop or Afghanistan's perpetual civil wars would never end.
</P>
<P>
   The senior State Department official said that Nawaz Sharif, the
deposed prime minister of Pakistan, had begun to distance himself
from the Taliban before last week's coup. But American officials do
not believe this was a major cause of his overthrow by his army
chief, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf.

 &HT;    SUNDAY METS WIN HAS NEW YORKERS IN A TIZZY
 &HT;    By Bob Dart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ya gotta believe that this place was nuts about the
Mets on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Their team's amazing 15-inning win over the Atlanta Braves on
Sunday evening gave New Yorkers at least one more day for goading
and hoping, and they took advantage of the opportunity. ``Tomahawk
chop that, Atlanta,'' gloated The New York Daily News. ``They
cannot be killed,'' declared The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the longest playoff game ever, Mets fans
marveled at the pluck and luck of their team and proclaimed that
the win was yet another miracle. They see destiny as on their side
after the second dramatic win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Yankee fans were happy about it,'' said Don Murphy, the
bartender at Mustang Sally's, a 7th Avenue sports bar. ``What can
you say? These guys won't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've got a good chance,'' said Mike Telfer, a Mets fan
working security at Madison Squar Garden. ``That's the reason
they're called amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   There was special delight in beating the Southern team that has
dominated the league for a decacde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't like the Atlanta Braves,'' said Harry Appel
(cq), another guard at the Garden. ``They're a lot like the Yankees
with their rich owner. They're just a team with a lot of money that
thinks you can buy wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Braves still lead three games to two in the
best-of-seven series to determine the National League champion.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Yankees leading the Boston Red Sox in the American
</P>
<P>
   League Championship Series, this whole town is in a tizzy over
the prospect of the first Subway Series in the last 43 years. Some
fans have even taken it as an omen that the city's underground rail
system will likely record a 30-year low in felonies this year, the
fewest since 1969, the year of the original Amazin' Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town must be excited,'' said Jim Root, who manages a
sports memorabilia store near Pennyslvanian Station. ``Not many
people showed up for the Rangers game last night. They sat in bars
holding their hockey tickets and wathching the baseball games.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first season in quite a while, Root said, he's selling
as many Mets caps and jerseys as Yankee gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for a Subway Series,'' he said. ``That way the city
could just schedule the ticker tape parade ahead of time because
one of our teams would definitely win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to God there is a Subway Series,'' echoed Mike Booth, a
Yankees fan sitting in Cafe 31, a sports bar on 31st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance,'' said Kevin Roundtree, who was
sitting on a nearby stool wearing an orange Mets jersey, ``although
we'll be playing with two pitchers going on three days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans wer still reliving the previous night's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy. Nuts. The best game I ever saw in my life,''
said Rich Morrison, who watched at Mustang Sally's. ``I can't wait
till tomorrow night.''

REBIRTH HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ The first Scottish Parliament in nearly
300 years opened in July with pomp, circumstance and the queen of
England herself, wearing a special dress with a Scottish-thistle
motif.
</P>
<P>
   It was the dawn of ``a new constitutional age,'' proclaimed the
queen, whose presence was intended as much to remind the unruly
Scots who is sovereign (she is) as to wish them well.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the soaring speeches and high-blown sentiment, the
new Parliament was consumed by a series of peculiarly solipsistic
issues, at least in the opinion of the pugnacious Scottish
newspapers. There was the issue of the new legislators' bonus
packages. There was the issue of their parking spaces. And there
was the issue of why each legislator received a handsome new
commemorative medal, when the Parliament hadn't actually done
anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Russell, the business manager of the Scottish National
Party, said his medal made him feel as if he were an old-time
Communist. ``It is like something a Politburo chief would wear
during the Stalin era, watching a May Day parade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Parliament is the fruit of years of campaigning by Scots
who have long felt undervalued by London. Under Prime Minister Tony
Blair's policy of devolution _ which aims to give more
self-determination to Britons outside of England _ Scotland and
Wales have both elected legislatures with responsibility over a
host of local matters.
</P>
<P>
   Most Scottish newspapers supported the effort. But suddenly,
tacitly egged on by opposition parties eager to attack the majority
Labor Party, the newspapers seemed to compete to see who could be
meaner about Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Edinburgh Evening News printed a drawing depicting the
legislators as lounging pigs in sunglasses, in a reference to their
salaries, perks and vacations. Dredging up a selection of outraged
veterans to denounce the parliamentary medals, The Daily Record
printed a headline saying ``For Services to Nobody at All.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers attacked so long and so hard that finally Sir David
Steel, the Parliament's presiding officer, declared that he had had
enough. Asking the news media to give ``the new Parliament a
chance,'' he took The Daily Record, the scrappiest of the Scottish
tabloids, to the Press Complaints Commission, saying that it had
violated its duty not to ``publish inaccurate, misleading, or
distorted material.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sir David said The Daily Record's editor,
Martin Clarke, had been unfair to a young institution trying to
find its way. ``The Parliament has been subject to a fairly
systematic denigration,'' he said. ``One particular editor was
repeatedly abusing the Parliament in a false manner, and possibly
affecting public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir David's effort failed when the complaints commission ruled
in favor of The Daily Record, giving a delighted Clarke the perfect
opportunity to add ``arrogance'' to his list of Parliament's
shortcomings. ``He's bonkers,'' he said of Sir David. ``They've had
300 years to think about getting their Parliament right.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal disputes aside, even people who campaigned fiercely for
the new Parliament acknowledge that the first few months did not go
very well, at least from a public relations point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Many new legislators were so unschooled in the cut-and-thrust of
parliamentary debate that at first they seemed unable to open their
mouths without a piece of paper in front of them. ``A lot of people
were reading from scripts, and some of us doubted whether they'd
even written it themselves,'' said Shona Robison, parliamentary
group secretary for the Scottish National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cochrane, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, agreed. ``To
call the Labor backbenchers drones and robots would be an insult to
drones and robots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Sir David said, maybe ``some of the maiden speeches were not
so brilliant.'' But he added: ``They come from all walks of life.
They're not 129 models of Demosthenes, but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not really the issue, said Magnus Linklater, a former
editor of The Scotsman who is a columnist for The Times of London
and who feels that the legislature has taken an unfair beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to insure that time will be given to Scottish
issues,'' he said of the Parliament. ``And in the short time it's
been in existence, a range of issues has been debated and discussed
that wouldn't have been at Westminster.''
</P>
<P>
   On the legislative agenda, among other things, are a proposal to
abolish tuition for students in Scottish colleges (colleges
throughout Britain currently charge tuition) and a sweeping
land-reform proposal that would subject large landowners to
increased government control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting development is not that the Scottish
Parliament is being seen to be a kind of minor assembly, but that
it actually might turn out to be a body whose measures have an
influence south of the border,'' Linklater said.
</P>
<P>
   Annabel Goldie, deputy leader of the Scottish Tories, said it
was up to Parliament to prove that Linklater was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was new, it was naked, it was vulnerable and it was a
fairly obvious object for the attentions of the press,'' Miss
Goldie said. ``But if any institution says of another, `You are
weak and undeserving of public confidence,' it is for the second to
turn around and say, `We are reliable, we are strong, and we are
people of ability.'''

HAMM, INKSTER NAMED SPORTSWOMEN OF THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a lavish and lively ceremony Monday night in the
Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria, Mia Hamm and Juli Inkster
were honored as Sportswomen of the Year by the Women's Sports
Foundation at its 20th annual Salute to Women in Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, a forward for the US women's national soccer team that won
the Women's World Cup last summer, was recognized for the second
time in three years in the team category, while Inskter, in the
midst of a phenomenal season on the LPGA tour that has included 16
top 10 finishes, was named in the individual category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone wants to throw out superlatives about me, I
cringe,'' an emotional Hamm said at a morning news conference,
addressing teammates who included captains Julie Foudy and Carla
Overbeck. ``I think anybody who participates knows who's
responsible for your development, and it's not me, it's my
teammates. I'm so glad you guys are here; you guys are everything
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other honorees was Joan Benoit Samuelson. The
42-year-old Samuelson, who in 1984 became the first woman to win an
Olympic gold medal in the marathon, was one of four women inducted
into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. The honor comes
15 years after the Maine native was named Amateur Sportswoman of
the Year by the foundation for her historic victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for all the pioneers in the world of sports, I
wouldn't be here today,'' said Samuelson, her voice quavering,
looking around the room Friday morning. ``They taught me to lead
with my heart, to believe in myself. If you don't have passion,
there isn't fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted into the Hall of Fame were:
</P>
<P>
   --Sandra Haynie, 56, a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame who was
forced out of the sport in 1977 by arthritis, only to come back
four years later and compete until 1989, winning three more
tournaments;
</P>
<P>
   --Betty Jameson, 80, a founding member of the LPGA who created
the prestigious Vare Trophy, given annually to the player with the
lowest scoring average;
</P>
<P>
   --Tina Sloan Green, 55, one of the top coaches in the history of
women's lacrosse and cofounder of the Black Women in Sport
Foundation, in addition to teaching field hockey and lacrosse to
inner-city Philadelphia children.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award was three-time Olympic
gold medalist Gail Devers, the track star who for the last decade
has battled Graves' disease. Deborah Slaner Larkin, executive
director of the Women's Sports Foundation from 1986-1991, was given
the Billie Jean King Contribution Award for, among other things,
helping to conduct the ground-breaking 1997 report ``Physical
Activity and Sport in the Lives of Girls.''

   LUXURY-GOODS (Undated) _ That Calvin Klein may soon be on the

receiving as they are snapped up in a wave of luxury fever. But if
Calvin is counting on the same outrageous multiples that are going
to his European cousins, analysts suggest he may be disappointed.

HUMAN TESTS OF ENDOSTATIN SET TO BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid great expectations and scientists' cautions, the first
volunteers to receive the tumor-starving drug endostatin will begin
receiving it this week in an initial round of safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care in Boston said
Monday that a small number of cancer patients is about to get the
first infusions of endostatin, which has wiped out large tumors in
mice without toxic side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have volunteered for the Phase 1 trials, but
a total of only about 30 patients will receive endostatin in tests
aimed mainly at revealing any toxic side effects. Researchers will
also look for any signs that the drug is halting the growth of
tumors or shrinking them, but they say even an ultimately valuable
cancer drug is unlikely to demonstrate much effect in these early
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, discovered in the laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman at
Harvard and Children's Hospital, is the most potent _ in mice _ yet
discovered of substances called angiogenesis inhibitors. They
attack the blood vessels nourishing tumors rather than being aimed
at the cancer cells themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin and another compound, angiostatin, have so
dramatically shrunk tumors in animals, without adverse side
effects, that some believe a new era in cancer treatment is
opening. But scientists emphasize that what works in mice might not
work in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always feel hopeful, but the failure in clinical trials can
be of so many things,'' Folkman said in a recent interview. For
example, he said, the drug is to be given once a day in the Phase 1
study, ``but what if the optimal dose is twice a day?''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer patients, oncologists and investors in the stock of the
Rockville, Md., company EntreMed that developed endostatin as a
drug are poised in anticipation, waiting for any word that it is
working. That could take months or years, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, cancer specialists at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston briefed reporters on the endostatin trial _ also a Phase 1
safety trial _ due to begin there early next month. A third trial
will be carried out at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Abbruzzese, one of the lead investigators of the
research at M.D. Anderson, said, ``we are years away from knowing
what benefit _ if any _ this drug will have in humans with
cancer.'' Patients are being recruited somewhat differently than
they have been in Boston, where volunteers called a hotline or
contacted a Web site if they wanted to be in the trial, and a
computer randomized their names.
</P>
<P>
   At M.D. Anderson, patients must be referred to one of the
hospital's cancer clinics where a cancer specialist will determine
whether endostatin is an option. ``They can't call specifically for
endostatin,'' said Dr. Roy Herbst, the principal investigator for
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The M.D. Anderson trial hopes to recruit patients with tumors of
the breast, head and neck that can be easily biopsied to look for
any signs of endostatin's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A bioethicist at the cancer center said there is a special
emphasis on making sure the volunteers understand that there is
little likelihood they will personally be helped in the early
safety trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid that people's expectations will have been raised
by the media,'' said the ethicist, Rebecca Pentz.

JUST BEFORE INDONESIA'S FINALE, THE CAST IS CHANGING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Just two days before an electoral assembly
votes to choose Indonesia's next president, it is impossible to
predict the outcome or even to say, in the final moments, who all
the candidates will be to lead the world's fourth-most-populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after a general election that chose most of the
delegates to the assembly, a fast-moving shell game of political
maneuvering is scrambling the field and creating political
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate to beat remains Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
opposition leader who won a plurality of 34 percent in the June
election and who remains by far the most popular figure outside the
halls of the electoral assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else seems sure in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated, it's fluid _ cross your fingers,'' said
Jusuf Wanandi, a prominent political analyst. Even this close to
the vote, the presidential field could become unrecognizable to the
millions of people who voted in June in Indonesia's first
democratic election in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati's chief rival, the increasingly unpopular
incumbent president, B.J. Habibie, could be jettisoned by his party
before the vote is taken. A prominent Muslim leader, Abdurrahman
Wahid, could drop his own candidacy, which seems unlikely to
succeed. A respected Muslim scholar, Nurcholis Madjid, could emerge
as a compromise candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist, the politically powerful chief of the armed
forces, Gen. Wiranto, made a television address Monday evening in
which he said he would not be a candidate for president or vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The statement appeared to be a rejection of Habibie's invitation
to be his vice presidential running mate. It was one more blow to
the president's hopes of election, following days of criticism in
speeches on the floor of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As the last-minute maneuvering went on, political talk in
Jakarta focused Monday on the possibility of an extraordinary
coalition of rivals in which a breakaway faction of Habibie's party
would support Mrs. Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   Deal-making like this underscores the pragmatic nature of the
presidential race, following a general election suffused with
idealism. In the election, voters campaigned for Mrs. Megawati to
overturn the old order embodied by Habibie's party.
</P>
<P>
   But in the proposed coalition, which has been under discussion
for some time, the current governing party's leader, Akbar
Tandjung, would become vice president and would bring along with
him as many as half of the party's 120 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers stack up,'' said a foreign election expert,
calculating the expected grouping of coalitions. ``I think the
numbers would give Megawati a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   But vote counting like this is risky as long as the leanings of
key groupings like the military and Wahid's supporters remain
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional address on Monday to soldiers at the
presidential palace, Habibie said he would fight on until the end,
but his remarks did not sound like those of a man who expected to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to continue the struggle until the last minute,'' he
said. ``I don't want to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia undergoes its risky on-the-job training course in
democracy following three decades of autocratic rule under former
President Suharto, it is not only the presidential candidates who
remain to be decided in the final moments of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rules of the game are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral assembly has still not determined whether the vote
will be conducted by a closed or open ballot or whether the winner
will need a plurality or a majority of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That determination is to be made on Tuesday, the day before the
vote. Parliamentary committees proposed over the weekend that the
voting be closed and that the winner be required to get a simple
majority of votes, which could require several rounds of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Another committee proposed on Monday that the assembly accept
the results of a referendum on Aug. 30 in which the people of East
Timor voted to break free of Indonesia after 24 years of
occupation. A vote on that proposal is also scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the election in June, many Indonesians thought they had
elected Mrs. Megawati. But that voting produced just 462 of the 700
members of the electoral assembly. The rest were appointed, opening
the way to the back-room deals that have taken the final decision
out of the hands of Indonesia's people. As a result, the
temperature on the streets of Jakarta has risen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have made their voices heard in continuing mass
rallies and in outbursts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The military announced Monday that more than 40,000 troops and
police officers had been deployed around the capital in
anticipation of large demonstrations over the next two days and the
possibility of widespread social unrest if Mrs. Megawati is not
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people were injured and scores more were arrested last
Thursday and Friday in major clashes between demonstrators and
security forces. Largely peaceful demonstrations continued through
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A new element has increased the potential for violence: the
deployment of separate, antagonistic uniformed security forces
loyal to Mrs. Megawati and to Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is at least a potential for large-scale
confrontations even before the session starts to vote,'' said a
Western diplomat.

APPLE BACKPEDALS ON G4 ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer Corp. has reversed course on an unpopular plan
that would have raised prices on its forthcoming Power Mac G4
computers to customers who had already placed orders for the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our customers for upsetting and disappointing
them during this past week,'' said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim
chief executive. ``Our actions today will hopefully set things
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's attempt to reprice the G4, because of shortages of the
advanced processor chip at the heart of the machine, threatened
last week to become a public relations fiasco for the company,
which has staged a dramatic comeback since Jobs regained control of
Apple in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 computer was originally to have been sold with processor
speeds of 400, 450, and 500 megahertz, with prices of $1,599,
$2,499, and $3,499, respectively. But Motorola Inc., which makes
the G4 processor, informed Apple it couldn't produce the chips in
sufficient quantity, and that the 500-megahertz version of the G4
wouldn't be available until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Apple last week responded by resetting the speed range of the G4
product line to 350, 400, and 450 megahertz without adjusting the
prices. But the real outrage was caused when Apple said it was
canceling all existing orders for the G4. People who had placed
advance orders would have to reorder, and accept a slower machine
for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever does marketing for them needs to be looking for
another job,'' said Manny Paraschos, a journalism professor at
Emerson College. ``I have never felt so outraged in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other customers reacted in the same way. By last
Friday, Apple had agreed to reinstate orders submitted through its
Internet site, but still planned to cancel all others. By Monday,
however, Apple had agreed to honor all of the original orders
placed before Oct. 13 at the original prices.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who had ordered the unavailable 500-megahertz model
would be offered the 450-megahertz version at a lower price. The
new, higher pricing announced last week will apply to future G4
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal mollified Apple customer K.M. Peterson, a systems
manager at the Whitehead Institute, a research institute affiliated
with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really screwed up, they badly screwed up,'' said
Peterson. ``And yet, after a fashion, they realized how badly they
screwed up and they've tried very hard to make good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Kay, a computer industry analyst with International
Data Corp. in Framingham, said the incident illustrates the dark
side of Apple's way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's indicative of a personality trait that Apple has had from
the beginning,'' said Kay, ``a tendency to lock customers in and
then sort of jerk them around.''

 &HT;    Read of the week: Nutrition
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim and M.A.J. McKenna

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The American Dietitic Association's Complete Food &AMP;
Nutrition Guide'' by Roberta Larson Duyff, M.S., R.D., C.F.C.S.
(Chronimed Publishing, 1998. $24.95 paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who professes to care about what they eat should have a
copy of this book. It covers everything about nutrition from how
much vitamin A you need, to how long you can keep raw eggs in the
refrigerator, to how often you should get screened for diabetes.
Parents will find the guide particularly useful, as it includes
sections on nutrition for pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers
and children.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nutrition for Dummies'' by Carol Ann Rinzler. (IDG Books,
1999. $19.99 paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   The ADA's nutrition book (see preceeding) is more comprehensive
and a better value, but this volume of the ``Dummies'' series is
more fun to read _ probably in part because it's only half as
heavy. The book contains sound information and includes a basic
calorie-counter nutritional guide for various foods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Nutrition Bible'' by Jean Anderson, M.S., and Barbara
Deskins, Ph.D., R.D. (William Morrow, 1995. $17 paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   This book is organized like a dictionary, with more than 5,000
alphabetized entries from ``A, Vitamin'' to ``Zwieback.'' So it's
useful for looking up specific terms, but not conducive to easy
browsing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Complete Book of Food Counts'' by Corinne T. Netzer.
(Dell, 1997. $7.50 paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   This compilation of nutritional information about generic and
brand-name foods is impressively inclusive. For each item, Netzer
provides calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, cholesterol, sodium
and fiber. But only total grams of carbohydrates and fat are given;
those looking for more specific information, such as sugar or
saturated fat content, may need to consult another book, such as
Dr. Art Ulene's ``NutriBase Guide to Fat &AMP; Cholesterol.''

 &HT;    The lineup: 100 years of sports
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the most interesting issues in a while, Newsweek
($3.50) looks back at the century in sports and interviews some of
the athletes and those who knew them. Muhammad Ali promises _
jokingly, we hope _ to get back into the ring for an exhibition
bout with two or three contenders. ``I'll dance for 15 rounds, and
whup 'em. I haven't forgotten.'' Other interviews include one by
Atlantan Charlie Yates about his friend, golf legend Bobby Jones.
When a reporter asked Jones if he was sad about having to give up
golf because of health problems, Jones replied: ``Remember, you
play the ball as it lies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The gospel truth: U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) seems
determined to stir up a controversy with its cover story and book
excerpt, ``Is the Bible True?'' Recent archaeological discoveries
are shedding new light on some biblical figures once considered
fictional legends. The unearthing of a 900 B.C. stone tablet in
Galilee with an inscription about the House of David is the first
historical evidence that King David existed. Now some scholars are
attempting to reconcile the scientific idea of evolution and the
biblical concept of divine creation. There is a middle ground, says
author Jeffery L. Sheler. ``Now a growing number of conservative
scholars embrace theistic evolution _ a view that considers
evolution, like all other physical processes known to science, to
be divinely designed and governed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A family affair: Maybe parents have gotten a bad rap.
According to a survey on the American family by Life ($3.99),
fathers in intact families spend more time with their children than
their fathers or grandfathers did. And even working moms spend
twice as much time with each child as mothers did in the 1920s. The
reason so many think American families are facing worse problems
now, says historian Stephanie Coontz, is that they are comparing
them to the seemingly more idyllic 1950s. But, she adds, ``much of
the nostalgia for the 1950s is a result of selective amnesia.''
Despite the rise in youth violence, an infant was four times more
likely to die in the 1950s than today.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  School daze: It's no ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' but
it's pretty close. Time ($3.50) sent eight reporters and five
photographers to chronicle a week at Webster Groves High School in
suburban St. Louis. The reporters wanted to find out if the school,
portrayed as complacent and directionless in a 1965 Charles Kuralt
documentary on CBS, had changed. At no time did the reporters try
to hide their identities, but students still confided in them.
Students divide themselves into social groups as they always have,
but several things have changed in post-Columbine America: An armed
security guard is on duty, and the principal and her deputies roam
the halls with walkie-talkies in an attempt to stop disasters
before they start.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: What do Sigmund Freud and Bill Clinton have in
common? Well, besides the obvious, Cigar Aficionado ($4.95) has
chosen them as two of the Top 100 cigar smokers of the century. The
Top 5 are Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, Fidel Castro, George
Burns and Mark Twain. Burns, who lived to be 100, smoked 10 to 15
cigars a day. ... P.O.V. ($2.99) picks the 100 best sites on the
Internet that allow you to play doctor, invest well and have fun.
The top five are broadcast.com, MP3.com, Amazon.com, Den.com and
ESPN.com. ...You would expect Bob Guccione Jr. to feature a
centerfold in Gear ($3.50), but not a life-size poster of Mini Me.
A more attractive layout features photos of VH1 VJ Madison Michele.
The photos are more revealing than the interview.

 &HT;    No miracle, but `Omega' finds success
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' ultimately won Hollywood's weekend box office
brawl, taking in just over $11.13 million to finish No. 1 in final
figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But another film _ Trinity Broadcasting Network's ``The Omega
Code'' _ also scored a small victory in its quest to become a force
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code,'' with a plot reminiscent of the biblical book
of Revelation and a mission to lure evangelical Christians to the
movies, garnered an impressive $7,622 per-screen average while
totaling $2.28 million to finish No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' opened at about 300 theaters nationwide while
the mega-hyped ``Fight Club'' debuted at about 2,000. ``Fight
Club's'' per-screen average was roughly $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Stephan Blinn, associate producer and
screenwriter of ``The Omega Code.'' ``We set out with our goal to
be the No. 1 independent movie for the weekend and the No. 1 film
in per-screen average and we did both. It was cool to also crack
the Top 10 overall. That's something we hadn't made a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Omega Code's'' first per-screen take is certainly
respectable, it pales in comparison to that of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which astonished experts last summer with a whopping
initial per-screen average of more than $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   But many major Hollywood films have opened _ and later won
Oscars _ with a smaller per-screen average than that garnered by
``The Omega Code.'' ``L.A. Confidential,'' for instance, opened two
years ago to critical raves and a per-screen average of $7,152.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing behind ``Fight Club'' at this weekend's box office was
``Double Jeopardy,'' with Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. It
ranked second, with a total box office of $10.13 million and a
per-screen average of $3,450. ``The Story of Us,'' featuring Bruce
Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, was third, with a total take of $9.75
million and a per-screen average of $4,506.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Sixth Sense'' will undoubtedly break the $250
million mark this week. The Bruce Willis film, which finished
eighth over the weekend, has a total box office so far of $249.92
million.
</P>
<P>
   A final rundown of the weekend's box office:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Fight Club'' _ $11.13 million
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Double Jeopardy'' _ $10.13 million
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Story of Us'' _ $9.75 million
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Three Kings'' _ $7.39 million
</P>
<P>
   5. ``American Beauty'' _ $6.49 million
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Random Hearts'' _ $5.80 million
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Superstar'' _ $5.73 million
</P>
<P>
   8. ``The Sixth Sense'' _ $5.22 million
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Blue Streak'' _ $3.78 million
</P>
<P>
   10. ``The Omega Code'' _ $2.28 million

 &HT;    `Frontline' in metro Atlanta a troubling look at teen syphilis
outbreakBy Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do you know where your children are?
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. Not if you're a parent of the kids portrayed in
PBS's ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,'' tonight's chilling
``Frontline'' presentation that centers on the binge decadence of
suburban high school kids outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute documentary, which includes explicit sexual
descriptions that might startle some viewers, plays like a
real-life companion to the new film ``American Beauty:'' a
dark-side tour behind the suburbanscape that once defined the
American dream, but which a recent trail of school shootings has
reconstructed for some into an updated version of the American
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Producers Rachel Dretzin Goodman and Barak Goodman spent five
months among a circle of mostly well-off teens in Conyers, 25 miles
east of Atlanta. They were there during the months leading up to
last May's shooting at Rockdale's Heritage High, which came a month
after the shootings at Columbine High, in suburban Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The result, shown tonight with unsettling, if sometimes
unrelenting, frankness, is ``a deeper story of lonely kids
desperate to belong, a secret world of sex ... of disconnection and
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a 14-year-old puts it: ``It was more an underground
railroad thing: Everybody would secretly have sex with everybody,
and the parents never knew.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``underground railroad thing'' was uncovered three years
ago, as Conyers prepared to host equestrian events for the Atlanta
Summer Olympics. A syphilis outbreak among 17 teens alerted
authorities and parents. A pattern of orgiastic sex was eventually
discovered that effected as many as 200 kids, some as young as 13.
A public health chart that linked these kids's sexual histories had
so many lines drawn to so many participants that it looked, says
Georgia public heath director Kathleen Toomey, like ``a ball of
yarn.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rockdale officials called a town hall meeting, parents
recited a litany of culprits for their childrens' behavior: TV,
video games, movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them looked to themselves,'' says Toomey. ``The
community was in total denial.''
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from tonight's emotional travelogue is a dark,
darkly heart-breaking terrain _ a kind of neutron-bombed community
where houses are intact but families are shattered. Careerist
parents work long hours to provide kids with material wealth, but
give up on giving the contact and structure they need. Kids turn
their lack of direction into a madate to veer out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The producers convincingly frame it all as an of
end-of-the-century consequence of families caught up in a life at
the ``outer edge of what has been called the fastest growing
settlement in human history: the rings of suburbs surrounding
greater Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, however, the documentary loses some direction
itself. It veers from those affected by the 1996 syphilis outbreak
to a current crop of Rockdale teens, oblivious to their
predecessors and repeating their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The last third provides some of the film's most disturbing
images_ three young girls use their stuffed toy animals to
demonstrate the complex couplings of group sex. But it also
underscores the documentary's weakness. Teens here are either
sex-mad or devoutly Christian virgins. How the forces of these
extremes affect those in the vast, confusing middle is left mostly
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall effect is so disturbing it's as hard to
imagine parents not rushing afterward to talk with their teens, as
it is hard to imagine their teens not talking back. ``The Lost
Children of Rockdale County'' demonstrates just how rare that would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline: The Lost Children of Rockdale County''
</P>
<P>
   10 tonight on PBS. A discussion of issues raised in the
documentary airs at 11:30 p.m. E.S.T.

 &HT;    Book, matching service offer new help in finding top docs
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us find a doctor in a very measured,
scientific and logical manner: We ask our friends.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you could ask doctors where they would send their
families or friends if they needed medical care?
</P>
<P>
   That's the foundation of a new book titled ``Guide to Top
Doctors'' ($19.95), published by the Center for the Study of
Services, a nonprofit heath care consumer group based in
Washington. More than 15,000 physicians are listed by region, and
sometimes by cities, with each receiving at least three
recommendations from their peers. In Atlanta, 310 doctors were
selected by their peers as being outstanding. The center then
back-checked the doctors' board certifications, licenses and office
telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a precise science,'' said Robert M. Krughoff, the
center's president. ``But the bottom line is, if a physician keeps
showing up on other doctors' lists, odds are they're going to be
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide survey, more than 260,000 doctors were asked to
recommend two doctors in 30 specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the names of metro Atlanta physicians listed in the book
come as no surprise. But the book also lists some suburban doctors,
who typically don't get a lot of notice. And that means that many
people living outside the Perimeter won't feel they need to head to
the city to get excellent care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff that doesn't need a university teaching
center,'' Krughoff said. ``This gives consumers some choices beyond
the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is also extremely helpful because patients can compare
the list with their managed care networks and hopefully find some
matches _ instead of picking a doctor with the accuracy of pitching
a dart.
</P>
<P>
   Krughoff also recommends that patients use the book to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Discuss specialists with their primary care physician. The
primary care practitioner might know some of those listed and be
able to direct the patient to the best choice for a given
condition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get an unbiased second opinion. It's human nature that a
doctor whom your first doctor has referred you to for a second
opinion might hesitate to disagree with the first doctor.
Sometimes, people would be better off picking someone totally
unrelated to the first doctor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bolster a case against a managed care company. If a patient
believes that a doctor is denying needed treatment because he or
she is too constrained by the company, the patient would have some
place to turn for another opinion outside the network. If that
doctor reaches a different conclusion, the patient might have a
stronger argument.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for such a book isn't new. In the early 1990s, a
company called Best Doctors Inc. of Aiken, S.C., began publishing a
similar volume. But people who were seriously ill found that such
lists have major limitations, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, it's not good enough to simply find the best
oncologist,'' explained Stephanie Spooner, spokeswoman for Best
Doctors Inc. ``You need to find the specialties and subspecialties
(of physicians) to be truly useful.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Best Doctors Inc. altered its approach. Instead of
publishing the books, it offers patients an ``accumatch.'' The
patient works with a company caseworker on the specifics of
diagnosis and treatment; then the company matches him or her to
appropriate doctors in the city, state, region, nation or even
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   It's expensive. The matches cost $2,000, although Spooner said
she expects that price to fall by about half in about two months.
Patients receive a detailed folder of information about doctors,
contacts and time frames (one of the advantages is that you don't
get hooked up with doctors who can't see you for six months).
</P>
<P>
   As for Krughoff, he's hoping ``Guide to Top Doctors'' will be a
welcome addition to any family library _ and notes that compiling
it was a labor-intensive, expensive process. ``Try reading
thousands of doctors' prescription handwriting and then try
matching them up,'' he said, laughing. ``What a nightmare!''
</P>
<P>
   You can purchase the book by calling 1-800-213-7283 or writing
to Center for the Study of Services, 733 15th St. N.W., Washington,
DC 20005. The price of $19.95 includes shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about getting a Best Doctors match, call
1-888-362-8677 (1-888-DOCTORS).

 &HT;    5 . . . things to know about mold
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mold isn't just the stuff that grows on stale bread and old
cheese. Microscopic mold spores can trigger allergies and worsen
asthma, especially during the fall season. A few varieties are even
toxic. Here are some tips on how to reduce mold in your home.
</P>
<P>
   1. Mold likes wet places. So keep your house dry.
</P>
<P>
   In your bathroom, run the exhaust vent while bathing or
showering and for at least 15 minutes afterward. If you don't have
a vent in the bathroom, open a window to let out moist air.
(Generally, though, windows should stay closed.)
</P>
<P>
   Fix cracked basement walls and leaky pipes. Damp wallboard, wet
carpets and even wet cardboard boxes also are havens for mold.
</P>
<P>
   If flooding occurs, dry out everything as quickly as possible.
Once mold gets inside walls, it's very difficult to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   2. Keep windows closed. And use a dehumidifier.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you're sensitive to mold, find someone who isn't to mow
your lawn and rake leaves. Those activities can stir up mold
spores.
</P>
<P>
   4. Store firewood outside. Don't keep too many plants indoors _
mold likes wet soil.
</P>
<P>
   5. If you want to clean up mold yourself, wear a special mask
such as a respirator or a HEPA filter mask that will filter out
mold spores. Scrub _ don't scrape _ at mold patches, using a
solution of 1 cup of chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   Major mold problems may require professional cleaning. Look in
the Yellow Pages under ``Flood Control Equipment and Services.''

 &HT;    FDA may OK labels for `functional foods'
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ketchup to prevent cancer? Grape juice to ward off
heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if, in the near future, you see those labels
on products on grocery store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchup and grape juice are among a growing number of so-called
``functional foods'' _ whole foods and fortified, enriched, or
enhanced foods that have a potential beneficial effect on health
when part of a varied diet.
</P>
<P>
   Natural foods such as broccoli and tea have been making
headlines as functional foods for a few years. Dietitians attending
the American Dietetic Association's Annual meeting in Atlanta on
Monday learned that the Food and Drug Administration is reviewing
the scientific data and may approve ``functional labels'' soon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Functional Foods for Health Program at the
University of Illinois, in Urbana-Champaign and Chicago, foods to
watch over the next year and their anticipated labels include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Soy protein and grape juice for their ability to reduce the
risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tomato products and broccoli for their ability to reduce the
risk of various cancers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Foods enhanced with plant-based substances such as psyllium,
phytosterol and stanolesterol, known for their ability to lower
blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Other foods currently under research include other cruciferous
vegetables, carrots, citrus fruits, cranberries, dairy, fish,
flaxseed, garlic, meats and oats.

 &HT;    No miracle, but `Omega' finds success
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' ultimately won Hollywood's weekend box office
brawl, taking in just over $11.13 million to finish No. 1 in final
figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But another film _ Trinity Broadcasting Network's ``The Omega
Code'' _ also scored a small victory in its quest to become a force
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code,'' with a plot reminiscent of the biblical book
of Revelation and a mission to lure evangelical Christians to the
movies, garnered an impressive $7,622 per-screen average while
totaling $2.28 million to finish No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' opened at about 300 theaters nationwide while
the mega-hyped ``Fight Club'' debuted at about 2,000. ``Fight
Club's'' per-screen average was roughly $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Stephan Blinn, associate producer and
screenwriter of ``The Omega Code.'' ``We set out with our goal to
be the No. 1 independent movie for the weekend and the No. 1 film
in per-screen average and we did both. It was cool to also crack
the Top 10 overall. That's something we hadn't made a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Omega Code's'' first per-screen take is certainly
respectable, it pales in comparison to that of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which astonished experts last summer with a whopping
initial per-screen average of more than $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   But many major Hollywood films have opened _ and later won
Oscars _ with a smaller per-screen average than that garnered by
``The Omega Code.'' ``L.A. Confidential,'' for instance, opened two
years ago to critical raves and a per-screen average of $7,152.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing behind ``Fight Club'' at this weekend's box office was
``Double Jeopardy,'' with Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. It
ranked second, with a total box office of $10.13 million and a
per-screen average of $3,450. ``The Story of Us,'' featuring Bruce
Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, was third, with a total take of $9.75
million and a per-screen average of $4,506.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Sixth Sense'' will undoubtedly break the $250
million mark this week. The Bruce Willis film, which finished
eighth over the weekend, has a total box office so far of $249.92
million.
</P>
<P>
   A final rundown of the weekend's box office:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Fight Club'' _ $11.13 million
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Double Jeopardy'' _ $10.13 million
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Story of Us'' _ $9.75 million
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Three Kings'' _ $7.39 million
</P>
<P>
   5. ``American Beauty'' _ $6.49 million
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Random Hearts'' _ $5.80 million
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Superstar'' _ $5.73 million
</P>
<P>
   8. ``The Sixth Sense'' _ $5.22 million
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Blue Streak'' _ $3.78 million
</P>
<P>
   10. ``The Omega Code'' _ $2.28 million

 &HT;    Delta's profit dips, but tops expectations
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blame it partly on Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines on Monday said profits fell 11 percent in its
first fiscal quarter, hurt by the effects of 1,100 flight
cancellations during Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline said the September storm, which hit
Florida and rolled up the East Coast, cost it more than $20 million
in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also said average fuel prices rose about 4 percent
from a year earlier. That reversed the trend of the past two years,
when falling fuel costs boosted Delta's profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Delta's net profit of $290 million, or $1.96 a share,
exceeded Wall Street forecasts. The results compared with a profit
of $327 million, or $2.08 a share, in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose about 2 percent, to $3.88 billion, while seat
capacity climbed 3 percent. Delta's operating margin fell from 14.5
percent to 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results don't include gains on the sale of investments or
one-time charges. Including those items, first-quarter profit was
$352 million, or $2.38 a share.
</P>
<P>
   About $255 million in gains came on the sale of stock in
Singapore Airlines and shares in Internet start-up Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines also reported quarterly results Monday,
posting a 27 percent profit drop to $110 million. Like Delta, it
cited the effects of Hurricane Floyd and higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts also say big airlines are struggling to maintain
unit revenues in the face of plateauing traffic growth. At Delta,
the proportion of seats filled dipped to 75 percent for the
quarter, down from 76.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Both Delta and Continental, the first major airlines to post
results this quarter, also lost the benefit of a year-earlier
strike at rival Northwest Airlines.

   New regional jets part of motivation
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Thurston
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With its buyout of Comair, Delta Air Lines has spent
$2.5 billion this year to purchase its two biggest regional
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The moves give Delta the dual benefits of absorbing the smaller
carriers' strong profit margins and gaining full control of their
growing fleets of small jets, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta on Monday announced it will spend $1.8 billion to buy
Cincinnati-based Comair, a highly successful regional carrier that
provides connecting service at Delta's hubs in Cincinnati and
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Delta to pay $23.50 a share in a tender offer
for the 78 percent of Comair stock it doesn't already own, and it
will assume $110 million in debt. The buyout should close by year's
end, Delta said, pending completion of the tender offer and
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta, which had about $1.6 billion in cash as of
Sept. 30, said it will finance the deal with a mix of cash and
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase follows a $700 million buyout earlier this year of
Atlanta-based Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Delta's primary regional
feeder in Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Comair and ASA purchases are mostly transparent to
passengers but bring a large fleet of new regional jets under
Delta's direct control. Comair has been an industry pioneer in
moving away from the turboprop ``puddle jumpers'' long used by
feeder airlines and into the new breed of small jets. It now has 82
Canadair Regional Jets, with 48 more on order.
</P>
<P>
   The planes fly as far, as fast and as high as some larger
airliners, and they are blurring the lines between major airlines
and their regional partners.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines are increasingly using the regionals' small jets
not just to connect to small cities near their hubs, but also to
augment their mainline schedules and serve longer-range routes that
don't support big-jet service.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ASA this year opened new routes between Atlanta
and Islip, N.Y., and Des Moines, Iowa, using regional jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets served by RJs are the fastest-growing segment in
the industry right now,'' said Delta Chief Executive Leo Mullin.
``These planes represent a tremendous service improvement and can
bring a lot of growth into our system.''
</P>
<P>
   By buying full ownership in ASA and Comair, Delta assures
decisions about deployment of the small jets will be to its best
advantage, said analyst Thomas Longman of Arnhold &AMP; S.
Bliechroeder. ``This gives Delta the ability to control Comair's
scheduling and marketing to a much larger extent than it had in the
past,'' he told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   But James D. Parker, an analyst at SunTrust Equitable
Securities, said Delta effectively controls the jets already
because it provides most of Comair's passengers. He believes
Delta's main motive is financial.
</P>
<P>
   He said Comair has a 28 percent profit margin, largely as a
byproduct of a longstanding revenue-sharing contract with Delta.
Comair had revenue of $763.3 million and a profit of $132.9 million
in its fiscal year ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta wanted some of that, and they also had excess cash on
hand,'' Parker said. ``This addresses both issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year Delta-Comair contract ends this month, and Delta was
pushing for more favorable terms. The talks shifted to the
acquisition mode late last week, according to Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' boards approved the deal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comair could have parted ways with Delta and tried to go it
alone or align with another carrier,'' Parker said. ``But they
would have had to work harder, and their stock price would have
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   The tender offer represents a 31 percent premium over Comair's
closing stock price before the deal was announced. Shares jumped
$5.06 1/4 to $23 Monday but are under a 52-week high of $29.
</P>
<P>
   Like ASA, Comair will operate as a separate unit within Delta.
Comair President and Chief Operating Officer David Siebenburgen,
52, will become Delta's top executive for regional feeder
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Comair purchase is allowed under Delta's contract with its
unionized pilots. However, it's expected to play into just-started
talks between Delta and the union over a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot unions view expanded regional jet flying as a potential
form of outsourcing, since pilots at the smaller carriers are paid
substantially less.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Renkel, vice chairman of Delta's Air Line Pilots
Association unit, said the Comair purchase ``underscores the
importance of attaining protections and job security'' during the
new contract talks. He said the union wants ``aggressive
enhancements'' in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said he's aware of the pilots' concerns but contends
ownership of Comair and ASA will strengthen Delta's total system,
boosting job growth and security for pilots at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Comair pilots are represented separately by ALPA. Comair flight
attendants are represented by the Teamsters, while the Machinists
union represents mechanics. Delta said there will be no work force
integration and that all labor contracts will remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Delta still has contractual arrangements with four other
regional carriers. They include SkyWest through its Salt Lake City
hub, and Business Express and Trans States in the Northeast. Delta
recently inked a deal for the exclusive right to book seats on 45
new regional jets ordered by Atlantic Coast Airlines, based near
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said those deals ``make great sense'' in their current
form.

 &HT;    Wall Street sees glimmer of improvement
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A measure of hope returned to Wall Street on Monday as blue chip
averages recovered a portion of recent losses.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rebounded. The NASDAQ composite fell again, but managed
to trim some of the day's earlier decline.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have decided that investors over-reacted to last
week's worse-than-expected wholesale inflation report and to the
cautionary comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to a
bankers' group.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial bull Abby Joseph Cohen, strategist at Goldman, Sachs,
also gave investors a boost when she declared the market's
fundamentals are still intact and that recent weakness was
``unfounded,'' Dow Jones News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts think the current correction that started about
six months ago still has a way to go, and could send the Dow Jones
industrial average to closings below 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons strategist Alfred Goldman said he
believes ``the Dow is about there,'' referring to the bottom of
this year's sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   What most analysts can agree on is that the major stock market
averages don't convey the extent of the damage that has already
occurred in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky T. Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia Securities,
said indexes such as the Dow and the S&AMP;P-500 are driven by a
handful of big stocks that continue to do well, while most other
stocks are in the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 80 percent of all stocks are down 20 percent from their
highs in 1998,'' said Harrington. ``I think this qualifies as a
bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   The plus side is that it means the sell-off is probably nearing
a bottom, they say.
</P>
<P>
   As for Greenspan's speech to a bankers group last Thursday
night, which added momentum to Friday's selling, Goldman said the
message was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the bankers to be prudent. I think the market
overreacted,'' said Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Dow wrapped up its worst weekly point loss ever _
and dipping briefly below 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I panic if it dropped to 9,500? It could happen,'' said
Goldman. ``But I see it at 11,300 at year-end, and the (30-year
Treasury) bond yield at 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury yield of better than 6 percent since June is one of
the factors that has depressed stock prices, analysts agree, since
it gives investors a favorable alternative to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the yield has come under pressure in the latest stock market
sell-off. As investors bailed out of stocks and into bonds _
perceived as a safe haven _ increased bond demand has driven prices
higher and yields lower.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman contends that the nation's economic fundamentals are
still too strong to permit a sustained down market.
</P>
<P>
   The market's chief concern is the prospect of higher interest
rates, which analysts believe is likely if the inflation news
worsens. That was the significance of Friday's Producer Price Index
report.
</P>
<P>
   If today's Consumer Price Index is also significantly worse than
expected, analysts fear another wave of selling could occur.

 &HT;    `Frontline' in metro Atlanta a troubling look at teen syphilis
outbreakBy Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do you know where your children are?
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. Not if you're a parent of the kids portrayed in
PBS's ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,'' tonight's chilling
``Frontline'' presentation that centers on the binge decadence of
suburban high school kids outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute documentary, which includes explicit sexual
descriptions that might startle some viewers, plays like a
real-life companion to the new film ``American Beauty:'' a
dark-side tour behind the suburbanscape that once defined the
American dream, but which a recent trail of school shootings has
reconstructed for some into an updated version of the American
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Producers Rachel Dretzin Goodman and Barak Goodman spent five
months among a circle of mostly well-off teens in Conyers, 25 miles
east of Atlanta. They were there during the months leading up to
last May's shooting at Rockdale's Heritage High, which came a month
after the shootings at Columbine High, in suburban Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The result, shown tonight with unsettling, if sometimes
unrelenting, frankness, is ``a deeper story of lonely kids
desperate to belong, a secret world of sex ... of disconnection and
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a 14-year-old puts it: ``It was more an underground
railroad thing: Everybody would secretly have sex with everybody,
and the parents never knew.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``underground railroad thing'' was uncovered three years
ago, as Conyers prepared to host equestrian events for the Atlanta
Summer Olympics. A syphilis outbreak among 17 teens alerted
authorities and parents. A pattern of orgiastic sex was eventually
discovered that effected as many as 200 kids, some as young as 13.
A public health chart that linked these kids's sexual histories had
so many lines drawn to so many participants that it looked, says
Georgia public heath director Kathleen Toomey, like ``a ball of
yarn.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rockdale officials called a town hall meeting, parents
recited a litany of culprits for their childrens' behavior: TV,
video games, movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them looked to themselves,'' says Toomey. ``The
community was in total denial.''
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from tonight's emotional travelogue is a dark,
darkly heart-breaking terrain _ a kind of neutron-bombed community
where houses are intact but families are shattered. Careerist
parents work long hours to provide kids with material wealth, but
give up on giving the contact and structure they need. Kids turn
their lack of direction into a madate to veer out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The producers convincingly frame it all as an of
end-of-the-century consequence of families caught up in a life at
the ``outer edge of what has been called the fastest growing
settlement in human history: the rings of suburbs surrounding
greater Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, however, the documentary loses some direction
itself. It veers from those affected by the 1996 syphilis outbreak
to a current crop of Rockdale teens, oblivious to their
predecessors and repeating their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The last third provides some of the film's most disturbing
images_ three young girls use their stuffed toy animals to
demonstrate the complex couplings of group sex. But it also
underscores the documentary's weakness. Teens here are either
sex-mad or devoutly Christian virgins. How the forces of these
extremes affect those in the vast, confusing middle is left mostly
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall effect is so disturbing it's as hard to
imagine parents not rushing afterward to talk with their teens, as
it is hard to imagine their teens not talking back. ``The Lost
Children of Rockdale County'' demonstrates just how rare that would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline: The Lost Children of Rockdale County''
</P>
<P>
   10 tonight on PBS. A discussion of issues raised in the
documentary airs at 11:30 p.m. E.S.T.

 &HT;    CLINTON, CONGRESS LEADERS SET BUDGET TALKS
 &HT;    530&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cloaking sharp political differences behind
professions of good will, President Clinton and Republican
congressional leaders agreed to seek a way out of a tax and
spending impasse in White House budget talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of negotiations, however, both sides drew stark
battle lines, conceding that they wouldn't bridge their differences
in time to meet a Thursday deadline for completing the $1.8
trillion budget for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring those differences, Clinton vetoed a Republican bid
to slash $2.2 billion _ 14 percent _ from the White House request
for foreign aid and diplomatic operations spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton blasted the proposed cuts, which targeted $1.2 billion
the administration had sought to promote Mideast peace, and
millions more the White House wants to help safeguard Russia's
nuclear weapons program and reduce Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me to be the next big chapter in the new American
isolationism,'' Clinton said of the cuts, ``right after the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate voted down the treaty, which Clinton has
signed. It would have called for an end to test explosions of
nuclear weapons among the United States and 153 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the test ban treaty and the funding of foreign
aid were only the latest in a weeks-long series of bitterly
partisan battles over taxes, spending and judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the rising rancor, Clinton called for Tuesday's budget
talks, saying the essential business of funding the government
could not be held hostage to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inaction is not an option,'' Clinton told reporters at the
White House. ``We have to put politics aside and seek common
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's music to my ears,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, told reporters in response to Clinton's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to a productive discussion,'' echoed his Senate
counterpart, Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Behind such pledges of good faith, however, both Clinton and his
Republican foes cast hard-line opening bids on the eve of talks
scheduled for late Tuesday afternoon at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed not to surrender his demands for money to hire
additional teachers and police and to press for full funding for a
slate of environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for their part, countered with a proposal for
across-the-board cuts in so-called discretionary spending _ the
one-third of the budget that doesn't include such mandatory
programs as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans'
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to talk about that,'' Armey said of the
discretionary cuts, ``but what we're not willing to do is to
discuss either raiding Social Security or raising taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and his Republican foes have pledged publicly not
to balance the budget by tapping into the surplus from the Social
Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Budget analysts, however, believe that is where the process is
headed. The political game, at the moment, is for each side to try
to make it appear that the other side caved in and tapped the
Social Security cash cow for its own partisan purposes.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no answer to this,'' said former Congressional Budget
Office director Robert D. Reischauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have to cut spending or raise taxes, or agree that
some of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund non-Social
Security programs, as it has over the last 30 or 35 years,'' said
Reischauer, senior economics fellow at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research center. ``It's not what they both want to do,
it's what they know they are going to end up doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's negotiations were not expected to resolve such
matters. Privately, the best either side appeared to hope for was
some sort of road map for further negotiations aimed at settling
the tax and spending issues over the next 10 days or so.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding as much, Clinton said he was prepared to sign a
temporary spending bill on Thursday to keep government operations
funded. The federal government has been operating under such
temporary funding since Oct. 1, the official start of the fiscal
2000 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal spending is governed by 13 huge appropriations bills
that Congress approves each year and sends to the White House for
the president's signature. So far, Congress has sent the White
House 10 appropriations bills, two of which he has vetoed and five
of which he has signed. Three remain on his desk and the House
intends to get the remaining three to him ``by the end of the
week,'' Armey told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is about money,'' Armey said. ``As long as we
can work out a compromise that fulfills the initial commitment, and
the overwhelming commitment, to not touch a dime's worth of Social
Security, we'll discuss any matter of spending priority the
president wants to discuss.''

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific faces reverse racial bias suit
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A white former employee of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is
suing the company, accusing it of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph D. Green alleges he was unjustly fired last year from
Georgia-Pacific's tissue mill in Palatka, Fla., because the company
wanted to appease black workers who had complained about racial
problems there. Green, a 32-year employee of Georgia-Pacific, filed
the suit Friday in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   In his complaint, Green said he was fired in an attempt to curb
racial tension between management and some of the plant's black
employees. According to the suit, a group of workers objected to
disciplinary actions taken against a new black employee who was
still on probation.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia-Pacific spokesman said Monday that the company had not
yet seen the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate to make any comments until we've
reviewed the complaint,'' said Greg Guest.
</P>
<P>
   Guest added that the company does not tolerate race or gender
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Green is seeking punitive and compensatory damages, plus lost
wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to be reinstated in his former position as
coordinator of training and resource development.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Jazz'' means entirely different things to
different people, but there was no question about the goal of this
year's Thelonious Monk International Piano Competition. The
competitors were judged as contemporary artists by contemporary
artists; the criteria were hard, and the process seemed free of
nostalgia and commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   The competition started in 1987 and was for piano for the first
three years, then started switching to a different instrument each
year. Some people have grumbled that in the 1940s Monk himself,
with his slangy rhythmic technique, wouldn't have stood a chance
against a judging score card that favors an even distribution of
elements like dynamics, time, swing feel and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   This year the competition circled back to the piano. The
finalists' competition on Sunday night wasn't just surprisingly
good; it was also indicative of where jazz piano is now.
</P>
<P>
   The Herbie clone, a pianist who wants to sound like Herbie
Hancock did in the 1960s, was a common figure among young musicians
until recently. One of the judges, Eric Reed, was in the
competition himself in 1993, and he remembered that the semifinals
that year were full of them. But this year the pianists went in
different directions. They were intensely rhythmic and experimented
with time and accents; they had concise, clever arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The contest has gained nationwide recognition, growing into a
two-day event at the Kennedy Center taped for the cable television
channel BET on Jazz (to be shown in February), with the presence of
the Clinton administration, especially Vice President Al Gore and
his wife, Tipper, who are honorary chairmen of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you think a jazz contest is an oxymoron, this one is an
undeniable opportunity. For an experienced pianist who has not
recorded for a major label _ the competition's only requirement _
there was almost no reason not to send in a $25 competition fee and
a five-song demo: the winner this year left with $20,000, an
acquaintance with six judges from the A-list of modern jazz piano
(aside from Reed, they were Geri Allen, Cedar Walton, Danilo Perez,
Herbie Hancock and Randy Weston), and his style ringing in the ears
of record-company people.
</P>
<P>
   The last of those perks may be wishful thinking. The Monk
competition became particularly well known in 1991, when Joshua
Redman won the saxophone contest, was signed by Warner Brothers and
became a minor household name. Last year's winner, Teri Thornton,
got a contract with Verve on the basis of her performance. But many
of the competition's other winners haven't been able to parlay
their prize into much of a career.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and Sunday representatives from only three major
record labels were in town for the competition. More surprising,
independent jazz labels were barely a presence. Whatever the
reasons, it's curious that the jazz business doesn't take more
interest in its own version of the Van Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater, 12 of
the 200 pianists who submitted tapes this year performed for the
judges and a sizable audience, who could wander in free to watch
and listen. Many of the musicians were constrained and proper, and
their uptempo pieces _ one was required in each set, along with a
medium-tempo and a ballad _ tended toward empty show. One pianist
inserted a note-for-note Art Tatum solo into his set; the panel
recognized it, and that was that. Another pianist, technically
fearsome, sounded too much like Oscar Peterson, though it escaped
no one that sounding like Oscar Peterson isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   A handful stood out. Orrin Evans, an outspoken, musically and
philosophically iconoclastic pianist from Philadelphia, went in as
a favorite among aficionados. Evans hits the keyboard hard to
accent rhythm but leaves plenty of space in his improvising; he
connects deeply with bassists and drummers, sometimes driving
repeated notes into the maw of the rhythm section and risking an
audience's irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a ton of good piano players,'' said Reed at a
reception Saturday night at the State Department given by Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright. In the palatial Benjamin Franklin
Room, Reed stood near an hors d'oeuvres table adorned by a
trumpet-shaped topiary. ``Trumpet's hard, drums are hard, and the
bass is hard,'' he said. ``But the piano is one of those things
where you really have to do something exceptional to stand out. It
takes something beyond having technique, being able to swing, being
able to play changes. Everybody sounded good, but a couple of them
put me to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   All four finalists _ Evans, 24, Eric Lewis, 26, Jacob Sacks, 22,
and Sam Yahel, 28 _ played again, for 10 minutes each. Yahel was a
second-timer; he was among the Herbie clones in 1993. His
performance was patient and mature, with a continuous development
of harmony. Afterward he was calm; he explained that he didn't try
to second-guess the judges this year. Sacks, originally from
Michigan and now a New Yorker, said he was shocked that he got as
far as he did; he was sure the selection would favor more
conventional approaches than his. On Herbie Nichols' ``Blue
Chopsticks'' he let himself go: he banged some cluster chords, at
first for a little accent and then shortly with abandon, lifting
himself up from the bench and pummeling the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Evans was impressive in the semifinals, musically and otherwise:
he was dressed in a gold kinte cloth shirt and cap instead of the
job-interview attire of the rest. In his second showing he made
some interesting choices: he allowed a drum solo, which no other
finalist had done, and he was barely using his left hand, breaking
up harmony more than ever. But the rhythm section got away from
him, and his second piece, Monk's ``Rhythm-a-Ning,'' lost focus.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is tall and thickset, and he has a heavy sound on the
keyboard. On Saturday he came on too strong, carpeting the music
with dense tremolos. But in the finals he gave a more balanced
performance. His first piece, Monk's ``Blue Monk,'' was a solo slow
blues, and he strode a little with his left hand, building up to a
climax.
</P>
<P>
   His second piece was Monk's ``Green Chimneys,'' a minimal,
declarative tune that rhythm sections love, and he used his own
time-addling introduction. Again he built it up gradually, grabbing
fistfuls of notes and gaining volume; this time the audience burst
into cheers during his crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got spiritual and emotional at that point,'' Mr. Lewis said
later . ``I just wish I had more definition. I was trying to say
something. It's tricky trying to maintain definition when I go up
into that area of emotion and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intermission, there was an all-star concert loosely
dedicated to Herbie Hancock, who received the Monk Institute's
Founder's Award. The institute is partly based in Los Angeles,
where it directs educational programs around the world and is a
constituent of the Music Center of Los Angeles County. This was a
Los Angeles version of contemporary jazz. It used some good
musicians and some great ones, including Grover Washington Jr.,
Arturo Sandoval, Wayne Shorter and Michael Brecker, but it was
showy and rhythmically challenged. The high point was Stevie Wonder
playing about 90 seconds of John Coltrane's ``Giant Steps'' on
electric piano: interesting for Wonder, but any of the four young
finalists could have played it better.
</P>
<P>
   Gore delivered a speech about jazz and America, and Bill Cosby
distributed the awards. Lewis won, with Evans, Sacks and Yahel
coming in second through fourth. ( Lewis' set will be broadcast on
``Jazz Set With Branford Marsalis'' at 6 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 31,
on WBGO, 88.3 FM, in Newark.) All four choices were special
musicians, and the two with the most percussive sound came in at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhythm is in now,'' beamed Randy Weston, one of the panelists,
at a party at the end of the night. He seemed pleased: his own
style is an offshoot of Monk's, and he had just witnessed a
competition that Thelonious Monk might well have won.

 &HT;    Coke canvassing world to reshape Classic's image
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anthropologists in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And ethnographers in Europe and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   You might not expect all that brainpower to go into the
marketing of just one soft drink, but it does.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. has called on a variety of academics to work with
its own global marketing team to develop a new direction for its
flagship brand, Coke Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a virtual network of researchers around the world to
give us (consumer) insights,'' Charlie Frenette, the company's
chief marketing officer, said Monday in one of his first interviews
since ascending to that position 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette said the information provided by the researchers is
critical to the company's strategic plans.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, consumers will see the results of that research
with the debut of the first major changes in the marketing of Coke
Classic in seven years. The ``Always'' Coca-Cola theme is being
replaced on Classic packages with ``Enjoy.'' And there will be new
media spots.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot more behind the change than just a word,
Frenette said. The message the company will be trying to sell,
along with the reasons for it, are key to understanding the remake
of Classic.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with an illustration.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle cap is popped, and the drink dances out of the
container. That's being done in hopes of stimulating your taste
buds and turning on the rest of your senses, including any positive
associations you might have with Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The company calls the concept ``sensation graphics,'' which
tries to exploit any ``magical delight'' consumers have had with
the product. For example, when the Atlanta Braves hit homers at
Turner Field, the Coke bottle above left field erupts in fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the new campaign is simple, Frenette said:
``Coca-Cola supports your quest to enjoy life at a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking this approach, the company hopes to bring Classic to a
higher level of sales. While the brand is still, by far, the
world's most popular soft drink, its growth rate has been trailing
such non-cola flavors as the company's Sprite brand and Pepsi's
Mountain Dew.
</P>
<P>
   To boost Classic, Frenette said the researchers, along with the
company's own employees, have studied several issues, including the
``human condition,'' or ``how people live their lives,'' in diverse
parts of the globe. That's important to a company that sells its
brands in 200 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, he said, was not a superficial one, but an in-depth
study into consumer culture and behavior, and what motivates people
to purchase specific products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Frenette makes decisions on an intensely researched
basis,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.
``He has a deep understanding of the soft drink business, like few
others today.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Frenette said he learned from the research is
that consumers are seeking ``touchstones of stability'' and
genuineness.
</P>
<P>
   That's different from the goal of the ``Always'' campaign, he
said, which was created to give Classic a ``multidimensional view''
with a ``plethora of messages,'' depending on the target audience.
The campaign's TV ads featured everything from talking ice cubes
and animated ants to senior citizens sipping Coke and a youth
orchestra playing on the streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the goal is singular: ``Awaken the senses.'' Just
how that will be executed in ads and other promotions is still
being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't shot a foot of film yet,'' said Frenette, who spoke
about the new campaign after word leaked out about it last week.
``What we've got is a strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy will be executed differently in different nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a local business at the end of the day,'' he said. What
works in the United States may fall flat in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Frenette said, the company knows that to beef up
Classic sales it has to provide relevant marketing on a consistent
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wake up thirsty everyday,'' Frenette said. ``We've got
to re-connect with consumers everyday.''

STOCKS CLOSE MIXED AS HESITATION PERSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also STOCKS-MARKETPLACE) 
(mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Monday, but investors
remained hesitant and analysts said there were no indications that
the recent steep slide in the market had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Led by shares of banks, which posted strong third-quarter
earnings, the Dow Jones industrial average staged a late surge and
closed nearly 100 points higher. But technology shares, led lower
by Dell Computer, remained weak, and the NASDAQ composite index,
which registered a new high on Oct. 11, fell for the fourth time in
five sessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 96.57
points, or 1 percent, to 10,116.28, led by J.P. Morgan, Citigroup
and big drug stocks like Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 6.72 points, or 0.5
percent, to 1254.13, as gains in stocks like Walmart and Bristol
Myers Squibb offset big declines in computer makers like Dell and
high-flyers like Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index fell sharply, but with an hour left
in the trading day the losses were far worse.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the index fell 42.68 points, or 1.6 percent, to
2689.15. Earlier, the index was down nearly 100 points. Since it
peaked on Columbus Day, the index has slid 226 points, or nearly 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow stocks led the tech stocks higher,'' said Richard
Cripps, chief market analyst at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``As the
Dow improved, that at least got traders to cover their shorts in
the NASDAQ composite.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that most of the issues that have been plaguing the
stock market for months remain in place. Near-term, the dominant
worry is about Tuesday's report from the Labor Department on
consumer prices. Last Friday, the market swooned after the
government reported that producer prices had posted their biggest
one-month gain in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the selling is over,'' said Ned Collins, head
stock trader at Daiwa Securities America. ``With the consumer price
report coming on Tuesday, the threat of a Fed rate hike still there
and worries about Y2K, it is hard to tell people they have to own
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns, particularly worries about rising interest
rates, have pushed large numbers of investors to the sidelines over
the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting and worrying about the Fed since May,''
said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``That
worry has take about 10 percent to 20 percent out of daily trading
volume since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session was again marked by fairly low trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 818.7 million shares changed
hands. Trading volume on the NASDAQ stock market was 997.3 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, which has seen its stock fall sharply in the last
two months, was the Dow's best performer Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bank holding company, which reported third-quarter earnings
that exceeded analysts' expectations, saw its stock price jump 7
5/16 to 113.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also rewarded Citigroup, another Dow component that
reported strong earnings. The stock closed at 43 13/16, up 1 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks also had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, a Dow component, rose 2, to 72 3/16. Bristol Myers Squibb
was up 1 9/16, to 43 13/16. And Warner Lambert, which reported
strong earnings, gained 2 11/16, to 70 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when interest-rate-sensitive bank and financial stocks
were rising, fears about further increases in rates helped to push
down technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer lost 1 1/2, to 41 5/16, and dropped even further
in after-hours trading after announcing that rising prices for
computer memory chips would hurt third-quarter profit. Intel fell 1
1/2, to 69 3/4. Lucent dropped 2 3/16, to 57. And Oracle shed 1
1/8, to 43 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued to batter companies that come to market with
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example is Lexmark International.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the world's second-biggest maker of ink-jet and laser
printers said profits for its fourth fiscal quarter will be at the
low end of analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which has been a high-flyer, fell 29, to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's big selloff, demand for initial public
offerings does not appear to have cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Due to strong demand, bankers at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter on
Monday raised their price target for a 7.2 million share offering
of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. to $16 to $18 per share,
from $13 to $15 a share. The offering was scheduled to be priced
Monday night.

TWO CASES FOUND WHERE INFANT BRAIN DAMAGE PREVENTED LEARNING MORAL
BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Calif.)  (The Science Times) 
(DW) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have identified rare cases in which injuries to the
brain in infancy prevented people from learning normal rules of
social and moral behavior in childhood and adolescence. When the
infants reached adulthood, they showed no guilt or remorse for
their extremely bad behavior and seemed destined never to get along
in social situations.
</P>
<P>
   The finding raises important questions about the biological
origins of human empathy and is likely to be fodder for creative
defense lawyers who may argue that clients who have committed
antisocial acts are not responsible for their behavior because a
brain injury prevented their normal socialization.
</P>
<P>
   The new research was carried out by Dr. Antonio Damasio and
colleagues at the University of Iowa College of Medicine in Iowa
City and appears in the November issue of the scientific journal
Nature Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   The research involves only two people, and it remains to be seen
if the findings will be confirmed or if people who have such
anomalies can be identified in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Damasio said, his findings do not explain what turns some
people into cold-blooded killers. The people he studied were more
likely to hurt their own prospects than harm anyone else. But the
new work fits nicely with earlier research, including studies of
people with other kinds of brain damage, that suggest injury to the
brain can alter moral judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings have ``profound implications,'' said Dr.
Raymond Dolan, a neuroscientist at University College London in
England and an expert on human development. If it turns out that
the human brain has a special circuit for learning right from
wrong, and that this circuit can be faulty from birth, Dolan said,
``we will need to reappraise psychopathy, which currently and
conveniently lingers in a hinterland between psychiatry and
criminal services.''
</P>
<P>
   Damasio is an expert on how emotions and bodily sensations drive
a person's conscious awareness and decision making. He is
especially interested in how a primitive brain region involved in
emotions, called the limbic system, interacts with a highly
advanced brain region involved in decision making and planning,
called the prefrontal cortex. When people think about doing
something, a part of the prefrontal cortex calls up knowledge
related to the feelings they have stored about similar situations
in the past, he said. These unconscious emotional signals are then
used to help select the best course of action.
</P>
<P>
   When this region of the prefrontal cortex, located just behind
the eye sockets and above the bridge of the nose, is damaged
because of a stroke or other trauma, Damasio said, the
decision-making circuit breaks down. People who suffer such
injuries may fall into debt, betray their spouses, lose their jobs
or abandon their friends. But if asked in a laboratory setting to
tell right from wrong, they do fine, Damasio said. Their knowledge
of how to behave properly in social situations is intact but their
ability to act on what they know is impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wondered what would happen if a person's prefrontal cortex
was damaged in infancy,'' Damasio said. Although such injuries are
extremely rare, the Iowa researchers found two young adults who had
exactly what they were looking for _ specific damage in infancy to
one or both sides of the prefrontal cortex, especially in the
so-called ventromedial sector of the orbitofrontal cortex.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their early 20s, both people were highly intelligent and
grew up in stable homes with college-educated parents, Damasio
said. Their siblings were well-adjusted and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The first subject was a woman who was run over by a car when she
was 15 months old. She recovered in a few days but by age 3 she was
ignoring all verbal and physical punishment. As a teen-ager she was
disruptive at home and at school. A compulsive liar, she refused to
follow rules, stole from her family, shoplifted and had no friends.
She had no plans for her future and could not hold a job. She never
expressed guilt or remorse for her behavior but blamed others for
her misdeeds and social problems. There is little or no evidence
that she felt empathy, Damasio said. Pregnant at age 18, she was
dangerously insensitive to her baby.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The second subject was a young man who had a brain tumor removed
from his right frontal lobe when he was 3 months old. He recovered
quickly and appeared to develop normally. But by age 9, he showed a
lack of motivation, had few friends and would occasionally explode
in anger. He managed to graduate from high school but could not
hold a job, turned to thievery and sometimes lashed out with his
fists. Also a compulsive liar, he showed no empathy, remorse or
guilt and had no plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Both subjects were dependent on their parents and seemed to be
impervious to efforts to help them. The basic rudder driving their
behavior was broken, Damasio said.
</P>
<P>
   Both were given batteries of tests to assess their
decision-making abilities. For example, they were asked to choose
between two decks of cards in a game that simulated gambling. One
deck consistently gave high payoffs in the short term but less in
winnings in the long term. The second deck gave less money each
time but more winnings over the life of the game. Most people soon
realize they should choose the second deck, Damasio said. But these
adults stuck with the first deck, he said, ``because the present
gain seems higher and they don't care about the future.'' In a test
that measures moral development, both young adults behaved at the
level of 10-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Damasio said, neither could figure out how to
act in social situations. In this, they differed from people who
have similar brain injury later in life; the people injured later
may not be able to act normally, but they are aware of what social
norms are and have a sense of right and wrong. The people who were
brain-damaged in infancy never seemed to learn rules of social and
moral behavior, Damasio said.
</P>
<P>
   Damasio's work raises important questions about the brain's
ability to reorganize after injury, said Dr. Jordan Grafman, chief
of the cognitive neuroscience branch at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke. When brain regions that underlie
language are surgically removed in early childhood, for example,
children go on to develop language using other parts of the brain.
But this circuit in the prefrontal cortex seems to be
irreplaceable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Damasio goes so far as to say that this circuit helps give rise
to consciousness and conscience itself, an idea he explores in a
new book, ``The Feeling of What Happens,'' published by Harcourt
Brace and Co..
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to misunderstand our research and think
that we have identified a biological basis for psychopathy,''
Damasio said. The two young people just studied, he emphasized,
were not purposeful in their bad behavior. They tended to bumble
along and mostly harm themselves, he said, whereas true psychopaths
are highly purposeful in their deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Hurlbut, a bioethicist at Stanford University, said
it was likely that there were many recipes for making bad human
beings. Empathy and the lack of empathy probably have many sources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some experts say, the new findings are likely to fuel
efforts by criminal lawyers mounting biological defenses for bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But others say these efforts won't wash. Except in the case of
the criminally insane, biological explanations for behavior cannot
prove cause and effect, said Robert Weisberg, a professor at
Stanford University School of Law. But Weisberg said biological
arguments might find their way into courtrooms in the penalty phase
of a trial. Lawyers throw out everything they can think of to get a
more lenient sentence, he said. This is just one more thing to
throw into the pot.

A NEW START IN PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In impoverished, conflict-ridden Pakistan, where the army chief,
General Pervez Musharraf, seized power from a corrupt civilian
government last week, deeds will matter much more than words.
Nevertheless, Musharraf's first address to the nation Sunday held
out the promise of some much-needed improvements in the governance
of Pakistan and in its relations with India.
</P>
<P>
   What Pakistanis know and Washington should acknowledge is that
the polity ruled by Nawaz Sharif, who as prime minister had been
whittling down the powers of the presidency, the courts, and
Parliament, was democratic in name only.
</P>
<P>
   If Musharraf's security council of two military leaders and four
technocrats can clean up the corruption of the country's political
system as promised, Pakistan will have a chance to take the first
step on the path to economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   At present the country is staggering under a foreign debt of $32
billion and has foreign exchange reserves of only $1.5 billion.
Pakistan has defaulted on $877 billion in foreign commercial loans,
and because of its nuclear tests in May 1998, it has been excluded
from commercial debt markets. Moreover, the International Monetary
Fund has withheld $280 million of a $1.6 billion loan package, and
the rescheduling of billions more in debt depends on resumption of
IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf must end corruption and begin collecting enormous sums
of unpaid taxes. He also needs to tell his compatriots and the
international community how long his unconstitutional,
unrepresentative government plans to stay in power. His silence on
that subject was the greatest failing of his Sunday address to the
nation. If only to reassure Pakistan's creditors, Musharraf should
establish a timetable for the return of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he would thin out troops along the border with
India and restrain nuclear testing, Musharraf also pledged support
for ``our Kashmiri brethren.'' But if he truly wants to save
Pakistan from economic collapse and chaos, he will pursue a
diplomatic resolution of its conflict with India over Kashmir.

 &HT;    Let kids set the tone for sexual discussions
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (L) Lifestyle categories.

SYPHILIS-RESIDENTS.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Big Talk doesn't cut it when parents are trying to
discuss their sexual values with teens, according to Sarah Brown,
director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   As PBS prepares to air ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,''
a Frontline documentary about a cluster of teen syphilis cases,
Brown urges parents to look for opportunities to have an ongoing
dialogue with teens about tough subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A television show or a magazine article can open the door to
such conversations, said Brown, mother of three teenage daughters.
But when dealing with sex, parents need to be guided by their
children's interest level _ and most importantly, such moments are
not a time for parents to instantly climb their values soap box,
she said. Instead, they should let the child start the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips for setting the stage for good communication include
giving your teen a purpose in the family. Chores are not evil, but
help a child develop self-esteem. Don't assume anything from your
child's body language _ just because they appear distracted,
doesn't mean they're not listening. And finally, supervise your
teenagers, giving them clear boundaries for behavior.
</P>

   ATLANTA _ The Big Talk doesn't cut it when parents are trying to
discuss their sexual values with teens, according to Sarah Brown,
director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   As PBS prepares to air ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,''
a Frontline documentary about a cluster of teen syphilis cases,
Brown urges parents to look for opportunities to have an ongoing
dialogue with teens about tough subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A television show or a magazine article can open the door to
such conversations, said Brown, mother of three teenage daughters.
But when dealing with sex, parents need to be guided by their
children's interest level _ and most importantly, such moments are
not a time for parents to instantly climb their values soap box,
she said. Instead, they should let the child start the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips for setting the stage for good communication include
giving your teen a purpose in the family. Chores are not evil, but
help a child develop self-esteem. Don't assume anything from your
child's body language _ just because they appear distracted,
doesn't mean they're not listening. And finally, supervise your
teenagers, giving them clear boundaries for behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can turn to several resources for more tips, including:

<P>
   LAUREL, Del. _ Here in the heart of the busiest poultry-growing
area in the world, there are remarkably few chickens in plain sight
across the gentle countryside, but Frank LeCates can smell the
birds all about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken farms, I'm surrounded by chicken farms _ 35 of 'em all
around me,'' bewailed LeCates, whose 79 years coincide with the
poultry industry's growth to its dominant position across the lower
Delmarva Peninsula. ``It's a desperate situation, a stinky
situation, putrid even some days when I have to burn pine branches
in the yard to try and dispel the smell.''
</P>
<P>
   LeCates said it helped very little that the chickens are raised
inside low-lying, silvery, sealed barns with powerful ventilation
fans. These barns quietly mark the pastoral fields like
extra-terrestrial dormitories in a vast poultry universe. Six
hundred million chickens a year come and go from 2,700 family farms
on the peninsula, leaving 600,000 tons of what the industry calls
litter and what LeCates calls abomination.
</P>
<P>
   While other agricultural areas offer autumnal tableaux of piled
pumpkins and dried corn stalks, for the hard-working chicken
farmers of Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia,
it is ``crusting out'' time when they dig and truck the thick
litter from the barns and pile it in the fields, 6 feet high in
some places, for eventual use as local crop fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   But now, prodded by new environmental laws, the industry's
regional leader, Perdue Farms Inc., is planning a radical new
approach, exportation, to begin dealing with long-running
complaints that drainage from chicken manure seriously pollutes
vital waterways, from underground wells to the vast resources of
Chesapeake Bay. Perdue intends to build a 24-hour-a-day factory
here that will collect and treat chicken litter _ a phosphorus- and
nitrogen-rich compound that includes excrement and sawdust _ to
produce fertilizer pellets for Midwestern farmers.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed factory seems unlikely to ease the complaints
of LeCates and other local residents, environmentalists welcome it
as a technological breath of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's great,'' said Mike Hirshfield, vice president of
the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental watchdog for the
tristate region. Such a candid blessing from the foundation is all
the more remarkable after the long decades of struggle between
environmentalists and the poultry industry, the region's chief
employer. But Hirshfield hailed the Perdue plant as a major
innovation in what has been a very troubled area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the options we've seen, this is one of the most
promising and it's certainly the one furthest along,'' he said of
the plant, which Perdue hopes to open in a year. Hirshfield said
stronger state laws were forcing farmers to adopt various solutions
for the problems of runoff from manure, chemical fertilizers and
fungicides. The runoff is widely blamed for helping to cause a
nutrient imbalance in the bay that is harmful to shellfish and the
undersea grasses at the heart of the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology seems able to handle a large fraction of the
problem,'' Hirshfield said. ``It seems to be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The factory would treat about 13 percent of the peninsula's
chicken litter, and be a test model for what Perdue officials hope
will be more local factories across the region in a dramatic
solution of shipping out the waste and turning a profit in the
process. Perdue plans to truck up to 80,000 tons a year six days a
week to the single-story factory that is to be built here on a
210-acre site set back from the road.
</P>
<P>
   But LeCates and other residents are far from thrilled that this
quiet hamlet of farm and residential neighborhoods will become a
funnel, in effect, for far more than its local share of chicken
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smelled bad in 1931, now it will get 400 times worse,''
said LeCates, a salesman. He and other residents say they doubt
Perdue assurances that there will no more than 10 truckloads of
litter a day. The trucks will be covered with tarps, the company
promises, and unloaded within a closed $10-million plant tightly
designed to thwart environmental runoff from the pellet-making
process.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   LeCates' neighbor down the road, Jerry Taylor, is organizing
community opposition from the ramparts of his bait and tackle shop
directly across from the farm where the factory is to be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our county has already sold us out,'' said Taylor,
referring to the Sussex County officials who count agriculture as
its principal economic resource. ``There are perquisites on the
way,'' he said, referring to county budget benefits, including tax
revenues; the estimated 20 jobs the factory will create, and other
benefits envisioned by Perdue, a powerful company that employs
20,000 people nationally with annual sales of $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We smell chicken manure where they smell money,'' Taylor said
of more than 800 petitioners opposing the plant under such names as
Citizens' Resistance Against Perdue.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hearn, who has been a chicken farmer for 20 years,
raising 75,000 broilers a year, said, ``I'm not too sure about the
factory.'' He warily noted that farmers heavily depend on Perdue
and other brand-name buyers, and that any new technology always
means higher pass-along costs to the contract farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chesapeake Bay Foundation stresses that farmers should
receive fair value in the litter recycling. And Perdue is promising
farmers options to either keep using litter as local fertilizer,
sell it at the factory or offer it in exchange for regular barn
cleanings. Perdue is operating the factory as a joint venture with
AgriRecycle Inc. of Springfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn now gives his litter to a neighboring farmer who cleans
the barns for free to obtain manure for his crops. But the new laws
that prompted the plant are holding farmers responsible for
observing far tighter limits on fertilizer use and runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're completing the recycling loop,'' said N. Wayne Hudson,
director of the proposed plant, noting that vast amounts of feed
used on the chicken farms come from the fertilizer-dependent
Midwest, where the pellets will be shipped and sold. ``We've had
inquiries from several states about the technology,'' he said,
describing it as the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Down the road from the proposed plant, Bill Beyer, a
transplanted New Yorker whose family has run a horse farm here for
20 years, said he had learned to coexist amicably with the chicken
farmers. The main problem, he said, seemed to be the secrecy that
shrouded the factory plan, which he thought was intended to limit
controversy until the precise site was announced as a fait
accompli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the Verrazano Bridge construction,'' said
Beyer, a former resident of Staten Island, which the bridge
connected to Brooklyn amid furious opposition from disrupted New
York neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted it, but it came,'' Beyer said, standing near a
rustic fence sign that proclaimed, ``Horse Manure for Sale.''

MOLINARI LEAVES BUSH BANDWAGON FOR McCAIN CAMPAIGN 
(Resending to add summary line) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key early backer of Texas Gov. George W. Bush
defected to a rival presidential campaign on Monday, offering
another reminder that the race for the Republican nomination is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Congressman Guy Molinari, a name with
considerable clout in delegate-rich New York GOP circles, switched
his allegiance to Sen. John McCain of Arizona in the latest a
series of bumps for what had been the smooth-running Bush campaign.
Although Bush remains the clear frontrunner in the GOP contest, his
efforts to set himself apart from the pack have alienated some
important factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush angered Republican lawmakers by accusing them of
trying to balance the federal budget ``on the backs of the poor.''
Then he seemed to go after social conservatives by saying that his
party sometimes seems obsessed with ``an image of America slouching
toward Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush's once-surging poll numbers, while still
impressive, have begun to level off. He continues to hold a
commanding lead in every credible poll, capturing more than 40
percent of the vote in a six-person race.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more I wonder if George W. hasn't `Forest Gumped' his
way into this,'' said New York pollster John Zogby, referring to
the movie character with an uncanny knack for turning up at the
right place at the right time. ``We're one inch from a real race.
Whether or not it will happen, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one suggests that Bush is an any immediate danger of
losing his frontrunner status, there are enough uncertainties to
give his rivals hope. He is scheduled to participate in the first
of a series of presidential debates on Dec. 2, giving the other
candidates a chance to exploit any gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers are also bracing for a bruising ad campaign by
rival Steve Forbes, the only candidate who can match Bush's
campaign bankroll. Forbes, a millionaire magazine publisher, is
preparing a series of ads that will attack Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will engage and do what I'll call contrast advertising when
the time comes,'' one Forbes adviser said. ``I'm not going to tip
my hand by saying when that will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the concern in Bush's camp, the candidate's media
experts recently tested possible Forbes attack ads, as well as
Bush's likely response, on focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's McCain, who has emerged as Bush's closest rival in
some recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he drops four or five points and McCain moves up four or
five points, it's a race,'' Zogby said of the polls. ``McCain has
the potential to take off. People can visualize him as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, a leader in the effort to coax Bush into the race,
said he changed his mind after comparing the two candidates. The
former Republican congressman currently serves as Staten Island
borough president, a job that gives him considerable clout in a
heavily Republican section of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frontrunner always starts to fade. This could become a
real horse race,'' Molinari said. ``Somebody had to emerge as a
challenger. I think it's pretty clear at this point that John
McCain is that Number 2 challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, who once called Bush ``the best candidate the
Republican Party can put forward,'' said he was stunned when Bush
criticized congressional Republicans. Molinari had personally
lobbied lawmakers to support the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave him such tremendous support, and then he turned
around and bit them,'' he said. ``There is some ill will about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also scored points with Molinari by urging conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan to leave the Republican Party. Bush said
Buchanan should stay with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded to Molinari's defection with a terse
statement inviting him to reboard the Bush bandwagon ``when Gov.
Bush becomes the Republican presidential nominee.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To a city still healing from the church
shootings and a human spirit gone bad, comes a person whose life
and art happily occupy the opposite end of that spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Evelyn Glennie, the first and only full-time solo
percussionist in the history of classical music, a 33-year-old
musician who in 15 years has revolutionized her craft.
</P>
<P>
   She headlines performances with the world's finest orchestras
and conductors, but is equally comfortable playing with
international pop stars. Universally fawning critics have variously
praised her as a ``musical genius'' and a ``wild woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite instrument is the traditional snare drum, but in
concert and on records she has played a starter's pistol, water
tank, exhaust pipes, flower pots and kitchen utensils.
</P>
<P>
   And then this _ a fact irrelevant to her, but amazing to her
listeners: Since the age of 12, the world's most famous
percussionist has been profoundly deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night at the Bass Performance Hall, Glennie performs
again with an a capella group, The King's Singers. As in all her
appearances, the Scottish redhead will be barefoot, for that is the
means by which she hears her music, vibrations absorbed by her
body.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at Bass Hall Monday morning, Glennie fields
questions about her impairment politely but with a hint of
exasperation. She refers her questioner to an essay on a Glennie
website that answers all the pertinent questions.
</P>
<P>
   Her web page indeed says that the essay is ``designed to set the
record straight and allow people to enjoy the experience of being
entertained by one of the world's great musicians, rather than some
freak or miracle of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, her promotional literature rarely mentions her
deafness, adhering instead to the litany of her 12 records, a
Grammy award, a bestselling book ``Good Vibrations'' and growing
worldwide celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   But any discussion of her art must inevitably return to her
childhood, during which Glennie tended lambs on her family's farm.
Neither parent was musical, and it was at her own initiative that
Glennie began taking piano lessons when she was 8. It was about the
same time that her hearing began to deteriorate for reasons never
fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very gradual over four years or so,'' Glennie says.
``As an 8-year-old kid you somehow adapt. You don't have the
vocabulary to understand particularly what's going on. You don't
even know what the word deaf means.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like this happened in my teenage years or even in
my 20s it would have been a very different story. But as a kid, you
are so adaptable. I think it was worse for those around me. They
were conditioned and they did know about the word, `deafness', and
they said, `Oh my God.' It was a scary experience for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glennie, on the other hand, learned to listen in other ways. As
a 12-year-old, she was intrigued by percussion instruments in the
school orchestra so she insisted on pursuing that course. From
early on, her ambition went further than just learning how to play.
She began to formulate the notion of becoming a solo percussionist,
unheard of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the same enthusiasm in an orchestra,'' she said.
``I needed an audience. I needed to play, like the violins or the
piano players. I don't know why. I think that if I start analyzing
it, it will all kind of crumble. It's just one of those things I
can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Glennie speaks today of her teenage years as frustrating times
when her musical ideas and ambition exceeded her ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had absolutely no doubt in my mind that this would
work,'' she says, ``not because of me as a player, but just
something inside that I just knew this was going to be what I would
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years at the Royal Academy of Music was followed by a
Grammy award at age 21. Her performances, with Glennie racing from
instrument to instrument to instrument in a montage of varying
musical hues, left international audiences slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One had to pause in sheer wonder at what she has
accomplished,'' said The New York Times. ``She is quite simply a
phenomenon as a performer.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone before her, ``Evelyn now shows you that
percussion is more than drums and more than just being able to keep
time,'' Leonard Slatkin, music director of the National Symphony
Orchestra said in a television interview. ``It's a whole world of
color and vitality and energy and subtlety that perhaps people
didn't know about before.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at the Bass Performance Hall, hundreds of local
students filed in to listen as Glennie whispered on the snare drum,
then hammered out thunder. She did the same on a set of bongos,
then on paddle drums, the snippets of her performance interspersed
with light-hearted lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she had been introduced to the youngsters as ``the
finest percussionist in the world. She does all of these things
through the vibrations in her feet, because she is deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   The faces of some students registered surprise. Then Glennie
appeared, dressed in black jeans, and a black blouse, and barefoot.
The novelty was quickly forgotten. Glennie is not a deaf performer,
but as she says, ``a sound creator ... to make those sounds into
some sort of emotional experience for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 45-minute session, the young audience was
mesmerized by Glennie's haunting performance of ``Danny Boy'' on
the marimba.
</P>
<P>
   ``You participated in that piece, because I would have
interpreted it very differently if you were moving, or decided to
have your lunch early,'' Glennie told the students. ``In fact you
gave me a canvas to work with. You really, truly helped me
experience the piece because you experienced it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, she fielded a half-dozen questions about her
instruments and her music. Glennie's deafness never came up.

<P>
   Three years at the Royal Academy of Music was followed by a
Grammy award at age 21. Her performances, with Glennie racing from
instrument to instrument to instrument in a montage of varying
musical hues, left international audiences slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One had to pause in sheer wonder at what she has
accomplished,'' said The New York Times. ``She is quite simply a
phenomenon as a performer.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone before her, ``Evelyn now shows you that
percussion is more than drums and more than just being able to keep
time,'' Leonard Slatkin, music director of the National Symphony
Orchestra said in a television interview. ``It's a whole world of
color and vitality and energy and subtlety that perhaps people
didn't know about before.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at the Bass Performance Hall, hundreds of local
students filed in to listen as Glennie whispered on the snare drum,
then hammered out thunder. She did the same on a set of bongos,
then on paddle drums, the snippets of her performance interspersed
with light-hearted lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she had been introduced to the youngsters as ``the
finest percussionist in the world. She does all of these things
through the vibrations in her feet, because she is deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   The faces of some students registered surprise. Then Glennie
appeared, dressed in black jeans, and a black blouse, and barefoot.
The novelty was quickly forgotten. Glennie is not a deaf performer,
but as she says, ``a sound creator ... to make those sounds into
some sort of emotional experience for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 45-minute session, the young audience was
mesmerized by Glennie's haunting performance of ``Danny Boy'' on
the marimba.
</P>
<P>
   ``You participated in that piece, because I would have
interpreted it very differently if you were moving, or decided to
have your lunch early,'' Glennie told the students. ``In fact you
gave me a canvas to work with. You really, truly helped me
experience the piece because you experienced it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, she fielded a half-dozen questions about her
instruments and her music. Glennie's deafness never came up.

<P>
   The modern campaign headquarters is no longer a rented
storefront decorated with bumper stickers, bunting and empty soda
cans. Increasingly it has an annex open any hour of the day or
night, at an address starting with www.
</P>
<P>
   If in 1996 a candidate could prove hipness simply by posting an
electronic version of a campaign brochure on the World Wide Web,
White House hopefuls for 2000 have learned how to use their
Internet sites to raise money and rally troops. The Web page is the
new whistle-stop, a way for candidates to carry their messages
daily to more people than they can reach on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   By posting everything from their baby pictures (as George W.
Bush has done) to their favorite Bible stories (an offering from
Elizabeth Dole), candidates are using the Internet as a fireside
chat room, to portray themselves as just plain folks. And the sites
provide a new conduit for cash: Bill Bradley has towered over the
opposition in online fund-raising, while the Steve Forbes campaign
created a way for Web surfers to crash a recent $1,000-a-plate gala
_ for a fee, of course.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the Internet has come of age as a
medium of political influence, as television did most notably with
the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960. But with 67 million Americans
online, up from 7.5 million four years ago, it has become a new
variable in campaign calculus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be said the candidate had to have a good message, a
good ground game and enough money to wage a good air game on TV,''
said Rick Segal, the Internet strategy adviser to Forbes. ``This is
the first cycle that it can be proven that a candidate needs to
have a good online game as well.''
</P>
<P>
   That game includes strategies like fill-in-the-blank e-mail that
supporters can send to friends in support of a candidate, and
paperless campaign contributions requiring just a few mouse clicks.
</P>
<P>
   And for all that, the sites are a relative bargain _ Bush spent
$57,000 on his over the last seven months _ with candidates either
hiring Web consultants, contracting with private companies, or
allowing volunteers to create and maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the sites have not only conveyed the campaigns' messages
but also made news: Bush last month became the first presidential
candidate to make updated lists of campaign donors available
online, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona got under the skin of
fellow Republicans by using his site to single out examples of
congressional pork.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, McCain's press secretary, affirmed the
Internet's growing campaign role, saying it is ``almost like the
51st state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no boundaries,'' Opinsky said. ``The Internet has
progressed from a billboard to a two-way street, and I think it's
probably good in the end for the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Web pages _ unlike television or radio commercials,
which to the public can seem unavoidable _ depend on the initiative
of people to look for them. But such surfers are valuable visitors:
Bradley's campaign says that on an average day his site brings in
about $7,000 and is seen by 5,000 people, more than he might
encounter in a day on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign workers try to drum up traffic to his site by
displaying the address on every lectern he uses. And Segal has
worked to make sure the Forbes site is indexed in Internet search
engines, thereby increasing the probability that surfers will stop
by, and is placing advertisements on news and financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as the Internet grows in popularity,
candidates are cutting down on printed campaign literature. The
Forbes campaign, for example, says it is sending out fewer
newsletters than it would have in pre-Internet campaigns, because
the Internet is a faster and less expensive medium.
</P>
<P>
   And more than in a television commercial, the candidates are
able to convey their personalities through their pages. The forced
friendliness that results can either charm or repel prospective
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradley's site includes recipes for dishpan
cookies, oatmeal icebox cookies and butterhorns, from Rosalie
Dunker, Dede Herrell and Em Aubuchon, who baked for his campaign
kickoff in Crystal City, Mo., while Bush has baby pictures of
himself and his daughters on his site and mentions his family's
dog, Spot, and three cats, India, Cowboy and Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   One presidential hopeful even sells his gospel recordings
online, at www.hatchmusic.com, where one can download snippets of
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch singing ``The Cross Before the Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Technologically savvy voters snooping through www.AlGore2000.com
are rewarded with a message embedded in the source code, the
programming blueprints of a site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for checking out our source code!'' the site says, ,
describing plans to improve the code. ``The fact that you are
peeking behind the scenes at our site means you can make an
important difference to this Internet effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In another innovative move, the Forbes campaign blended virtual
reality with real reality, inviting 400 computer users to an online
version of a $1,000-a-plate bash in June at the Waldorf-Astoria in
New York. For $10, plugged-in supporters saw live video of the
festivities, and typed messages back and forth with Forbes and
others in attendance. Later that night his address was seen on a
free Webcast by about 1,800 people, 600 more than at the live
event.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the partnership between established candidates
and the wild, wild Web is uneasy as they plumb the possibilities of
this new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are a tight, disciplined, focused message delivered
in a focused way, reducing chance, variables and conflict to a
minimum,'' said Phil Noble, president of PoliticsOnline of
Charleston, S.C., a company offering Internet expertise. ``The
Internet is about millions of voices colliding, all at the same
time, about all kinds of things in a near-chaotic pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   But candidates recognize that the Internet is an effective way
to get their messages across and to keep the prospective voter's
attention. Campaigns usually can get 45 seconds of a voter's
attention by phone or 30 seconds in a television advertisement,
compared with eight minutes through a Web site, said Emilienne
Ireland, president of Campaign Advantage, an Internet
campaign-services company in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   And more than ever before, the candidates' pages are bringing in
contributions. Bradley's campaign says it has raised over $770,000
through his site, more than 3 percent of its total contributions.
(According to a survey by PoliticsOnline, McCain had raised
$260,000 on the Internet through September; no other candidate had
brought in more than $100,000 through the Net.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the half-million people who have visited the Bradley site
since last December, 14.4 percent have filled out a form to get
involved, and 1 percent have brought out their credit cards or
checkbooks to contribute, said Lynn Reed, a consultant to the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley campaign has been real effective in the overall
strategic use of the Net,'' said Jonah Seiger, co-founder and
principal of Mindshare Internet Campaigns, consultants in
Washington. ``They raised a great deal of money and a great deal of
press attention, suggesting they clearly have a better strategic
sense of the Net than the Gore campaign does, considering that Gore
is so identified with the Net. Here they're doing something that is
really going to hit Gore where it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Sather, senior vice president at Sapient, Internet
consultants in Cambridge, Mass., that redesigned the official White
House Web site, cited the Gore campaign's use of the Web to let
visitors interact with the candidate, through electronic town
halls, where people can pose questions about anything from class
size to the income gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has used its site to gain credentials for the
Texas governor as a Net-savvy candidate, notably with the decision
last month to begin posting a list of all his contributors, even
those who gave less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Americans the opportunity to look for themselves at
the broad-based support Governor Bush is receiving,'' said Scott
McClellan, a campaign spokesman. About 100,000 people have dipped
into the 1,750-page listing so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, just as readers of Web pages get more
information about their candidate, the candidate gets more
information about them, helping a campaign organize its ground
troops. Several Web watchers pointed to what the Forbes campaign
calls electronic precincts as a canny use of the Internet: In a
political version of multilevel marketing, a campaign volunteer
brings in a handful of other volunteers, who in turn bring in more.
The first volunteer, the e-precinct captain, is rewarded with
special briefings, online video presentations, and a chance to meet
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's growing in its own viral kind of way,''
said Segal, the Internet adviser to Forbes, who added that the
campaign had about 5,000 e-precincts, a few with 5,000 members
each.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign keeps tabs on where their e-volunteers live
and what kind of volunteering they would like to do. Using similar
information, the Bradley campaign was able to send e-mail to 5,000
supporters in the Northeast, encouraging them to take part in a
weeklong canvass in New Hampshire this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get 300 folks, free,'' Ms. Reed said. ``If you
had to make phone calls for the same return, it might not be worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With all those electronic addresses and ZIP codes flowing in
from supporters to Webmasters, some Internet experts have become
concerned about what is done with this information. To reassure
supporters, the Gore site posts this disclaimer: ``We do not share
our volunteer lists with any other site or any other entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Todd, managing editor of The Hotline, a daily Web-based
political newsletter published by The National Journal, a weekly
magazine of politics and government, predicts that the Internet
will first show its new power in a primary campaign, in a small or
particularly well-wired state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way, in the past, there was a last-minute TV barrage,
there will be a huge Internet campaign to swing votes toward a
candidate,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the Internet may not show its full potential
as a political tool until 2004 at the earliest, when high-speed
Internet connections become common and the transmitting of messages
to discrete targets is refined to an art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential watershed moment will be when Al Gore can make
sure his pro- choice abortion ads are only seen by moderate,
pro-choice women,'' Todd said. ``That's what the Internet allows,
targeting and identifying voters by household.''

BRADLEY GAINING ON GORE IN MASS. MONEY RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley has nearly caught
up with Vice President Al Gore in fund-raising in Massachusetts,
and outraised Gore 2-to-1 here during the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is collecting checks from some seemingly unlikely
quarters in Massachusetts, including Fidelity Investments, Harvard
_ Gore's alma mater _ and friends of President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   While local contributions to Bradley surged in the latest
reporting period, those to Gore appeared to be trailing off.
Between July and September, Bradley took in $396,000 from in-state
supporters, while Gore received only $196,000, according to the
Federal Elections Commission's just-completed third quarter
filings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has taken about three-quarters of a million dollars from
donors in Massachusetts this year, while Bradley has collected just
under $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors to Bradley are not surprising: Retired Celtics star
John Havlicek wrote a $1,000 check in June. But a closer look at
donor lists indicates broader support.
</P>
<P>
   For example, former Clinton administration labor secretary
Robert Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University, gave Bradley
$1,000, the maximum allowed under federal guidelines. And Nancy
Klemm, who, with her husband, Cambridge developer Richard Friedman,
has repeatedly opened their Martha's Vineyard summer home to
Clinton, also contributed $1,000 to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent donors appear to be covering their bets and
giving to both candidates, another indicator of Bradley's
viability. Former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk
gave to both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I have money to throw around, but I wanted to be even
with them,'' Kirk said. ``The primary process needs a debate and a
dialogue (but) money becomes the first primary in this thing. The
second reason is I'm cochair of the commission on presidential
debates . . . . In that role, I really want to be _ and be
perceived to be _ neutral and even-handed with the candidates who
come to that forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University now ranks among some of the top employers
nationwide contributing to Bradley, along with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Fidelity Investments and State Street
Bank. Bradley, a Rhodes Scholar, graduated from Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard professors Cornel West, who is advising Bradley on race
issues, and Christopher Jencks each gave the maximum contribution
to Bradley, as did MIT's Lester Thurow. Fidelity administration
chief David Weinstein also gave $1,000. State Street Bank's
chairman and CEO Marshall Carter and his wife, Mary, each
contributed the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Christopher Lehane downplayed Bradley's surge in
Massachusetts and stressed that the vice president's support is
more broad-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the number of donors that we had, we far
exceeded anyone, on the Democratic or Republican side, in terms of
the number of donors. We had more than 128,000 donors nationwide.
And we also had the smallest average donor level,'' Lehane said,
adding that Gore does not accept contributions from political
action committees. ``We have support at the grass-roots level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also tapped his close relationship with the late US
Senator Paul Tsongas of Lowell, who shared his low-key, cerebral
brand of politics. Tsongas' sister, Thalia Schlessinger, donated
the most allowed, as did his Tsongas' aide and confidante Dennis
Kanin and his wife Carol Kanin.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides say they have only held a couple of fundraisers in
Massachusetts, including a large one in October. Donations from
that event won't be public until the next FEC quarterly filing
deadline at the end of December, the same month another large
fundraiser is being planned here for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Gore was leading with
$745,085 in donations from Massachusetts, compared to $689,969 for
Bradley. Gore, the top-grossing Democrat, has $27.4 million in his
war chest, according to the most recent FEC records available,
while Bradley is in second place with $19.1 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, GOP contender George W. Bush has a record-breaking
$57.7 million year-to-date, followed by rival John McCain's $9.4
million, collected during the same time period.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
cuddled a 3-year-old girl whose arm had been hacked off by rebels,
then met with rebel leaders responsible for thousands of such
mutilations in this country's eight-year civil war, urging them
Monday to stick to a fragile peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of a weeklong visit to Africa, Albright said
that to insure lasting peace in this small West African nation, it
was critical that the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, take part in the
effort. Sankoh was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but he was
later freed and will occupy a high government position under a
peace deal that granted amnesty to the rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Albright pointedly avoided being photographed with Sankoh _
meeting him behind closed doors and providing no photo
opportunities _ and emphasized the importance of eventually
punishing war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The United States helped broker the peace deal, signed in July
in Lome, Togo, between the government of President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah and Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front. But the agreement
has been criticized by human rights groups as too lenient to those
responsible for some of the worst atrocities seen in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At a camp housing 516 men, women and children _ run by Doctors
Without Borders, the international relief organization that was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last week _ Albright walked around a
courtyard on red earth baked hard by a burning sun.
</P>
<P>
   She met long lines of people, most of whose arms had been
chopped off by machete-wielding rebels. ``It's hard to reach out a
hand to shake hands with somebody and know they do not have a
hand,'' she said later.
</P>
<P>
   Albright picked up a 3-year-old girl named Mamuna, who was
dressed in a red jumper and whose right arm had been taken off at
the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Mutari Jalo, who was missing his right arm and who was acting as
the camp's informal chairman, told her, ``We know the government of
America will help us to alleviate our suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks Monday, Albright said, ``Ultimately, the only way
that reconciliation really can come is if people have a sense that
justice has been done and those who have perpetrated the terrible
crimes are punished individually.''
</P>
<P>
   But she emphasized that peace must first become entrenched in
Sierra Leone, where carrying out the peace accord has been delayed
by bickering among rebel leaders and where 45,000 fighters have yet
to disarm. Sankoh has just returned from visiting a rebel
stronghold to encourage his men to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sankoh is delivering the right message,'' Albright said at a
news conference before meeting with him, ``and I hope very much he
will continue to intensify his efforts to insure full adherence to
the Lome accord. The atrocities must end, and abductees must be
released. The peace must be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sierra Leone's capital, she met Monday with Kabbah and
pledged $55 million in aid _ the only aid announcement made so far
on her trip. Most of it is to be used for for food, education and
efforts to control the illegal traffic in diamonds, which fueled
the civil war and has drawn in neighboring Liberia and Burkina Faso
at various points.
</P>
<P>
   She also promised $65 million in debt forgiveness, conditioned
on Sierra Leone's agreement to carry out an International Monetary
Fund economic program.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the American interest in helping Sierra Leone is related
to the Clinton administration's effort to find ways to distinguish
between legitimate diamond sales and those that finance strife in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels in Sierra Leone, as well as those in Angola and
Congo, have used diamond sales to prolong their conflicts. The war
in Sierra Leone appears to have drawn more attention from the
United States because of the nature of the atrocities against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Africa, her third as secretary of state,
began with a brief stop in Guinea. After her visit to Sierra Leone,
Albright arrived on Monday night in Mali, whose successful
transition from dictatorship to democracy has made it a model in an
unstable region. She was headed next to Nigeria, which recently
ended nearly 16 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   She is also to visit Tanzania and Kenya, in East Africa, where
the American embassies were bombed in 1998. On Thursday in
Tanzania, she will attend the state funeral for Julius Nyerere,
that country's founding father.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at the American ambassador's residence here, which
overlooks the green hills and blue bays of this seaside town,
Albright met with Sankoh and another rebel leader, Johnny Paul
Koroma.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit came two weeks after Sankoh's return to Sierra Leone.
His extended stay in Togo, after the peace agreement was signed
there in July, delayed carrying it out. The rebels were supposed to
start disarming in August, and the process is finally expected to
start this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return, Sankoh has said that people must forget the
past and move on. He has yet to visit the war amputees' camp, which
has become an obligatory stop for visiting dignitaries, including
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Koroma, who led another faction, paid a
surprise visit to the camp and, breaking down in tears, pleaded for
forgiveness. The amputees _ who like most ordinary Sierra Leoneans
have expressed grudging support for the peace deal _ jeered at him.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement, Sankoh will become the chairman of a
commission overseeing the country's mineral resources, with the
rank of vice president. Several of his men will occupy other
government positions in a power-sharing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, a cashiered army corporal and former commercial
photographer, began the civil war in 1991, saying that the
country's corrupt rulers had enriched themselves on diamonds while
leaving Sierra Leone one of the poorest countries in the world. He
attracted recruits in rural areas and for many years was rarely
seen as he waged war from the bush.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, his message of economic exploitation was
lost and his fighters became known for the atrocities they
committed.
</P>
<P>
   After Kabbah was elected president in 1996, the rebels began
slicing off civilians' hands _ in retribution, the rebels often
said, for having voted for Kabbah by putting a thumbprint next to
his name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths during the war is thought to be in the tens
of thousands and the number of amputations in the thousands, but
there are no accurate figures.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Africa is her first since President
Clinton's 12-day trip in March 1998. His visit _ with his pledge of
more American interest in the continent, his talk of an African
renaissance and a commitment to integrate African nations in the
international community _ drew enormous attention to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, many Africans and American critics of policy
toward Africa have said the United States has failed to follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States and the rest of the West quickly spent
billions of dollars in conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor, many of
the critics have pointed out that Western countries have done
comparatively little to intervene in civil wars in Sierra Leone,
Congo, Angola and Sudan and in the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea
_ all extremely lethal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has played a leading role in the international
community in assisting the peace process in Sierra Leone,'' the New
York-based Human Rights Watch wrote in a letter to Albright last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the letter continued, the commitment to justice shown to
Sierra Leone falls far short of that shown in Kosovo and East
Timor, ``even though the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone match
or surpass anything seen in these crises.''

REEBOK CITES SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS AT TWO FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an action praised by labor and human rights officials, Reebok
International Ltd. Monday released an independent study of two
factories in Indonesia that documented substandard working
conditions, including improper handling of hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by a Jakarta-based research and consulting
firm, Peduli Hak _ which is Indonesian for ``Caring for Rights'' _
said that the 10,000 workers in the two factories were not provided
with basic information that would help them to collect overtime
pay. They also were exposed to unhealthy conditions at their work
stations, and women were subject to gender bias, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Having documented similar working conditions for years, labor
and human rights activists lauded Reebok Monday, saying the study's
independence and the fact that the shoe and apparel company, based
in Stoughton, Mass., made it public should serve as a model for
other firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies are going to think about truly independent
studies of their overseas operations and taking real steps to
improve the conditions of these workers, this is a useful
example,'' said Sidney Jones, the director of Human Rights Watch's
Asian unit. ``They asked the right questions, developed a useful
methodology, and they've done it all with the fullest possible
transparency and made the findings public.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok said that, based on the report, it already has pushed for
improvements at the plants that cost $500,000 to implement. The
14-month-long study included interviews with 950 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems identified at the Reebok-contracted plants
were a lack of information for workers about work sheets, time
cards, and pay stubs at both factories, PT Dong Joe Indonesia and
PT Tong Yang Indonesia. Activists have complained for years that
workers in the industry are prevented from collecting overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian researchers also cited improper conditions for
disposing of chemical wastes and handling these materials; improper
ventilation systems; poor seating at work stations; and a bias
against women employees, especially as managers. Eighty percent of
employees at the two factories are women.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok says it has successfully pushed to provide for more
communication with the workers, in part by allowing them to review
their time sheets. New chairs have replaced problematic stools, and
special equipment has been ordered for the handling of hazardous
wastes, the company said. Reebok said it also is trying to break
down cultural biases against women.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, human rights groups, and student organizations have long
been pressing apparel and shoe manufacturers to identify their
contractors, disclose conditions, and open the plants for
independent monitoring; and to pay the workers a living wage. The
release of the independent Indonesian study of the Reebok plants
comes two weeks after Nike Inc. disclosed names and locations of 41
overseas factories it uses. Nike has been under intense pressure by
student activists who are pressing colleges to regulate production
of licensed apparel bearing school names.
</P>
<P>
   While praising Reebok's public disclosure of its report, some
labor and human rights activists, including the Interfaith
Coalition for Corporate Responsibility _ a group of 275 religious
organizations with more than $100 billion in corporate investments
_ said Reebok should move quickly to provide better wages and to
allow the workers to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the company that moved to China and Indonesia to get
away from union contracts,'' said Jeff Ballinger, a consultant at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and
a member of Press for Change, a group of activists that educates
consumers on factory conditions in Asia. ``They say that this is a
communication problem. It's really a power distribution problem.
These workers lack the power to represent themselves.''

STUDY SUGGESTS EXPERIMENTAL DRUG MAY BE BEHIND GULF WAR SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientific survey underwritten by the Pentagon
has concluded that an experimental drug given to American troops
during the Persian Gulf war to protect against a nerve gas may have
been responsible for the chronic illnesses afflicting tens of
thousands of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be released at a news conference on Tuesday, is
the first commissioned by the Pentagon to identify a possible cause
for the illnesses, which have collectively come to be known as Gulf
war syndrome. It sharply contradicts two earlier government studies
_ by a presidential commission and by the Institute of Medicine _
that ruled out the drug as a cause.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, pyridostigmine bromide, PB, was distributed to 250,000
to 300,000 of the nearly 700,000 American troops sent to the
Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991 as a ``pretreatment'' for potential
Iraqi attacks with the nerve agent soman. While the drug has been
used since 1955 to treat a rare neurological disorder, its use as
an antidote to soman is still regarded as experimental.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 veterans have reported experiencing symptoms
attributed to Gulf war syndrome, including chronic fatigue, muscle
pain, memory loss and sleep disorders. But because of the
Pentagon's admittedly shoddy record-keeping during the war, it may
be impossible to know how many of those took the drug and in what
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   The report represented a breakthrough after years in which the
Pentagon has systematically discounted possible explanations for
the ailments, from stress to exposure to oil-well fires and
depleted uranium used in American bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of the reaction of veterans' groups and their supporters in
Congress, Pentagon officials on Monday played down the findings of
the survey, which was conducted over the last two years by the Rand
Corp., a nonprofit research organization funded by the Department
of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Eureka,'' said Dr. Sue Bailey, a physician who
is the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bailey and other officials said they accepted the report's
findings but added that more studies were needed before a direct
scientific link could be established. They also said the Pentagon
would continue to keep PB in its arsenal of vaccinations and
antidotes for troops who might face attacks with chemical and
biological weapons, even though the survey's conclusions also raise
questions about the drug's effectiveness against soman in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by Dr. Beatrice Alexandra Golomb, is a
385-page review and is based on the findings of scores of medical
studies on PB and its effects.
</P>
<P>
   It cites recent studies that have linked the drug to
side-effects similar to those experienced by some veterans,
including one by Hebrew University in Israel that associated PB
with neurological disorders in mice and another by the University
of Texas and Duke University that concluded that PB, when mixed
with other chemicals, can cause nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Golomb's report then goes on to suggest that the drug's
short-term effects can become chronic as PB causes abnormal levels
of a nerve-signaling chemical called acetylcholine. The chemical is
involved in many important bodily functions, including sleep,
muscular activity, memory and pain, which have all been cited as
problems for ill veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that research has shown that individual
reactions to the drug depend on different factors, including
stress, physiological differences and exposure to other agents,
including pesticides, and even such benign things as nicotine and
caffeine. That would explain why only some veterans have reported
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot rule out the possibility that long-term effects of
PB might occur and might participate in the production of
neuropsychological and other deficits reported by some'' Gulf war
veterans, Dr. Golomb concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and veterans' advocates have long pointed to PB, as
well as other experimental drugs given to troops in the Gulf, as
one of the possible culprits in the still unexplained illnesses
attributed to ``Gulf war syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard D. Rostker, the undersecretary of the Army who
serves as the Pentagon's senior official overseeing Gulf war
illnesses, said the Pentagon strongly supported several studies
into PB because of those concerns, including Rand's survey. He said
that the Pentagon was already spending $20 million on additional
research into the possible links considered in Rand's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not mean we have made a direct relationship between
the two,'' he said, referring to PB and the syndrome. ``It means we
don't have enough information, and presses forward the issue of
research.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction on Capitol Hill was harsh. Rep. Christopher
Shays, a Republican from Connecticut and one of the most outspoken
critics of the Pentagon's handling of the issue, accused the
Pentagon of moving slowly to study the drug and of ``restating the
obvious need for aggressive research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad news is how little has been learned in eight years
about organophosphate poisoning and the delayed neuropathies that
appear to play a role in the illnesses suffered by Gulf war
veterans,'' Shays said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under a special waiver from the Food and Drug Administration,
the Pentagon distributed thousands of packets of PB to the troops
as they deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990 following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. Troops were ordered to take three of the flat white
tablets each day as long as they were in the region, although it
appears they did so erratically.
</P>
<P>
   PB is the only known treatment for soman, a deadly gas developed
by the Soviet Union. Although Iraq is known to have made weapons
with other nerve agents, including sarin, no evidence has surfaced
suggesting Iraq ever made weapons with soman.
</P>
<P>
   In her survey, Dr. Golomb also reported that some studies on
animals suggested that PB might not be particularly effective
against soman at the doses given and may in fact increase
susceptibility to other chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   PB has not been given to troops since the Gulf war, but Rostker
said the findings would not change the Pentagon's policy to use PB
whenever commanders determine that an enemy might have soman. The
Pentagon, he said, had to consider the trade-off between potential
side-effects and the immediate effects of the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its continued use is warranted given the fact that an exposure
to soman would result in almost immediate death,'' he said.

CLINTON AND REPUBLICANS TO MEET ON BUDGET DIFFERENCES

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Congress moved closer to a
showdown over the federal budget on Monday as the president vetoed
a foreign aid bill and then invited congressional leaders to a
meeting at the White House on Tuesday to discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to make tough choices, and we are going
to have to make them together,'' Clinton told reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded less confrontational than last week at his news
conference after the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test-ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol, Republican leaders accepted the president's
invitation. They emphasized, however, that they were not going to
participate in a ``budget summit'' as they had in the past, and
insisted that they deserved credit for persuading Clinton to
negotiate a budget that did not dip into Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president agrees with us that we ought not to touch Social
Security,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority
leader. ``That's music to my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   The rather conciliatory tone on both sides Monday masked the
breadth of the differences between Clinton and Congress in terms of
policy and politics. The outlook is for weeks more of sparring and
jockeying before an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither Clinton nor Congress is prepared to make the
spending cuts necessary to meet the limits set in the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act, they must take one of three courses to resolve their
differences:
</P>
<P>
   --They can increase taxes. Clinton has proposed an increase in
the cigarette tax, for instance, but the Republicans in Congress
have vowed not to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   --They can dip into money raised in Social Security taxes that
is not needed this year for benefits. This has been done every year
for generations. But to illustrate their commitment to Social
Security, Republican leaders have pledged not to take this course,
and Clinton has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   --They can resort to gimmicks. Already, the Republicans have
taken steps like declaring the 2000 census and other programs
emergencies so they do not count against budget ceilings, pushing
billions of dollars of spending into the next fiscal year,
including the postponement of one payday for the military, and
ordering the Congressional Budget Office to adopt a different
method of projecting spending that will result in a lower total.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet is that the recourse will be more gimmicks.
Gimmicks can meet the problem of spending too much money, but they
cannot resolve the differences over policy. For example, Clinton
intends to veto the spending bill for the Departments of Labor,
Education and Health and Human Services in part because it does not
adopt the administration's plan for reducing class size in the
nation's schools and paying for more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to veto the bill for the Interior Department
because it includes Republican measures favorable to the oil,
timber and cattle industries that he considers harmful to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign aid bill was the second spending measure Clinton
vetoed this year. Last month, he vetoed the appropriations bill for
the District of Columbia. Lawmakers expect to send a slightly
revised district bill this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the veto message he sent to Congress Monday morning, Clinton
said the foreign aid measure was ``another sign of a new
isolationism that would have America bury its head in the sand at
the height of our power and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton objected to the failure of the bill to provide money he
had sought for the Middle East peace accord negotiated last year at
Wye River, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois accused the president of
wanting to ``raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for more
foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 spending bills to finance the various departments and
agencies in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, five have been
signed into law, and three are likely to be signed this week. But
the White House says that Clinton will probably veto the bill for
the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice in addition to those
for Labor and Interior and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 1, government offices have stayed open under a
temporary spending measure that expires on Thursday. The president
and Republican leaders said Monday that they would agree to another
stopgap measure so they would have more time to work out their
differences. &QL;

   CONYERS, Ga. _ The national spotlight is returning to Rockdale
County tonight, but residents aren't sure they're ready for another
close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Frontline's documentary, ``The Lost Children of Rockdale
County,'' is the buzz of the community, with residents hoping that
they will be treated fairly and that the program will be balanced
to include a mention of those children who have managed to stay out
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's not going to do our community's image a whole
lot of good,'' said Pat Wilson, a counselor at Rockdale County High
School. ``But if it is done in a way that the focus is to impress
the need for kids not to have so much unfocused time . . . maybe it
will be good.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary marks the second time in the past year that
Rockdale County has been under the national microscope. The first
occasion came five months ago when Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon shot
six of his Heritage High School classmates as they waited in the
commons area for school to begin May 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, Solomon _ then unknown to the public _ is
seen walking among a procession of students down one of the
school's hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockdale County school system sent a letter home to parents
informing them of the program and of the community forum,
spokeswoman Susan Paul Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the scope of this program, we just wanted parents to
be aware and to support the community forum,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Sosebee, a nurse manager at the Rockdale County Health
Department, said she hopes the Frontline program will help parents
realize that what they see and hear on the program can happen to
their children.
</P>
<P>
   She said the activities that led to the outbreak in Rockdale are
happening all over the country. If it were not for the outbreak,
the activities would have continued unabated without anyone's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, people believed these kids belonged to someone
else,'' Sosebee, said. ``They didn't. Any child today is at risk,
and parents have to open up the lines of communication at home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years ago, a self-effacing Russian emigre with scant
business experience set up a modest New Jersey company that planned
to introduce entrepreneurs from the new Russia to American
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berlin's company, Benex Worldwide Ltd., got off to a slow
start. But after a few years of arranging shipments of stereos and
other electronic products to Russia, Berlin hit on something
simpler and more lucrative to move around the world: money.
</P>
<P>
   It proved an inspired choice. Nearly everyone in Russia with any
money, from businessmen to gangsters, was searching for ways to
hide their cash from onerous taxes or overly inquisitive
investigators. Berlin offered a fast, discreet vehicle for moving
dollars offshore _ lots of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's companies opened accounts at the Bank of New York,
where his wife, Lucy Edwards, was an executive, and began whisking
billions of dollars a year out of Russia. Ms. Edwards was in an
ideal position to help. Just as her husband began his new business
in 1996, she was promoted to a prestigious job in London at the
bank drumming up commercial clients in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The couple prospered. According to people involved in an
investigation into the couple's finances, they earned millions of
dollars from Benex's dealings, depositing the money offshore in
accounts in Britain's Channel Islands and elsewhere. Berlin and Ms.
Edwards, who had previously owned a small home in upstate New York,
bought a $500,000 apartment in central London and enrolled their
daughter in an expensive private school.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say little distinguished them from other Russian
immigrants aspiring to upper middle-class success in the United
States. The diminutive Ms. Edwards, who rose from an entry level
job to executive in just eight years at the Bank of New York, was
known for her diligence and energy in recruiting clients. Russian
businessmen say Berlin had no obvious links to the titans of
Russia's new market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the couple is now at the center of the biggest
federal money laundering investigation in history as law
enforcement officials try to sort out how more than $7 billion
sluiced through Berlin's companies over three years. Much remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators, for example, suspect Berlin's
transformation from small-time businessman to leader of a widely
used company was orchestrated by someone in Russia with ties to
leading business or political figures. But thus far, neither they
nor British investigators have been able to figure out who this
might be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' role remains equally unclear. British investigators
who raided the couple's apartment in London in August found
business cards and stationery for the Benex company that carried
the Bank of New York logo. It is not known whether Ms. Edwards
recruited clients for the money-moving businesses; prosecutors
assert she was directly involved in expediting at least one
transfer through Benex, and Western financiers say she ran
financial seminars in Russia in which Benex's consulting services
were promoted using the Bank of New York name.

   Investigators are still trying to unravel precisely whose money
washed through Berlin's companies. Some of the more than 87,000
electronic transfers, they say, appear to involve legitimate
Russian companies financing the purchase of imported goods and
evading taxes. Some has been linked to Russian racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which is cooperating with the
investigation, has not been accused of doing anything wrong. In an
indictment this month that federal prosecutors said was just the
beginning of a far-reaching international inquiry, Berlin, Ms.
Edwards and an associate were charged with illegally operating a
money transfer business and taking deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already had an impact few could have foreseen. It
has roiled relations between Washington and Moscow, sparked a
congressional inquiry, given new momentum to corruption
investigations into the financial dealings of Russia's business
titans and President Boris Yeltsin's family, and has become an
issue in upcoming presidential elections here and in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Ms. Edwards are still living in London where their
apartment is frequented by photographers and journalists seeking
interviews. They and their lawyers have declined comment. Ms.
Edwards' London-based lawyer has said she has done nothing wrong
and the bank had no grounds for firing her.

   The Beginnings: Two Long Roads From Russia
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Ms. Edwards came of age in a country in which banking
was depicted as the glue holding together America's morally
bankrupt economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, born Ludmilla Pritzker in Leningrad, was the first
of the two to make her way to the West. In 1977, Ms. Pritzker
married Brad Edwards, a 19-year old American merchant seaman she
had met at a club in Leningrad. After a civil wedding at the
American consulate in Leningrad, they moved to Illinois where their
daughter, Amy was born. The couple then settled in Colorado where
Ms. Edwards held a succession of jobs as a bank teller and
waitress.
</P>
<P>
   After the marriage fell apart in 1988, Ms. Edwards almost
immediately landed an entry-level job handling commercial accounts
at the Bank of New York, one of the country's oldest and most
prestigious banks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Bank of New York took over Irving Trust, which was
doing extensive business in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. Ms. Edwards joined the newly formed Eastern European
Division in 1992 and became a loan officer two years later, moving
for the first time into the executive ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' bosses in the Eastern European unit were two
well-regarded bank officers, Vladimir Galitzine, an American-born
Russian with a royal pedigree, and Natasha Gurfinkel, an Ivy
League-educated woman who, like Ms Edwards, was a Russian immigrant
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's strategy was straightforward. It hoped to become a
key overseas player in Russia by making it easier for Russian
companies to conduct business overseas. Ms. Edwards' verve in
searching for clients immediately set her apart, associates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguished her to everyone was her energy, incredible
energy,'' said a former colleague of Ms. Edwards. ``When others
would see four or five clients a day, she would see 10 or 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berlin's road to Western success appears to have been less
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that a man named Peter Berlin graduated from the
Moscow Institute on Physics and Technology in 1978 with a degree in
molecular chemical physics. According to the institute, Berlin
lived in one of Moscow's better quarters, a quiet block of
Stalin-era apartments with tree-lined streets.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin left Russia about 10 years ago, just as Communism was
collapsing. His neighbors in Russia knew little about his travels,
saying simply that he had ``gone to the West.''
</P>
<P>
   A trim, bearded man who stands about 5-foot-9, Berlin may have
lived in Indiana before he moved to New Jersey. His immigration
status is not clear; many Russians who travel under such
circumstances leave Moscow on a tourist visa and then stay in the
United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1992, Berlin married Ms. Edwards, a union that
would have solved many immigration problems. A relative would say
only that they met and married in the same year. There was, she
said, nothing unusual about it.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, he was trying his hand at business. He founded Benex,
which listed his apartment in Cliffside Park, N.J., as its
operating address. After several years, Berlin hooked up with a
major, Moscow-based dealer in consumer electronics and began
brokering sales of televisions and other items.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Edwards rose through the ranks at the Bank of New York,
the couple's finances modestly improved. They bought a $125,000
house in Narrowsburg, N.Y. Acquaintances say Berlin has a taste for
fine art, particularly Impressionist paintings, but some found him,
and his wife, uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not high-cultured and didn't seem to have much
spiritual value,'' said Vadim Borshai, a Russian artist and a
neighbor who lived near them in Narrowsburg. ``There was no poetry
in their soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also had brushes with local law enforcement. Seven
years ago, as she glided through the aisles of a Nordstrom
department store in Edison, N.J., Ms. Edwards tried to steal more
than $1,400 of clothing. She was arrested and pleaded guilty, only
to repeat the offense two years later at a Bloomingdale's store in
Hackensack, N.J. _ this time, with 15 year-old Amy in tow. Ms.
Edwards was arrested again and later pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which was employing her, did not learn of
either arrest until after federal investigators began scrutinizing
the Benex accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was arrested for shoplifting six years ago, records show,
when he was charged in Fairview, N.J., with stealing sinus medicine
from a local A&AMP;P. He retained a lawyer, and the charges were
dropped.

<P>
   The Companies: Red Flags Ignored By The Bank
</P>
<P>
   On a winter day three years ago, Berlin took a step that would
change his life: He strolled into the Bank of New York's Wall
Street headquarters and opened an account in the name of Benex
International. Six months later, in July, 1996, he opened an
account in the name of Becs International at the same branch.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Bank of New York said that Berlin initially
represented Benex and Becs as tour companies. The bank did little
digging of its own to learn anything more about the companies'
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Closer scrutiny by the bank would have revealed corporate
records on file with the state of New Jersey showing that one of
their employees, Ms. Edwards, was one of two officers at Benex
(Berlin was the other). The bank's own records noted that Ms.
Edwards had authority to withdraw money from the Becs account.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these facts were red flags. Banks typically restrict
employees from playing a direct role in customers' businesses. The
Bank of New York allows such arrangements only with permission of
its chairman. Ms. Edwards formal links to her husband's ventures,
the bank says, did not surface until late 1998, after the federal
inquiry began.
</P>
<P>
   Bank employees knew that Berlin and Ms. Edwards were married,
but this apparently only served to shield the accounts from
scrutiny. In congressional testimony last month, the bank's chief
executive, Thomas A. Renyi, said that the fact that Berlin was
married to ``a well regarded bank officer'' dissuaded bank auditors
from looking more closely at the money in the accounts. He
described that as ``a lapse on the part of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to look at. It is not clear precisely when the
companies began moving money out of Russia, but by 1996, they had
become one of the more heavily used pipelines for sending cash
offshore. Millions of dollars a day coursed through the network,
pouring through the Bank of New York unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Banks do not typically make much profit transferring money from
one country to another. They charge their better clients a small
fee, as little as a few dollars per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators say that in Russia's volatile economy,
Berlin was able to charge a premium for a service that ran through
the reliable, prestigious Bank of New York. His companies,
investigators say, were paid a percentage of the total transferred,
earning millions of dollars in profits.
</P>
<P>
   There were some uniquely Russian forces fueling the demand for
Berlin's services. Russia's high taxes and import tariffs give
businessmen powerful incentives to hide the true costs of their
deals, whether importing goods, buying property, or consummating
routine deals. Offshore accounts help hide the volume of trade and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Berlin opened his first account at the bank,
Ms. Edwards was courted by a Moscow-based bank but was persuaded to
stay at the Bank of New York with a prestigious promotion. She was
sent to London and named a vice president, responsible for finding
new business among Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   The couple enrolled their daughter in the American School in
London and bought an apartment in a central London neighborhood.
Both Berlin and Ms. Edwards wore off-the-rack business suits, a
former colleague said. They sometimes spent weekends in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1996 and 1998, there seemed to be more money,'' the
colleague said. `Peter was doing better, or that is what everyone
attributed it to. But there was no ostentation, no high-priced
clothing or jewelry.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Berlin's companies appear to have transacted much of their
business from a nondescript office building in Queens, where a
handful of people working with computers arranged hundreds of
electronic transfers a day.
</P>
<P>
   Russian investigators have told their American counterparts that
they believe crime groups in Russia exercised some form of control
over the operation. American officials say they have no evidence of
that, but are still trying to understand how Berlin corralled so
much money so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The customers appear to have covered the entire range of Russian
commerce. Federal investigators believe much of the money came from
corporate clients trying to avoid taxes and customs duties. Some of
it, they say, was moved by Russian criminal groups. Italian
prosecutors have found that Russian gangs operating out of Northern
Italy, for example, used Benex to transfer several million dollars
out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the $7 billion handled by Berlin's companies
moved through the accounts before any suspicions arose. But in
early 1998, investigators in two countries, working on different
cases, began asking questions about Becs, Benex and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office, working with British
officials on a money laundering and stock manipulation case, found
that a Russian emigre they were investigating was moving $300,000
to $500,000 a week through Benex into the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the Russian government separately asked the
FBI for help in tracing the ransom in a kidnapping case. The money,
it turned out, moved through a Benex account at the Bank of New
York on its way to Russian organized crime figures, prompting the
bureau to open its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry focused more closely on Berlin in August 1998, after
Republic Bank told the FBI that $10 million had passed from Russia
through an account controlled by one of his companies.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's money moving operations continued at full throttle
through the fall of 1998. But something had changed. His companies
were being watched.

<P>
   The Investigations: A Slow Start, Startling Disclosures
</P>
<P>
   In its initial phases, the case did not make much of a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators served a subpoena on the Bank of New York
in September 1998 for account records relating to Berlin's
companies, among hundreds of such requests the bank receives each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were startled by what they found. The
records showed a dizzying array of transfers out of Russia and to
dozens of countries, including in some cases back to Russia. The
trail led around the world.
</P>
<P>
   British investigators began electronic surveillance of Berlin
and Ms. Edwards conversations and the FBI received transcripts,
according to American law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In March, confronted with requests for additional information,
Bank of New York officials finally informed Renyi, the bank's
chairman, that a problem had arisen with the accounts used by
Berlin's companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest of the investigative agencies heated up in March
and that's when it went to the CEO,'' said one person with
knowledge of the investigation at the bank. ``There were people who
knew there was a big-time amount of money there after the first
subpoenas came in September of '98. But it wasn't until six months
later that it went to the CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are conflicting views of how actively the FBI pursued the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous officials, including current and former members of the
New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, the New York state
Banking Department, and Britain's National Crime Squad assert that
the bureau moved too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials maintain that they made a
choice, at the outset, to investigate the case covertly. Berlin's
accounts, they say, offered a rare window into Russian financial
chicanery, provided the inquiry could be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were trying to determine whether the
rapid-fire transfers were money-laundering, a difficult case to
make because prosecutors must prove that the cash at issue was used
in a crime such as drug dealing, extortion or fraud. The FBI,
officials said, hoped to infiltrate the organization and find out
more about how Russians launder their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got frustrated because we were trying to do
the investigation without letting the targets know we were doing
it,'' said one federal law enforcement official. ``We were actively
investigating the money laundering case, but we restrained
ourselves from doing anything that would tip them off. ''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Ms. Edwards were surprisingly open about the links
between their two careers. For example, brochures for Berlin's
companies carried the Bank of New York logo. The couple traveled
together to Russia and in 1996 and 1997 and Berlin sometimes signed
his name to tabs billed to Ms Edwards' expense account at the Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   That discrepancy was eventually noticed by bank auditors in
1998, before the federal inquiry began, but it did not prompt a
closer look at the couple's financial dealings, according to people
close to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were struggling to understand a case that
was largely unfolding in Moscow. The leads, law enforcement
officials said, went in myriad, sometimes unfruitful directions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators at one point contemplated using an
American diplomat in Moscow as an undercover agent. Ms. Edwards and
Berlin made contact with the diplomat in 1998 in an attempt to
secure American government backing for their plan to convert a
Russian defense factory to civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was later taped by British investigators as he boasted
his ties to the diplomat. The plan was called off after The New
York Times disclosed the inquiry last August.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the federal investigation now a very public event,
Ms. Edwards and Berlin, those investigating them, and the Bank of
New York, all face complicated problems.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI can no longer conduct a covert investigation, leaving
the bureau with the more difficult task of piecing the Benex puzzle
together with help from Russia, or by persuading witnesses to come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Bank of New York has been cooperating with the
investigation, federal authorities have indicated that they still
plan to take a hard look at how the bank handled various issues
surrounding Berlin's accounts. The Manhattan district attorney's
office also has its own investigation underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, with a federal indictment hanging over their heads, and
their bank accounts frozen, the pressure on Berlin and Ms. Edwards
to cooperate with the federal investigation has intensified. But so
far they have remained silent, declining all interview requests
from authorities or the press.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Ms. Edwards remained holed up in her London
apartment, she used her building's intercom system to decline an
interview request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could help you, but I can't,'' she said.

<P>
   In impoverished, conflict-ridden Pakistan, where the army chief,
General Pervez Musharraf, seized power from a corrupt civilian
government last week, deeds will matter much more than words.
Nevertheless, Musharraf's first address to the nation Sunday held
out the promise of some much-needed improvements in the governance
of Pakistan and in its relations with India.
</P>
<P>
   What Pakistanis know and Washington should acknowledge is that
the polity ruled by Nawaz Sharif, who as prime minister had been
whittling down the powers of the presidency, the courts, and
Parliament, was democratic in name only.
</P>
<P>
   If Musharraf's security council of two military leaders and four
technocrats can clean up the corruption of the country's political
system as promised, Pakistan will have a chance to take the first
step on the path to economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   At present the country is staggering under a foreign debt of $32
billion and has foreign exchange reserves of only $1.5 billion.
Pakistan has defaulted on $877 million in foreign commercial loans,
and because of its nuclear tests in May 1998, it has been excluded
from commercial debt markets. Moreover, the International Monetary
Fund has withheld $280 million of a $1.6 billion loan package, and
the rescheduling of billions more in debt depends on resumption of
IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf must end corruption and begin collecting enormous sums
of unpaid taxes. He also needs to tell his compatriots and the
international community how long his unconstitutional,
unrepresentative government plans to stay in power. His silence on
that subject was the greatest failing of his Sunday address to the
nation. If only to reassure Pakistan's creditors, Musharraf should
establish a timetable for the return of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he would thin out troops along the border with
India and restrain nuclear testing, Musharraf also pledged support
for ``our Kashmiri brethren.'' But if he truly wants to save
Pakistan from economic collapse and chaos, he will pursue a
diplomatic resolution of its conflict with India over Kashmir.

SHOOTER'S FAMILY CONSIDERING LAWSUIT AGAINST SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In the first public sign of discord between the
families of the teen-agers responsible for the killings at
Columbine High School, the parents of Dylan Klebold are considering
a lawsuit against Jefferson County, claiming that the authorities
ignored indications that the other shooter, Eric Harris, had
violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and Thomas Klebold argued in papers filed on Friday with
the county attorney that the sheriff's office was ``reckless,
willful and wanton'' in failing to respond to complaints in 1998
that Harris had threatened to kill another student.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, any lawsuit against a government agency must be
proceeded by a notification, known as an ``intent to sue'' claim,
within 180 days of the event. The shootings in which Harris and
Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before turning their guns
on themselves, occurred on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds filed ``intent to sue'' claims against the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, as did the families of 14
victims, four of whom died, and one teacher. Thirteen of the
families also filed papers with the county school district, and at
least eight filed with the county probationary department because
at the time of the shootings, both Harris and Klebold were on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   The filing took many officials by surprise because the Klebolds
cited previous incidents involving Harris that they contend should
have alerted the authorities to his potential for violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that if the authorities had told them and the
probation department that Harris once threatened to kill a student,
the knowledge ``would more likely than not have caused the Klebolds
to become aware of dangers of which they were not aware and demand
that their son, Dylan, be excluded from all contacts with Eric
Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   William A. Tuthill III, an assistant county attorney, said the
claim ``is without any legal basis whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the Klebolds, Gary Lozow, and Benjamin Colkitt,
who represents the Harrises, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   For those who proceed with a lawsuit, the rewards may be
minimal. Under Colorado law, a plaintiff suing a government agency
can recover no more than $150,000, and the agency is liable for no
more than $600,000 for any one incident.

 &HT;    Now, pressure's on Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Considering what the Braves have _ and have not _
accomplished this decade, they might have felt less pressure this
season than any other.
</P>
<P>
   But on the longest Sunday afternoon in playoff history, it all
changed.
</P>
<P>
   An epic, 15-inning loss to the New York Mets sent the Braves
home contemplating an offense gone stagnant, a rotation with little
room for error, a bullpen looking strangely vulnerable and an
opponent still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves still hold a 3-2 lead in the National League
Championship Series, which resumes tonight at Turner Field. But
it's a different series now. This NLCS just got interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The tide turned Saturday night with John Olerud's chopper off
Ozzie Guillen's glove, giving the Mets their first victory of the
series. By the time Robin Ventura hit the grand-slam-that-wasn't in
the bottom of the 15th on Sunday, the Mets had left New York in
bedlam and the South in shock.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets don't have much to lose at this point, having been all
but finished three different times this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have so much to lose. If they don't get their offense
going and win either tonight or Wednesday night in a potential Game
7, they would become only the third team in professional sports
history _ and the first in Major League Baseball _ to blow a 3-0
lead in a best-of-seven series. They would do it in the final year
of the decade they still have a chance to claim as their own. They
would fall a giant step short of the World Series for the third
year in a row to finish the 1990s with one World Series title in
four trips.
</P>
<P>
   So where does all of that leave the Braves?
</P>
<P>
   They were last seen around 10 p.m. Sunday in a quiet visitors'
clubhouse at Shea Stadium. Greg Maddux, one of the least outspoken
but most respected players in their clubhouse, had nodded that,
yes, Sunday's loss was the most heartbreaking he ever had endured.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said of winning the NLCS: ``You don't care when or
how, you just want to do it. We're still breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he could break into an easy smile as he said, ``It's a good
thing we won the first three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux spent 10 to 15 minutes in front of his locker quietly
talking to wave after wave of reporters. After that, he walked over
to 22-year-old pitcher Kevin McGlinchy, who lost in a heap of mud
and walks in Game 5 Sunday, and gave him a pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   For all the killer instinct the Braves have displayed over the
past several weeks, including using Kevin Millwood to shut the door
on the Astros in Game 3 of the Division Series and John Smoltz to
close out Game 2 of the NLCS against the Mets, they had a glaring
lack of it in Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The game wound down with McGlinchy a sitting duck in the pouring
rain as Ventura came up to bat in the 15th. Millwood and Tom
Glavine were not an option, manager Bobby Cox said, because he
didn't want to take a chance on either one getting hurt in the poor
conditions and he didn't want to disrupt the rotation for the final
two games of the series, if both are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning might have had some Braves quietly frustrated.
But it also might have the opposite effect. That Cox felt secure
enough to look beyond the kind of loss that could rip a team apart
might give the Braves some reason to feel at ease in the greatest
pressure this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to have a short memory,'' infielder Keith
Lockhart said. ``You can't dwell on it.'' Lockhart would like to
forget getting thrown out at the plate in the 13th and then having
his run-scoring triple in the top of the 15th wasted in the Mets'
two-run rally in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves didn't work out Monday. Cox gave the team the day off
to spend with their families. Only Millwood, tonight's starter,
came to the ballpark, to meet with the media. There, he explained
that having Monday to themselves could help the Braves put Sunday
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if (Games 5 and 6) were back-to-back it would have an
effect,'' Millwood said. ``But I think with us having today off and
being able to go home and get the game out of our head a little
bit, I don't think it will be that big of an effect tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would prefer to focus on a change of scenery and the
comforts of Turner Field, where they have won 13 of their past 14
games against the Mets. And focus on having their best pitcher this
season and one of their best pitchers in the postseason scheduled
for Games 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need one more win,'' shortstop Walt Weiss said.
``We'll take our chances with Millwood on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood last saw his teammates on the team's charter flight on
Sunday night. It was quiet, as expected, but Millwood said that
reaction was normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same old, same old,'' he said. ``If we had lost the
game on getaway day (during the regular season), it's pretty much
the same thing. Nobody is too down; nobody is too up. I think
everybody is just preparing for tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Mets mania grips Big Apple
 &HT;    By Bob Dart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ya gotta believe that this place was nuts about the
Mets on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Their team's amazing 15-inning win over the Atlanta Braves
Sunday evening gave New Yorkers at least one more day for goading
and hoping, and they took advantage of the opportunity. ``Tomahawk
chop that, Atlanta,'' gloated The New York Daily News. ``They
cannot be killed,'' declared The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the longest playoff game ever, Mets fans
marveled at the pluck and luck of their team and proclaimed that
the win was yet another miracle. They see destiny as on their side
after the second dramatic win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Yankee fans were happy about it,'' said Don Murphy, the
bartender at Mustang Sally's, a 7th Avenue sports bar. ``What can
you say? These guys won't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've got a good chance,'' said Mike Telfer, a Mets fan
working security at Madison Square Garden. ``That's the reason
they're called amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   There was special delight in beating the Southern team that has
dominated the league for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't like the Atlanta Braves,'' said Harry
Appel, another guard at the Garden. ``They're a lot like the
Yankees with their rich owner. They're just a team with a lot of
money that thinks you can buy wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Braves still lead three games to two in the
best-of-seven series to determine the National League champion.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Yankees leading the Boston Red Sox in the American
League Championship Series, this whole town is in a tizzy over the
prospect of the first Subway Series in the last 43 years. Some fans
have even taken it as an omen that the city's underground rail
system will likely record a 30-year low in felonies this year, the
fewest since 1969, the year of the original Amazin' Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town must be excited,'' said Jim Root, who manages a
sports memorabilia store near Pennsylvania Station. ``Not many
people showed up for the Rangers game last night. They sat in bars
holding their hockey tickets and watching the baseball games.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first season in quite a while, Root said, he's selling
as many Mets caps and jerseys as Yankee gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for a Subway Series,'' he said. ``That way the city
could just schedule the ticker tape parade ahead of time because
one of our teams would definitely win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to God there is a Subway Series,'' echoed Mike Booth, a
Yankees fan sitting in Cafe 31, a sports bar on 31st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance,'' said Kevin Roundtree, who was
sitting on a nearby stool wearing an orange Mets jersey, ``although
we'll be playing with two pitchers going on three days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans were still reliving the previous night's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy. Nuts. The best game I ever saw in my life,''
said Rich Morrison, who watched at Mustang Sally's. ``I can't wait
till tomorrow night.''

 McCAIN WINS ENDORSEMENT OF INFLUENTIAL NEW YORK REPUBLICAN  
(th) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an abrupt turnabout, Staten Island Borough
President Guy Molinari endorsed Sen. John McCain of Arizona for
president on Monday, breaking ranks with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Gov. George Pataki and a host of other New York Republicans who
have lined up behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The switch by Molinari, who had been an early supporter of Bush,
reflected his anger at Pataki over a recent series of snubs and
over the controlling role the governor has taken in the Bush
campaign in New York state. And it immediately created an awkward
situation for Giuliani, who remains a close friend of McCain even
after endorsing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting Molinari's endorsement, McCain, a leading proponent
of campaign finance reform, said he believed that Giuliani had
endorsed Bush to help the mayor raise money for his prospective
campaign for U.S. Senate next year. Giuliani later rejected that
assertion, saying he was impressed by Bush's executive experience.
</P>
<P>
   Just 18 days ago, Molinari stood next to Giuliani in the Blue
Room at City Hall as the mayor endorsed Bush in a telephone call to
Texas that was broadcast over a loudspeaker for reporters. The
three men joked and laughed as Giuliani proclaimed unanimous New
York support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have with me Borough President Guy Molinari of Staten
Island, who is an old friend of President Bush and of Governor
Bush,'' the mayor said then. ``And he and I and Republicans all
throughout the city of New York and the state of New York are
united in our support of Governor Bush for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied, jokingly: ``You said Guy Molinari is my old
friend. He is not that old.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the white-haired Molinari stood next to the
white-haired McCain at the Vietnam veterans' memorial in lower
Manhattan and said that after a month of soul-searching about the
impending presidential race, he had decided to switch camps and had
agreed to serve as chairman of the McCain campaign in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have continued to support Governor Bush, who of course
is the present front-runner,'' Molinari said. ``After all, he has
amassed far more financial resources than any other candidate. But
sometimes, sometimes, you just have to stand up and say, `Despite
all the odds, my overwhelming respect for a candidate like John
McCain demands that I rise to endorse him.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican officials have pointed to a number of recent
incidents that have widened a rift between Molinari and Pataki. In
the spring, Molinari accused Pataki of trying to hinder Giuliani's
efforts to raise money for a Senate bid. The governor has also
ignored Molinari's requests that he pardon a former police
lieutenant in prison for carrying out illegal raids.
</P>
<P>
   And Mmlinari has bristled at reports that Pataki wants Charles
A. Gargano, chairman of Empire State Development Corp., to be
chairman of the Bush campaign in New York. Molinari repeated his
criticism Monday, saying Gargano worked against Bush's father in
the 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, at his daily news conference, said Molinari was wrong
about Pataki. ``I think the reason that he's doing it is wrong,''
the mayor said of the McCain endorsement. ``I think Governor Pataki
is doing a good job in running not only the state but running the
party. I think he has organized it correctly behind the candidate
who has the best chance to win the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he understood the mayor's decision to support the
Republican front-runner. ``A few weeks ago he and I went to lunch
and I urged the mayor to do whatever is necessary so that we could
have him in the United States Senate,'' McCain said. ``The best
way, probably, for him to get the United States Senate would be to
take the present course that he is on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why endorsing Bush would help the mayor's Senate chances,
McCain, whose campaign finance reform bill is being debated in the
U.S. Senate this week, replied simply, ``Money.'' Asked what he
meant, McCain repeated, ``Money.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Monday, Bush said:
``Guy's a good _ I've known him for a long time. He's a good man.
And we just disagree. I think I ought to be the party's nominee and
he thinks the senator from Arizona ought to be the party's nominee.
Should I win the nomination, I hope he'll help me in the general
election.''

SBC TO UPGRADE ACCESS TO INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ANDREA AHLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SBC Communications unveiled a $6 billion initiative to provide
high-speed Internet access to about 80 percent of its customers in
the next three years, the company said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio-based company, which is the nation's largest
local phone provider, intends to sell voice, data and video
services over its upgraded infrastructure in the 13 states it
currently serves. The initiative is expected to reduce operating
expenses and generate $3.5 billion in new revenues by 2004, SBC
said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's network upgrade plans are the latest development in the
ongoing battle between telecommunications and cable companies for
high-speed Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies offer access through cable modems while
telephone companies can provide access via digital subscriber
lines, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said SBC had been expected to make some type of
announcement about its broadband plans after the completion of its
merger with Ameritech, taking advantage of the new markets and 60
million access lines the merger gave SBC. When the three-year
deployment is complete, SBC will be able to offer high-speed
Internet service to 77 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today, our broadband capabilities are going to take a
quantum leap,'' said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   SBC has upgraded 58 central offices in the Fort Worth-Dallas
area and will have all 63 offices equipped for DSL by the end of
the year, said Chris Rice, regional vice president of network
engineering for Southwestern Bell, an SBC subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   With the new initiative _ called Project Pronto _ DSL service
will be available to the majority of Southwestern Bell customers in
Tarrant and Dallas counties, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC also expects to hire several hundred new employees in Fort
Worth-Dallas to help build and install the service for customers,
Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts said the push to upgrade its network is a key
growth opportunity for SBC, the market did not respond as favorably
to the announcement. SBC stock was down 25 cents on Monday, closing
at $48.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might be concerned about the $6 billion expenditure,
which will affect SBC's revenues for the next three years, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the program is expected to increase SBC's earnings about 14
to 15 percent from 2000 to 2001, said Omar Melo, an associate
analyst at Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the initiative nicely positions SBC to
take advantage of the growing high-speed market and puts it ahead
of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The company that is first to the market often is the one that
has the most success with the new product, said Robert Wilkes, a
telecommunications analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, you are having a race between the phone
companies and the cable companies to have high-speed services
available to their customer bases,'' Wilkes said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of DSL users is expected to grow from 250,000 in 1999
to 2.7 million in 2002, according to the Yankee Group, a market
research firm in Boston. Cable modem users are also expected to
grow from 1 million this year to 4.3 million in 2002, the Yankee
Group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We envision a time when the computer Web-based experience and
the traditional telephone experience come together,'' said James D.
Gallemore, SBC executive vice president of strategic marketing and
planning. ``We intend to create an easy-to-use tool that people can
use to surf the media-rich Net, complete with video, and manage and
use all of their communications.''
</P>
<P>
   With the initiative, SBC said it will guarantee customers an
Internet connection of 1.5 megabits per second, about 50 times
faster than a standard 28.8 kilobyte-per-second dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   SBC currently guarantees a connection of only 384 kilobytes per
second, and the service costs about $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced on Monday that it would provide DSL
access to active investors on E-Trade, an online investing site.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, SBC will provide DSL service to
about 15,000 IBM telecommuting employees in select areas.

 &HT;    Quarterbacks suddenly an endangered species
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NFL quarterbacks had another tough Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Dan Marino, who became the first player to surpass
60,000 passing yards, is doubtful for Sunday's game against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Marino injured his right, throwing shoulder in practice last
week and threw only three passes in the Dolphins' 31-30 victory at
New England. He was replaced by Damon Huard, who rallied the
Dolphins from a nine-point deficit in the final 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Marino had an MRI exam on his shoulder Monday, and doctors
discovered a bone spur in his lower neck. They advised him not to
practice until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just see what kind of strength Dan has throwing the
ball,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``If he isn't 100
percent, Huard will start. Dan's going to want to play even if he
has no arm. That doesn't mean he's the right one to win the game
with. I want the guy that's going to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jake Plummer is expected to miss four to six weeks
after suffering a broken ring finger on his right hand during a
24-10 loss to the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who never has missed a start in his three-year NFL
career, was injured when the finger got stuck in the face mask of
Redskins linebacker Shawn Bates on a sack.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are off this week and host New England on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets coach Bill Parcells said Rick Mirer, benched
before his team's 16-13 loss to Indianapolis, will start against
the Raiders on Sunday. Backup Ray Lucas suffered a sprained left
ankle on the final play of his first NFL start and will miss three
to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch is expected to play against
Carolina on Sunday after his right arm was bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Banged-up millionaires
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks aren't the only players hurting. Buffalo Bills
receiver Eric Moulds will miss three to four weeks with a strained
hamstring. Minnesota running back Robert Smith could be sidelined
as long as six weeks with a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   Also, wide receivers Herman Moore (leg) of Detroit, Darnay Scott
(bruised ribs) of Cincinnati and Curtis Conway (sprained ankle) of
Chicago are doubtful this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals running back Corey Dillon is questionable with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   George is back
</P>
<P>
   Vikings quarterback Jeff George will start Sunday's game against
San Francisco. George replaced struggling starter Randall
Cunningham for the second half of Minnesota's 25-23 loss at
Detroit. The loss dropped the Vikings to 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all must-wins from here on out,'' George said. ``I
think you have to go into each game saying, `This is a must-win.'
If we want to accomplish the goals that we set out to accomplish,
every week is a must-win.''
</P>
<P>
   George rallied the Vikings from a 19-0 halftime deficit,
completing 10 of 12 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns. He
threw both scores in a six-minute span during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quick-change artists, and I'm not either,'' Vikings
coach Dennis Green said. ``But we clearly weren't playing at a
level that is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not well
</P>
<P>
   Vikings receiver Randy Moss, who finished with 10 catches for
125 yards and a touchdown, still was venting after the loss. After
running on three consecutive plays, Minnesota took a 23-22 lead on
Gary Anderson's 26-yard field goal with 1:40 left. It wasn't
enough, and Moss didn't like the conservative play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why stop?'' Moss said. ``I mean, if it's working.... It's not
my call. If I had a choice, I probably would have took the shot (at
the end zone). I mean, you got two All-Pros with a Jake Reed
healthy. Something was bound to happen good. The field goal put us
up, but I'm not big on the field goals. If you can get a touchdown,
get a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaying a decision
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Mike Shanahan said he won't decide until Wednesday
whether rookie Olandis Gary of Georgia or Derek Loville will start
at running back. Gary replaced the injured Loville in a 31-10
victory over Green Bay and rushed for 124 yards on 37 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we had Terrell (Davis), we shuffled (running
backs),'' Shanahan said. ``You don't want to overwork a back. You
want to keep them fresh. When you give a guy 37 carries, that's a
lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan also declined to name second-year pro Brian Griese his
starting quarterback. Griese, who was benched after the team's 0-4
start, threw for 363 yards and two scores against the Packers. He
led Denver to its second victory in a row after replacing Bubby
Brister, out with a strained oblique muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Washington cornerback Champ Bailey, a rookie from Georgia,
became the youngest player in NFL history to return an interception
for a touchdown and to pick off three passes in one game. . . . New
Orleans coach Mike Ditka probably will draw a hefty fine from the
NFL for making an obscene gesture toward fans in a 24-21 loss to
Tennessee.

KEY TEST IN INDONESIA'S TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ The world's fourth-most-populous nation chooses a new
president Wednesday, and for the first time since Indonesia gained
independence in 1945, no one knows in advance who the winner will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is struggling to form a post-autocratic government
against an extraordinary backdrop of wheeling and dealing, shifting
alliances, and a total lack of party discipline _ a
rough-and-tumble process that is messy and imperfect but
undoubtedly more democratic than anything that came before.
</P>
<P>
   The members of parliament who will make the choice could produce
a result that reflects the public will, or one that tilts
dangerously against it. And until it's over and the public decides
whether it likes the result, Indonesia's transition to democracy
hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The race, for once, is a real contest _ a choice between a
candidate closely linked to the past and a main rival with a potent
political legacy who still symbolizes a break from the recent
regime. Polls show that Megawati Sukarnoputri, a daughter of the
country's founding president, commands 10 times the popular backing
of the 5 percent who support incumbent President B.J. Habibie. But
the people won't get to cast their votes directly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 700-member People's Consultative Assembly _ chosen
four months ago in Indonesia's first democratic elections in 44
years _ will select the next head of state. And with just one day
to go, the scene is more chaotic than the 1968 Democratic
convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Parties are divided, alliances have collapsed, loyalty is for
sale, last-minute candidates have emerged, double-crossing is
rampant, the rules for selecting a winner are undecided, and by
Wednesday, anything could change.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the job will face several enormous tasks. Not only
must the new president reform and kick-start an economy that
collapsed under the weight of corruption and bad debt, he or she
also will have to address public demands to bring former President
Suharto and his associates to account and establish the rule of law
_ all while appeasing a military accustomed to wielding ultimate
authority. It is not at all clear that any of the declared
candidates is up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins is likely to find the presidency far less powerful
than it used to be. The new parliament, armed with the right to
elect the nation's leader, is showing an unprecedented
assertiveness that has come to a head in debate over Habibie's
so-called ``accountability speech'' last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The legally required address, a sort of state-of-the-union
report, was traditionally approved in a pro forma fashion by the
rubber-stamp parliament. But this time, lawmakers engaged in raging
debate all weekend, and could force Habibie to withdraw from the
race if they reject his report in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, every minute counts and everything is
changing,'' said Arief Budiman, professor of Indonesian studies at
the University of Melbourne. ``For now, we don't have a legitimate
government, because Habibie was never elected and everyone is
against him, more or less. . . . Habibie is part of the old regime
and a Suharto crony. He is only supported by people who want to
protect themselves from attack by the new civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the view of those who consider themselves reformers,
as a majority of the public apparently do, but their
representatives do not necessarily control the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the beleaguered Habibie gave Indonesians something they
had never seen before _ a president literally begging lawmakers and
the public in a televised speech Sunday to ``open your hearts and
forgive the weaknesses I have shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Armed Forces chief General Wiranto, whom Habibie had
named as his running mate in a bid to secure the military's 38
votes in the Assembly, declined to enter the race unless ``the
people really need it,'' saying he must focus on insuring the
safety of the nation. That effectively freed military
representatives to support anyone, and weakens Habibie's chances.
But the tenacious Habibie vowed to ``continue the struggle until
the last minute. I don't want to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Indonesians are demanding that Habibie go. About 1,200
stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals rallied at
the Jakarta stock exchange Monday in the first major white-collar
protest to his 17-month tenure. More than 10,000 students and urban
poor took to the streets last Thursday to demand an end to his
rule, and 40,000 extra security personnel have been drafted to
maintain order in the capital. Clashes with riot police and
soldiers have left at least 200 people injured.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, about 2,000 Megawati supporters blocked a main traffic
circle, waving banners and dancing in a free-for-all that was more
carnival than protest. There were fire-eaters, a parade of buses,
and a chimpanzee dressed as Habibie. The mood was peaceful, but the
chanted slogan was ominous: ``Megawati or revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Megawati won the most votes last June, taking 34
percent of the seats in the Assembly, by no means does she have the
race sewn up. Habibie's long-ruling Golkar party finished second
and controls 27 percent. In an alliance with conservative Muslim
parties, he could have the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Megawati's alliance with a reformist Muslim party
that finished third in June is in tatters after the ailing cleric
Abdurrahman Wahid declared himself a rival candidate. Smaller
Muslim parties have backed him, suggesting that religion could end
up a deciding factor in a country that has long divided religion
from state.
</P>
<P>
   There are also rampant allegations of vote-buying, with prices
quoted of between $250,000 and $500,000 for a single vote.
Independent political commentator Wimar Witoelar estimates that 30
to 50 percent of the 700 seats could be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even without bribery, party loyalty is a fiction. The
Megawati-Wahid coalition _ the largest in parliament _ has somehow
managed to lose the four key votes so far. In the race for
parliamentary speaker, the man it backed got only 58 votes, even
though the two parties control 185 seats.
</P>
<P>
   During a break at parliament, Kwik Kian Gie, deputy chairman of
Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, acknowledged
that a secret ballot for president, ironically, could work against
democratic ideals by hiding from the public the votes cast by their
elected delegates.
</P>
<P>
   He also downplayed suggestions that Megawati might make a deal
to support a member of the ruling Golkar party or a military choice
for vice president in exchange for their backing for president.
</P>
<P>
   A deal for the Golkar party to support Megawati's choice for the
full assembly speaker collapsed two hours before the vote when
Megawati failed to appear for a meeting with Golkar chairman Akbar
Tandjung.
</P>
<P>
   Such overconfidence, or some say political naivete, has hobbled
Megawati. Many observers say she became arrogant after winning the
most votes last June, acting as if she had secured the presidency
already, and refusing to make deals with other parties. Still, she
is the single most popular candidate, and if she loses, the
``rakyat,'' or masses, have promised to revolt. Some military
leaders have said privately they will back her to ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's own party, meanwhile, is divided over whether to drop
him at the eleventh hour. ``It's an untenable situation to continue
to push for his nomination if his speech is rejected,'' Marzuki
Darusman, chairman of the Golkar party faction in parliament, said
in an interview. ``We're not foreclosing any possibility. We might
end up working with the majority party . . . We are in a position
of bargaining now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Hobbled by years of losses and high debts, Nissan Motor
Co. surprised Japan and the auto industry Monday with details of a
radical overhaul plan that will make unexpectedly deep cuts at the
company, Japan's No. 3 automaker, and reverberate more broadly
through the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year plan, presented by Nissan's aggressive new
chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, three plants will be closed
and 21,000 jobs eliminated, most of them in Japan. Nissan will also
halve its supplier base and close 10 percent of its dealerships,
with the objective of returning to profitability in the next fiscal
year, starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that a lot of people at Nissan will feel like
orphans in this plan,'' Ghosn said at a briefing for reporters and
securities analysts, where the details were released. ``But we have
no choice, and the fact that we have no choice is the strength of
our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He was echoed by Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president. ``There
is no other alternative for us,'' Hanawa said. ``In order for us to
survive, we must implement this revival plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Nissan did not specify how many of the job losses would be in
the United States, where the company employs 12,000 people,
slightly more than half of them working at two manufacturing plants
in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But it was considered likely that Nissan would avoid layoffs at
those plants to help the company continue to block the United Auto
Workers' efforts to organize there. Instead, any cuts in Nissan's
American employment were expected to be in white-collar jobs at
regional sales offices.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the plan took securities analysts and executives
from other car companies by surprise, although its general
parameters were well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the numbers are concerned, it's even better than
expected,'' said Koji Endo, an analyst at Schroders Japan Ltd.,
speaking presumably of Nissan's aim of a return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the plan is like other corporate
reorganizations in Japan these days, but the magnitude of Nissan's
cuts makes it likely that its effects will be felt more strongly
than most others. About 500 parts and materials suppliers, for
instance, will lose Nissan's business, and the communities affected
by plant closings, still a rarity in Japan, could feel the most
acute impact.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan also plans to sell most of the shares it holds in
companies that have been linked through loans and
cross-shareholding, reducing its obligations to them as well as the
impact of stock-market fluctuations on its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few of those companies we consider as indispensable,''
Ghosn said. ``Over the next three years, a lot of these companies
will be out of the reach of Nissan.''
</P>
<P>
   How those businesses and communities respond to the challenge
created by Nissan Monday may in turn help shape the future of other
Japanese businesses. In the same way that closing three of Nissan's
plants is aimed at improving the productivity of its remaining
factories, a supplier forced to become more competitive might be
expected to become a healthier business.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn and Hanawa acknowledged that their plan is nothing until
it is executed. ``Ninety-five percent of the work remains,'' Hanawa
said. ``It is not going to be an easy process. It will be a very
difficult one.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be costly to Nissan. The company will take a 200
billion yen accounting charge, or about $1.9 billion, to cover the
costs of the restructuring in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn said the year's losses would be much larger than the 60
billion yen the company had forecast in May. In addition, Nissan's
liabilities will swell this year as changes in accounting rules
force it to include previously unrecognized pension and other
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The financial pain will not be limited to Nissan, either.
Renault SA, the French carmaker that purchased a 36.8 percent stake
in Nissan in March and installed Ghosn and several other foreign
executives to help lead a turnaround, said Monday that it would
take a $317 million accounting charge related to its Japanese
partner's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's costs in human terms and in corporate pride are
expected to be even greater. Traditional labor practices and tough
labor laws make layoffs as they are known in the United States
virtually impossible. ``The plan is roughly what the doctor
ordered,'' said Jay Woodworth, an independent automotive analyst.
``Now I hope Mr. Ghosn has all his ducks in a row, and in
particular has Nissan's labor union on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the rest of his speech was straightforward, Ghosn
finessed the part on job reductions, using the same cautious
language employed by Japanese executives forced to broach that
uncomfortable subject. He said Nissan, which has a global work
force of around 148,000, plans to prune its work force through
attrition, the increased use of part-time employees, spinoffs and
``early retirement,'' a euphemism in Japan for layoffs sweetened by
generous severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Endo of Schroders said he had spoken with the chairman of the
company's union not long ago, who told him the union would be
unhappy with any job cuts of more than 3,000. While it is almost
unheard of for Japanese unions to strike, their cooperation is
considered critical to the plan's success.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn and Hanawa played down such concerns Monday. ``Already in
the past we have had reallocations of personnel,'' Hanawa said.
``This won't be a first-time experience.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, the plan was blunt and direct. ``The key
facts and figures about Nissan point to a reality: Nissan is in bad
shape,'' Ghosn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese automaker's market share has dropped to 4.9 percent
worldwide from 6.6 percent in 1991. It has turned a profit in only
one of the last seven years, and its debts, excluding potential
liabilities related to leasing cars, will stand at roughly $12.6
billion at the end of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring plan presents a litany of cuts that go beyond
plants and workers: Purchasing costs, which now eat up 58 percent
of Nissan's net sales, will be cut 20 percent. Platforms, the
backbone of a vehicle, will be reduced to 14 from the current 24 by
2002, and to 12 by 2004, and Renault and Nissan will produce some
cars on the same platforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Ghosn made it clear that the plan was not only about cutting
back and casting away, but also about creating new,
more-exciting-looking vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product development will be at the heart of Nissan's
revival,'' he said. In one sign of Ghosn's commitment, the design
team in Japan is being removed from the engineering group and
placed under the oversight of Patrick Pelata, the French head of
product development, in hopes of insuring that Nissan's future
models will have greater consumer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's plan was announced after the stock market closed here.
Earlier, its shares tumbled 7.1 percent to 637 yen, or $6.06. Later
in New York, Nissan's American depository receipts closed unchanged
on NASDAQ at $12.875. Renault shares fell a little more than 2
percent in Paris to 49.9 euros, or $54.10.

NEW INDEPENDENT COUNSEL VOWS TO CONCLUDE INQUIRY OF PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert Ray, a career federal prosecutor, was sworn
in on Monday to replace the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and
he vowed to complete Starr's five-year-old, $47-million criminal
inquiry of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in a
``prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the steps of the federal courthouse here after
taking the oath of office, Ray promised that the independent
counsel's office would be ``thorough and fair.'' He also saluted
Starr for his ``extraordinary service to the country at great
personal sacrifice over the past five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray succeeds Starr, who resigned on Monday after overseeing an
investigation that began in August 1994 with the Clintons'
Whitewater real estate deal and eventually led to Clinton's
impeachment by the House of Representatives over his affair with
Monica Lewinsky. Starr's tenure was marked by years of harsh
attacks by White House aides and supporters of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, those aides and supporters immediately extended those
attacks to Ray, calling him an ideologue unfit to conduct an
impartial inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Ray was sworn in, White House aides had begun
calling reporters to contend that Ray has a conflict of interest
because he had been hired as a federal prosecutor in early 1989 by
Rudolph Giuliani who was then U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York. Giuliani, now the mayor of New York City, is
considered the likely Republican candidate for the Senate seate in
New York, a seat likely to be contested on the Democratic side by
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, a Clinton confidant who declared ``war'' on
Starr in early 1998, accused Ray of being beholden to Giuliani even
though Ray actually began working for the the U.S. Attorney's
office in Manhattan in February 1989, several weeks after Giuliani
left office there..
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray got his first big break as a prosecutor from Rudy
Giuliani,'' Carville said on Monday. ``We question everything he
does _ every motive he has, every decision he makes, every word he
writes, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray did not return telephone calls on Monday. He did not address
the allegations of the Clinton supporters after his swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a resignation letter submitted to a three-member panel
of federal appellate judges on Monday, responded to some of his
critics by defending his work and the professionalism of his
office's career prosecutors. But he acknowledged that his
resignation had been prompted by the ``intense politicization'' of
his tenure. He said it would be best for someone else to lead the
independent counsel's office, which is still pursuing two
investigative matters, and to write a final report.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reduce the unfortunate personalization of the process, in
particular in the wake of the inherently divisive impeachment
proceedings, the wiser course, I believe, is for another individual
to head the investigation,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray inherits two investigative matters at the independent
counsel's office, lawyers say. Prosecutors are trying to determine
whether White House aides played any role in what a former White
House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, has said was an effort to
persuade her to deny that the president made a sexual advance to
her in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are also investigating the dismissals of White
House travel office employees in the early months of the Clinton
presidency to determine whether anyone involved in the matter
misled investigators about who had ordered the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is a 39-year-old federal prosecutor who joined Starr's
office in April as senior litigation counsel. He worked on the
tax-evasion case against Webster L. Hubbell, a friend of the
Clintons and a former top Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Ray was instrumental in bringing the case to a
close. Hubbell pleaded guilty in June to a misdemeanor tax charge
and a felony charge of concealing legal work in a fradulent
Arkansas land deal.

RUNNING GAME WAS GROUND TO A HALT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ You will begin to hear whispers about
schemes now.
</P>
<P>
   It will begin Tuesday or Wednesday in the locker room of the New
England Patriots, as it has each year for the past half-dozen
around this time. To be honest, it began Sunday in some corners.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear about inconsistent play-calling and predictability.
You will hear that the coaches aren't persistent enough with the
run. You'll hear offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese needs to be
more stubborn because you can't get anything going calling only 14
running plays, as the Patriots did in Sunday's disappointing,
last-second loss to the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear many reasons to explain why the Patriots can't run
out for lunch, let alone run for a first down. Little of what you
hear whispered will involve the people most responsible for this
problem, because that is the age we live in.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear a lot of things said anonymously but little of
what you hear will center on the major reason the Patriots can't
run to the bathroom, let alone to the end zone. That reason has
nothing to do with schemes or coaches' decisions or stubborness or
emphasis or anything else but one thing. What it has to do with is
the five blocks of limestone standing at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party line around here always has been that we've got to
run the ball, so you always say it, but at a certain point if you
always say it and then lead the league in pass attempts every year,
you have people within your own team wondering what we are,''
quarterback Drew Bledsoe admitted late last week, only days before
his team blew a 14-point lead to the Dolphins in large part because
it had to play like a team that was 14 points behind most of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Patriots did that was not because Zampese and Pete
Carroll don't understand the need to run. It is not because they
can't be stubborn because Carroll can be as stubborn as anyone.
Just ask Sam Gash and Willie Clay. No, they did what they did
Sunday _ which was throw the ball 36 times and run it just 14
despite having a 14-0 lead only minutes into the game _ because
their offensive line couldn't move the ball on the ground if they
put it in a Chevy Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   This is a familiar complaint. It has surfaced about this time of
year for a decade. It has been the Patriot coaches who have borne
the brunt of the blame for that failing, and it's time that stopped
before it gets a chance to start again because here are the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bill Parcells first waddled into Foxborough and
transformed a loser into a winner, the Patriots have had two head
coaches, three offensive coordinators, three offensive line
coaches, and five running back coaches. They have had four
different backs serve as their leading rusher and will have a fifth
this season.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been an assortment of offensive linemen during
that time, since 1995 Bruce Armstrong, Todd Rucci, and Max Lane
have been starters most of the time. Since 1997, Zefross Moss has
been with them for nearly every snap. Until he left for free agency
in February, center Dave Wohlabaugh had been as well, although his
place now has been taken by rookie Damien Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Over that span the Patriots have averaged the following when
running the ball: 3.9 yards, 3.4 yards, 3.7 yards, 3.7 yards, and,
to date this year, 3.3 yards per carry. To quote the man who
started it all, Parcells himself, ``You are what you are,'' and
what these guys are are guys who can't run block.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts will tell you it's because most of them are too
lumbering to be able to pull or trap (with the exception of Rucci)
or because they lack the explosion to come off the ball and knock a
defense straight back. Others will tell you it's a mind-set they
don't possess because since Bledsoe arrived in 1993 so much of the
emphasis in New England has centered around protecting the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, there has been one constant in this gridlock
since 1995: the faces of the interior linemen, who have found it
impossible to open a hole in a pair of old athletic socks, let
alone between a pair of defensive tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, Moss, Rucci, and Lane. The last three seasons,
whether it was Curtis Martin running or Robert Edwards running or
Terry Allen running, whether it was Larry Kennan calling the plays
or Zampese calling the plays, whether it was Paul Boudreau coaching
the offensive line or Fred Hoaglin coaching the offensive line or
Dante Scarnecchia coaching the offensive line, most of the five
blocks of limestone have been the same people and they have
produced a running game that has netted an average of around 1,460
yards a season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 (1,468) and 1997 (1,464) and 1998 (1,480) and as
projected for 1999 (1,536), it has been the same, so we can
conclude one of two things. One is that every head coach, offensive
coordinator, running back coach, line coach, and running back the
Patriots have had is an idiot incapable of understanding how to run
forward, or two, the men blocking can't perform this skill anywhere
near as well as they can pass block.
</P>
<P>
   The whisperers will try to convince you this week or next that
the former is true. The whisperers will be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can't run because their line doesn't make holes
that stay open long enough for slender running backs like Allen to
fit through before they fill in like a collapsing sinkhole. It's as
simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are times when they are outmanned at the hole by
a defense that either guesses right or reads their formation.
Certainly there are times the bad guys make a play, as they are
paid to do, and life goes on. But you average about 3.4 yards a
carry long enough with the same blockers and it leads to an
inexorable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers prove it and the faces prove it, which is why, when
Bledsoe was asked after Sunday's game, ``Do you feel like you're
getting into more of a throw-first-run-later approach?'' he
replied, ``What, that's different? We're a passing football team.
That's what we are. We do need to establish the run more than we
have but when, or if, that's going to happen I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes he does.
</P>
<P>
   So do Zampese and Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   So do the Five Blocks of Limestone.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not any different than it was in 1997 or 1998. Not any
different than in 1993 or 1994 or 1995 or 1996 either.
</P>
<P>
   So the best thing they could do is admit it, throw 65 times a
game, and hope that teams become so petrified of that that one of
these Sundays they line up not with eight men in the box but with
eight men in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots might not be able to run then either but at least
it would be a fair fight.

 &HT;    Proposal could backfire if `breaks' aren't significant
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The popular political strategy of using tax breaks
to help reduce the number of 44.3 million Americans without health
insurance could backfire if the breaks are not significant,
according to a National Coalition on Health Care report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewin Group analyzed proposals in Congress and on the
presidential campaign trail, which are based on broadening the tax
exclusions that currently apply to money that employers spend on
employees' health insurance. It found no plan that would increase
the number of insured Americans by as much as 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal that has passed both houses of Congress would give
a 100 percent tax deduction on health-insurance costs for people
without access to employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   It would most help people who are paying for their own insurance
or who have incomes above $50,000, the report said. The coalition
said it would induce only 3.9 million currently uninsured people to
buy coverage, only about 200,000 of whom have annual incomes below
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax credits alone cannot solve the problem of the uninsured,
nor are they likely to contain the skyrocketing costs of health
care,'' said Dr. Henry E. Simmons, the coalition's president. ``If
Congress enacts tax credits absent other changes, we could end up
with even more people uninsured because of higher health-care
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's recommendation would require employers to
convert their health-insurance expenditures to taxed wages, then
apply tax credits to individuals' purchases of their own coverage,
which would have a mandatory minimum benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net federal cost of such a plan, first proposed in the
early 1990s by the conservative Heritage Foundation ... would be
$55.3 billion (next year),'' the coalition said of the
paradoxically conservative approach to universal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidents Ford, Carter and Bush are honorary co-chairmen
of the coalition, which comprises nearly 100 small businesses,
labor unions and consumer, physician, hospital and religious
groups.

 McCAIN OUTMANEUVERED IN VOTE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHANGE  
(See also MCCAIN-MOLINARI, moved in `p' category) 
(th) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain tried to win a test vote on his
legislation to ban the large, unlimited donations to political
parties that have been proliferating over the past decade, but he
was outmaneuvered on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a confounding day in the Senate, McCain, the Arizona
Republican who is the lead sponsor of legislation to overhaul the
campaign finance system, made an unusual parliamentary proposal to
kill an amendment containing his own proposal to ban the donations,
known as soft money. He then urged his supporters to vote against
him as a way to send a signal that they support the soft money ban
and want it to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   McCain characterized the strange maneuver as a way to
demonstrate how many senators support the effort to rein in the
influence of money on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got at most 48 hours left on this legislation,'' he
said. ``We have not made a lot of progress. It's time we did, and I
believe that having the Senate on record on soft money is a very
defining vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But his effort to get senators on record was thwarted when not
just his supporters but also his opponents voted to keep the ban on
soft money alive, by a 92-1 vote. That made the vote meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw the vote,'' complained Sen. Russell Feingold, the
Wisconsin Democrat who is McCain's co-sponsor. The opponents knew
they would have plenty of other opportunities to kill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The gamesmanship was a sign of how slim the prospects are for
the Senate to follow the lead of the House and pass a bill this
year to overhaul the campaign finance law. The campaign finance
debate has simply degenerated into a procedural battle. Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, is expected to pull the
legislation off the floor soon, perhaps as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Senate mustered a majority for comprehensive
legislation to overhaul the campaign finance law, but fell eight
votes short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster against the
bill. Although the House passed the comprehensive legislation in
September, McCain and Feingold scaled back their bill this year to
focus almost entirely on a ban on soft money.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped provisions that would have tightly regulated the
issue-advocacy commercials that are often thinly masked
advertisements attacking or supporting candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said that by stripping down the bill they hoped to
win more supporters and then, through an amendment process on the
floor, build a bill that could gain the 60 votes needed to break a
filibuster.

 &HT;    Delta buys Comair for $1.8 billioni
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Delta Air Lines Inc. will buy Cincinnati-based
Comair Holdings Inc. in a $1.8 billion deal that unites the main
major and regional airlines serving Dayton, the companies announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta will acquire Comair for $23.50 per common
share and operate the airline as a separate subsidiary, with its
headquarters remaining at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky
International Airport. Delta already owned about 22 percent of
Comair's shares.
</P>
<P>
   No changes in Comair's services were announced. Dayton airport
spokesman John Sears said the acquisition is not expected to affect
Delta's or Comair's services.
</P>
<P>
   The change will not affect fares because they are mainly
influenced by market conditions, Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of both airlines unanimously approved the deal,
according to separate but nearly identical announcements by the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1977, Comair developed close ties with Delta in 1984
with a code-share marketing agreement through which Comair flies
customers from cities in the Midwest and Florida through both
Comair's and Delta's hubs in Cincinnati and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Leo F. Mullin, Delta president and chief executive, called
Comair ``a very successful regional airline with strong and
respected leadership and an outstanding record of financial and
operational performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the acquisition ``continues Delta's strategy to
strengthen its nationwide Delta Connection carrier network with an
emphasis on introducing regional jets.''
</P>
<P>
   Comair kicked off the regional jet movement 1993 as the first
airline to fly the 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet. Regional jets of
various makes and sizes are rapidly replacing turboprops throughout
the regional airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, a Delta subsidiary will make a
tender offer no later than Friday to purchase all outstanding
shares of common stock of Comair Holdings for $23.50 per share in
cash. Comair Holdings has outstanding 95.5 million shares of common
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Following the completion of the tender offer, which is subject
to customary conditions, the Delta subsidiary will merge into
Comair Holdings. When the merger becomes effective, each
outstanding share of Comair Holdings will be converted into the
right to receive $23.50 in cash. At that time, Comair Holdings and
Comair will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Delta reported third-quarter net income of $290
million, or $1.96 per diluted share, excluding gains from the sale
of investments and non-recurring charges. Net income was $327
million and $2.08 per share in the same period last year. Delta
said its operations were hurt by Hurricane Floyd, which forced
Delta to cancel more than 1,100 flights and reduced revenue by $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   Including gains from the sale of investments and non-recurring
charges, net income was $352 million and diluted earnings per share
were $2.38 for the quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   That Calvin Klein Inc. is on the block should come as no
surprise. Many other fashion houses have been tempted by the
incredible prices that brand-name companies are receiving as they
are snapped up in a wave of luxury fever.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for example, the much-pursued Fendi finally sold
a majority stake in the business to a pair of suitors, the French
conglomerate LVMH-Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton and the Italian
leather goods maker Prada SpA, at a price that valued the total
company near $1 billion. For Fendi, whose steamy reputation rests
mostly on the wild popularity of a single style of handbag and
whose net income last year (after the partners pulled their draw)
was estimated at well under $20 million, that was some deal.
</P>
<P>
   But if the designer Calvin Klein is counting on the same
impressive multiples that are going to his European cousins,
analysts suggest he may be disappointed. Barnard Arnault, LVMH's
chairman, has expressed interest in Calvin Klein, but he is cool in
his enthusiasm at best. The companies that today's high-end
acquirers have been going after are those with sterling reputations
in one arena _ shoes or jewelry, for example. Their strategy for
increasing sales is to attach that name to ancillary products like
sunglasses and porcelin _ a formula that has not always been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   American companies have a reputation for already being too loose
with their labels.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, for example, is most famous for transforming
cotton underwear into a daring personal style statement, but
through licenses the name is already on everything from sheets to
perfume to blues jeans; not a lot of new categories remain
available for bringing in new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the business of quality, creativity and legitimacy;
maybe for U.S. brands, this is the aspect that is still missing,''
said Arnault about the Europeans' discomfort with the large
American labels. ``You have fantastic brands, but they are the
creation of the last 20 years. American brands, they are the
fastest to build. They gain worldwide recognition in a few years,
but maybe for that reason they are more fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Arnault and his partners at Prada, the acquirers in the
luxury game include Gucci Group of Italy, backed by
Pinault-Printempts Redoute; Compagnie Financiere Richemont, the
owner of Cartier, Texas Pacific Group of Dallas, which recently
bought the Swiss shoe retailer Bally, and the Italian giant HdP,
which recently bought a stake in Valentino, an Italian fashion
house. Everyone seems to be largely shunning the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   American designers sense a bit of snobbism. Bill Blass made it
known more than a year ago that he was looking to sell his company,
one of the best-known names in the high-end fashion market in the
United States, but he still does not have a deal (he says one is
coming soon, however). Will there be a bid from LVMH or another
European Luxury group?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had an expression of interest from them, and it's
surprising, in my opinion.'' Unfortunately for would-be luxury
emperors, there are not many Fendi's left. ``It is not a frequent
phenomenon to have a brand that is so hot and is still small,''
Arnault acknowledged. And after the latest raft of deals, most of
the brands left that meet the snob test _ European, long lived,
well known but small _ are majority controlled by families who say
they have no intention of selling. Hermes International SA, the
maker of elaborately pattered silk scarves and ties, and Salvatore
Ferragamo, known for its comfortable dowdy pumps, are quietly on
many investors' wish lists, and both say they are not interested.
Nor is the Italian fashion retailer Stefanel, whose share price
jumped 14 percent one day earlier this month on rumors that LVMH
was preparing a bid. (Giuseppe Stefanel head of the family that
controls Stefanel, called the reports completely unfounded.)
</P>
<P>
   In the chase to make so few tightly held firms consider selling
out, investors are finding themselves in expensive contortions.
According to an executive involved in the Fendi sale, Gucci, which
had been the main competition of LVMH and Prada, quit bidding at
$700 million and walked away from the table. Yet for a month
afterward, the five Fendi sisters, who inherited ownership of the
company, were able to keep the talks going, ultimately convincing
LVMH and Prada executives to increase the valuation on the company
by $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnership outbid itself four times,'' said the source.
</P>
<P>
   How can big companies expect to make back their money after
paying such high multiples?
</P>
<P>
   Gucci _ itself the target of an unsuccessful bid by LVMH _
provides an example of how a small business with a great name can
be transformed into a powerhouse. Five years ago the company, then
known for leather bags and snaffle-bit loafers and not much else,
was almost bankrupt on $200 million in annual sales. After a
takeover by new management and the sizzling designer Tom Ford,
Gucci re-established itself as a style maker. It increased sales to
$1 billion, largely by expanding the range of merchandise to
include ready-to-wear fashions and even perfumes. It also expanded
sales globally, by greatly increasing the company's retail presence
in the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula, of course, is far easier to describe than to
carry out. There are few similar success stories and many
disappointments. William Price, a founding partner of Texas Pacific
Group, put a bid in on Fendi and is still on the prowl _
acknowledges that such acquisitions do not always bloom as planned.
``I don't think I could cite one that has been an unmitigated
success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein seems aware of the possible pitfalls of being
acquired and is exploring many options, including an alliance. But
a high price could be too tempting to turn down. (Klein declined to
comment.) Direct sales for Calvin Klein Inc. were $160 million last
year, which, by the Fendi valuation of 7.6 times direct sales of
$130 million, would make the American design house worth well over
$1 billion. But since revenues from total products under the Calvin
Klein label equaled about $2.5 billion, the brand may be too
exploited to earn such outstanding mutiples.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the enthusiasm for conglomeration lower than at many
of the brands that have been acquired by LVMH, which has been at
this strategy longer than anyone else in the luxury goods world.
These units feel that LVMH is not as committed financially to
expanding their range and raising their profile as they had hoped.
`` Arnault is wonderful, but his pleasure and focus in life is
battling and fighting,'' said Christian Lacroix, a designer in the
LVMH stable for the last a decade. ``He loves much more the fight
than making or promoting a label once he has conquered it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duffy, president of Marc Jacobs, a design house that LVMH
bought four years ago, is similarly disappointed with LVMH's
commitment to invest growth money into the brand once it bought a
stake. Instead of acquiring new businesses, he said, ``It's my wish
that LVMH would invest the money here and grow this label.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fendi deal is full of quirks that may make it even more
difficult to manage than most would be. For example, although LVMH
and Prada together will own 51 percent of Fendi, it is unclear
which has primacy, and that could eventually lead to internal
fueding. Fendi, Vuitton and Prada are direct competitors on leather
goods; what happens if Fendi's growth comes at the expense of the
owners' own businesses?
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of whether after paying so much money
for Fendi, Prada will have enough money left over to help Fendi
along as promised. Prada, with sales under $800 million, had a drop
in net profit of nearly 27 percent last year as overhead ballooned.
Debt also jumped as the company borrowed heavily to finance the
recent investments in Church &AMP; Co., Helmut Lang and Jil Sanders.
(Though LVMH has also been on a buying spree, it has remained very
profitable.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Fendis there remains the issue of who will run the
company. For now the five Fendi sisters and their family are firmly
ensconced at the helm, but industry experts like Allen J. Ellinger,
a partner in MMG, a New York fashion management consulting firm,
think that real money in family businesses comes only when
``somebody starts to put structure into a company, and deal with
the margins.'' That is' code for replacing the family with a
professional cadre of mangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You retain management only until something goes wrong,'' said
Massimo Ferragamo, chief executive of Ferragamo USA. ``It is why we
have no interest in selling.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unhappy that managed care has cut into psychologists' income and
autonomy, the New York State Psychological Association and its
3,200 members agreed this month to join the American Federation of
Teachers _ the first time a group of American psychologists has
affiliated with a union.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the psychologists' association, mostly therapists
with doctoral degrees in psychology, said they were affiliating
with the AFT largely because the powerful teachers' union would
have more clout in lobbying for legislation, in Albany and in
Washington, that would force managed care organizations to provide
better mental health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologists' decision to affiliate with the teachers'
federation is unusual because the union will not be able to bargain
collectively for the psychologists: Since 80 percent of them do
therapy in private practice, they are considered independent
contractors, rather than employees. Most members are in private
practice, but the association includes dozens of salaried
psychologists at state and city mental hospitals and dozens of
school psychologists who have doctorates. The association generally
does not include therapists with other degrees, like master's
degrees in social work or degrees from psychoanalytic institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the American Psychological Association said
psychologists in dozens of other states were studying the New York
agreement to see whether it should serve as a model for them.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological association and the teachers' union share many
legislative interests in Albany and in Washington, like a strong
patients' bill of rights or so-called ``parity'' bills that would
require HMO reimbursements for mental health treatment to be on a
par with reimbursement for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said the agreement calls for an innovative, experimental
arrangement in which the teachers' union will lobby for the
psychologists, offer them a range of benefits and explore other
ways to assist them. The AFT will benefit by obtaining a larger
membership and getting guidance and support from the psychologists
on teacher' issues.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a major departure for organized labor, not only
because psychologists are not traditional employees, but because
they have far different concerns _ like gaining higher HMO
reimbursements _ than most union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professional sector is the fastest growing sector of jobs,
and we are trying to provide a leadership role in developing
programs to represent these people,'' Ms. Feldman said. ``I think
we'll see that labor can adapt and change to new forms of
representing people. We're showing people we can represent them in
very different ways as we see the nature of work changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychologists' move comes after thousands of medical doctors
have joined unions in recent years, with the psychologists, like
the doctors, frustrated that managed care companies have cut
reimbursements and imposed restrictions on treatment and on
frequency of patient visits.
</P>
<P>
   A typical psychologist in New York City might charge a patient
$100 per session. But when the psychologist belongs to an HMO, the
reimbursement is often about $70, and the therapist cannot ask the
patient to make up the difference. And some HMOs limit the number
of visits covered. If a patient wishes to go beyond a maximum of
five sessions, for example, the HMO must approve.

   The New York psychologists had debated joining the teachers'
union for three years, and association officials said that momentum
grew as psychologists grew increasingly frustrated with aspects of
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some members who thought that as professionals, we
shouldn't be part of a union,'' said Marianne Jackson, president of
the New York State Psychological Association. ``But I believe that
with managed care, we are being deprofessionalized and we have to
face that fact. We are being made into people just paid to do
things. We don't have control over our work the way we should
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Several psychologists said they favored joining up with the
teachers so the union could use its lobbying might to make it
harder for other mental health practitioners with less advanced
degrees, like art therapists and marriage and family counselors, to
take away their patients. The psychologists' association has
lobbied hard in Albany, but with little success, for legislation
that would define the scope of practice for doctoral-level
psychologists as well as other mental health practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put energy and resources into our lobbying, but we
could never hope to have the operation that the teachers' union
has,'' said June Feder, a psychologist in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists said they wanted more lobbying power because
they feared that the New York State Psychiatric Association might
seek to change the proposed legislation in a way that would give
psychiatrists much of the business now done by psychologists. But
Seth Stein, executive director of the 5,000-member psychiatric
association, denied that the psychiatrists were in any way
promoting legislation that would take patients away from
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brenner, chief executive of the psychological association,
said her group was now working with the psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists and psychologists both treat the mentally ill,
although they often use different techniques. While all of them
provide therapy, psychiatrists are medical doctors with the power
to prescribe drugs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the affiliation agreement, which takes effect on Jan. 1,
the psychologists will be associate members of the 1 million-member
teachers' federation, rather than full members. They will be
offered many union benefits and will be counted as members of the
union, but they will not have to pay individual union dues.
Instead, the psychologists' association will pay an affiliation fee
of $46,000 in the first year, with the fee climbing in subsequent
years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the affiliation with the teachers' union would
provide several advantages other than the formidable lobbying clout
of its New York affiliate, New York State United Teachers, which
has more than 400,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologists will be offered numerous union fringe
benefits, including the teachers' health plan, disability
insurance, life insurance and legal services plans.
</P>
<P>
   Since only one-third of the 10,000 eligible psychologists in New
York are in the state psychological association, the association is
looking to the teachers' union to use its size, energy and
expertise to recruit more members to the association.
</P>
<P>
   This would increase dues payments to the association while also
increasing its power. And as the union attracts more psychologists
to the association, the association's affiliation payments to the
union would rise proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russ Newman, executive director of professional practice for the
American Psychological Association, which has 159,000 members, said
many state psychological groups would study the New York move to
see how much it benefits New York's psychologists and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned nowadays about the one-sided bargaining
power that has been developed in the market place with insurance
and managed-care companies having so much leverage that consumers
and health-care professionals are left out in the cold,'' he said.
``We think it is important to re-establish better balance and
leverage for consumers and health-care professionals. It will be
interesting to see whether this turns out to provide some help for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Berger, director of the Metropolitan Center for Mental
Health on West 97th Street in Manhattan, said he originally opposed
affiliating with the teachers because he feared it would cost the
psychologists a lot of money. But he said he was reassured that the
association has negotiated an affiliation fee that was not
extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologists as a group are looking for some magical fix for
the problems of managed care,'' he said. ``I don't see the union as
being a magical fix.''

 &HT;    Tobacco settlement plan may shrink
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft's plan for Ohio to spend $10.1
billion during 26 years from the national tobacco settlement could
shrink to an eight-year plan to spend about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up in the air,'' said state Sen. Roy L. Ray, chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's committee meets today and could vote to send a tobacco
spending plan to the full Senate. A substitute bill with the
eight-year plan was being circulated among senators Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While $10.1 billion is the amount Ohio is scheduled to get as a
result of the settlement between the states and the major tobacco
companies, some Senate Finance Committee members are worried about
making projections that go through the year 2025, said Ray,
R-Akron.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Hottinger, R-Newark, a committee member, is
among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``His main concern is how do we know where we're going to be in
25 years,'' said Susan Wittstock, Hottinger's legislative
assistant. ``Priorities change. Different needs arise. How do we
know this plan is going to be the best for the state?''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year, $3 billion plan would not decrease the amount of
money the state is scheduled to receive, but would leave it up to
future legislatures and governors to plan for spending the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Taft continues to support the 26-year plan recommended by the
task force he set up, said Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year plan calls for putting nearly half the tobacco money
_ $4.5 billion _ in a trust fund to build and repair primary and
secondary school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year schedule for spending the tobacco money would
upset a related Taft proposal, to spend $10.2 billion in state
money during 12 years for school buildings. The governor has
proposed that $2.4 billion of the tobacco money be used for school
buildings during those 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Taft has used his school-repair plan as an example of his
commitment to education in a brief he filed with the Ohio Supreme
Court in the school funding case. Taft is trying to get the high
court to reverse a lower court decision that the school funding
system is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   While backing Taft's plan, Ray said it's important to note that
``as a practical matter'' no legislature is committed to a spending
plan that goes beyond the two-year term in which members serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appropriate every two years. That's the operative set of
circumstances. . . . We could have a 50-year plan, a 200-year plan.
It doesn't mean a hill of beans until the legislature in control
appropriates,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the school money, the tobacco task force
recommended spending the tobacco money on smoking cessation and
prevention, other health-related programs, law enforcement
technology and to help tobacco farmers and communities where
tobacco has been an important part of the economy.

California and Florida citrus growers, and poultry and meat
producers from around the country were delighted in April when
China, as a goodwill gesture to the United States, agreed to end

the deal at a joint news conference, not one of the agricultural

MOLINARI JUMPS OFF BUSH BANDWAGON, JOINS McCAIN CAMPAIGN 
(EDS: Adds details from new Bush book) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key early backer of Texas Gov. George W. Bush
defected to a rival presidential campaign on Monday, offering
another reminder that the race for the Republican nomination is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Rep. Guy Molinari, a name with considerable
clout in delegate-rich New York GOP circles, switched his
allegiance to Sen. John McCain of Arizona in the latest bump in a
series for what had been the smooth-running Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush remains the clear front-runner in the GOP contest,
his efforts to set himself apart from the pack have alienated some
important factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush angered Republican lawmakers by accusing them of
trying to balance the federal budget ``on the backs of the poor.''
Then he seemed to go after social conservatives by saying that his
party sometimes seems obsessed with ``an image of America slouching
toward Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush's once-surging poll numbers, while still
impressive, have begun to level off.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, I wonder if George W. hasn't `Forrest Gumped'
his way into this,'' said New York pollster John Zogby, referring
to the movie character with an uncanny knack for turning up at the
right place at the right time. ``We're one inch from a real race.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one suggests that Bush is in any immediate danger of
losing his front-runner status, there are enough uncertainties to
give his rivals hope. He is scheduled to participate in the first
of a series of presidential debates Dec. 2, giving the other
candidates a chance to exploit any gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers are also bracing for a bruising ad campaign by
rival Steve Forbes, the only candidate who can match Bush's
campaign bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the concern in Bush's camp, the candidate's media
experts recently tested possible Forbes attack ads, as well as
Bush's likely response, on focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is McCain, who has emerged as Bush's closest rival in
some recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, a leader in the effort to coax Bush into the race,
said he changed his mind after comparing the two candidates. The
former Republican congressman currently serves as Staten Island
borough president, a job that gives him clout in a heavily
Republican section of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, who once called Bush ``the best candidate the
Republican Party can put forward,'' said he was stunned when Bush
criticized congressional Republicans. Molinari had lobbied
lawmakers to support the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded to Molinari's defection with a terse
statement inviting him to reboard the Bush bandwagon ``when Gov.
Bush becomes the Republican presidential nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Bush aides said that new allegations about an
arrest for cocaine possession are ``completely false and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges, aired by anonymous sources, are contained in a new
biography, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and The Making of an
American President,'' by former Texas freelance journalist J.H.
Hatfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been arrested for a drug possession offense,'' said
Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The biography, citing unnamed sources, says that Bush was
arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 and further alleges that
former President Bush arranged with a friendly judge to have the
record expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Becker, a spokeswoman for President Bush, said, ``It
absolutely did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Carol Vance, Harris County district attorney from
1966 to 1979, pointed out what he described as factual
inconsistencies in Hatfield's account _ including the contention
that the judge in question was ``a fellow Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1972, there were no Republican district judges handling
criminal cases in Harris County,'' Vance said in a written
statement. He also said the law providing for expungement of
criminal records was not passed by the Texas Legislature until
1977.

DELL SHARES TUMBLE ON WARNING ABOUT RISING CHIP PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Dell Computer Corp. tumbled in after-hours
trading Monday after the company warned that rising memory chip
prices would hurt its third quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Dell made the announcement after the market closed. Dell shares
had closed at $41.3125, down $1.50 in Nasdaq trading, but dropped
another $3.5625, to $37.75 in after-hours trading. Dell earnings
for the third-quarter, which ends this month, will be released on
November 11.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dell put a positive spin on the warning, emphasizing
the temporary nature of the DRAM shortage and reiterating the
company's positive outlook, analysts said the stock could easily
drag the whole technology sector down on Tuesday. Because the
market is sensitive to bad news right now, and Dell is considered a
bellwether, the reaction is likely to be disproportionate to the
news, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAM,
have risen sharply in the past few weeks since the earthquake in
Taiwan disrupted production there. Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple
Computer Inc., among others, had already said that the quake would
have an impact on product availability or on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Michael Dell, Dell's chairman and chief executive,
said the company would not be affected by the quake, and analysts
had said the company's size and long-term contracts might buffer it
from the impact. But Wednesday, the company said that the latest
memory prices had increased by as much as 25 percent, more than
they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are managing the memory situation carefully and are working
to offset the cost increases with efficiencies in other parts of
our business,'' Thomas J. Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer,
said in a statement. ``We are also taking actions to reduce overall
memory consumption, including advertising system configurations
with lower amounts of base memory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said he estimated
that increased memory prices might trim Dell's earnings for the
quarter by 2 cents a share, or about 10 percent. Analysts had
expected the company to earn 20 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also the risk of some revenue getting deferred,
because as they point out, this is a temporary situation,'' he
said. ``A rational buyer wants lots of DRAM, so, do you pay up now,
to get all the memory you need, or just wait a couple of months,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The memory chip situation is one instance in which Dell's much
vaunted business model may have worked against it. Dell builds each
computer to order and maintains minimal component inventories, so
it benefits during periods of rapid price declines for chips and
other key parts, as the industry has experienced for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   With a sudden steep price increase, such as the PC industry is
experiencing now, Dell has greater exposure than do vendors that
maintain larger inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said the company considers the effects of the
memory-cost issue to be a short-term matter, but that it will hurt
third-quarter operating margins. He pointed out that for the first
half of this year, Dell's sales grew by more than 40 percent,
double the industry rate. He said that current customer demand is
consistent with the growth pattern of the year's first half, and
reiterated that Dell's overall business and prospects for robust
growth remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``in fairness, DRAM pricing will come down again, and they are,
in that context, probably truthful in saying their long-term
outlook has not been altered,'' Kunstler said. ``But the market is
looking for reasons to go down, and Dell just gave it a new one.''

   Who is Melvin Mora?
</P>
<P>
   Mora is the Met who made his way out to left field on Saturday
with the uncomfortable mission of having to tell Rickey Henderson
that he had to come out of the game. This was the top of the eighth
inning in Game 4 of the National League playoffs last Saturday
night, a full house at Shea Stadium, another tight game. Usually
the switch _ Mora was replacing Henderson for defensive purposes _
would have been made between innings, in the privacy of the Mets
dugout. But Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager, said he had a mental
lapse and forgot. So he sent the quiet, mild-mannered Mora to break
the news.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, thanks to Valentine, was well schooled in this kind of
humiliation. A similar experience happened to him last April, at
the end of a successful spring training. Mora thought he had made
the Mets' 25 player roster. He had outperformed his nearest
competitor _ hitting, fielding and exhibiting the proper attitude.
Finally after seven years in the minors, Mora was going North to
open the '99 season as a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   His bags were already on the bus as the team prepared to head to
Texas for the last exhibition game. That's when Mora got the news:
He had not made the roster and would be demoted. The Mets _ i.e.,
Bobby Valentine _ forgot to tell him, just as he'd forgot to tell
Henderson in a timely fashion. Mora's bags had to be retrieved off
the truck headed to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Mora was crushed. When someone asked him to describe his
emotions, Mora said ``I feel like I want to go to a bridge and jump
off.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday, he broke the news to Henderson and watched him
leave the field angry, embarrassed. Mora understood. But he also
remembered how he'd kept his own spirits up when he was demoted in
the spring. ``I wasn't angry, I was sad,'' he said. ``But I told
myself I don't make decisions; I have to accept whatever they say
and continue to work. Now I have the opportunity to show everyone
that I can play, because if you can play in the playoffs, you can
play in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the spring training disappointment, Mora is the
leader of an undercard of unsung Mets players who have propelled
the team from 0-3 series deficit to an unlikely Game 6 against
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for respect began on Oct. 3, in the last game of the
regular season, when Mora, a rookie with just five hits to his name
this season, reached on a one-out single in the ninth inning. When
fellow Venezuelan Edgardo Alfonzo singled to right, Mora sped
around second and dived headfirst into third as the crowd went
wild. Moments later he raced home with the winning run on a wild
pitch. The Mets defeated Pittsburgh and earned the right to play
Cincinnati for the wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Mora made his third start of the season as part of
Valentine's lineup shakeup. He kept a close game close when he
threw a perfect strike to Mike Piazza to nail Bret Boone at the
plate. On Saturday, after replacing Henderson, Mora executed a
daring baseball play when he initiated a double steal with Roger
Cedeno on second, Mora on first and John Rocker on the mound. Mora
remembered being on third base in Atlanta and faking like he was
straying home, and saw how nervous it made Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Roger we have to put pressure on this guy,'' Mora
recalled. ``With a man at second base he's going to throw a lot of
pitches in the dirt; a man on third base is a different story _ he
has to throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   They executed the double steal, and then a John Olerud smash
grazed off Ozzie Guillen's glove and allowed both runners to score.
In a critical juncture of the game on Sunday, Mora may have saved
the game for the Mets when, in a heavy drizzle, he cut off a
hard-hit ball before it reached the right field wall, then fired
the wet ball to Alfonzo, who fired to Mike Piazza, who applied the
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Melvin Mora? Mora is the face of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Aqua Negar, Venezuela, Mora came out of the Houston
Astros' academy in Valencia, but was overshadowed by other players
regarded as better major league prospects. Houston regarded Mora as
little more than a utility player and kept him on one of their
minor league clubs for six years. When the Astros did not invite
him to major league camp in 1997 Mora thought about quitting
baseball. Instead of doing that or going back to Triple A, Mora
went to the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan, though
he left a month and a half later.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, Mora contacted Edgar Alfonzo,
Edgardo's brother, a coach with the Mets' Class A affiliate in Port
St. Lucie. Alfonzo put Mora in contact with Jim Duquette, the Mets
assistant general manager of player personnel. Duquette offered
Mora a utility role with the Mets A team in St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what seems like a lifetime later, he's headed for Game 6
in Atlanta. Even as he does, he embodies for some the indomitable
spirit of the minor leagues. Bobby Floyd, the minor league field
coordinator, saw Mora when he returned from Taiwan and again when
he returned to AAA after failing to make the 25-plater roster this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melvin never quit,'' Floyd said Monday from Melbourne, Fla.
``It's like a fighter that keeps getting knocked down; he gets back
up and you just he will never let go until everybody _ everybody _
says `no we don't want you.' It's that wanting to go out there and
do it one more time, giving it all you've got and being able to say
to yourself when its all over and done that you gave it every shot
you could.''

REACTION BY THE FANS WAS UTTERLY INDEFENSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least once a year I deliver my personal Sermon on the Mount
to those unfortunate individuals who do not have the great benefit
of organized sport in their lives. I condescendingly explain to
them that no matter how happy they think they are, or how fulfilled
they believe their lives to be, unless they know what it is like to
be filled with that delicious rush that only sport can bring, they
are missing something otherwise irreplaceable during their
existence on this earth.
</P>
<P>
   I firmly believe that. But along with the good things sport
brings into our lives, there is an undeniable dark side, which was
completely in evidence at Fenway Park Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to care. Appreciating sport for its own sake is
one thing, but investing deep emotion in the outcome of a
competition raises it all to a different level. At some point or
another, a true fan cares, and cares deeply, who wins or loses.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is a limit. These are all games, and no matter
how steeped in history and tradition they are, and no matter how
much better a feeling it would be if your team wins rather than
loses, when it is all said and done, they remain games.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot rationalize for one millisecond the behavior of that
demented minority who took it upon themselves to disrupt Sunday
night's game by throwing things onto the field in the ninth inning
of the (deserved) Yankee victory over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   On the Atrocity Scale of 1 to 10, it wasn't much more than a 2,
but it was bad enough that plate umpire Al Clark justifiably pulled
everyone off the field until order could be restored. Who cares
whether or not any potentially harmful objects really did land on
the field? (And at least one eyewitness of my acquaintance said a
hard something-or-other came whizzing by his ear.) They could have.
Ask Chris Chambliss and Mickey Rivers about the darts and bolts
thrown in their direction in this very park 25 years ago. Was Clark
supposed to wait until a bottle or battery or who-knows-what
actually struck Tim Tschida or Tino Martinez before acting?
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, there is a disturbing history here, and not just here,
but north of the border, as well. When sports passions are
inflamed, whether by officiating calls or noncalls, or by alleged
injustices of some sort, all bets are off. Thus we give you NFL
field judge Armen Terzian being skulled by a flying bottle in
Minneapolis during a 1975 playoff game; a massive riot in Montreal
when Maurice Richard was suspended by NHL commissioner Clarence
Campbell in 1955 for almost decapitating Boston's Hal Laycoe; and
Chargers equipment man Sid Brooks seriously injured by a Giants
Stadium iceball in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And we're like a tot on training wheels behaviorally in this
country compared with the goings-on in the international arena. I
mean, we're not the ones with moats surrounding our soccer pitches,
are we? And ask any American who has ever played basketball there
about crowd behavior in such places as Italy and Greece, where
heating coins with a lighter and flinging them at both opposing
players and referees is often the evening's highlight.
</P>
<P>
   I say that nothing justifies any of this behavior, but not
everyone agrees. A woman called Monday afternoon to say she was
``outraged'' that I had criticized in print the Sunday night fan
behavior. ``If I were there,'' she said, ``I'd have thrown
something, too.''
</P>
<P>
   I was astounded. She was polite and she certainly sounded
cultured. What would compel her not only to harbor that
anti-intellectual desire but also to condemn me for not agreeing
with her?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frustrating evening,'' she explained. ``You wouldn't
understand if you're not a lifelong Red Sox fan.''
</P>
<P>
   No, ma'am, I'm not a lifelong Red Sox fan. I'm a lifelong sports
fan, and that's a much higher calling. I care about the Red Sox
(season ticket-holder), and I really like and admire this
particular team. I would find it far preferable for them to keep
winning for all the obvious professional and personal reasons. I am
a serious fan, and I'd be willing to bet that in the course of my
sports fandom I've punched more walls, shouted at more TV sets, and
had more despondent rides home from losing games than she could
possibly imagine. I know what it is to be a fan; believe me.
</P>
<P>
   She was understandably upset with the blown calls by Rick Reed
and Tim Tschida, and alluded to some sort of larger conspiracy
against her team. I asked her if she would have considered throwing
something at Nomar Garciaparra, Bret Saberhagen, or Jose Offerman,
all of whom made errors that led to runs. ``Oh, no,'' she replied.
``They're our boys, and we love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you don't always love wisely in this life. Anyway, I've
overreacted to poor officiating, or what I thought was poor
officiating, as much as anybody, but as I get older I try to temper
that instinct by looking at the larger picture. My female protester
doesn't seem to understand that there is a huge difference between
clear self-inflicted wounds such as errors that lead to inexcusable
runs and very unfortunate missed calls, that, however aggravating,
still lead only to speculative situations. In both cases in
question, Mariano Rivera was still in control of the game, and was
likely to get himself out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that a few booze-soaked slugs can spoil things for
thousands of people, but there is more in the Fenway air these days
than that. Red Sox fans have bought into their own folklore too
much, especially when the opponent is New York. You've got people
on the radio who should know better telling them that the umpires
are subconsciously favoring the New York team. You've got people
truly believing that larger forces are controlling the fate of the
Red Sox. And you've got people who maybe ought to read the front
page once in a while ready to inflict harm on people because they
don't like what's happening in a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   It's really not that complicated. You watch, you yell, you go
home, you go to bed, you wake up, you read the paper to confirm
what you saw, you go to work, and you hash it out with someone.
Anything else is sick.

CLINTON PROPOSES A DISCOUNT PLAN TO TRIM COSTS OF MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a break from three decades of Medicare policy,
the Clinton administration asked Congress on Monday to steer
Medicare patients to certain doctors and hospitals that offer
discounts on the price of care they provide to people who are
elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation drafted by the administration and sent to
Congress, federal officials would notify beneficiaries of a list of
preferred doctors and hospitals that agree to offer ``discounted
rates'' to the government and to reduce the fees charged to
patients. The medical providers would attract more patients, making
up in volume for the lower charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and some Democrats, like Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida, say the proposed changes would save money and make
Medicare more competitive and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans oppose the idea, which has also provoked an
outcry from doctors and hospitals. Critics say the government would
emphasize price over quality and would steer Medicare patients to
mediocre doctors and hospitals that offered the biggest discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, doctors and hospitals that
wanted to be named as ``preferred providers'' would have to meet
new federal standards for the quality of care. But critics of the
proposal said that price would often be the dominant factor because
it was much easier to measure cost than quality.
</P>
<P>
   Since the creation of Medicare in 1965, beneficiaries have been
able to seek treatment from almost any licensed doctor or
accredited hospital. In its new legislative proposal, the
administration is asking Congress for broad new powers to pick and
choose providers who would coordinate the care of Medicare
patients. In some cases, under the proposal, certain services would
be provided only by the designated hospitals and doctors in
specific geographic regions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other details of the administration's proposal:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would designate specific hospitals
across the country as ``centers of excellence'' and would encourage
Medicare patients to use them for high-cost procedures like heart
surgery or hip replacement, provided the government saved money.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would hire specialists to coordinate all the
care needed by Medicare patients for the treatment of particular
conditions like congestive heart failure, high blood pressure,
coronary artery disease, asthma and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal officials could use competitive bidding to obtain
discounts on medical equipment and other goods and services
purchased for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare often pays more than
the retail price for common items like lancets and catheters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed interest in these proposals in June,
when he unveiled a comprehensive plan to redesign Medicare and add
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the proposals would modernize
Medicare and save money, by using selected techniques of managed
care to control costs in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare
program, which still serves 84 percent of the 39 million
beneficiaries. Vice President Al Gore supports the administration's
Medicare plan, including these proposals, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means
Committee plan to vote this week on legislation to restore some
money cut from Medicare in 1997. White House officials said they
hoped that the committees would accept the president's proposals,
which could offset some of the cost of undoing cuts made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Senate Finance Committee, Graham and Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., support the president's proposal to revamp the
purchasing of goods and services in the traditional Medicare
program. A third member, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., has expressed
support for some of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said that an experimental project in
Polk County, Fla., had shown that competitive bidding and similar
techniques could save money for Medicare without harming the
quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also strong criticism. Dr. Nicholas T. Kouchoukos,
president of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, said heart surgeons
were ``extremely troubled'' by Clinton's proposal because they
feared that ``excellence would take a back seat to discounted
pricing.'' It is, he said, totally inappropriate to send elderly
patients to the ``lowest bidder'' when they need life-saving
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pollack, executive vice president of the American
Hospital Association, said Clinton's proposal could reduce access
to specialized services in areas where the local hospital did not
win a contract with Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that doctors and hospitals were
afraid of true competition because it meant that there would be
winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say they oppose Clinton's proposal simply
because he covets the modernization of Medicare as part of his
political legacy. Republicans said they did not want him to be able
to take credit for such changes in the program unless they got what
they wanted: fundamental overhaul of Medicare, putting the original
fee-for-service program into direct competition with private health
plans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In March, 10 of the 17 members of a federal advisory commission
headed by Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana recommended that Medicare
compete directly with private health plans. To enhance such
competition, the panel said, Medicare officials should have more of
the purchasing tools available to private health plans, including
the ability to sign contracts with selected health care providers
who offer high-quality services and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday night Breaux, a Democrat, said the
president's proposal, taken by itself, was ``like robbing Peter to
pay Paul.'' The government, he said, would cut payments to some
health care providers so it could redistribute the money to other
doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Breaux said, ``I do not want to give the Health Care
Financing Administration more bureaucratic power, more regulatory
authority, at a time when it controls more than 80 percent of the
Medicare marketplace.''

PROFIT AT XEROX FELL 11 PERCENT IN THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten days after warning that its third-quarter results would be
dismal, Xerox Corp. made good on that promise Monday, and then
some.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said that its
net income fell 11 percent, to $339 million, or 47 cents a diluted
share, compared with $381 million, or 53 cents a share, in the
quarter a year earlier. Until Xerox's warning on Oct. 8, analysts
had expected third-quarter earnings to be 58 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue, meanwhile, was flat, rising to just $4.63 billion from
$4.61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox offered no hope for a quick turnaround. During a
conference call with analysts that lasted more than 90 minutes, its
chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, and its chief financial
officer, Barry D. Romeril, said that fourth-quarter results would
be 20 percent less than those in the quarter a year earlier and
that the first half of 2000 would be sluggish as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They confirmed a lot of worst-case scenarios,'' said Benjamin
A. Reitzes, an analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who had already lowered their fourth-quarter estimates
to 82 cents a share from 92 cents, lowered estimates to less than
70 cents a share Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues Xerox was dealing with in the first quarter just
aren't getting any better,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders, who have been steadily dumping Xerox stock in the
last 10 days, rushed to sell even more. The shares, which have
fallen 44 percent since the warning, dropped $3.625 on Monday, to
$23.8125.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost two-thirds of my net worth, and none of us are
feeling fat, dumb and happy right now,'' Thoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem skittish about the entire document-processing
industry. Lexmark International, a maker of printers, announced
third-quarter profit that beat forecasts Monday, but its shares
fell $28, or 30 percent, to $65, when it warned that its
fourth-quarter results might be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, Lexmark's net income rose 32 percent, to
$76.5 million, or 56 cents a diluted share. Analysts had expected
profit of 54 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics for Imaging, which makes products used in color
printers, lost $9.1875 a share, or 20 percent, to $36.3125, even
though it has met all profit expectations. Hewlett-Packard fell,
too, by $4.50, to $78.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copier and printer markets are healthy, so Xerox may have
pulled these stocks down,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst
with Prudential Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox may be in worse shape than its earnings indicate. The
company accrued money in the first two quarters to pay out as
profit-sharing; now, with profits looking low, it returned that
money to the income stream, benefiting the quarter's profits by 7
cents a share. Xerox picked up an additional 3 cents a share from
stock and asset sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back those out and you get 37 cents, way below the guidance of
10 days ago,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox executives attributed some of the profit troubles to a
range of causes, including weak sales in Brazil, currency exchange
rates, customer fears of Year 2000 problems and a general
resistance among clients to trade up on equipment. But they
acknowledged that internal upheavals accounted for far more of the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox recently consolidated 36 administrative centers into
three, but did not provide adequate staff. The result was severe
problems with billing and accounts receivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sales people have had to spend 40 percent of their time
dealing with administrative matters instead of selling,'' Thoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Xerox sales force is grappling with a
reorganization that makes its sales representatives responsible for
specific industries and companies, not geographic territories. And
they must switch from a decades-old emphasis on selling stand-alone
copiers to one of selling digital machines that can be connected to
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect that the new structure will eventually
enable Xerox to offer multinational customers a wider breadth of
products and services. But for now, the sales turmoil has badly
slowed Xerox's efforts to get customers for the expensive superfast
digital copiers that are its highest-margin products.
</P>
<P>
   Canon and Ricoh, meanwhile, are making inroads into Xerox's
market for medium-speed copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 25 percent of our revenues are coming from customers
that are new to us,'' said Dennis Amorosano, assistant director for
networked office systems at Canon USA, ``and I think that growth is
coming out of Xerox's customer base.''

COMMENTARY: CITY OF GHOSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In most great cities, monuments to the past are an
unnoticed part of the landscape. In Berlin, the past _ the terrible
past _ is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent in the skyline of the eastern part of the city is the
Moorish dome, topped by a Star of David, of the New Synagogue,
completed in 1866. It was an enormous building, seating 3,200 for
services: an indication of the size and position of the Jewish
community.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that remains are the facade and domes, beautifully
reconstructed, and a small museum of what used to be. A large
photograph shows the men of the congregation, prosperous-looking
burghers.
</P>
<P>
   In the southwest corner of the city is a large lake, the
Wannsee. On weekends dozens of sailboats race on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, 1942, 14 Nazi officials met in a villa on the
lakeshore to plan the carrying out of the Final Solution: the
extermination of the Jews. The chairman of the meeting was Reinhard
Heydrich.
</P>
<P>
   Today the villa is a memorial and educational center. Its
exhibits show how important the Jewish community was in Germany
from the mid-19th century _ how much it contributed to culture and
the economy. And then it shows how the Nazis harassed, humiliated
and finally murdered the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In one room is the long table around which the Nazi officials
sat in 1942. You can imagine them jotting down notes, occasionally
recessing to stroll along the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heydrich had expected that his concept would meet with
misgivings and objections from the ministerial departments,'' a
villa publication says, ``but he encountered only general agreement
and readiness to help in its execution. The discussions dealt
solely with details.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews, including Albert Einstein, lived in the neighborhood
around Bayerischer Platz in the first third of this century. They
were altogether integrated into the society, or so they thought.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary memorial designed by Renata Stih and Frieder
Schnock showed, on signs put high on light poles, what happened to
the Jews after 1933. On one side of a sign was an image _ of, say,
a cat. On the other was the text of a Nazi decree: Jews are
forbidden to have pets.
</P>
<P>
   The signs showed the gradual accumulation of anti-Semitic laws
that dehumanized an entire people: Jewish judges dismissed, then
public-school teachers, then civil servants, then actors, then
musicians, then doctors. Jews barred from theaters and concert
halls, forbidden to buy food except between 4 and 5 in the
afternoon. And finally, deportation and death.
</P>
<P>
   Most powerful of all is the new Jewish Museum building designed
by Daniel Libeskind. It is only a building; the exhibits are not
yet installed. But it is so remarkable that it is thronged with
visitors. They have to sign up for group tours, and there are now
40 tours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The outer walls of Libeskind's museum are covered in zinc,
pierced by slashes of window that might be lightning or a shattered
Star of David. Inside, the corridors and rooms are cut again and
again; bridges connect them. The unmistakable symbol is of Germany
and Judaism, linked and disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Then, through a black door, one enters a dark angular tower. It
is an oppressive space, suffocating. As a symbol of the Holocaust,
I found it more powerful than museum images of the reality.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing is that ordinary Germans in large numbers
visit these reminders of the Jewish past and Nazi savagery. And
newspapers, radio and television refer to the history in one way or
another day after day. Immediately after the war most Germans
seemed to wish the past away. Now they face it.
</P>
<P>
   History is everywhere here. Lord Foster, the British architect,
totally reconstructed the interior of the Reichstag _ but left bits
of the old interior walls, including Soviet soldiers' graffiti. At
the top he put a wonderful glass dome, with a circle of pictures
from history below it.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of the Berlin Wall have been preserved here and there as
mementoes, too. And a museum tells the story of the airlift that
saved West Berlin when the Soviet Union blockaded it in 1948-49.
Over 11 months the United States and its Allies flew in 2,325,000
tons of food, coal and other supplies. Republicans in Congress
supported President Truman in the great effort without
partisanship. But that was another country.

HOW FRIENDLY FENWAY BECAME FRIGHTFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As he braced against biting winds on Yawkey Way Monday,
Steve Busby tugged his Red Sox cap low over his eyes and took no
joy in firing a knockdown pitch at baseball fans behaving badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for baseball,'' said Busby, 45, of Marblehead, Mass.
``And it's very bad for Boston. We're losers and we can't deal with
it. And it's reducing grown men _ lawyers, stockbrokers, and
accountants _ into children. I mean it's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Measured against street riots and felonious deeds that have
shadowed sporting events for generations, Sunday night's shower of
debris from Fenway fans, forcing an eight-minute delay in the
bottom of the ninth, was somewhere between boorish and brutal.
</P>
<P>
   But fans, baseball officials, and students of sports psychology
said hideous umpiring, a legacy of losing, and a rivalry that
borders on hatred are toxic ingredients that have turned sections
of Friendly Fenway into Frightful Fenway this championship season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people have this sense of entitlement,'' said
Jose Masso, senior associate director of the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ``They feel they
have this ticket that is expensive and hard to get and there are no
rules about their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can curse at the umpire, get personal with the players,
and even throw things. I'm sitting there thinking: This is now part
of our New England culture? This is something we find charming? I
was somewhat embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday night's shower of bottles and cups, prompted by a
blown call at second base by umpire Tim Tschida, was unusual for
its ferocity, it was hardly unprecedented for a Red Sox-Yankees
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, the players in pinstripes literally feared
for their safety at Fenway. Chris Chambliss once took a dart in the
shoulder as he pulled into third base with a triple. Someone once
tossed 2-inch bolts at Mickey Rivers as he stood in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fanatical behavior is part of baseball history. In the
sixth inning of Game 7 of the 1934 series between the St. Louis
Cardinals and Detroit Tigers, St. Louis's Joe Medwick barreled into
Marv Owen at third. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered
Medwick removed from the game after Tiger fans threw bottles,
fruit, and vegetables at him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something about the first-ever postseason series
between two fabled franchises that has pushed the decibel level to
new extremes, sent veins popping in the necks of jeering Boston
fans, and added a razor-sharp edge to catcalls from the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the Astros, some of the things that went on in
Shea Stadium were unbelievable. One of our players was supposedly
urinated on by a fan,'' said Jerry Trupiano, a Red Sox radio
broadcaster. ``But I've never seen anything like this Red
Sox-Yankee rivalry. Those who were throwing the bottles were just
the lunatic fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a sense here that it's our turn. And there's a
level of frustration. I don't care if the fans yell or scream, but
keep it in the boundaries of good taste and let's not turn it into
a physical act.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a sport where bench-clearing brawls are not uncommon and
fans feel comfortable chanting obscenities in front of little boys
and bespectacled grandmothers, the boundaries of good taste are
moving targets.
</P>
<P>
   They said an expletive on CBS television last week, ``and you
can see people's naked butts on weekly TV, too. I'm not excusing
it, but that's the way everything else has evolved,'' said Lynn
Solomon, 32, of Yakima, Wash., who stood in line Monday for the
limited number of tickets sold for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the game, I was sitting in the grandstand
and there was a lot of good-natured bantering going on,'' Solomon
said. ``But by the end of the game when people had had their hearts
broken a couple of times and had a handful of beers, it was not
good-natured at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino called the behavior an embarrassment for
the city. ``I apologize to the baseball fans of America,'' Menino
said in a statement. ``That is not what Boston is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's game will give us the opportunity to show the world
that we are not only the most loyal and supportive fans, but we are
courteous and sportsmanlike as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox spokesman Dick Bresciani said a small portion of the
team's fans were responsible for the outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 34,000 fans, it doesn't take too many to create an ugly
scene,'' said Bresciani, adding that ballpark behavior has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe what I hear on radio and TV today,'' he said.
``The limits of appropriateness has changed. These kids hear these
words all the time and they chant it in all the ballparks. I know
it makes older people feel uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Len Zaichkowsky, a sports psychologist at Boston University,
said the same crowd mentality that would make otherwise rational
people behave irrationally, is at work in the growing sense of
frustration that has boiled over after Red Sox defeats amid
questionable umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the immediate frustration and the frustration that goes
back to the beginning of this century,'' Zaichkowsky said. ``People
know the history, and now we see the umpires really trying to take
it away from us and they become the enemy, too. There's sort of a
social contagion going on here, and it spills through the whole
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Masso: ``There's the frustration that's built up over all
these years added to the expectations that were raised in
overcoming Cleveland. There are a good number of fans out there who
are saying, `Doggone it. This is our year, and if people get in our
way, we're going to point them out and tell them they're the reason
we're not getting our just dues.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Murphy, 26, of Peabody, needed no advanced degree in the
psychology of modern sports to summarize succinctly the behavior at
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a combination of frustration, alcohol, and other
grown men around them doing the same thing,'' said Murphy outside
the park Monday afternoon. ``Nothing begets stupidity like
stupidity.''

NOMINEE AS AMBASSADOR RUNS INTO ADVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During her single term in the U.S. Senate, Carol
Moseley-Braun repeatedly clashed with the chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, for a freshman Democrat, Ms. Moseley-Braun twice got
the best of the formidable Helms. She humiliated him in 1993 by
blocking a routine request he favored to grant the United Daughters
of the Confederacy a renewed patent on an emblem featuring the
Confederate battle flag, which she said was an affront to black
Americans. A year later, she thwarted Helms' efforts to sharply
reduce financing for a commission to promote the holiday honoring
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Now, out of office and President Clinton's choice to be
ambassador to New Zealand, Ms. Moseley-Braun is facing her old
adversary again. And Helms seems to be relishing the chance to
torpedo her nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Helms says his opposition hinges on ``ethical
lapses'' by Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat. In her failed
re-election effort last year, Ms. Moseley-Braun was criticized for
her 1996 meetings with the former Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha and dogged by accusations, never proved, that she used 1993
campaign money for personal luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud
hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun,'' Helms said Monday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, Helms is still rankled by Ms. Moseley-Braun's
past comments and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she should hold her breath until she becomes an
ambassador,'' he told Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, in
Monday's issue.
</P>
<P>
   Helms told Roll Call that the committee would only consider her
nomination if she apologized ``for the display that she provoked
over the little symbol for a wonderful group of little old
ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House seized on Helms' remarks Monday, made just days
after he helped sink a treaty banning underground nuclear testing,
as evidence that he was carrying a political grudge. ``The
Constitution was not written to provide individual senators with a
way to even the score,'' said the White House spokesman, Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unusual for the Senate to oppose the nomination of a
former colleague. Ms. Moseley-Braun was the first black woman
elected to the Senate; she lost last November to Peter G.
Fitzgerald, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Her selection is the latest of Clinton's ambassador nominations
to run afoul of Helms or Senate Republicans. The nomination of
Richard C. Holbrooke to be the American delegate to the United
Nations was held up earlier this year by Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, William F. Weld, the former governor of
Massachusetts, withdrew his name from consideration to be
ambassador to Mexico after angering Helms. J. Brian Atwood's
nomination to be ambassador to Brazil suffered a similar fate after
he clashed with Helms over the senator's plan to merge the Agency
for International Development, which Atwood directed, into the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Monday at her home in Chicago, Ms. Moseley-Braun said
the State Department had asked her not to comment on her
nomination. ``I'm hopeful I can get a hearing quickly, and that
Senator Helms accords me the same kind of support he would any
other former senator,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Helms, Marc Thiessen, said it was ``doubtful''
the committee would hold a hearing on the nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   The administration approached Ms. Moseley-Braun about the
ambassadorship after her defeat last November, as a way to help a
Clinton loyalist. She has been working part time as a consultant
with the U.S. Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday why she would want the New Zealand job, given her
domestic interests in the Senate, Ms. Moseley-Braun said: ``The
place sounds like it's close to paradise. I'm very excited about
this.''

 &HT;    An AIDS wakeup call; Quilt panels send urgent message
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year ago, Debbie Thomas-Bryan relaxed in her Atlanta
home and talked enthusiastically about how good it felt to have her
life back on track after years of battling AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, college students at the Atlanta University Center
soberly regarded a panel of the AIDS Memorial Quilt sewn in memory
of Thomas-Bryan. In July, after her HIV drugs failed, the
45-year-old became one of the roughly 150,000 black Americans who
have died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Brittenham, a 20-year-old junior at Clark Atlanta
University, was hoarse with emotion as she viewed the quilt panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to cry,'' Brittenham said. ``I wish more
students would come and see this. It would be a reality check for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A reality check is precisely what the NAMES Project Foundation,
which sponsors the AIDS quilt, hopes to deliver to black college
students across the country. For at least the next few months,
portions of the AIDS Quilt will tour historically black colleges
and universities to raise AIDS awareness and promote HIV prevention
among young African-Americans, considered to be the population at
greatest risk for infection with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The quilt tour is the latest event to heighten the profile of
the AIDS epidemic among African-Americans. Until recently, the
black community has largely kept silent about AIDS, even as the
virus slew thousands of African-Americans each year. Black
preachers and politicians alike have been criticized for failing to
address AIDS and accompanying social ills such as homophobia and
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black communities have been so overburdened that the idea of
adopting another burden is not appealing,'' explained Cornelius
Baker, executive director of the National Association of People
with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance and reticence appear to be melting at last, as
more attention is focused on the AIDS epidemic among
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A recent conference sponsored partly by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention revealed significant _ and alarming _ new
data about the prevalence of HIV and AIDS among blacks.
African-Americans now account for about half of all new HIV
infections, AIDS cases and AIDS deaths, despite representing only
13 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, black churches in Atlanta gathered for the
first National Black Church HIV/AIDS Institute, to help pastors and
other faith leaders learn how to deal with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, faith leaders, policy makers, community activists
and AIDS researchers all met in Atlanta to discuss how to combat
AIDS among African-Americans. That same day, the NAACP announced
the upcoming release of a series of educational films aimed at
raising HIV awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The support hasn't been merely rhetorical. This month, the CDC
awarded $39 million in federal funds to more than 100 national,
state and local organizations around the United States to help
prevent HIV infections among blacks and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The money went to groups such as the DeKalb Prevention Alliance,
which plans to start a street outreach program to perform HIV
testing and counseling among homeless people and drug users in
DeKalb County.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the state health department received $1 million for HIV
prevention programs in Georgia correctional facilities. A recent
study sponsored by the National Commission on Correctional Health
Care found that approximately 8,900 prison inmates had AIDS in
1997, and that up to one-fifth of all Americans with HIV had been
released from a correctional facility within the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must mount prevention and treatment strategies that deal
with people where they are now, not where we want them to be or
where we imagine them to be,'' said Phill Wilson, director of the
AIDS Social Policy Archive.
</P>
<P>
   While injection drug use is commonly perceived as a major factor
in the spread of AIDS among blacks, sex is the primary method of
transmission. AIDS experts say bisexual behavior among gay black
men who feel pressured to have sex with women accounts for a
significant number of HIV infections among heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stigma on homosexual behavior in the African-American
community, it's not surprising that this is the case,'' said Dr.
Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD
and TB Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King, widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
addressed this problem Monday at the opening ceremonies for the
quilt tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that homophobia has worsened and prolonged the
AIDS crisis,'' King said. ``It is particularly sad to me when I
hear black people, including some in leadership positions, making
homophobic comments and attacking the human rights of gay and
lesbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of sexual orientation or gender, however, all
African-Americans are at significantly higher risk for becoming
infected with HIV. Youth only increases that risk: Most new HIV
infections are occurring among people 25 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics deeply sadden and frustrate AIDS activists such
as Denise Stokes, who has been HIV-positive for 17 of her 30 years.
Stokes, a member of President Clinton's HIV/AIDS Advisory Council,
spoke Monday at the quilt tour kick-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live and breathe so I can prevent you from becoming
infected,'' Stokes said, addressing the college students in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, this is ultimately where I'm going to end up,''
Stokes continued, gesturing to the quilt panels surrounding her.
``I'm going to be a panel on some wall in some library.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the library isn't full of people with AIDS.''

U.S. SALES HELP FORD DELIVER 11 PERCENT PROFIT GAIN IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Strong sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup
trucks and large cars in the United States gave Ford Motor Co.
better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter, even as the
company acknowledged severe problems in its European operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said Monday that it had earned $1.11 billion, or 90 cents a
share, up 11 percent from the third quarter last year, when it
earned $1 billion, or 80 cents a share. It beat analysts' profit
expectations of 85 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's gain would have been even larger except for a one-time
charge of $125 million for retirement health care and life
insurance costs at an auto parts division, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors focused Monday on the company's strong overall
earnings, bidding up Ford's stock in a weak market. Shares rose
$1.50, to $52.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has profited, particularly in North America, by
discontinuing slow-selling, unprofitable car models and replacing
them with more lucrative models. Successful new models include the
Lincoln LS sports sedan, the Jaguar S-type sedan and the Ford
Excursion sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   W. Wayne Booker, Ford's vice chairman and chief financial
officer, acknowledged Monday in the bluntest terms used yet that
the company was having problems in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's European operations lost $171 million in the third
quarter despite profits from its Volvo Cars and Jaguar divisions in
Europe, and despite the success there of the Ford Focus compact
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's an indication of the magnitude of the other
problems,'' that the European operations lost money despite those
three successes, Booker said at a news conference Monday at Ford's
headquarters here in a southwestern suburb of Detroit. Ford has
been losing market share in Europe as rival automakers,
particularly Volkswagen AG, have introduced more exciting car
designs.
</P>
<P>
   Ford lost $273 million in Europe in the third quarter of 1998,
but that included high costs for the introduction of the Focus. The
company said Monday that ``Ford does not expect to achieve its 1999
milestone for Europe to improve operating earnings year over
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a management shake-up on Friday aimed
partly at improving results in Europe. The new structure will give
more autonomy to Ford's European operations, which have been run
mainly from here in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's South American automotive operations have also been
losing money, partly because of economic problems in Brazil but
also because Ford did not invest in new models and factories there
until recently. Ford lost $72 million in the third quarter,
compared with a $44 million loss a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ford earned $1 billion from North American
automotive operations in the quarter, despite setting aside $100
million for a continuing program of reducing white-collar
employment through voluntary-departure incentives. Ford, which did
not declare the $100 million as a one-time charge, had earned $896
million in the region a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Rod A. Lache, an auto analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown,
predicted that Ford would continue to do well at home while
struggling overseas. ``The North American earnings are going to
keep getting better and the rest are going to be nonfactors for
Ford as a whole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's cash reserves swelled to $25.7 billion, compared with
$22.9 billion a year earlier. Despite occasional criticisms from
institutional investors and Wall Street analysts, Ford has been
conserving cash to prepare for the next recession and for possible
mergers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The auto parts subsidiary, Visteon Automotive Systems, which
Ford is expected to spin off soon, earned $155 million in the third
quarter excluding the one-time charge, which occurred when an
outside actuarial analysis of a Visteon division caused Ford to
conclude that it had been underestimating costs for retiree health
care and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials declined to identify the division, saying only
that it was small and that they did not believe other divisions had
similar problems. Visteon earned $148 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Credit, the auto loans and leases division, earned $317
million in the third quarter, up from $272 million a year ago.
Hertz Corp., the car rental business in which Ford owns an 80
percent stake, earned $139 million, up from $119 million a year
earlier.

   NEW YORK _ Henry Kissinger, German refugee, walked into a
classroom of children of immigrants from the Dominican Republic and
looked for common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Few raised their hands when he inquired whether they were born
abroad (though some clearly had not understood the word
``abroad''). Almost every arm shot up when he asked who shared a
room with a sibling, as he had. But none of the 30 sixth-graders in
their neat school uniforms of white shirts and dark pants nodded
along when this century's most famous American diplomat told how he
and his brother had to sleep in the living room, waiting up until
everyone else had retired for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' he said with a smile, ``you're better off than we
were.''
</P>
<P>
   The classroom, at Eleanor Roosevelt Middle School in the
Washington Heights section of Manhattan, was just a few blocks from
the high school Kissinger attended six decades before. The lesson
plan Monday was Kissinger himself.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of life in a cramped three-room apartment and in a
tense White House on the eve of President Nixon's resignation,
trying to explain his path from the shadow of the George Washington
Bridge to the power elite of Washington. He talked about escaping
the Holocaust and fighting the Cold War, Joe DiMaggio and Oscar de
la Renta, 55-cent bleacher seats in Yankee Stadium and VIP tickets
to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some comparable background to me,'' Kissinger, 76,
said after the hour was up. ``When I drop in like this, what I can
do is show them that there is a way out of here, and you can do it
by your own efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger is one of dozens of celebrities visiting classrooms
around the country this week to celebrate the 10th anniversary of
Teach for America, the nonprofit group that places recent college
graduates in poor and struggling school districts. Across the hall
from him Monday at Intermediate School 143 was Al Roker, the
weatherman. George Stephanopoulos, a White House adviser from a
later era, was a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, Oprah Winfrey was teaching sixth-graders, too,
inviting them to join her in keeping a daily journal of five things
for which they are grateful. Ms. Winfrey pointed out that her list
was filled with ordinary items that were unrelated to her fame and
fortune, like a good workout this weekend and a safe trip to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey was a surprise guest, but the teachers of the
sixth-grade class at I.S. 143 had spent a week prepping their
students for Kissinger's visit. They had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we said his name, they were like, `Who is he?''' said
Justine Papierski, the homeroom teacher. ``Then we showed a
picture. They said, `He's old.' They said, `Why would he come
here?'''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kissinger arrived for third period Monday, the
students had read excerpts from Walter Isaacson's
less-than-flattering biography and looked at some historical Web
sites. The classroom was decorated with paper balloons and cutouts
of some of Kissinger's books, including ``A World Restored'' and
``Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Attentive and curious, if somewhat befuddled by his accent and
formal tone, the children were ready with carefully crafted
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your favorite sport?'' asked Omar Guzman, 11, who
hopes to be a professional baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer, it turns out, from childhood kick-arounds in Europe.
And, yes, Kissinger is a Yankees fan. DiMaggio, he said, was one of
his heroes. That was helpful. The students had all heard of
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody had said, you have a choice between being friends
with Joe DiMaggio and being secretary of state, I would have
thought secretary of state was crazy; I would have picked
DiMaggio,'' Kissinger told the class. ``But later on, when I was
out of office and he was retired, I got to know Joe DiMaggio. I got
both. I was lucky.''
</P>

<P>
   The Washington Heights where the Kissingers lived after fleeing
Germany and the Nazi reign of terror in 1938 is gone now. The grand
old movie theater he remembers, the RKO Coliseum on 181st Street,
is rundown. The Jewish population has dwindled to a small enclave
in a Dominican swath, and German shop signs have been replaced with
restaurant specials in Spanish. The streets that produced Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, the sex therapist, are now far more famous as the home
of slugger Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 96 percent of the students at I.S. 143 are Hispanic, and
92 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. The school,
which is brightly decorated with student artwork inside and out,
typically outperforms similar schools on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger long ago moved to Midtown Manhattan, and the
homecoming was a little awkward. The students missed most of his
jokes. He reached out by saying that he visits the Dominican
Republic regularly to see his friend, de la Renta, but the children
thought that was just the name on a label.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember,'' he began, in response to a question
about Nixon. ``Well, you don't remember,'' he corrected himself,
``but you should know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger asked the students who had questions for him to first
tell him what they want to be when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Reyes, a small boy with a shaved head, said he wants to
join the Central Intelligence Agency. ``During the Cold War,'' he
asked, ``were you helping the Communists?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very anti-Communist on the one hand,'' Kissinger said.
``On the other hand, when you look at nuclear weapons and you know
what they can do, you have an obligation to promote peace. If you
have a high position in government, if you're not controversial,
you're not doing your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Valdez, who hopes to be a lawyer, wanted to know
Kissinger's biggest fear while living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walked down the street, the Hitler Youth could beat
you up,'' he said. ``It's not something I should recommend you go
through, but it wasn't yet a Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Roselynn Cordero, a budding archeologist, wondered what
Kissinger had wanted to do when he was growing up. ``Did you always
want to be a secretary of state?'' she asked, sounding unsure of
exactly what that is.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who worked in a shaving-brush factory as a teen-ager
while attending classes at George Washington High School at night,
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got paid $11 a week, $10.89,'' he said. ``I gave $8 to my
parents; I kept $2.89 for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea to become secretary of state _ out of the question,''
he said. ``If someone had said to me, in 30 years, you're going to
have an office next to the president of the United States, I would
have said he's nuts.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It'S not that the man the fans called Bobby O. doesn't know from
comebacks. After all, in the 1986 World Series, he pitched Game
Three and the classic, Game Six, for the Mets, stonily willing them
to victory when they were on their knees. But though Bobby Ojeda
has played for the Red Sox, the Indians and the Yankees too, it
wasn't until his mother prodded him this weekend that he finally
watched some of the playoffs. That's because there are comebacks,
and then there is coming back, as in near-death freefalls.
</P>
<P>
   So to a grand new home, hidden in Rumson, N.J. On a sunny
October morning, his youngest girls are gamboling out back and
inside, candles have been lighted to calm the room. No newspapers.
They shake things up. Before, Bobby O. would read three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Before does not mean his 16-year career in baseball, but the
nightmare that essentially ended it. On a March night in 1993,
after a family barbecue in Florida with two of his fellow pitchers
from the Cleveland Indians, Bobby O., Steve Olin and Tim Crews
decided do a little fishing in Crews' motor boat. The boat crashed
into a dock. The autopsy said that Crews had had a little too much
to drink. Only Bobby O. survived, barely.
</P>
<P>
   It took Bobby O. six weeks to heal from his injuries, notably
the virtual scalping that, even after artful plastic surgery, left
him with a U-shaped scar looping across his forehead. The real
healing had not even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn fool. That summer, weeks after he fled to Sweden to
hide, followed by a stay at a Maryland psychiatric institution, he
made a comeback to honor his dead friends. When even the Orioles
fans welcomed him with a standing ovation, Ojeda, overcome, posted
a thank-you note on their scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   At season's end, the Indians and Ojeda parted ways. He made it
through the 1994 spring training with the Yankees and began
pitching in the regular season. But it was obvious. After he got
the word, he sneaked away, got into his truck and drove his rage,
his guilt, the boozing and the ghosts home to New Jersey, to face
his family and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't figure it out,'' says Bobby O., leaning back on a
couch. ``I was used to fighting and winning, but for the first time
in my life I couldn't fix it or make it go away or not happen, no
matter how hard I tried. That anger lasted, strong. I didn't make
sense for about three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played the victim, but I was mean and nasty, which is
way out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   In his grief and guilt about his friends' fatherless children,
he temporarily lost contact with his three children from his first
marriage. He endlessly berated his second wife and their young
daughter. ``I had strangers saying, `We're really glad you're
alive,' and even that would make me mad,'' he says. ``I didn't look
at a mirror for six months because I was terrified of who was in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, Bobby O. looks as if he has stepped back into his skin
and likes the way it fits. His humor is self-deprecating. Raised in
California, his mother an interpreter for migrant workers, his
father an upholsterer, he wanted to be a professional ballplayer,
he said, because ``it was the only thing I was any good at.''
</P>
<P>
   He was good but not dazzling. He did have a great year in 1986,
after he left Boston and came to New York, where his loyalty
remains. ``All the Mets fans ask is that you give your best
effort,'' he says. ``If you try to pass the buck, they'll chew you
up.'' When he was lousy, he says, ``They knew I was really trying.
I was very average, but when the moon and the planets lined up in
'86, there I was, and it was a shock to me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``Boston? They're the proverbial bridesmaid and you're
just another groom. If you don't propose with a World Series title,
they'll hate you.'' As in: you stink as a baseball player, so you
stink as a person, ``and we hate your dog, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby O. has always two-stepped with fate. He has flown planes,
still hikes and fishes in wildernesses worldwide and still rides a
Harley-Davidson. As a kid, he drove his minibike off a bridge.
During the 1988 pennant race, he almost lost a finger to a hedge
clipper.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of almosts. During those lost years, howling at his
staunch second wife, Ellen, he knew that if he could reach deep
enough, he might save himself from drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's salary, two more daughters, the amazing Ellen _ who,
12 years later, still jauntily calls him ``Baby'' _ building a new
home and mountain treks helped. These days, Bobby Ojeda, a
``professional Dad,'' can taste joy and gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, at his mother's behest, he and Ellen raised
$100,000 from Met fans for a group home on a California Indian
reservation. A month ago, Mom calls to say that, flush from a new
casino, the tribe built a Little League field and is dedicating it
to him. She knows how he is, but would he consider coming out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `Are you kidding? You're talking to me, not Babe Ruth!
This is a highlight of my life! I'm there!''
</P>
<P>
   At the dedication, he sees Indian children in baseball uniforms
and a chief says, ``When no one was coming here, you helped us take
the first step. This is why we honor you.'' An elder waved burning
sage leaves, praying. Amid unfamiliar language, the former pitcher
heard the words, ``Bob Ojeda.'' In the retelling, Bobby O. looks
awestruck. ``It gave me the chills,'' he says, ``and I thought, `It
does not get better than this.'''

PANEL RECOMMENDS NAVY BE ALLOWED TO USE PUERTO RICAN FIRING RANGE
FOR 5 YEARS

 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A presidential panel recommended on Monday that the
U.S. military be allowed to resume live firing exercises at a Navy
base in Puerto Rico but that the range be shut down in five years,
despite demands from the territory's governor that the base be
closed immediately and all bombing halted.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, when a Marine pilot killed a Puerto Rican guard in
a bombing accident on the base, which is on the island of Vieques,
Puerto Rican protesters have occupied the base and prevented any
target practice while the territory's politicians have argued that
the base was an unacceptable threat to the island's livelihood and
environment. The Navy has suspended all bombing pending a final
decision on the base.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating criticism of Monday's recommendation, Secretary of
Defense William Cohen said in a written statement that Navy
officials and representatives from Puerto Rico should continue
searching for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear from the panel's report there are serious concerns
among the residents of Vieques which need and deserve the careful
attention of the Navy and the Department of Defense,'' Cohen said
in the statement issued while he was traveling in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendation was immediately criticized by Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a presumed candidate for senator from New York. She
endorsed the position of most Puerto Rican politicians in New York,
who have promised to make the closing of Vieques an issue in next
year's presidential and Senate elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be an immediate and permanent end to the
bombing,'' Mrs. Clinton said on Monday. ``The use of live fire on
the island has put the people of Vieques at risk, degraded the
environment and hampered economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Mrs. Clinton angered several Hispanic leaders in New
York when she urged the president to withdraw his offer of clemency
to members of a Puerto Rican terrorist organization. And in
Monday's move, she was more in step with the Democratic Party
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In a private conversation over the weekend, Vice President Al
Gore told a state senator from New York, Olga Mendez, that he also
favored shutting down the base, said an official with Gore's
presidential campaign. But a spokesman for Gore would say only that
the vice president was working for ``a resolution to this important
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department says that despite months of searching, it
has found no replacement for the base, which the secretary of the
Navy has called ``the only suitable training site.''.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States is to maintain military forces, it owes
its sailors, Marines, soldiers and airmen the best possible
training,'' the Navy secretary, Richard Danzig, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig asked Congress to endorse the findings of the four-member
panel, which was headed by Francis Rush, principal deputy assistant
secretary of defense for force management policy. After a
congressional recommendation on the base, President Clinton will
make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government owns nearly two-thirds of the 33,000-acre
island of Vieques. Because the island is far from the major
commercial shipping and air routes, the Navy and Marines have
mounted exercises with live ammunition for amphibious assaults,
aerial bombing and aircraft carrier-based attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said that as the only base for such exercises
on the East Coast, Vieques had been critical for training pilots,
sailors and Marines for every war since World War II, including the
recent Kosovo air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In June Clinton appointed the four-member panel to resolve the
competing demands of the American military and the Puerto Rican
government.
</P>
<P>
   But the president tipped his own hand in a private letter he
wrote to his national security advisor, Sandy Berger, on July 26, a
White House official said. In it, the official said, the president
said he agreed with Ruben Berrios-Martinez, a Puerto Rican friend
of the president, who said that Vieques was being treated like ``a
colonial commonwealth.'' ``This is wrong,'' the president wrote.
``I think they don't want us there. That's the main point. The Navy
can find a way to work around it.''
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous recommendation, the panel said it recognized
the need to hold the training but said the military should
substantially reduce the number of days it holds live-fire
operations and cut back by half the amount of ammunition used.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lee Hamilton, head of the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars, was a member of the panel, along with retired a
Marine Corps general, Richard Neal, and a retired Navy vice
admiral, Diego Hernandez, a former commander of the Navy's Third
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said on Monday that the issue was difficult because the
``Navy has not done a good job communicating to the Puerto Rican
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly two months of testimony and travel to Puerto Rico,
Hamilton, a former Democratic representative from Indiana, said the
panel came to the conclusion that ``the Puerto Rican community is
very incensed by this and they all want it stopped immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the strongest of those voices was Rep. Carlos
Romero-Barcelo, a Democrat and nonvoting delegate from Puerto Rico.
Romero-Barcelo told the special panel, ``We insist that the Navy
release its stranglehold on Vieques and that all property in
Vieques be returned to the government of Puerto Rico or the
municipality of Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make up for these lapses in communication, the Navy
has issued reports trying to counter arguments about environmental
degradation and showing that the death of the base guard in April
was the only civilian fatality in more than 50 years of live
ammunition training there.

   RITE AID OUSTS ITS CHIEF AND GETS A LOAN EXTENSION
</P>
<P>
   Directors of Rite Aid ousted the chief executive, Martin L.
Grass, and announced the company would restate $500 million in
pretax earnings since 1997 and would place control with four
independent board members.
</P>
<P>
   With those changes, the company said, its lead bankers agreed to
extend by one year $2.7 billion in loans and other debt that had
been due Oct. 29 and that Leonard Green &AMP; Partners, the Los Angeles
investment boutique, would invest $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL SERVICES BILL IN LAST STAGE
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the Senate and House moved toward completing a bill
overhauling the nation's financial system but failed to satisfy
President Clinton's concerns about protecting consumers and
minorities. The issue, which would repeal the Glass-Steagal Act of
1933, has led to an intense lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CITIGROUP'S PROFITS TOP FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup reported that third-quarter profit more than tripled,
exceeding forecasts. Citigroup's stock rose $1.5625, to $43.6875.
Results at Bank of America and J.P. Morgan also topped analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   XEROX'S PROFIT AND SHARES SKID
</P>
<P>
   Xerox reported that its net income fell 11 percent, to 47 cents
a diluted share. Until Xerox warned on Oct. 8 that its results
would be dismal, analysts had expected earnings of 58 cents a
share. The company said that results for the fourth-quarter and the
first half of 2000 would also be sluggish. Xerox's shares, which
have fallen 44 percent since the warning, dropped $3.625 to
$23.8125.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT AT FORD INCREASES 11 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor reported an 11 percent profit rise, to 90 cents a
share, surpassing forecasts of 85 cents thanks to strong domestic
sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large cars.
European operations had problems.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG COMPANIES' RESULTS ARE MIXED
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert reported a 38 percent profit rise, matching
analysts' expectations, but a rival drug maker, American Home
Products, posted a $2.9 billion loss after setting aside $3.5
billion, mainly to pay for the settlement of litigation related to
its fen-phen diet drug.
</P>
<P>
   DELTA AND CONTINENTAL OUTPERFORM
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nation's largest airlines, Delta and Continental,
reported earnings that beat analysts' estimates, despite losing
millions of dollars to Hurricane Floyd. Delta also announced it
would pay $1.8 billion for outstanding shares of its regional
affiliate, Comair Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   LEVITT CALLS FOR WIDER DISCLOSURE
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, asked companies ``in the spirit
of fair play'' to let all investors take part in conference calls
about important information. He also criticized what he called a
``web of dysfunctional relationships'' among companies and
analysts, saying that brokerage firms often expect their analysts
``to act more like promoters and marketers than unbiased and
dispassionate analysts.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 The Lure of Virtual Banks  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Internet-only banks have been going all-out lately to lure
customers with low fees and generous interest rates.
<P>
   If you feel that a bank must have marble floors, soaring pillars
and a ponderous stone facade to really be a bank, then perhaps the
online versions aren't for you.
</P>
<P>
   But if you already are comfortable dealing with virtual
financial institutions _ for example, if you have an account with a
stockbroker that operates strictly online _ then you might want to
give Internet-only banks a try. They offer some good deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got lower overhead costs and better rates,'' notes
Robert Sterling, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New
York. ``As a result, they are able to go after business more
aggressively than traditional banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they may be invisible, Internet-only banks are real
banks, with FDIC-insured checking and savings accounts. They let
you deposit and withdraw money, write checks and take out loans.
Most of them also let you pay most of your bills online.
</P>
<P>
   However, they can't meet all the banking needs of all consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a safe-deposit box, you will have to continue to
maintain an account at a bricks-and-mortar bank. Nobody has figured
out how to store grandma's heirlooms in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, virtual banks don't have their own automated teller
machines _ though their customers can use ATMs maintained by other
financial institutions if they are willing to pay the standard fee
of $1 to $2 per transaction. (Some Internet-only banks _ among them
NetBank of Alpharetta, Ga. _ fully reimburse their customers for
ATM fees.)
</P>
<P>
   Virtual banks also can't accommodate you when you want to make
cash deposits or if you have special banking needs that require
prolonged, hands-on attention from a teller or branch manager.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no good reason why you can't have more than
one bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Internet banking dates back about four years, but it has begun
to catch on only during the past year or so. About 4 percent of all
U.S. households do at least some of their banking on the Internet,
according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of Internet banking is done through online arms
of traditional banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   There are just about a half-dozen Internet-only banks, and their
name recognition isn't great yet. However, that could change
because their extremely low overhead allows them to offer highly
competitive checking, deposit and loan rates.
</P>
<P>
   Browse through the Internet bank Web sites, check out the deals,
select the bank that suits you best, and send in an application.
Most let you apply for an account online, though they then will
send you papers to fill out, sign and return.
</P>
<P>
   Once you establish an account, you will get a packet of checks,
if you open a checking account, and deposit slips and mailing
envelopes. While this may be the Internet Age, you still will have
to use snail mail to make deposits and transfer funds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more prominent Internet-only banks are:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; _Security First Network Bank &LR; , founded in 1995, is based in
Atlanta. It pays interest as high as 6 percent annually on checking
accounts and provides credit cards with a 3.9 percent introductory
interest rate for six months and 9.9 percent after that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _WingspanBank.com &LR; , based in Delaware, opened for business in
the middle of this year. It offers three-month certificates of
deposit that pay an annual interest rate of 5.2 percent _ a full
percentage point above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Net.Bank,  &LR; founded three years ago, doesn't charge fees on any
of its checking accounts, and it pays 3 percent annual interest on
even the tiniest checking balances.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank estimates that the average banking transaction on the
Internet costs it only 4 cents, compared with a typical cost of
$1.44 for a transaction done in person at a traditional bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to share much of that cost benefit with our
customers and still run a profitable banking operation,'' says D.R.
Grimes, Net.Bank's vice chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank is unusual among Internet-only banks because it is
entirely freestanding _ not owned by a larger financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
   WingspanBank.com, for example, is owned by Bank One Corp. of
Chicago, while Security First Network Bank is a subsidiary of the
Canadian Royal Bank Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hartz, Security's president, considers the affiliation with
a traditional bank helpful because it gives his bank credibility
among consumers. In addition, he says, Royal Bank provides Security
with ``knowledge of the industry and other synergistic benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from NetBank, there appear to be only two freestanding
Internet-only banks: CompuBank, based in Houston, and First
Internet Bank of Indiana, based in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank went public in 1997, and it has more than 45,000
customers and revenues of around $30 million annually. It has
reported small profits in each of the latest five quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The other Internet-only banks don't publish any financial
details, either because they are privately held or because they are
subsidiaries of other institutions and therefore don't have to
break out their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an Internet bank is freestanding or a subsidiary
shouldn't make any practical difference to customers.
</P>
<P>
   What really matters is whether a customer can earn more on
deposits or save more on fees by using an Internet-only bank _
quite likely in most cases _ and whether the Internet-only bank
provides good service.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors (www.gomez.com), a Massachusetts firm that ranks
online financial institutions, publishes ratings of 58 banks that
do business online.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes both Internet-only banks and traditional banks
that let their customers do at least some of their banking online.
</P>
<P>
   The bank Web sites are scored on a scale from zero to 10
according to such criteria as ease of use, quality of customer
relations and quality of online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez ranks Security First Network No.1 among all banks on the
Internet, giving it an overall score of 6.6. Net.Bank ranks third
at 6.13, CompuBank ninth at 5.75 and First Internet Bank of Indiana
10th at 5.69. WingspanBank.com, founded only a few months ago,
hasn't been rated yet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the traditional banks on the list, Wells Fargo ranks
second, Citibank fourth and Bank of America eighth.
</P>
<P>
   One useful feature of the Gomez site is a bulletin board where
customers sound off about their banks.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme is that it is hard to get satisfaction when
something goes wrong with your account. You can't walk down to the
nearest branch and grab the manager by the lapels.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent posting, a customer complained that he tried to
open an account with a virtual bank but that the bank lost $2,000
in money orders he sent as the initial deposit. Another customer
complained that his bank lets months go by without crediting him
with interest in his checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives say they are acutely aware of the potential for
service problems when bankers and customers never meet face to
face. They insist that they are doing all they can to prevent and
solve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have asked our customer-service representatives to put
themselves in the customer's shoes,'' says Jeff Unkle, vice
president for corporate affairs with WingspanBank.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a physical bank, we have 24-hour, seven-day access,
either by e-mail or you can pick up a phone and get a live person.
These people are going to work with you and make sure that whatever
the problem, it will be fixed in a way that is right for the
customer.''

 Microsoft Hablara Espanol  By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. is trying to cash in on the latest Latin craze. No,
not salsa dancing: Spanish-language Internet portal sites.
<P>
   The software giant yesterday said it would join with Mexico's
largest phone company, Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), to create a
new Web company that will deliver content and e-commerce services
to Spanish speakers across the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture _ which will have offices in Argentina, Chile,
Colombia, Central America, Mexico, Venezuela and the United States
_ combines Microsoft's Internet software and services, notably its
Microsoft Network online service, with Telmex's telecommunications
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be called MSN Prodigy. It has no relationship to
the Prodigy online service. No launch date has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Santillan, vice president of Microsoft's Mexican
operations, said the portal will provide Spanish-speaking consumers
with Microsoft's Internet e-mail and instant messaging services, as
well as news and entertainment content and online search and
shopping capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the individual services we plan to offer are already
available to Spanish-speaking consumers,'' he said. ``But we plan
to offer these services in a more comprehensive and integrated
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has its work cut out for it in Latin America. A slew
of Internet companies _ such as StarMedia Network, Yupi.com and
Quepasa.com, as well as Microsoft rivals America Online and Yahoo _
have already unveiled their own Spanish-language portals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is already saturated in terms of these general,
all-purpose Spanish-language sites,'' said Patrick Keane, an
analyst with Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. ``But
even though Microsoft is late to the game, you can never discount
them because of all the money and muscle they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet has been slow to catch on in Latin America.
Only 4.8 million Latinos, or 4 percent of all Internet users,
logged on last year, according to International Data Corp. And
Latin American e-commerce generated a paltry $167 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacles in Latin America are high Internet access
costs and poor infrastructure. Only 1 one  &LR; in 10 Latinos has a
phone line, and fewer still own a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have both a computer and a phone line must typically
pay about 10 times more than U.S. residents Americans &LR;   &LR; for
Internet access, largely due to shabby telecom networks in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and others remain undeterred. They cite Latin
America's burgeoning population, which is almost double that of the
United States, as well as a drop in computer prices and increased
Internet access in public schools, as reasons for jumping into the
market. The number of Latinos using the Internet is expected to
grow to 19.1 million by 2003, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Rios Drapkin, a business assistance manager at the
Spanish Speaking Unity Council in Oakland, said she is pleased to
see the rise of Spanish-language portals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites are useful to the community because they help
bridge the technological divide and let Latinos enter the
information age,'' she said. ``Up till now, there have mostly been
only English Web sites. That makes it more difficult for Spanish
speakers to get into computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 3 percent of all Web pages are in Spanish, according
to StarMedia.
</P>
<P>
   But Rios Drapkin warned that the new Microsoft site may not
succeed if it focuses too heavily on online shopping features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Spanish sites that allow people to get more
informed,'' she said. ``I'm not sure Latinos are looking to engage
in e-commerce. For the most part, Latinos like the idea of personal
relationships and buying goods from people they know.''

LEITER READY FOR HIS BIGGEST START  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Al Leiter looked perplexed and shook his head. The
pitcher who after each start remembers the nuance of almost every
pitch he throws, who can describe in minute detail the movement he
put on a ball, could not recall the only time he had pitched on
three days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt he will remember the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter will start Game 6 of the National League Championship
Series on Tuesday night after having pitched last Friday in Game 3.
The Mets, down by 3-2 in the series after two astonishing come from
behind victories at Shea Stadium over the weekend, will be facing
Kevin Millwood and attempting to become the first team in baseball
history to rebound from an 0-3 start and win a four-of-seven-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   They are placing the ball in the hand of a pitcher who is known
to like extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what?'' said Manager Bobby Valentine. ``There was no
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 116 best-of-seven series cpmbined in the League
Championship Series and the World Series and just 27 teams have won
four games in a row at any point in any series. The good news, if
you believe in this sort of karmic convergence, is that one of the
teams to do it was the 1969 Mets, who lost the first game of the
World Series and then beat Baltimore four in a row. They did that
after beating the Atlanta Braves in the League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Only four teams have lost a series after being up 2-0, as the
Braves once were in this series. One of those teams was the 1996
Braves, who led the Yankees in the World Series 2-0, only to lose
the next four.
</P>
<P>
   But let the giddiness induced by the exhaustion of Sunday's
extra-innings spellbinder wear off and the fact remains that the
Mets have won just once at Turner Field in two seasons. Though
Leiter may have done just fine the last time he threw on short rest
_ it was April 17, 1994 while with Toronto when he went 6 2/3
innings against the Angels and allowed three runs on six hits with
four walks and eight strikeouts _ he was just 28 years old then and
he had just come out of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has won some of the biggest games of the season for the
Mets. He stopped an eight-game losing streak by beating the Yankees
a day after three coaches were fired in June; he beat the Braves to
halt a seven-game dive last month that nearly cost the Mets a
playoff berth; he beat the Reds to secure the wild card spot two
weeks ago and he started the game in which the Mets clinched the
division series over the Diamondbacks nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter did not pitch one critical game, the final game of
the regular season against Pittsburgh, because Valentine had
reservations about using him with less rest than normal. Valentine
explained that when he had expanded the rotation to six pitchers
during the regular season, Leiter had told him he supported the
move because he felt better with extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Valentine thought Leiter would have to pitch a lot
of innings against Pittsburgh. Of course, Leiter had thrown just
104 pitches, not an alarming amount, in the start before then, just
one more than he threw against Atlanta in Game 3 last Friday. No
matter. Valentine was persuaded by his coaches to bring Leiter back
for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, whose start this would have been, was not really
an option, Valentine said, because he did not feel confident using
Leiter out of the bullpen if Rogers got in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to empty the tank,'' Valentine said of Leiter. ``I
think it's a good situation. It's the right time to go on less
rest. The adrenaline will help you and there is no thought in the
back of his mind about his next start. This is a leave it all on
the table effort. You win and we play again and then he's rested
for the next time. It's one time when he can let it all hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter certainly didn't look the least bit tired after the team
arrived at its hotel in the early evening. An ebullient sort,
Leiter is a bundle of twitches and tugs on the mound and he
possesses the boundless energy of a kid at Little League. He does
not expect to know what he can do until he warms up before Game 6,
when he will determine just how much velocity his fastball has and
how much he will have to use his breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He has scaled back his weightlifting in anticipation of this
start and he threw just 10 easy pitches in the bullpen during
Sunday's game, in case he was needed in relief. He knows he will
have to make adjustments to remain in a game against a team that
saw him so recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what Chipper knows,'' Leiter said. ``I know what Brian
Jordan wants. There are probably a few innings where I will come up
with something different. I think the emotion of what the game
means will elevate me in other ways to feel 100 percent. And what's
100 percent? There's always something this time of year. The last
game, I threw five or six changeups, so even if the gun doesn't
show 90 miles per hour, I can still get hitters out. Let's face it,
every player should let it all hang out. You have four months to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have had eight winning streaks of four games or more
and in one of them _ where they won five in a row from the last
weekend of the season to the first game of the division series _
the Mets were essentially facing elimination every day. It was
during that stretch that Leiter pitched his gem, a complete game
two-hit shutout of the Reds in Cincinnati to clinch a Mets trip to
the post-season for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, who is almost certain to be the catcher despite a
host of nicks and bruises, has detected recently in Leiter a marked
increase in aggressiveness. After struggling for much of a season
that left him with a 13-12 record and a 4.23 earned run average,
Leiter has dropped his earned run average to 1.47 over his last
four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I think he was pitching not to get hit,'' Piazza
said. ``You go through peaks and valleys when you become tentative
and you could see it. I don't know if it was nerves or
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter went home Friday night, after his error led to the
Atlanta's only run in a Mets loss that dropped them to 0-3 in the
series, he was not sure he'd have another start this season. ``I
was hoping,'' he said. Now, he has the biggest start. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to believe something crazy is happening,'' he said.
``There's a lot of reasons we shouldn't be here and you wonder why
we're still here. We've achieved an awful lot to get to Game 6 and
that's comforting. But to say `We're this close to the World
Series' puts the slightest pressure on me and that doesn't help me
throw a nice slider to Gerald Williams.'' &QL;

 PUC Charges Phone Firm With Cramming  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
State consumer officials have charged a Louisiana phone company
with fraud, alleging the firm bilked Californians out of more than
$5.5 million through illegal charges placed on customers' monthly
phone bills.
<P>
   Telmatch Telecommunications, a long-distance carrier, is being
accused by officials at the state Public Utilities Commission of
``cramming'' _ a scam in which a company places fraudulent charges
on a customer's phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the PUC say Telmatch used a sweepstakes to
get as many as 135,000 Californians to sign up for a pricey calling
card service that included a $4.33 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   They want the company to return at least $5.5 million to
Californians who were billed by Telmatch and are asking the PUC to
bar the company from doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
   PUC investigators, who began looking into allegations of fraud
after the commission was deluged with complaints from customers,
said this is one of the worst cases of cramming they have ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   They said many customers were unaware they were being charged
for a calling card, and some racked up hundreds of dollars in bills
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really disturbed not only because of the high dollar
amounts involved, but the number of customers affected,'' said Bill
Schulte, head of the PUC's consumer services division.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Telmatch insist the company did nothing wrong and
said all customers were informed about charges that would appear on
their monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   David Brownstein, an attorney for Telmatch, said the company is
being attacked because it used a controversial sweepstakes method
to sign up customers. Complaints about sweepstakes marketing
prompted legislation earlier this year that bans using prize entry
forms to secure a written order for a service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, Telmatch company  &LR; solicited customers by
getting them to enter a sweepstakes that offered a new car or
$25,000. Consumers filled out an entry form at fairs and shopping
malls and were entered into the drawing for a prize.
</P>
<P>
   But the forms also authorized Telmatch to send customers a
calling card that required customers make at least $4.06 per month
in calls. Even if customers did not use the card they were charged
the $4.06 minimum, plus a 27 cent monthly tax. The service also
included a one-time $4.96 activation fee.Calls made with the card
cost 25 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The recurring charges were placed on a customer's monthly
Pacific Bell or GTE local phone bill by billing agents who were
collecting money for Telmatch. Those billing agents are Hold
Billing Services, Billing Concepts, USBI and ZPDI.
</P>
<P>
   PUC officials said most customers who were billed told
investigators they had never received or used a calling card and
many told the PUC they had never authorized a calling card service.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they had never filled out a sweepstakes entry form,
while others said they had entered a contest but did not know they
were authorizing a calling card service.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were crammed,'' said Carol Dumond, an attorney at
the PUC who is leading the case against Telmatch. ``The sweepstakes
did not make it clear what people were signing up for. And when
they realized they were being billed, people who tried for months
to get those charges taken off their bills failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumond said Telmatch violated several state statutes, including
one that prohibits companies from signing customers to a service
without their consent. The commission staff has asked the PUC to
fine the company, force it to refund customers and revoke its
license to operate in the state.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to Telmatch's records, which show that less than 1
percent of the income Telmatch collects comes from actual
long-distance calls. According to data presented to the PUC,
Telmatch collected an average of $206,035 in a single month, but
only $1,073 came from long-distance charges made using the card.
The rest of the money came from ``miscellaneous charges,''
including an average of $152,806 from the minimum use fee.
</P>
<P>
   Brownstein said that information data  &LR; is misleading because
many customers made calls with the card that amounted to less than
$4.06. Those calls are not included in the money collected for the
minimum use fee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a series of hearings late last week, an administrative
law judge with the PUC issued an interim decision, saying, ``Good
cause exists to believe that a high portion of revenues ... result
from the unauthorized imposition of recurring monthly charges for a
calling card on California consumers' telephone bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph DeUlloa ordered the four billing companies to turn
over whatever funds they have collected for Telmatch. The money
would be kept in an escrow account and could be given back to
Californians if the PUC finds Telmatch guilty of cramming. The full
commission will vote on whether to approve DeUlloa's order at its
meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several customers who were billed by Telmatch said the
commission should force Telmatch to give refunds to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mitchell, an official with the Los Angeles Board of
Education, said at least two Los Angeles schools, including an
elementary school, were charged for the calling card service two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never authorized those charges,'' Mitchell said. ``It was
going on for a period of time and we were never reimbursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other customers who filled out an entry form said the
sweepstakes box did not make it clear that they would have to pay
for a calling card. And once the charges started appearing,
customers said, it was hard getting them removed.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Villegas-Borges, who lives in Hollister (San Benito County),
told investigators her husband entered to win a car at a swap meet
in San Jose but did not know there was any cost associated with it.
She said she had to call at least five different numbers to get the
charges removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disturbing that I had to spend a couple of hours taking
care of this problem,'' Villegas-Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownstein said customers should have been aware of what the
sweepstakes entailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a customer signed up, before there was any billing, they
would receive a big packet of information via first-class mail that
clearly explained the charges and there was text saying if there's
a mistake, if you want out, here's an 800 number to call,''
Brownstein said. ``Anytime a consumer called the company and said
`I didn't know I signed up for service,' they got cancellations
without questions, without hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Records filed with the PUC show that Telmatch's billing agents
have issued refunded to some customers who complained.
</P>
<P>
   One of the billing companies, Hold Billing Services, reported
collecting a total of $4,764,659 from Jan. 1, 1997, to April 22,
1999. During that same period, HBS issued refunds of $426,483 to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Telmatch, which is still providing service in the state, has
since stopped billing its customers in California.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Telmatch has run into problems.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Telmatch reached a settlement with North Carolina
over allegations of cramming related to the calling card program.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Telmatch, which denied wrongdoing,
agreed to provide refunds to customers and change its marketing
practices so it's clear what consumers are agreeing to when they
sign up for a calling card program or other phone service.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Paying Tax on Market Gains 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I am a 16-year-old who has just received $1,000 to invest in the
stock market. Do minors have to pay taxes when they make money in
the stock market?
<P>
   A: Not necessarily. Whether you are a minor or a major, it
depends on how much money you earn.
</P>
<P>
   To take the simplest case first, let's assume that you have no
other income. In that case, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman
Jesse Weller, if your dividends and capital gains from stock
investments total no more than $700 for the year, then the income
is tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   If you can make more than $700 in one year on a $1,000
investment, then I would like you to manage my money.
</P>
<P>
   Things can become more complicated if you also earn money from,
say, a part-time job. This is known as earned income, as
distinguished from stock-market dividends and capital gains, which
are considered unearned income.
</P>
<P>
   If your earned and unearned income combined are greater than
$700, any portion of your unearned income that exceeds $250 would
be subject to tax.
</P>
<P>
   For more details, get a copy of IRS Publication 929, ``Tax Rules
for Children and Dependents.'' You can download it from the IRS Web
site at www.irs.gov, or order by telephone at (800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Taking IRA Distributions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I rolled over my traditional individual retirement account to a
Roth IRA in June 1998. Then early this year, I rolled half of the
Roth back into a traditional IRA. I reached age 701/2 on September
28. Does this mean I have to begin taking distributions from the
traditional IRA this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tax law requires you to begin taking distributions from
whatever traditional IRAs you hold by April of the year following
the year in which you reach age 701/2. Therefore, you don't have to
start taking distributions this year.
</P>
<P>
   As you may know, you are never required to take distributions
from a Roth IRA, no matter what your age. In fact, you can continue
to contribute to a Roth at age 701/2 and up.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you want to avoid taking distributions, you could roll
the balance of your traditional IRA into a Roth. You can do this
one more time under current tax rules. But if you try the switching
maneuver again after that, you may be subject to a tax penalty. I
say ``may'' because the IRS hasn't said what the rules will be
beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
   You are one of many IRA holders who have switched back and forth
between Roths and traditional IRAs. This was particularly common
last year. The switchers were smart enough to realize that they
could save on taxes after the stock market took a sharp dip during
the late summer and early fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's because when they switched into Roths originally, they
were required to pay taxes on the value of the assets in their
traditional IRAs at that time. When the value of these assets
declined after the switch to the Roth, they were permitted to annul
the tax consequences of the switch by transferring the assets back
to traditional IRAs. If they then switched back to Roths again,
they were required to pay taxes only on the lower asset values
resulting from the stock-market decline.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to and fro became so hot and heavy last year that
financial institutions that sponsor IRAs raised Cain with the tax
authorities, complaining that the paperwork was overwhelming them.
The IRS then issued a temporary regulation restricting the number
of switches.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to wait and see what they come up with next.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tokyo Stock Quotes
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get quotes on Tokyo Stock Exchange stocks during
trading hours? Can it be done on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can do it easily enough if you have access to the
proprietary terminal from Bloomberg News. Bloomberg also can tell
you just about anything else you need to know about investing, 24
hours a day, but you will have to pay upwards of $1,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
   A less-costly method, says Jim Bogin, portfolio manager of the
Matthews Japan Fund in San Francisco, is to go to the Yahoo Japan
Web page at www.yahoo.co.jp. However to proceed from there, you
will either have to know how to read Japanese characters or have
someone with you who can read them.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Japanese stock market is open from 5:30 p.m. to
11 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. Are you sure you want to stay up
that late?

 Cell Genesys OKs Buyout in Latest Biotech Merger  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Cell Genesys of Foster City said yesterday that it had accepted a
$350 million buyout offer from Genzyme Corp. of Massachusetts,
becoming the latest local biotech firm to surrender to an industry
merger trend.
<P>
   The stock-swap transaction, which is subject to regulatory and
shareholder approval, valued Cell Genesys at $10 a share, although
the value of the merger could dip if Genzyme's stock price falls
below $31.50.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme lost 8 percent, or $3.06 yesterday, to close at $35.31,
as Genzyme revealed that the proposed acquisition would dilute its
earnings by 10 percent in 2000. Cell Genesys, which ended Friday at
$7 per share, gained $1.38 to close at $8.38 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys is joining a string of local biotech firms,
including Alza Corp., Sugen Inc. and Genentech, to be acquired by
larger companies from outside the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone interview, Genzyme Executive Vice President
Peter Wirth said Genzyme would keep Cell Genesys' 115-person staff
and use its new acquisition as a West Coast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotechnology is definitely a bicoastal industry, with
distinct academic communities with different strengths,'' Wirth
said. ``We have strong links to the East Coast community, and we
think this acquisition will help us gain entree to the biotech
talent on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Wirth predicted investors would warm up to the deal, which would
give Genzyme access to Cell Genesys' 200-plus patents in the broad
field of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its patent portfolio, Cell Genesys brings about
$60 million in cash to the deal, along with a $130 million stake in
Abgenix, another Bay Area biotech firm. Cell Genesys spun off
Abgenix in 1996 and kept a 22 percent ownership in its offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jim McCamant, with the Medical Technology Stock Letter
in Berkeley, called the deal ``a coup'' for Genzyme, which picked
up a powerful portfolio for a net cost of $160 million _ once Cell
Genesys' liquid assets are subtracted from the sales price. He
professed surprise that Cell Genesys was willing to be acquired for
such a modest premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this goes to show is that biotech execs are just tired of
getting out there and raising money,'' he said. ``There's not the
ego and resistance to a good offer like there used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys CEO Stephen Sherwin said his company's cash
position would have enabled it to remain independent but said the
huge cost of bringing drugs to market made it more sensible to
accept a merger offer. Cell Genesys has consistently lost money,
whereas Genzyme had net income of $101 million on sales of $673
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have access to capital that we simply wouldn't have as
a small biotech company,'' Sherwin said. ``Ultimately, this will be
a good deal for our shareholders.''

FRANCE TELECOM TO BUY GERMAN CARRIER STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ France Telecom SA began a frontal attack
Monday on its former partner, Deutsche Telekom AG of Germany,
agreeing to pay about $8 billion for a controlling stake in
Germany's third-largest mobile telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at France Telecom said that was just the beginning.
The French telephone company said it planned to compete against
Deutsche Telekom in fixed-line services and Internet access as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the deal announced Monday sets the stage for a
confrontation across Europe. Since July, the French and German
companies have both made big acquisitions in Britain and have vowed
to build pan-European networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider that we are intimately hostile toward each
other,'' said Eric Bouvier, a senior vice president at France
Telecom. ``We're just competitors, but we're the two largest
competitors in the European market.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement was a coup for France Telecom, which has
been looking at ways to attack the German market ever since its
alliance with Deutsche Telekom essentially collapsed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had
scrupulously avoided attacking each other's markets and were
partners in Global One, a joint venture with Sprint Corp. that
provided services to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   But that partnership abruptly went cold when Deutsche Telekom
infuriated the French by trying to acquire Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   The last remnant of the partnership unraveled earlier this
month, when MCI Worldcom reached a deal to acquire Sprint for $108
billion.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom will be buying out the stakes that both France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had in Sprint, and withdrawing from
Global One.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Monday, France Telecom will acquire 60
percent of the E-Plus wireless telephone network from two major
German utility companies, Veba and RWE.
</P>
<P>
   The former French monopoly had already signaled its intentions
several weeks ago when it agreed to pay $1.86 billion for a 17
percent stake in E-Plus sold by Vodafone Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to acquire a controlling stake was largely a
result of lucky timing. Veba wanted to sell its stake in E-Plus,
because it planned to merge with another utility, Viag, which
controls Germany's fourth and smallest mobile network.
</P>
<P>
   RWE, based in Essen, wanted to sell its stake as part of a
broader plan to finance big acquisitions in its core business,
electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
   Both the French and German telephone companies have been looking
for deals on the Continent. Though Deutsche Telekom's bid for
Telecom Italia failed, the German company won an auction in August
to acquire the British wireless carrier, One-2-One, for $11
billion.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, the French got more for their money with
E-Plus in Germany than the Germans got in Britain. Douglas Wight,
an industry analyst for Commerzbank in London, said the French
price worked out to about $200 for each potential customer while
the German price worked out to about $230.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Deutsche Telekom has no real presence in France,
Europe's second-biggest market after Germany. It is also out of the
Italian market.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom, meanwhile, has built up a significant presence
outside of France and Germany. In the Netherlands, it owns a
controlling stake in the Dutchtone mobile telephone service as well
as all of a Dutch cable operator called Casema. It is also the
controlling shareholder of a telephone company in Spain, a mobile
telephone service in Belgium and has an assortment of other
holdings in central Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ever since the end of the Cold War, Europe's fragmented
military industry has come to resemble a ponderous mating rite in
which the surprises came not so much from the urge to consolidate
as from the partners ticking the dance card.
</P>
<P>
   The newest, unexpected coupling came last week when
DaimlerChrysler AG of Germany and Aerospatiale Matra SA of France
agreed to merge. With annual sales of $22 billion, the cross-border
European behemoth would rank as the world's third-largest aerospace
company after Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of this new combination raised a tantalizing
question about the destiny of Europe's other military mammoth _
British Aerospace PLC, which, last January, sprang its own surprise
with a $12.7 billion takeover of British General Electric Co.'s
Marconi Electronics defense and missile business.(British General
Electric Co. is not linked to the U.S. company of the same name.)
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the question was: Did the Franco-German deal leave
British Aerospace as the wallflower of European defense?
</P>
<P>
   Ask the company and the answer is simple enough. ``We don't
think we are isolated,'' said Mike Peters, a spokesman. ``This
further consolidates the industry in Europe and we welcome that. We
expect further moves in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask just about anyone else, though, and the responses are far
more complicated, reflecting the tangle of interests surrounding an
industry that, like the U.S. military business in the early 1990s,
is being pushed to consolidate by overcapacity and shrinking
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The European military business, moreover, is one in which
jealous governments have traditionally held sway as both political
masters and major customers. And it is laboring now under the
uneasy sense that its very fragmentation creates a huge obstacle to
the kind of military capability sought by those same governments to
build a military arm within the NATO alliance for the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo conflict was a real wake-up call because it proved
that the fragmentation of the European industry was giving even
less capability than the spending would suggest,'' said John Dowdy,
a European aerospace and military specialist at the McKinsey
management consultancy here.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace, of course, would argue that it has been at
the forefront of efforts to draw Europe into a cohesive military
business. Its actions have not always been seen that way.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, when it announced its merger with Marconi,
creating an all-British leviathan with annual sales of more than
$20 billion, the deal scuppered negotiations with DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace to build a cross-border, European concern. And, in the
process, British Aerospace outbid a French contender, Thomson-CSF,
for Marconi.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Alex Ashbourne, a European military analyst with the
Center for European Reform, created ``fairly bad blood between the
U.K., France and Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Ashbourne said, last week's shake-up in European
defense _ now essentially reduced to two big companies with sales
ranking them among the world's major players _ could well propel
British Aerospace to seek an American partner.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean, she said, that ``British Aerospace will bypass
some of the European consolidation to go trans-Atlantic.'' A likely
deal, she reckoned, was a combination of British Aerospace with
Boeing's McDonnell Douglas military aircraft division. British
Aerospace, said Peters, the company spokesman, already has joint
ventures with both Boeing and Lockheed, but he declined to comment
on talk of a merger, saying it was speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The European military industry is tangled in structure. ``It's
like a bowl of spaghetti,'' said Dowdy, the McKinsey analyst.
Companies are linked ``by program, by sector. All are related in
some way or other.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Ashbourne said such are the existing ties between
various European contractors that British Aerospace ``can't really
afford'' to have the new Franco-German giant ``as an arch-enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace, for instance, is linked with Matra of France
in a sophisticated missiles project whose potential customers
include the four European air forces backing the Eurofighter
warplane _ Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. And DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace of Germany, in turn, has a 43 percent stake in the
Eurofighter project.
</P>
<P>
   More troublesome still, British Aerospace builds the wings for
the European Airbus Industrie civilian airliner consortium in which
the newly created Franco-German aerospace giant now controls some
80 per cent, leaving British Aerospace with an uncomfortable
minority holding of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And, to round the circle, Airbus is in ferocious competition
with Boeing, raising speculation that British Aerospace wants to
shed its stake in Airbus to make way for a trans-Atlantic deal with
Boeing focusing on military aircraft construction. That would
happen only after the Airbus consortium itself is reorganized as a
more conventional company _ a process that British Aerospace hopes
will accelerate as a result of last week's deal.
</P>
<P>
   For all the European defense contractors, the U.S. industry,
with its huge budgets and research projects, remains the ultimate
lure. U.S. military spending is double the entire European outlay
and U.S. military research is three times greater than the European
equivalent. British Aerospace has never made a secret of its desire
to deal with American companies from what it calls a position of
equality, as it made clear after the Marconi deal last January.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by some accounts, it is in a position to pursue U.S. or
European deals.

VOTE IS SET ON CAMPAIGN-FINANCE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, in a landmark vote Tuesday, could
change the way US political campaigns are waged and funded.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes, aimed at reducing the influence of big money in
elections, would be unlikely to achieve the goal, lawmakers on both
sides of the high-stakes debate said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a scaled-down plan to overhaul the nation's campaign
finance system, the Senate could vote to ban the raising and
spending of the unlimited and largely unregulated contributions
known as soft money that were linked to the worst fund-raising
abuses in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition would take effect as soon as President Clinton
signed the bill into law, although the controversial measure is
given little chance of reaching his desk in the face of a
Republican-led filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money accounts for as much as half the estimated $800
million that national parties plan to raise and spend in the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But by stripping the parties of soft money, Congress could
create the ``unintended consequence'' of triggering a proliferation
of spending by independent advocacy groups intent on influencing
the nation's elections, according to senators on both sides of the
issue. Those ad campaigns would not be regulated by federal
election laws.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be ``a national political debate fought by
surrogates,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who
heads the Senate Democratic election committee. ``Over our heads
will be a far larger contest fought by the AFL-CIO, the Christian
Coalition, antiabortion groups, chemical companies, automobile
companies and steel companies that will spend millions, if not
hundreds of millions, of dollars on advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure's chief sponsors _ Senators John McCain, an Arizona
Republican, and Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat _ said
they settled on the soft-money ban because they believed they would
be unable to garner the 60 votes needed to break a GOP filibuster
on a more comprehensive plan to overhaul the campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   The broader plan would ban soft money and restrict the so-called
``issue advocacy'' spending that lawmakers predicted would mushroom
under the McCain-Feingold measure. The House voted 252-177 last
month to approve the more sweeping proposal, sponsored by
Representatives Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, and
Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, like many other advocates for changing the way elections
are financed, said the soft-money ban alone would mark progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the soft-money bill passes without reining in sham
issue ads, then all the money from corporations and wealthy
individuals that went to the parties will be funneled to outside
groups to do those sham ads,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of it, predicted Anthony Corrado, a government professor
at Colby College in Maine who specializes in campaign finance. He
said many corporate leaders and wealthy individuals who have
contributed massive amounts of soft money in recent years have done
so only at the prompting of party officials and have expressed
little desire to give to other entities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you adopt the ban, a significant amount of money
now being funneled into the system will dry up,'' Corrado said.
``There may be some movement toward the issue ads by organized
interests, say from the tobacco companies and some of the
ideological groups. But, overall, it would be a step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In a major showdown Tuesday, the Senate will consider whether to
end the Republican filibuster and permit final votes on both the
McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan measures. A majority of senators
have expressed support for both bills, but they remain several
votes short of the 60 needed to cut off the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two alternatives, however, the McCain-Feingold bill is
considered more likely to pick up the GOP votes needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who favors the Shays-Meehan alternative,
said the McCain-Feingold measure could be broadened in a
House-Senate conference committee to iron out differences between
the competing versions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House could also play a role in the conference
committee, although Clinton's influence could be diminished amid
his budget standoff with GOP congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the McCain-Feingold measure remains the best hope for
progress among advocates of overhauling the election system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly incremental, but it's a critically important
increment,'' said Ellen Miller, executive director of Public
Campaign, which advocates public funding of elections. ``No
campaign-finance reform deserves the name `reform' if it doesn't
shut down soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the pursuit of soft money in 1996 that prompted President
Clinton to open the White House for major party donors to sleep in
the Lincoln Bedroom and sip coffee in the Roosevelt Room. The
Democratic Party accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars that
year in soft money from allegedly illegal foreign sources,
including $366,00 that was raised by a party operative, Johnny
Chung, with ties to China.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the soft-money scandal, Senator Susan M. Collins,
a Maine Republican, quoted Chung as saying, ``I see the White House
is like a subway. You have to put in the coins to open the gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of changing the campaign finance system argued that
current law already prohibits the alleged abuses that occurred in
1996, and they asserted that further restricting soft-money giving
would be tantamount to violating free speech.

JAMES E. WILLIAMS, MUCH-DECORATED NAVAL HERO, DIES AT 68  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Fla., N.C., Vietnam, Korea)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James E. Williams, who as a patrol-boat commander in the Vietnam
War won the Medal of Honor and became one of the most highly
decorated sailors in Navy history, died Wednesday at a hospital in
Florence, S.C. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who lived in Palm Coast, Fla., suffered a heart attack
while visiting family members, his wife, Elaine, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1966, Petty Officer Williams was a year away
from retiring, having served 19 years as a Navy enlisted man. But
he volunteered for combat in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had experience in small boats, and he knew he could lead
young Americans in combat,'' recalled the retired Rear Adm. Morton
Toole, who commanded the patrol-boat division in which Williams
served.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing patrols in the Mekong Delta from April 1966 to April
1967, Williams won the Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, two Silver
Stars, the Legion of Merit, three Bronze Stars, and the Navy
Commendation Medal. He also received three Purple Hearts and was
twice awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for rescue operations
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of Williams' gunners, Rubin Binder, recalled being ``19
years old and scared to death,'' only to be steadied by the veteran
boatswain's mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a rock,'' Binder said. ``When he said he was going
to do something, he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   A petty officer would normally take charge of a single patrol
boat. But Williams was given responsibility for two-boat patrols
and the authority to call in helicopter and artillery assistance
because, his former commanding officer, Fred McDavitt, said,
``Williams was superior from the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   James Elliott Williams, a native of Rock Hill, S.C., first saw
combat in the Korean War. He was assigned to a destroyer, but was
detached to take raiding parties into North Korea on small boats.
</P>
<P>
   During the Vietnam War, he received the Medal of Honor for what
Binder remembers as ``an incredible firefight'' the night of Oct.
31, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams' two-boat patrol was attacked by two sampans, he
ordered return fire that killed the crew of one enemy boat and sent
the other fleeing to an inlet. In continuing the counterattack, he
exposed himself to fire from snipers along the river bank and from
a large concentration of enemy boats that joined the battle.
</P>
<P>
   When darkness arrived, he ordered his patrol boats' searchlights
turned on to illuminate the enemy positions, although that made his
own boats easier targets, and he moved close to shore to press the
attack. The two American boats destroyed 65 enemy boats and
inflicted many casualties in a battle that lasted three hours and
left Williams with a wound near his right kidney.
</P>
<P>
   He was presented with the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B.
Johnson on May 14, 1968, at a Pentagon ceremony. A burly man,
5-foot-8 and 210 pounds, Williams had a physique that impressed the
president, who asked, ``How'd you get that big neck?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was appointed U.S. marshal for South Carolina in 1969
by President Richard M. Nixon and served more than a decade in the
Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, James
Jr., of Darlington, S.C.; Steven, of Dorchester, S.C.; and Charles,
of Charlotte, N.C.; two daughters, Debbie Clark, of Palm Coast, and
Gail Patterson, of Florence; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after Williams' death, President Clinton
praised him for ``extraordinary bravery in combat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams did not covet publicity. He turned down offers for
a movie based on his Medal of Honor exploits, feeling too much
dramatic license would be taken. As he said in an interview with
The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, S.C., in 1990: ``If
you're not going to tell the truth about that battle, then it ain't
worth telling.''

   RUSSIA: ZHIRINOVSKY CAN RUN
</P>
<P>
   The Central Election Commission ruled that candidates aligned
with the Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky can take part in
the coming parliamentary elections. Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic Party was disqualified after the commission ruled that
two leading party members had misrepresented their assets. To
satisfy the commission, Zhirinovsky formed a new bloc with two

OLD TREATIES SHOW SIGNS OF FRAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since 1945, only months after the United States
dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, world leaders have
sought to halt the use and spread of nuclear weapons with the
deterrence of treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those treaties are in danger of falling apart, say a range
of arms control specialists. Some in Congress, mostly Republicans,
are arguing for the breakup of some of the treaties, saying their
Cold War terms are outdated and put America at risk.
</P>
<P>
   With the US Senate's rejection last week of the test ban treaty
as well as US talks with Russia about reopening terms of the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty, many nonproliferation analysts
believe such US moves could create a domino effect and jeopardize
all the treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel it already,'' said Joseph Cirincione, director of
the nonproliferation project at Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, a Washington think tank. ``In the
interconnected framework of treaties and agreements, if you take
one of the key elements out, you risk the whole structure and it
could collapse. That's what's happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione and other arms control specialists, as well some
Clinton administration officials, see several possible grim
consequences ahead.
</P>
<P>
   They foresee Russia abandoning all talks on cutbacks of weapons.
They predict nonnuclear states, especially some in Asia such as
Japan, will reevaluate whether to acquire nuclear weapons. Many
also forecast new nuclear tests by India, prompted by the Pakistan
military coup, and politically more easily undertaken in the wake
of the US Senate rejection of a test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to control nuclear weapons began in the ashes of
World War II, when the leaders of the United States, United Kingdom
and Canada called for ``entirely eliminating the use of atomic
power for destructive purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   It took 23 years for world powers to sign the Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and from that trunk grew branches of bilateral deals
between the United States and Soviet Union known best by acronym:
SALT, ABM, START.
</P>
<P>
   Nonproliferation efforts flourished even as the Cold War faded,
reaching out to include biological and chemical weapons treaties
and the comprehensive test ban treaty, signed by President Clinton
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks and months, the long unhappiness over the
treaties in the United States burst open.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican drive against ratification of the test-ban
treaty and the Clinton administration's negotiations with the
Russians about instituting a system of missile defense share one
common theme: a belief the treaties don't best serve American
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from partisan motivations, several moderate Republicans
believed the test-ban treaty turns the US aging stockpile of
nuclear missiles into an increasingly unreliable arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Both liberals and conservatives favor rewriting the 27-year-old
ABM treaty, which prohibits widespread deployment of missile
defense, because of emerging threats from unpredictable regimes
such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Said centrist Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut
Democrat, Monday: ``The treaties that were negotiated in a context
of a two-power, bipolar Cold War world have less relevance. They're
outdated. The ABM treaty is the best example of that. The danger
now is more from rogue nations, and we're trying to convince the
Russians they should have equal concern about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Floyd D. Spence, a South Carolina Republican and
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a hearing
last week that the missile defense system should be a national
priority. He said the ABM treaty was ``designed to perpetuate
Americans' vulnerabilty to missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have been lulled into a false sense of security by
either a belief that we already have the defense or by assertions
that the ballistic missile threat to our country is decades away,''
he said. ``The reality is that America is vulnerable to this threat
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton said last Thursday in a news conference, changing any
of the nonproliferation treaties risks new dangers. One is a
possible negative reaction from Russia. Another is China's
response, and whether Russia and China would move closer together
if the United States deploys a missile defense that could be
interpreted in Moscow and Beijing as protection from Russian and
Chinese missiles, not just those from Iran or North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another threat, which could become glaringly apparent next
spring when more than 180 nations review the Non-Proliferation
Treaty, is whether all the countries that have sworn against
building a nuclear bomb keep that promise. Only eight nations now
have nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said work on missile defense _ including a successful
test earlier in the month of an interceptor system _ has been
encouraging. ``If we have the potential to protect our people
against missiles that could be loaded with nuclear weapons or
chemical or biological weapons, coming at us from other countries,
. . . it would be the responsible thing to try to deploy such a
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, any such system, even a ground-based one,
would violate the literal terms of the ABM Treaty. Now, there are
people in the United States Congress who would like to just tear up
the ABM Treaty and go on. I think that would be a terrible
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials have offered to help Russia build a large missile
tracking radar if Moscow agrees to renegotiate the ABM pact. But
Russia has reacted icily to any proposed change. Colonel General
Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's strategic missile
forces, said only two weeks ago that any change could trigger a
Cold War-style arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that a missile defense system would prompt other
nations to add offensive firepower, enabling them to overwhelm a
defensive system in order to keep the balance of power intact.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Z. Collina, director of arms control for the Cambridge-based
Union of Concerned Scientists, said the United States needs ``some
world view that balances all these threats'' and should actively
use diplomacy to reduce the threats. He feared that the focus on
perceived threats from long-range ballistic missiles from North
Korea and Iran had caused some to overlook danger in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the administration should want to do is pull
out of a treaty with Russia,'' Collina said Monday. But he said
that could happen in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a train wreck in the making,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
there is a ``pretty active front'' among US and Russian officials
talking about reopening the ABM treaty terms. But he said if
Russians ultimately reject any missile defense system, a
confrontation is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is if they don't renegotiate, we have hardliners
in Congress who will want to dump ABM, and we may be going forward
without the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   The official acknowledged the administration also will have
little diplomatic leverage in case nonnuclear states opt to leave
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Said the official: ``We have lost the moral high ground.''

LAWMAKERS REJECT CLINTON CHANGES TO FINANCE-OVERHAUL BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers in the Senate and House Monday night
moved toward completion of a bill overhauling the nation's
financial system that failed to satisfy President Clinton's
concerns about adequately protecting consumers and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers were expected to work through the night on the
legislation in a joint House-Senate Conference Committee. While a
compromise between the Republicans and the White House was not out
of the question, the initial votes taken by early evening included
the rejection of an amendment, supported by Clinton's aides, that
would have strengthened the privacy rights of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments' defeat dimmed the prospects that Congress and
the White House would be able to reach an accommodation over the
measure
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had said that Clinton would veto the
measure because it both failed to protect the privacy of consumers
of large financial conglomerates and it diluted the provisions of a
1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in lending.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, different versions of which have already been
adopted by the House and the Senate, would repeal more than 60
years of laws that have restricted the cross-ownership of banks,
insurers and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   For months Clinton has appeared to make the privacy and
discrimination issues a central policy focus of the debate over the
legislation. He has suggested that he viewed those issues as more
important than the issues that have driven the legislation and are
of greatest interest to the industry _ the repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and other barriers to competition.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the administration's interest in the issues reflected
the view that Americans are more concerned with privacy and
discrimination than the nuances of bank regulation, even though
three powerful industries _ banks, securities and insurance _ have
lobbied heavily for the legislation, pouring more money into
lobbying and campaign contributions than at any time in modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening the lawmakers defeated a measure, largely on
partisan lines, that was sponsored by Rep. Ed Markey, D- Mass.,
that would have permitted consumers to block their banks from
sharing private information with either affiliated companies like
insurers or brokerage houses or with third parties such as
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lobbyists from the financial services industry lined
the basement hallways of the Capitol building Monday afternoon as
the conference committee neared completion of its work. The
industry had uniformly lobbied against increasing the privacy
protections of consumers, maintaining that any barriers preventing
the affiliates of financial service conglomerates from sharing
customer information and marketing would defeat the purposes of
such combinatons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment would place unworkable and inappropriate limits
on sharing of information between commonly owned affiliates,'' said
a letter sent to the lawmakers by trade groups for the securities,
insurance and banking industries. ``Our associations will find it
necessary to oppose any legislation'' that adopted such amendments,
adding that there were consumer benefits derived from affiliates
that shared customer information and were able to market more
services.
</P>
<P>
   Those contentions drew sharp criticism from the Democrats who
had supported the Markey proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen all the fat cat lobbyists in their $1,000 suits
outside looking very, very happy,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
``They're about to get everything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Markey measure failed on an 18-to-12 vote that
largely followed party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The vote suggested that partisan politics might play a stront,
and possibly fatal role in decideing the measure outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, there was no sign of any significant
compromise by either the White House or the Republican leadership,
particularly in the Senate. But the lawmakers were not expected to
begin a series of important votes until late in the evening on the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which prohibits discrimination
in lending. Those votes may ultimately determine the bill's fate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Community Reinvestment Act is not a significant issue
for most bankers, Sen. Phil Gramm has made it an issue in the
legislation. Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the Senate
Banking Committee, has criticized the act for adding undue burdens
on many financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The measure before the conference committee was written by Gramm
and two other Republicans, Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa and Rep. Tom
Bliley of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 85 percent of the nation's banks and savings
associations, it would decrease the number of times that their
lending records are reviewed to see if they have complied with the
Community Reinvestment Act _ to once every five years from once a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, who has not generally spoken on the
legislation, issued a statement expressing his commitment ``to
insuring that CRA remains strong and is not weakened.''

 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seventeen cases of syphilis. More than 50 teenagers
experimenting with group sex. At least 200 middle and high
schoolers exposed to sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   And the behavior that created the problem may still be going on.
</P>
<P>
   That's what TV viewers will see and hear tonight in ``The Lost
Children of Rockdale County,'' a PBS ``Frontline'' documentary that
explores an outbreak of syphilis among area teenagers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the cases at the time,
but the discovery came when Atlanta was gearing up for the
Olympics. So, to many area residents, the report of the syphilis
outbreak will still come as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   So will many of the moments captured by filmmakers Rachel
Dretzin Goodman and Barak Goodman, who lived in Conyers, Ga., for
five months. Several teens, all identified by first name only,
describe in graphic detail a largely hidden world of reckless teen
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One girl, 15 at the time of the outbreak, compares the spread of
syphilis to ``the cooties game little kids play.'' Another, 15 now,
stacks up cuddly stuffed animals to demonstrate a sexual position.
And one 14-year-old boy, whom the film places at the center of the
group of teens, says: ``I didn't really want to be notorious. I
wanted to be popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale residents already know the shock a wider audience will
likely feel. Those who lived through the syphilis outbreak and its
soul-searching, finger-pointing aftermath are wincing in
apprehension at the harsh national attention the program could
bring. Some hope, once the impact fades, the exposure of their
community's secrets will underline a lesson the ordeal taught them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need parenting,'' said Cynthia Noel, a county public
health nurse who treated most of those infected. ``They want a
family, they want rules, they want someone to be in charge. If they
can't get that attention from their parents, they will seek it
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockdale outbreak surfaced in two places almost
simultaneously in the late spring of 1996. At the county health
department, Noel was encountering students from the three local
high schools. All had similar symptoms of sexually transmitted
diseases, and most had similar stories of how they might have
contracted them.
</P>
<P>
   At Memorial Middle School, counselor Peggy Cooper was hearing
identical stories: teens having sex with multiple partners at home
after school and before parents came home, and sleepovers where
imitating sexually explicit movie scenes on cable was the chief
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the health department I thought we had a problem,''
said Cooper, a grandmother who had also worked at Rockdale County
High School. ``Some of my girls were coming to me with deep
uncomfortableness. They were scared, and they wanted an adult to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The state and county investigation that Noel and Cooper
triggered turned up jaw-dropping findings. Rockdale's teens were
infecting each other with chlamydia, herpes and human papilloma
virus, the cause of genital warts and occasionally of cervical
cancer. And 17 had syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   That was unheard of. Syphilis was once as feared as smallpox;
left untreated, it can cause miscarriage, sterility and madness.
But public health campaigns have pursued it so aggressively that
there were fewer than 7,000 cases in the United States last year.
It is overwhelmingly a disease of poverty and poor health care _
not of affluent suburban teens with SUVs and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   (Among students the same ages as those in the Rockdale outbreak,
sexual activity itself among younger teens _ let alone sexually
transmitted diseases _ is not common. A 1994 study by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute found that 71 percent of students nationwide
had sex before they graduated from high school -_ but less than 10
percent of 12-year-olds and less than 30 percent of 15-year-olds
had.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What lit this up for us (was) syphilis had occurred in a
community where you never see syphilis,'' said Dr. Kathleen Toomey,
Georgia's director of public health. ``It allowed us to be aware of
the high-risk behaviors among these teens in Rockdale.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the investigation concluded, seasoned public health
investigators trained not to be judgmental would be startled by
what they found. There were 14-year-olds who had had up to 50
sexual partners, sixth-graders competing for the sexual attention
of high school students, girls in sexual scenes with three boys at
once. In one case, according to the film, a girl at a party with
30-40 teens volunteered to have sex with all the boys there _ and
did. ``My heart dropped,'' Cooper said. ``I felt nauseated. I
wanted to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some drug use, and significant amounts of alcohol.
Surprisingly, there were only a few pregnancies, possibly because
multiple infections impaired the girls' fertility. ``I have worked
in the STD field for many, many years,'' said Toomey, who was state
epidemiologist in 1996 and oversaw the investigation. ``I had never
encountered anything of these dimensions of sexual activity, of
this high risk, among teens this young and in this kind of a
population.''
</P>
<P>
   One other factor linked many of the Rockdale students, the
investigators said: Parents were unaware of what was going on. By
law, minors who seek help in a public health clinic are treated as
adults and accorded doctor-patient confidentiality. Thus the
investigators were unable to contact parents directly, though they
urged the kids to involve their parents, and many did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a lot of lack of communication between children and
parents,'' Noel said. ``Some didn't know their kids were sexually
active. Some, even when presented with evidence, refused to believe
it. One woman cussed me out and said she knew her child was a
virgin, until I had to say no, her child was pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between Rockdale's parents and teens is a central
theme in tonight's film. The Goodmans, longtime ``Frontline''
producers, found only four parents who would appear on camera.
Identified only by first name, they talk with anxious smiles that
seem pleas for understanding about their inability to understand or
control their kids.
</P>
<P>
   None of the teens or parents who appear in the film would agree
to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   On camera, one mother says of her then-18-year-old daughter, ``I
got to the point where it's easier for me to let (her) go do what
she wants instead of standing there fussing and fighting with
her.'' In another scene, a mother and her 15-year-old daughter _
who lost her virginity at 12 when, she says in the film, she got
drunk, blacked out and woke to find she had been raped _ assemble
dinner together, but eat it in separate rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The girl _ who was not part of the syphilis cluster, according
to the ``Frontline'' staff _ had a wild early adolescence,
drinking, taking drugs and experimenting sexually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took more of the blame than I gave her, definitely _ her or
the guy, because I realized I was not the parent I should be,'' the
mother says on camera. ``She kept getting worse. And once I took
control, she has done so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, viewed the documentary before its broadcast so she could
serve as part of a panel discussion following the film tonight.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Lost Children' is an appropriate title,'' she said,
``but mine would be, `Where Are the Adults?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the investigators found, the adults were pursuing
their own agendas. Many worked long hours _ often, ironically, to
fund their kids' label-conscious clothing and consumer goods. Some
had allowed their kids to move out _ in one case, into a pool house
behind the family home _ or to live with family friends.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper coached her students in how to approach their parents
with news of their sexual activity, in some cases allowing them to
use her office so she could stand by as the child's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some chewed the child out. Some said, `Oh, I knew something
was wrong,' '' she recalled. ``But the first one who shocked me
said, `I can't have my daughter at home all weekend. I need to
date, too. I need her to spend the night with her friends sometime'
_ even though she knew her daughter was going to a house (where
teens were watching) the Playboy Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast adrift by their parents, the Rockdale teens struggled for a
niche, or even a gathering place, in a suburb that lacked both a
town square and a mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a community where privacy leads to isolation for some of
the adolescents,'' said Claire Sterk, an Emory University
anthropologist who helped the state health department investigate
the teens' behavior. ``So they find each other and create their own
things to do. I don't think sexuality was even what they had in
mind, originally; that in itself was a symptom of what was lacking
in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The film captures the teens of Conyers on an average evening.
Chased out of the bowling alley and the movies, they end up
congregating in strip-mall parking lots and in the playground of a
McDonald's. Some are drinking on camera, and all the girls are
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a portrait of a toxic community: Syphilis, smoking,
alcohol and media, and these kids are out in it by themselves for
hours at a time,'' said Brown, the mother of three teenage
daughters. ``The more poisonous the culture, the more adolescents
need their parents to be present to filter it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the syphilis outbreak was recognized, the state and
local health departments hosted a town meeting to air community
concerns. Both attendance and reaction left the investigators
surprised and pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like, we gave a party, and no one came,'' Noel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Toomey presented the results of the investigation, most notably
a chart that showed how many sexual contacts the 17 confirmed
syphilis cases had shared. A gasp went up when she projected the
spider-web pattern. But in the discussion that followed, ``there
was a desperate searching to find an external cause for this,'' she
said. ``When parents were pointing fingers,'' Toomey said, ``none
of them were pointing back at themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been three years since the outbreak was discovered, a
long time in the lives of teenagers. It's legitimate to ask whether
the syphilis and sexual experimentation in Rockdale were a one-time
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   To the ``Frontline'' producers, the answer is clearly no. The
last third of tonight's documentary captures three girls who have
just finished their freshman year in high school. Two say they are
not virgins, and their male acquaintances became sexually active as
young as 10. And they are unfazed by sexually explicit media: Asked
to choose a favorite song, they chant a rap by local artist Kilo
Ali in which the narrator has sex with seven women in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people do stuff like that, just experiment,'' one of
the girls, 14, says on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Since the town meeting, Rockdale County officials have turned
down state funds for a health clinic catering to teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from talking to individual parents that there are a lot
of people who have gotten some help for their families and are
paying more attention to supervising their children,'' said
Elizabeth Ross, director of student support services for the
Rockdale County school district. ``But we kept identities
confidential, so whether those are the families of the (teens in
the outbreak), I don't know. I can't tell you for certain that
there is any decrease in some of these behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   At the health department, Noel the public health nurse is not
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we got the girls cured of the diseases they had picked
up,'' she said, ``there was an outbreak of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that the documentary will be broadcast tonight has
caused anxiety, both in Rockdale and among those who helped its
residents understand the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that the community will react with anger and look for
external factors to blame,'' Toomey said. ``And I worry that there
will be knee-jerk finger-pointing, looking at Rockdale as unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular cluster of syphilis cases was unique _ but the
syphilis wasn't the problem, it was the symptom. The larger issue
is parent-child communication, and that problem is being mirrored
in communities not only all over Georgia, but all over the United
States.''

got to the point where it's easier for me to let (her) go do what
she wants instead of standing there fussing and fighting with
her.'' In another scene, a mother and her 15-year-old daughter _
who lost her virginity at 12 when, she says in the film, she got
drunk, blacked out and woke to find she had been raped _ assemble
dinner together, but eat it in separate rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The girl _ who was not part of the syphilis cluster, according
to the ``Frontline'' staff _ had a wild early adolescence,
drinking, taking drugs and experimenting sexually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took more of the blame than I gave her, definitely _ her or
the guy, because I realized I was not the parent I should be,'' the
mother says on camera. ``She kept getting worse. And once I took
control, she has done so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, viewed the documentary before its broadcast so she could
serve as part of a panel discussion following the film tonight.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Lost Children' is an appropriate title,'' she said,
``but mine would be, `Where Are the Adults?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the investigators found, the adults were pursuing
their own agendas. Many worked long hours _ often, ironically, to
fund their kids' label-conscious clothing and consumer goods. Some
had allowed their kids to move out _ in one case, into a pool house
behind the family home _ or to live with family friends.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper coached her students in how to approach their parents
with news of their sexual activity, in some cases allowing them to
use her office so she could stand by as the child's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some chewed the child out. Some said, `Oh, I knew something
was wrong,' '' she recalled. ``But the first one who shocked me
said, `I can't have my daughter at home all weekend. I need to
date, too. I need her to spend the night with her friends sometime'
_ even though she knew her daughter was going to a house (where
teens were watching) the Playboy Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast adrift by their parents, the Rockdale teens struggled for a
niche, or even a gathering place, in a suburb that lacked both a
town square and a mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a community where privacy leads to isolation for some of
the adolescents,'' said Claire Sterk, an Emory University
anthropologist who helped the state health department investigate
the teens' behavior. ``So they find each other and create their own
things to do. I don't think sexuality was even what they had in
mind, originally; that in itself was a symptom of what was lacking
in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The film captures the teens of Conyers on an average evening.
Chased out of the bowling alley and the movies, they end up
congregating in strip-mall parking lots and in the playground of a
McDonald's. Some are drinking on camera, and all the girls are
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a portrait of a toxic community: Syphilis, smoking,
alcohol and media, and these kids are out in it by themselves for
hours at a time,'' said Brown, the mother of three teenage
daughters. ``The more poisonous the culture, the more adolescents
need their parents to be present to filter it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the syphilis outbreak was recognized, the state and
local health departments hosted a town meeting to air community
concerns. Both attendance and reaction left the investigators
surprised and pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like, we gave a party, and no one came,'' Noel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Toomey presented the results of the investigation, most notably
a chart that showed how many sexual contacts the 17 confirmed
syphilis cases had shared. A gasp went up when she projected the
spider-web pattern. But in the discussion that followed, ``there
was a desperate searching to find an external cause for this,'' she
said. ``When parents were pointing fingers,'' Toomey said, ``none
of them were pointing back at themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been three years since the outbreak was discovered, a
long time in the lives of teenagers. It's legitimate to ask whether
the syphilis and sexual experimentation in Rockdale were a one-time
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   To the ``Frontline'' producers, the answer is clearly no. The
last third of tonight's documentary captures three girls who have
just finished their freshman year in high school. Two say they are
not virgins, and their male acquaintances became sexually active as
young as 10. And they are unfazed by sexually explicit media: Asked
to choose a favorite song, they chant a rap by local artist Kilo
Ali in which the narrator has sex with seven women in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people do stuff like that, just experiment,'' one of
the girls, 14, says on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Since the town meeting, Rockdale County officials have turned
down state funds for a health clinic catering to teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from talking to individual parents that there are a lot
of people who have gotten some help for their families and are
paying more attention to supervising their children,'' said
Elizabeth Ross, director of student support services for the
Rockdale County school district. ``But we kept identities
confidential, so whether those are the families of the (teens in
the outbreak), I don't know. I can't tell you for certain that
there is any decrease in some of these behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   At the health department, Noel the public health nurse is not
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we got the girls cured of the diseases they had picked
up,'' she said, ``there was an outbreak of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that the documentary will be broadcast tonight has
caused anxiety, both in Rockdale and among those who helped its
residents understand the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that the community will react with anger and look for
external factors to blame,'' Toomey said. ``And I worry that there
will be knee-jerk finger-pointing, looking at Rockdale as unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular cluster of syphilis cases was unique _ but the
syphilis wasn't the problem, it was the symptom. The larger issue
is parent-child communication, and that problem is being mirrored
in communities not only all over Georgia, but all over the United
States.''

 &HT;    Rylander asked her agency's former chief lawyer to leave
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two weeks after denying that an aide was
secretly tape-recording conversations, state Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander acknowledged Monday that her former chief lawyer
taped at least four conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander asked Steven Koebele to leave after learning of the
secret recordings, her office said, and the tapes were all
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had been accused of playing dirty politics for
raising the issue, immediately denounced Rylander's turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said
Monday's disclosure underscores ``a pattern of lies, deception and
a total disregard for the public's right to know what's going on in
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we haven't seen are the tapes or transcripts or any of
the records we have requested under the law,'' she said. ``Carole
Keeton Rylander's credibility is so badly damaged now that it's
hard to believe anything she says.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her spokesman, Rylander made public 20 pages of
documents concerning the four conversations that Koebele taped
while he was general counsel, receipts for 35 tapes and two
recorders that he bought and a legal memo ruling that the tapes
could legally be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise admissions came after the Democratic Party two
weeks ago had sought copies of Koebele's tapes or transcripts under
Texas' open records law, charging that he abruptly resigned because
they caught him taping official conversations.
</P>
<P>
   After initially insisting ``the stories are not true,''
Rylander's spokesman, Mark Sanders, acknowledged Monday that the
taping was indeed the reason for Koebele's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comptroller does not believe in and does not want any of
her employees tape-recording anything that should not be taped,''
Sanders said. ``Conversations should not have been taped.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that in each of the four instances in which Koebele
recorded, the tapes were destroyed. In one instance, Sanders said,
he threw the tape away himself after Koebele gave it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Koebele was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to a confidential memo that Sanders said Koebele
wrote, one tape was of testimony last spring during sessions of the
Senate Finance Committee and the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That tape was discarded in May after Koebele determined the
hearing was ``recorded by legislative staff and available on the
Internet,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   The memo states that Koebele also taped two phone conversations
_ one from a tipster about a ``very important and confidential
matter'' and the second from former Democratic state Rep. Hugo
Berlanga, now an Austin lobbyist. The Berlanga conversation was
taped, the memo says, ``to memorialize'' where Berlanga stood on an
amendment to a bill for which he was lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Berlanga had gotten approval for the amendment by telling
legislative staffers that the comptroller's office agreed with it,
the memo says, even though ``no such agreement existed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Berlanga would change his approval source depending upon
to whom he was talking,'' the memo states. ``Accordingly, the
general counsel taped a phone conversation between himself and Mr.
Berlanga to memorialize exactly where the approval resided.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlanga, in a statement released Monday, said he was not aware
his discussion with Koebele had been taped. The memo ``does not
accurately reflect my conversations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, the fourth tape was made of a Sept. 17
meeting on an education initiative Rylander was launching.
Attending the meeting were staffers from her office and from the
offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, House speaker and
Texas Education Agency. Sanders said Koebele gave him the tape
after the meeting, and he discarded it. ``I didn't have any use for
it, and I thought it was improper. I'm not sure the others in the
meeting knew it was being taped,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said Rylander's office initially denied the Democrats'
records request because they asked only for tapes or transcripts _
neither of which still exist.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent request from the Democrats for related documents
about the tapings will be answered in coming days with the
documents Rylander made public Monday, Sanders said.

 &HT;    Dell says higher memory prices will cut profits
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. warned analysts Monday that
another unexpected spike in memory chip prices may lower its
profits in its third quarter ending Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Monday after markets closed, the company
said suppliers of dynamic random access memory chips plan to raise
prices 25 percent on top of price hikes of more than 250 percent
earlier this year. DRAM chips are the most common type used in
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest increase will add about $75 to the cost of one-third
of the PCs Dell will ship this quarter, said Chief Financial
Officer Tom Meredith. ``With three weeks left, we can't really
manage our way around it without it affecting our (profit)
margins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares closed down $1.50 to $41.31 1/4 in Nasdaq trading
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The memory-chip industry is cyclical, typically going from
periods of falling prices because of excess capacity to tight
supplies that prompt price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for 124-megabyte modules ranged from $163 in October 1998
to $84 in July to $268 this month, according to Pathfinder
Research, a company that tracks the industry. The recent increase
is largely attributed to demand for more memory from consumers and
businesses rather than supply disruptions from the September
earthquake in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   While all PC makers will be affected by the latest increase,
Dell is likely to see its effects sooner because it has little
inventory of components, analysts said. While competitors such as
Compaq Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Inc. and IBM Corp. are still
moving toward Dell's low-inventory manufacturing system, they have
tens of thousands of finished machines in warehouses and on store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq may have three or four weeks of inventory and then
Compaq has to deal with it,'' said Cody Acree of Frost Securities
in Dallas. ``Dell won't feel it worse, they'll feel it sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith and Dell said Monday's call didn't foreshadow a
disastrous third quarter for Dell. They, instead, conveyed
confidence in Dell's prospects, including for the fourth quarter.
``We're actually bullish there,'' Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of 28 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. is
$0.20 a share for Dell's third quarter, whose results will be
reported Nov. 17. But that estimate is likely to come down today.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dube of Wasserstein Pirella &AMP; Co. said he will take from
$0.02 to $0.05 off his estimate of $0.20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is part of the reason for the latest increase in DRAM
prices, he said. ``They have been rushing into the market, saying
'We will pay X, if you can get us X,' `` Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 days ago, when Dell hosted its annual fall meeting with
Wall Street in Austin, Michael Dell indicated that the company
would be able to work its way through short-term supply disruptions
in a way that would not affect third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, suppliers told the company last week that prices
would go up another 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's large enterprise customers are likely to absorb
the increases, Dell said, but consumers and small businesses may
respond by buying less memory or delaying purchases. That will slow
demand and, in time, should bring chip prices back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think memory vendors are probably pushing a little further
than this market, i.e. customers, are willing to bear,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for other key components such as microprocessors from
Intel Corp. are expected to keep dropping and that will partially
cushion the DRAM spike. But PC makers probably will have to absorb
the rest because consumers and small businesses have become
accustomed to steadily declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the PC market is in such a condition that
consumers have to pay more for anything,'' Acree said.

 &HT;    Blowhards are ruining a superb series
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The results from Sunday night's game four of the
American League Championship Series are in, but you won't find all
of them in the box score.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jose Offerman was never remotely tagged by Chuck
Knoblauch. Nomar Garciaparra was safe at first. And the Red Sox
fans are disgusting idiots.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them. Not even a majority of them. But enough of them
_ dozens, according to the Boston media _ acted in such a
disgraceful, classless manner that the Yankees had to be taken off
the field for security reasons. Outraged Red Sox fans inexcusably
threw bottles, cans, magazines and all types of debris on the
field. Home plate umpire Al Clark made the correct decision _ one
of the few correct ones by the men in blue _ and the game was
stopped for eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I wish Clark had gone a step further and halted it for good.
Called it a forfeit and awarded the game to the Yankees. As
punishment? No, as precedent. Fans have to be taught a lesson
because it's obvious they won't learn it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Did the umpires botch the two calls? Absolutely. But you'll find
no fan of instant replay here. Games are long enough already.
Sunday's Braves-Mets game lasted so long, it almost interfered with
February spring training. But I am in favor of umpire conferences
to get the critical calls right as they do in other sports. To
refuse to ask for help is the height of arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have guessed they'd be watching a baseball playoff
game and see an English soccer match break out?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of atrocious umpiring, fan misbehavior is getting
totally and recklessly out of control. In Boston. In New York. In
Philadelphia, where they cheer the maiming of football players.
Fans know no restraint, no civility anymore. They think everyone's
fair game. One fan tried to grab Yankee right fielder Paul O'Neill
as he fielded a ball in the ninth inning Sunday. With the price of
admission comes the right to boo _ but not to commit mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   American fans jeer rabbit-eared Colin Montgomerie with profanity
at every turn at the Ryder Cup. Someone at Mile High Stadium hits
the Broncos' Dale Carter with a battery. A lunatic in Milwaukee
tries to play leapfrog with the Houston Astros' Bill Spiers. Mets
fans verbally rip Braves pitcher John Rocker, although he doesn't
do much to deter the verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Taunting Chipper Jones by calling him ``Lar-ry, Lar-ry,'' his
given name, is good, clean, harmless fun. When Red Sox fans chant,
``Where's Roger?'' all night long, former Sox pitcher Clemens
deserves all the razzing he got. That's part of the legitimate
home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But where does it end? Or does it? Is it going to take a serious
injury? Are we going to have to put huge barriers up separating the
fans from the players? Put in a moat? Do we put a cop in every
section? The Mets had to hire 500 extra, off-duty police officers
to patrol Shea Stadium. Add a $2 surcharge to every ticket for
security overhead? Make baseball players take the field wearing
helmets?
</P>
<P>
   Most fans are great. They give us the Lambeau Leap. They dress a
little weird in the Dawg Pound, but they're part of the color in a
too-often colorless NFL. The Cubs' bleacher creatures do nothing
more harmful than return visitors' home-run balls to the field. But
there are too many nut cases out there looking for an excuse to
swill beer and be destructive.
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Here's a few suggestions. Cut off all beer sales
before the seventh-inning stench. Or here's an idea: Don't sell
alcohol at all in stadiums, or is that a constitutional right?
Would sports die without the presence of alcohol? Eject offensive
fans who throw anything so much as wadded-up gum and revoke their
season tickets if they own such. Have ``real fans'' point out the
offenders who misbehave. Set up a mini-courthouse like the one in
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. Make the fines stiffer than their
drinks. Don't let television wag the dog any longer and schedule
more day games. Forfeit games when rowdy fans try to take over the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner accused Red Sox Manager Jimy
Williams of inciting the crowd by arguing the call at first base.
Excuse me? Who incites more ill will than the Boss? What's Williams
supposed to do, take his licking and slink off? Sorry, George. He
has every right to crab at the umpires for blowing big calls the
same as Joe Torre does. If yelling at umps for wrong calls incited
riots, cantankerous Lou Piniella would have caused Seattle to tear
apart the old Kingdome long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it. When unruly fans mistake ballparks for
a carnival sideshow and use players as targets, they threaten to
ruin one of the best-pitched, most dramatic baseball playoff series
since the 1986 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Just think, Albert Belle isn't even playing.

 &HT;    Successful promotions help state welcome more visitors
 &HT;    By Dave Doolittle
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Those people crowding into the Capitol and
stores in the San Marcos Outlet Mall are not just new residents to
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a strong economy, Texas has seen a steady increase in
tourism over the past five years. In Austin, the number of visitors
has risen to more than 16 million in 1998 from 14 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, venues such as the LBJ museum and the Lady Bird
Johnson Wildflower Center are enjoying increased attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing development in many different areas, with the new
airport, to roadways, to new restaurants, everything is continuing
to evolve,'' said Ric Luber, executive director of the Austin
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``This not only benefits local
residents, but brings in out-of-town visitors as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKinley and his wife, Stephanie, visiting Austin from
Baton Rouge, La., said they had been to Houston several times but
never to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were planning a trip to San Antonio and realized how close
Austin was,'' Kevin McKinley said. ``We're interested in seeing
some of the historical sights around Austin, like the Capitol
building and the University of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the increase in tourism generated more than
$34 billion for the Texas economy in 1998, while employing more
than 480,000 people statewide. It has grown to become the
third-largest industry in Texas, trailing only real estate and oil
and gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong economy has made travel a possibility again,'' said
Stan Hodges of the Texas Department of Economic Development. ``By
1995, people had purchased items they couldn't before, like
refrigerators and cars, and then began to look at the feasibility
of travel.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials also started an advertising campaign with the
theme of ``Texas. It's like a whole other country.'' The television
and print ads, which give the state's 800 number and its Web site,
TravelTex.com., ran in all 50 states and contrasted Western images
with less well-known aspects of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to work with an image that was well-known around the
country, as well as showcase something like the different kinds of
music coming out of the state,'' Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that travel information requests from areas where
the ads ran were up 115 percent from the previous year and that
hits to the Web site increased during weeks the ads ran. Further
research shows that 71 percent of households that requested
information visited Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will have spent an estimated $47 million between 1995 and
1999 trying to attract visitors from both the United States and
abroad, according to the Texas Department of Economic Development.
Tourists have spent more than $127 billion in the state since 1995,
with the totals increasing about $2 billion every year.
</P>
<P>
   Austin officials hope this trend continues.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to bring in more visitors with the opening of the
Texas Historic Museum in 2001 and the opening of the Museum of
Art's new location at Fourth and Guadalupe streets, scheduled for
2002. The Museum of Art, which opened downtown in 1996, already has
close to 90,000 visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey done by an independent tourism research and consulting
company put the Alamo as the most visited attraction in Texas last
year. The outlet malls in San Marcos and the Capitol came in fourth
and fifth, respectively. Other Central Texas attractions that made
the top 30 include the Admiral Nimitz Museum in Fredericksburg, No.
25; Enchanted Rock, north of Fredericksburg, No. 26; and The LBJ
Library at the University of Texas, No. 28.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming years, state officials will be working to bring
more people to Texas. New print and television ads will focus on
wildlife and adventures, such as hiking and white-water rafting. In
addition, TravelTex.com will be highlighting activities such as
golf, theme parks and beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is also trying to generate interest abroad. Last year, the
state had more than 1 million visitors from other countries. While
people from Mexico and Canada have historically made up the largest

<P>
   Six years ago, a self-effacing Russian emigre with scant
business experience set up a modest New Jersey company that planned
to introduce entrepreneurs from the new Russia to American
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berlin's venture, Benex International Co., got off to a
slow start. But after a few years of arranging shipments of stereos
and other electronic products to Russia, Berlin hit on something
simpler and more lucrative to move around the world: money.
</P>
<P>
   It proved an inspired choice. Nearly everyone in Russia with any
money, from businessmen to gangsters, was searching for ways to
hide their cash from onerous taxes or overly inquisitive
investigators. Berlin offered a fast, discreet vehicle for moving
dollars offshore _ lots of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's companies opened accounts at the Bank of New York,
where his wife, Lucy Edwards, was an executive, and began whisking
billions of dollars a year out of Russia. Ms. Edwards was in an
ideal position to help. Just as her husband began his new business
in 1996, she was promoted to a prestigious job in London at the
bank drumming up commercial clients in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The couple prospered. According to people involved in an
investigation into the couple's finances, they earned millions of
dollars from Benex's dealings, depositing the money offshore in
accounts in Britain's Channel Islands and elsewhere. Berlin and Ms.
Edwards, who had previously owned a small home in upstate New York,
bought a $500,000 apartment in central London and enrolled her
daughter in an expensive private school.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say little distinguished them from other Russian
immigrants aspiring to upper middle-class success in the United
States. The diminutive Ms. Edwards, who rose from an entry level
job to executive in just eight years at the Bank of New York, was
known for her diligence and energy in recruiting clients. Russian
businessmen say Berlin had no obvious links to the titans of
Russia's new market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the couple is now at the center of the biggest
federal money laundering investigation in history as law
enforcement officials try to sort out how more than $7 billion
sluiced through Berlin's companies over three years. Much remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators, for example, suspect Berlin's
transformation from small-time businessman to leader of a widely
used company was orchestrated by someone in Russia with ties to
leading business or political leaders. But so far, neither they nor
British investigators have been able to figure out who that might
be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' role remains equally unclear. British investigators
who raided the couple's apartment in London in August found
business cards and stationery for the Benex company that carried
the Bank of New York logo. Prosecutors assert she was directly
involved in expediting at least one transfer through Benex, and
Western financiers say she ran financial seminars in Russia in
which Benex's consulting services were promoted using the Bank of
New York name.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to unravel whose money washed
through Berlin's companies. Some of the more than 87,000 electronic
transfers, they say, appear to involve legitimate Russian companies
financing the purchase of imported goods and evading taxes. Some
has been linked to Russian racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which is cooperating with the
investigation, has not been accused of doing anything wrong. In an
indictment this month that federal prosecutors said was just the
beginning of a far-reaching international inquiry, Berlin, Ms.
Edwards and an associate were charged with illegally operating a
money transfer business and taking deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already had an impact few could have foreseen. It
has roiled relations between Washington and Moscow, sparked a
congressional inquiry, given new momentum to corruption
investigations into the financial dealings of Russia's business
titans and President Boris Yeltsin's family, and become an issue in
upcoming presidential elections here and in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Ms. Edwards are still living in London where their
apartment is frequented by photographers and journalists seeking
interviews. They and their lawyers have declined comment. Ms.
Edwards' London-based lawyer has said she has done nothing wrong
and the bank had no grounds for firing her.

 &HT;    Braves appeared to be in cruise control before Mets won twice
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves' National League Championship Series with
the New York Mets started a week ago at Turner Field as something
less than compelling. There was a little trash talk from both
sides, but nothing that hinted that it would ascend during an
enthralling weekend in Gotham into an epic matchup.
</P>
<P>
   If the first five games are an indication, tonight's Game 6 at
Turner Field promises head-shaking plots, subplots, excellence,
ineptitude, vulgarity and, most definitely, drama.
</P>
<P>
   Get plenty of rest because there's no telling when _ or how _
this one will end.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise is that the series has yet to end. The Mets
continued to quiver at the mere sight of Turner Field, losing the
first two games here following a three-game sweep late in the
regular season. They returned home to fall behind 3-0. The Mets
were dead. Right? No team in baseball history had climbed out of
such a deep canyon. And yet, two out-and-out fascinating New York
victories later, we go into tonight not knowing what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Let's relive the stimulating journey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Game 1: Oct. 12 at Turner Field
</P>
<P>
   Before 6,000 empty seats, the Braves executed a 4-2 victory on
the pitching of Greg Maddux that seemed to initiate burial
proceedings on the Mets. New York manager Bobby Valentine had
called his players ``ghosts'' after they rose from near elimination
to make the playoffs, but they seemed to be the same team that the
Braves backhanded in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the first one makes it easier,'' said Braves catcher
Eddie Perez, whose home run in the sixth gave the Braves a 3-1
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's counterpart, Mike Piazza, played after missing two games
because of a bad reaction to a cortisone shot in his left thumb. He
swung the bat as if he was still in pain. But at least he had an
excuse. His teammates did not.
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to the Braves that John Rocker got the save.
The trash-talking originated on the Braves' side from Chipper
Jones, who told the Mets fans to switch to Yankee gear after the
Braves' last victory at Shea, and Rocker, who said he hated Mets
fans. He would soon find the feeling mutual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Game 2: Oct. 13 at Turner Field
</P>
<P>
   When Kenny Rogers realized he was in a playoff game, he turned
into the pitcher feared by doubting Mets fans. Ahead 2-0, he gave
up a pair of two-run home runs in the sixth inning. Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   First Brian Jordan, then Perez, went deep, and the Braves'
pitchers shut it down for a 4-3 victory in front of plenty more
vacant seats. Afterward, Valentine pointed at himself as the
culprit, saying he should have taken out Rogers before Perez
unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason to keep him in. It was absolutely the
wrong move,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb baseball was just as damaging to the Mets as Rogers' gopher
balls. Case in point: In the second inning, his team up 1-0,
shortstop Rey Ordonez inexplicably tried to bunt with runners on
first and third, no outs and the pitcher up next. Worse, he popped
out to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it on his own,'' Valentine said, trying hard to not
show his disgust. ``I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning pitcher Kevin Millwood rated his stuff a C-minus, which
tells you either he's exceptionally hard on himself or that the
Mets' bats were made of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything here,'' Edgardo Alfonzo said. ``I'm glad
to be going home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Game 3: Friday at Shea Stadium
</P>
<P>
   There was not a seat to be had. The energy hung over the
building like a roof. Familiar baseball chants filled the air,
along with some nasty chants. During pregame introductions, the
fans berated every Braves player after his name was called, none
more so than Chipper Jones and Rocker, who doffed his cap.
</P>
<P>
   Throws by Rickey Henderson, not exactly known for his arm, from
left field gunned down Jones and sore-kneed Perez as they tried to
stretch singles into doubles. But that was about all Mets fans
could cheer as Tom Glavine threw darts on the black of the plate
and gave up nothing. His counterpart, Al Leiter was just as tough
on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was off the mound where Leiter had trouble. His throwing
error on a bunt led to an early 1-0 Braves' lead that held up when
Rocker closed matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can trash talk all he wants,'' Mets counterpart Turk
Wendell said, ``because he's backing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   No team has ever come back to win a post-season series after
losing the first three games. ``If we're thinking of the big
picture,'' Leiter said, ``that, 'Oh, my God, we have to win four in
a row,' we're not going to do that. We have to focus on the
smallest task at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that would be scoring a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time a team won a game without scoring?''
Valentine said. ``I don't remember that one.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Game 4:
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Shea Stadium
</P>
<P>
   The heretofore wild and raunchy crowd was decidedly tame. John
Smoltz, Mr. Series-Ender, was on the mound and the Mets hadn't
shown a glimpse of offense. Rocker and Jones still got the
business, but the fans were more wait-and-see than make-it-happen.
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitcher Rick Reed baffled hitters as long as Smoltz did,
and his effort inspired hope. John Olerud, who had been invisible,
showed up. He smoked a Smoltz pitch 405 feet for a bases-empty home
run in the sixth. Shea erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, it was silent. Brian Jordan hit a home run
off Reed and Ryan Klesko followed suit for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine pulled Reed, who said he thought as he headed for the
dugout ``the season was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Only, it was just beginning for the Mets.They worked the bases
loaded in the eighth with Olerud at the plate against Rocker, who
had not allowed him a hit in nine confrontations. Olerud hit a
bouncer up the middle that Ozzie Guillen got a glove on but did not
snare. Two runs scored to touch off a wild Mets celebration and a
3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Headline in the next day's New York Post: ``Put A Cork In It,''
referring to the champagne the Braves expected to spray in victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hoopla was the fact that Valentine pulled Henderson
for Mora. The move incensed Henderson because it was not made
between innings and Henderson had to face the so-called indignity
of leaving his position.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Mets poured into their clubhouse, Henderson was
showered, dressed and on his way out. That prompted Wendell to say
Henderson quit on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Henderson took exception to that. He got an apology
from Valentine for not making the change earlier and then said
within earshot of a reporter, ``Tell Turk he can kiss my (butt). If
he's got something to say about it, tell him to meet me. I'll beat
his (butt).''
</P>
<P>
   Mets win a classic game and teammates feud. Just another day in
the big city.
</P>
<P>
   _ Game 5:
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Shea Stadium
</P>
<P>
   The energy was back in the building. The game started on a
beautiful baseball day, first pitch at 4:11. By the time the last
at-bat was taken _ 5 hours, 46 minutes later, the longest playoff
game in history _ the teams had endured a consistent downpour and
used almost every player on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember most of the game,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   It was too much to remember. The Mets got two runs in the first
inning, the Braves two in the fourth. From there, it was mostly the
Braves blowing scoring opportunties. All told, they left an
NLCS-record 19 men on base.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after the 14th-inning stretch _ the 15th, to be
exact _ that either side made a dent. Keith Lockhart doubled in a
run to put the Braves up 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston, leading off the Mets' 15th, battled reliever
Kevin McGlinchy by fouling off six full-count pitches before lining
a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tip your cap to him,'' Maddux said. ``A great at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy, unable to find the plate, walked in the tying run
and, with the bases loaded, gave up Robin Ventura's first hit of
the series _ a blast over the wall in right-center that became a
single when Ventura was halted by his jubilant teammates between
first and second base. Final score: 7-3. No, make that 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost that 'Field of Dreams' thing, where the ball hits
the lights, everything explodes and it starts pouring,'' Mets
pitcher Orel Hershiser said. ``This is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Who has the advantage now? Chipper Jones said it might be in
someone else's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's fate,'' he said, ``that this is the way it's meant
to be. We've been in positions before where we thought we should
win and we were either watching some other team in the World Series
or watching someone else's parade. If the baseball gods aren't on
your side, it ain't going to happen.''

<P>
   The Beginnings: Two Long Roads From Russia
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Ms. Edwards came of age in a country in which banking
was depicted as the glue holding together America's morally
bankrupt economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, born Lyudmila Pritzker in Leningrad, was the first
of the two to make her way to the West. In 1977, Ms. Pritzker
married Brad Edwards, a 19-year old American merchant seaman she
had met at a club in Leningrad. After a civil wedding at the
American consulate in Leningrad, they moved to Illinois where their
daughter, Amy was born. The couple then settled in Colorado where
Ms. Edwards held a succession of jobs as a bank teller and
waitress.
</P>
<P>
   After the marriage fell apart in 1988, Ms. Edwards almost
immediately landed an entry-level job handling commercial accounts
at the Bank of New York, one of the country's oldest and most
prestigious banks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Bank of New York took over Irving Trust, which was
doing extensive business in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. Ms. Edwards joined the new Eastern European Division in 1992
and became a loan officer two years later, moving for the first
time into the executive ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' bosses in the Eastern European unit were two
well-regarded bank officers, Vladimir Galitzine, an American-born
Russian with a royal pedigree, and Natasha Gurfinkel, an Ivy
League-educated woman who, like Ms Edwards, was a Russian immigrant
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's strategy was straightforward. It hoped to become a
key overseas player in Russia by making it easier for Russian
companies to conduct business overseas. Ms. Edwards' verve in
searching for clients immediately set her apart, associates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguished her to everyone was her energy, incredible
energy,'' said a former colleague of Ms. Edwards. ``When others
would see four or five clients a day, she would see 10 or 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berlin's road to Western success appears to have been less
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that a man named Peter Berlin graduated from the
Moscow Institute on Physics and Technology in 1978 with a degree in
molecular chemical physics. Berlin left Russia about 10 years ago,
just as Communism was collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, bearded man who stands about 5-foot-9, Berlin may have
lived in Indiana before he moved to New Jersey. His immigration
status when he came to the United States is not clear; he later
became an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1992, Berlin married Ms. Edwards, a union that
would have solved many immigration problems. A relative would say
only that they met and married in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, he was trying his hand at business. He founded Benex,
which listed his apartment in Cliffside Park, N.J., as its
operating address. After several years, Berlin hooked up with a
major, Moscow-based dealer in consumer electronics and began
brokering sales of televisions and other items.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Edwards rose through the ranks at the Bank of New York,
the couple's finances modestly improved. They bought a $125,000
house in Narrowsburg, N.Y. Acquaintances say Berlin has a taste for
fine art, particularly Impressionist paintings, but some found him,
and his wife, uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not high-cultured and didn't seem to have much
spiritual value,'' said Vadim Borshai, a Russian artist and a
neighbor who lived near them in Narrowsburg. ``There was no poetry
in their soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also had brushes with local law enforcement. Seven
years ago, in a Nordstrom department store in Edison, N.J., Ms.
Edwards tried to steal more than $1,400 of clothing. She was
arrested and pleaded guilty, only to repeat the offense two years
later at a Bloomingdale's store in Hackensack, N.J. _ this time,
with 15 year-old Amy in tow. Ms. Edwards was arrested again and
later pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which was employing her, did not learn of
either arrest until after federal investigators began scrutinizing
the Benex accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was arrested for shoplifting six years ago, records show,
when he was charged in Fairview, N.J., with stealing sinus medicine
from a local A&AMP;P. He retained a lawyer, and the charges were
dropped.

<P>
   The Companies: Red Flags Ignored By The Bank
</P>
<P>
   On a winter day three years ago, Berlin took a step that would
change his life: He strolled into the Bank of New York's Wall
Street headquarters and opened an account in the name of Benex
International. Six months later, in July, 1996, he opened an
account in the name of Becs International at the same branch.
</P>
<P>
   Closer scrutiny by the Bank of New York would have revealed
corporate records on file with the state of New Jersey showing that
one of its employees, Ms. Edwards, was one of two officers at Benex
(Berlin was the other). The bank's own records noted that Ms.
Edwards had authority to withdraw money from the Becs account.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those facts should have been red flags at the bank.
Banks typically restrict employees from playing a direct role in
customers' businesses. The Bank of New York allows such
arrangements only with permission of its chairman. Ms. Edwards
formal links to her husband's ventures, the bank says, did not
surface until late 1998, after the federal inquiry began.
</P>
<P>
   Bank employees knew that Berlin and Ms. Edwards were married,
but this apparently only served to shield the accounts from
scrutiny. In congressional testimony last month, the bank's chief
executive, Thomas A. Renyi, said that the fact that Berlin was
married to ``a well regarded bank officer'' dissuaded bank auditors
from looking more closely at the money in the accounts. He
described that as ``a lapse on the part of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to look at. It is not clear precisely when the
companies began moving money out of Russia, but by 1996, they had
become one of the more heavily used pipelines for sending out cash.
Millions of dollars a day coursed through the network, pouring
through the Bank of New York unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Banks do not typically make much profit transferring money from
one country to another. They charge their better clients as little
as a few dollars per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators say that in Russia's volatile economy,
Berlin was able to charge a premium for a service that ran through
the reliable, prestigious Bank of New York. His companies,
investigators say, were paid a percentage of the total transferred,
earning millions of dollars in profits.
</P>
<P>
   There were some uniquely Russian forces fueling the demand for
Berlin's services. Russia's high taxes and import tariffs give
businessmen powerful incentives to hide the true costs of their
deals, whether importing goods, buying property, or consummating
routine deals. Offshore accounts help hide the volume of trade and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Berlin opened his first account at the bank,
Ms. Edwards was courted by a Moscow-based bank but was persuaded to
stay at the Bank of New York with a prestigious promotion. She was
sent to London and named a vice president, responsible for finding
new business among Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   While both Berlin and Ms. Edwards wore off-the-rack business
suits, a former colleague said they sometimes spent weekends in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1996 and 1998, there seemed to be more money,'' the
colleague said. `Peter was doing better, or that is what everyone
attributed it to. But there was no ostentation, no high-priced
clothing or jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's companies appear to have transacted much of their
business from a office building in Queens, where a handful of
people working with computers arranged hundreds of electronic
transfers a day.
</P>
<P>
   Russian investigators have told their American counterparts they
believe crime groups in Russia exercised some form of control over
the operation. American officials say they have no evidence of
that, but are still trying to understand how Berlin corralled so
much money so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The customers appear to have covered the entire range of Russian
commerce. Some of the money, federal investigators say, was moved
by Russian criminal groups. Italian prosecutors have found that
Russian gangs operating out of northern Italy, for example, used
Benex to transfer several million dollars out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the $7 billion handled by Berlin's companies
moved through the accounts before any suspicions arose. But in
early 1998, investigators in two countries, working on different
cases, began asking questions about Becs, Benex and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office, working with British
officials on a money laundering and stock manipulation case, found
that a Russian emigre they were investigating was moving $300,000
to $500,000 a week through Benex into the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the Russian government separately asked the
FBI for help in tracing the ransom in a kidnapping case. The money,
it turned out, moved through a Benex account at the Bank of New
York on its way to Russian organized crime figures, prompting the
bureau to open its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry focused more closely on Berlin in August 1998, after
Republic Bank told the FBI that $10 million had passed from Russia
through an account controlled by one of his companies.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's money moving operations continued at full throttle
through the fall of 1998. But something had changed. His companies
were being watched.

   The Investigations: A Slow Start, Startling Disclosures
</P>
<P>
   In its initial phases, the case did not make much of a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators served a subpoena on the Bank of New York
in September 1998 for account records relating to Berlin's
companies, among hundreds of such requests the bank receives each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were startled by what they found. The
records showed a dizzying array of transfers out of Russia and to
dozens of countries, including in some cases back to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   British investigators began electronic surveillance of Berlin's
and Ms. Edwards' conversations and the FBI received transcripts,
according to American law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In March, confronted with requests for more information, the
Bank of New York officials finally informed Renyi, the bank's
chairman, that a problem had arisen with the accounts used by
Berlin's companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest of the investigative agencies heated up in March
and that's when it went to the CEO,'' said one person with
knowledge of the investigation at the bank. ``There were people who
knew there was a big-time amount of money there after the first
subpoenas came in September of '98. But it wasn't until six months
later that it went to the CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are conflicting views of how actively the FBI pursued the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous officials, including current and former members of the
New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, the New York state
Banking Department, and Britain's National Crime Squad assert that
the bureau moved too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials maintain that they made a
choice, at the outset, to investigate the case covertly. Berlin's
accounts, they say, offered a rare window into Russian financial
chicanery, provided the inquiry could be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were trying to determine whether the
rapid-fire transfers were money-laundering, a difficult case to
make because prosecutors must prove that the cash at issue was used
in a crime such as drug dealing, extortion or fraud. The FBI,
officials said, hoped to infiltrate the organization and find out
more about how Russians launder their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got frustrated because we were trying to do
the investigation without letting the targets know we were doing
it,'' said one federal law enforcement official. ``We were actively
investigating the money laundering case, but we restrained
ourselves from doing anything that would tip them off. ''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Ms. Edwards were surprisingly open about the links
between their two careers. For example, brochures for Berlin's
companies carried the Bank of New York logo. The couple traveled
together to Russia and in 1996 and 1997 and Berlin sometimes signed
his name to tabs billed to Ms Edwards' expense account at the Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   That discrepancy was eventually noticed by bank auditors in
1998, before the federal inquiry began, but it did not prompt a
closer look at the couple's financial dealings, according to people
close to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were struggling to understand a case that
was largely unfolding in Moscow. The leads, law enforcement
officials said, went in myriad, sometimes unfruitful directions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators at one point contemplated using an
American diplomat in Moscow as an undercover agent. Ms. Edwards and
Berlin made contact with the diplomat in 1998 in an attempt to
secure American government backing for their plan to convert a
Russian defense factory to civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was later taped by British investigators as he boasted
his ties to the diplomat. The plan was called off after The New
York Times disclosed the inquiry last August.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the federal investigation now a very public event,
Ms. Edwards and Berlin, those investigating them, and the Bank of
New York, all face complicated problems.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI can no longer conduct a covert investigation, leaving
the bureau with the more difficult task of piecing the Benex puzzle
together with help from Russia, or by persuading witnesses to come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Bank of New York has been cooperating with the
investigation, federal authorities have indicated that they still
plan to take a hard look at how the bank handled various issues
surrounding Berlin's accounts. The Manhattan district attorney's
office also has its own investigation underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, with a federal indictment hanging over their heads, and
their bank accounts frozen, the pressure on Berlin and Ms. Edwards
to cooperate with the federal investigation has intensified. But so
far they have remained silent, declining all interview requests
from authorities or the press.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Ms. Edwards remained holed up in her London
apartment, she used her building's intercom system to decline an
interview request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could help you, but I can't,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: ONE HILLARY IS ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has a new mortgage, thank heavens. The New York
Senate race doesn't need another controversy about the Clinton
family finances. Things are complicated enough right now, what with
the debate about elephant dung in the arts and the ongoing
investigation into exactly what Rudy Giuliani thinks about raising
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons defused the mortgage issue when they dropped the
idea of having a rich friend guarantee their loan. Now they're
going to pay 7.5 percent interest on a 30-year adjustable mortgage,
just as you or I would, should you or I ever suddenly get a yen to
own a $1.7 million, 11-room, fully loaded Colonial in an upscale
suburb. This is a pretty fancy pad for a Senate candidate.
Perfectly reasonable for a retiring president and first lady, but
Mrs. Clinton is planning on occupying two roles throughout the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, that's one role too many.
</P>
<P>
   New York has more experience than most places in what happens
when a woman in politics fails to draw a clear line between her
identity as a candidate and her relationship to a politically
connected spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro never seemed to grasp why it was a bad idea
for her to run for the Senate while serving as an officer in her
husband's real estate business. As a result, she wound up trying to
explain away the $340,000 a pornography publisher paid to lease
space in one of the family buildings. (Memorably, Ferraro said she
and her husband had been pursuing a strategy of ``raising the rent
in order to get them out.'')
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro, recently the New York Republican Party's Woman
Most Likely to Succeed, is trying to extricate herself from the
problems of her husband, Albert, who was indicted last spring for
tax evasion, despite his attempt to avoid prosecution by secretly
taping conversations with his accountant, who also happens to be
his brother. Ms. Pirro has attempted to portray herself as no more
sophisticated about family finances than Beaver Cleaver's mom, an
effort that might be easier if she were not Westchester district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   We've learned at least one clear lesson from all this. If you're
a candidate for elected office, you can't rely on a spouse's money
or political muscle to propel your career, and then distance
yourself when it suits you. (``I don't make the money. I'm in
public service,'' said Ms. Pirro, who drove around in a Mercedes
that her husband is now charged with deducting as a business
expense.)
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton crossed that line when her husband's top
fund-raiser agreed to guarantee the family mortgage. Now she's
unraveled that conflict. But she still wants to be able to travel
to Israel as first lady, tell the Jewish voters of New York what
she and the prime minister talked about, and then reserve the right
to distance herself if the administration takes a position on the
Mideast that's unpopular here. That's too many identities for the
public to juggle, and it would take a White House far more
coordinated than this one to keep things straight.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton wants to run for the Senate, she should cut her
first lady duties to the minimum. The line isn't as hard to draw as
it might seem. You stick to jobs with a low degree of public
interest and high potential for boredom. Feel free to host dinners
for visiting dignitaries, especially those from countries not
widely represented in the New York electorate. Skip the trips
abroad. Keep a low profile at Christmas-tree-lighting time.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising how often the nation has managed to get along
without a first lady. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson made the
Top Ten Presidents list as widowers. James Monroe presided over the
Era of Good Feeling while his wife stayed in her room, sulking
because she'd been forced to move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of our chief executives have governed without the
assistance of the kind of on-the-go helpmeet we've been primed to
expect as part of the presidential package. Some of the absent
first ladies were ill, others kept to themselves out of shyness or
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Americans saw very little of Ida McKinley, a rather gloomy
invalid who was subject to fits. When Mrs. McKinley had a spell
during White House dinners, her husband covered her head with a
napkin. Chances are, the president's guests weren't all that
disappointed when he arrived at the table alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' challenge is a bit more upbeat: Downsize Hillary's
Washington role to a cameo appearance, and find some furniture to
put in all those rooms in Chappaqua.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
cuddled a 3-year-old girl whose arm had been hacked off by rebels,
then met with rebel leaders responsible for thousands of such
mutilations in this country's eight-year civil war, urging them
Monday to stick to a fragile peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of a weeklong visit to Africa, Albright said
that to insure lasting peace in this small West African nation, it
was critical that the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, take part in the
effort. Sankoh was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but he was
later freed and will occupy a high government position under a
peace deal that granted amnesty to the rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Albright pointedly avoided being photographed with Sankoh _
meeting him behind closed doors and providing no photo
opportunities _ and emphasized the importance of eventually
punishing war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The United States helped broker the peace deal, signed in July
in Lome, Togo, between the government of President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah and Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front. But the agreement
has been criticized by human rights groups as too lenient to those
responsible for some of the worst atrocities seen in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At a camp housing 516 men, women and children _ run by Doctors
Without Borders, the international relief organization that was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last week _ Albright walked around a
courtyard on red earth baked hard by a burning sun.
</P>
<P>
   She met long lines of people, most of whose arms had been
chopped off by machete-wielding rebels. ``It's hard to reach out a
hand to shake hands with somebody and know they do not have a
hand,'' she said later.
</P>
<P>
   Albright picked up a 3-year-old girl named Mamuna, who was
dressed in a red jumper and whose right arm had been taken off at
the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Mutari Jalo, who was missing his right arm and who was acting as
the camp's informal chairman, told her, ``We know the government of
America will help us to alleviate our suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks Monday, Albright said, ``Ultimately, the only way
that reconciliation really can come is if people have a sense that
justice has been done and those who have perpetrated the terrible
crimes are punished individually.''
</P>
<P>
   But she emphasized that peace must first become entrenched in
Sierra Leone, where carrying out the peace accord has been delayed
by bickering among rebel leaders and where 45,000 fighters have yet
to disarm. Sankoh has just returned from visiting a rebel
stronghold to encourage his men to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sankoh is delivering the right message,'' Albright said at a
news conference before meeting with him, ``and I hope very much he
will continue to intensify his efforts to insure full adherence to
the Lome accord. The atrocities must end, and abductees must be
released. The peace must be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sierra Leone's capital, she met Monday with Kabbah and
pledged $55 million in aid _ the only aid announcement made so far
on her trip. Most of it is for food, education and efforts to
control the illegal traffic in diamonds, which fueled the civil war
and has drawn in neighboring Liberia and Burkina Faso at various
points.
</P>
<P>
   She also promised $65 million in debt forgiveness, conditioned
on Sierra Leone's agreement to carry out an International Monetary
Fund economic program.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the American interest in helping Sierra Leone is related
to the Clinton administration's effort to find ways to distinguish
between legitimate diamond sales and those that finance strife in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels in Sierra Leone, as well as those in Angola and
Congo, have used diamond sales to prolong their conflicts. The war
in Sierra Leone appears to have drawn more attention from the
United States because of the nature of the atrocities against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Africa is also viewed by the administration
as an answer to criticism that Washington was prepared to intervene
on humanitarian grounds in Kosovo and more recently to give some
support in East Timor but has not shown such interest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the conflicts in Africa, the situation in Sierra Leone
appeared to be one in which a visit from Albright could shine the
brightest spotlight, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Africa, her third as secretary of state,
began with a brief stop in Guinea. After her visit to Sierra Leone,
Albright arrived on Monday night in Mali, whose successful
transition from dictatorship to democracy has made it a model in an
unstable region. She was headed next to Nigeria, which recently
ended nearly 16 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   She is also to visit Tanzania and Kenya, in East Africa, where
the American embassies were bombed in 1998. On Thursday in
Tanzania, she will attend the state funeral for Julius Nyerere,
that country's founding father.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at the American ambassador's residence here, which
overlooks the green hills and blue bays of this seaside town,
Albright met with Sankoh and another rebel leader, Johnny Paul
Koroma.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit came two weeks after Sankoh's return to Sierra Leone.
His extended stay in Togo, after the peace agreement was signed
there in July, delayed carrying it out. The rebels were supposed to
start disarming in August, and the process is finally expected to
start this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return, Sankoh has said that people must forget the
past and move on. He has yet to visit the war amputees' camp, which
has become an obligatory stop for visiting dignitaries, including
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Koroma, who led another faction, paid a
surprise visit to the camp and, breaking down in tears, pleaded for
forgiveness. The amputees _ who like most ordinary Sierra Leoneans
have expressed grudging support for the peace deal _ jeered at him.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement, Sankoh will become the chairman of a
commission overseeing the country's mineral resources, with the
rank of vice president. Several of his men will occupy other
government positions in a power-sharing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, a cashiered army corporal and former commercial
photographer, began the civil war in 1991, saying that the
country's corrupt rulers had enriched themselves on diamonds while
leaving Sierra Leone one of the poorest countries in the world. He
attracted recruits in rural areas and for many years was rarely
seen as he waged war from the bush.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, his message of economic exploitation was
lost and his fighters became known for the atrocities they
committed.
</P>
<P>
   After Kabbah was elected president in 1996, the rebels began
slicing off civilians' hands _ in retribution, the rebels often
said, for having voted for Kabbah by putting a thumbprint next to
his name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths during the war is thought to be in the tens
of thousands and the number of amputations in the thousands, but
there are no accurate figures.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Africa is her first since President
Clinton's 12-day trip in March 1998. His visit _ with his pledge of
more American interest in the continent, his talk of an African
renaissance and a commitment to integrate African nations in the
international community _ drew enormous attention to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, many Africans and American critics of policy
toward Africa have said the United States has failed to follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States and the rest of the West quickly spent
billions of dollars in conflicts in Kosovo and East Timor, many of
the critics have pointed out that Western countries have done
comparatively little to intervene in civil wars in Sierra Leone,
Congo, Angola and Sudan and in the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea
_ all extremely lethal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has played a leading role in the international
community in assisting the peace process in Sierra Leone,'' the New
York-based Human Rights Watch wrote in a letter to Albright last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the letter continued, the commitment to justice shown to
Sierra Leone falls far short of that shown in Kosovo and East
Timor, ``even though the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone match
or surpass anything seen in these crises.''

 &HT;    Bailey presses legal, ethics battles over right to keep
attorney's fees
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Once a legal giant whose client roster read like
a civics lesson _ he counted Patty Hearst, Sam Sheppard and the
Boston Strangler among his best known besides himself_ F. Lee
Bailey is mired these days in battles over how he earns his legal
fees.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, while he fought a contempt charge over a $2 million
fee in a federal case here, the Florida Bar filed a seven-count
complaint of ethics violations in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Bailey remains unfazed by the assaults, arguing that
federal prosecutors in Orlando are going after what's rightfully
his while the Bar is ``cranking up again,'' as if it exists to
annoy him. Both cases stem from Bailey obtaining multimillion
dollar fees from clients who were ultimately convicted and had to
surrender mansions, boats and millions in cash and stock obtained
through their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once (a judge) looks, he will see there was no breach of
ethics,'' Bailey said of the Bar complaint. As for the Orlando
case, he said, ``every nickel is right in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando case stems from Bailey's representation of
infomercial king William J. McCorkle, who bilked hundreds in a
get-rich-quick scheme that involved buying foreclosed property. The
former stripper and his wife were sentenced last year to 24 years
in prison and ordered to forfeit $10.6 million in assets, including
$7.1 million in Cayman Islands accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When Bailey turned over all but $2 million, which he said
covered his legal fee, the government threatened to hold him in
contempt and send him to jail. Again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bailey spent 44 days in jail after refusing to give up
stock valued at $17 million he said he earned representing a French
drug dealer in Gainesville. That case, in turn, prompted the
lengthy Bar complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bailey's attorney, Richard Lubin, argued that because
Bailey had already spent the McCorkle money, he could neither be
held in contempt or be forced to repay it.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not sound logical, Lubin said the law does not
allow the government to order an attorney to substitute other
assets for the money in question.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled, U.S. Magistrate Judge James Glazebrook asked a
question: If a bank robber used tainted money stained with the
bank's dye to pay his attorney, why can't the government demand
back an equal amount?
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it has to be the very same dollar bill, or traceable,''
Lubin argued. ``If the red dye money (from the bank robbery) came
to me and I bought a car and you could trace the car and I refused
to turn the car over, then you could hold me in contempt,'' he
said. But if no trace is made, the money cannot be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin's first witness was a former IRS agent who traced Bailey's
legitimate spending from the Cayman accounts. Bailey said he also
plans to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin also warned that the Bailey conflict points to a larger
issue involving the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a citizen's
right to legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's ultimately going to mean is just a court-appointed
system,'' he said afterward of government attempts to seize
attorney fees. ``It's a serious issue. There's not enough money now
for public defenders. Court-appointed attorneys are incapable of
functioning on a competent level with the amount they get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bailey: ``The government is trying to drive every private
practitioner out, and they'll have no one to beat up but public
defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Marie DeMarco has argued Bailey knew
the money was illegally obtained and Monday said his keeping the
money was the same as stealing it from the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you steal the money, you have to pay it back. It's really
that simple,'' she said. ``In this case we have a lawyer who did
know from the very beginning ... that the money was obtained
through fraud ... and he sent it (to the Cayman Islands) for the
purposes of avoiding seizure. We have a lawyer in the exact same
position as the lawyer who takes the red dye money.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco pointed out the McCorkle case parallels Bailey's other
contentious battle _ the 1994 Gainesville case involving drug
dealer Claude Duboc _ and submitted transcripts of hearings as
evidence of his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In that case. Bailey and federal prosecutors agreed that he
would hold $3 million in pharmaceutical stock to cover his fee and
maintain Duboc's property until the government, which had seized
it, sold it. When the stock skyrocketed to $17 million after the
company made a break-through in the treatment of AIDS, the
government demanded it back.
</P>
<P>
   In May a federal appeals court upheld the government's right to
the money and Bailey dropped the fight. But he is still arguing for
fees in federal claims court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the Bar alleged Bailey used the money for
personal and business expenses not connected to the case, mingled
the money with his own, misappropriated at least $309,861 and
continued to misuse the money even after the court ordered him to
stop. Bar investigators also said Bailey lied under oath,
improperly communicated with the judge, repeated confidential
communication with his client and should have realized the obvious
conflict his taking the money created between his and his Duboc's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Supreme Court justices will now assign the complaint to
a judge, probably in Fort Myers, for a hearing. The judge would
recommend sanctions _ or no punishment _ to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the McCorkle case continues today and is expected to
wrap up Wednesday.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Hobbled by years of losses and high debts, Nissan Motor
Co. surprised Japan and the auto industry Monday with details of a
radical overhaul plan that will make unexpectedly deep cuts at the
company, Japan's No. 3 automaker, and reverberate more broadly
through the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year plan, presented by Nissan's aggressive new
chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, three plants will be closed
and 21,000 jobs eliminated, most of them in Japan. Nissan will also
halve its supplier base and close 10 percent of its dealerships,
with the objective of returning to profitability in the next fiscal
year, starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that a lot of people at Nissan will feel like
orphans in this plan,'' Ghosn said at a briefing for reporters and
securities analysts, where the details were released. ``But we have
no choice, and the fact that we have no choice is the strength of
our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He was echoed by Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president. ``There
is no other alternative for us,'' Hanawa said. ``In order for us to
survive, we must implement this revival plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Nissan spokesman, said that 1,400 jobs in the
United States would be eliminated through attrition and the sale of
divisions as part of the 21,000-person reduction in employment.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan plans to sell a 530-employee forklift division in
Illinois and a 380-person computer operations unit, he said, adding
that the remaining 490 jobs would disappear through attrition among
Nissan's 11,000 American employees, with no layoffs planned.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the plan took securities analysts and executives
from other car companies by surprise, although its general
parameters were well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the numbers are concerned, it's even better than
expected,'' said Koji Endo, an analyst at Schroders Japan Ltd.,
speaking presumably of Nissan's aim of a return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the plan is like other corporate
reorganizations in Japan these days, but the magnitude of Nissan's
cuts makes it likely that its effects will be felt more strongly
than most others. About 500 parts and materials suppliers, for
instance, will lose Nissan's business, and the communities affected
by plant closings, still a rarity in Japan, could feel the most
acute impact.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan also plans to sell most of the shares it holds in
companies that have been linked through loans and
cross-shareholding, reducing its obligations to them as well as the
impact of stock-market fluctuations on its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few of those companies we consider as indispensable,''
Ghosn said. ``Over the next three years, a lot of these companies
will be out of the reach of Nissan.''
</P>
<P>
   How those businesses and communities respond to the challenge
created by Nissan Monday may in turn help shape the future of other
Japanese businesses. In the same way that closing three of Nissan's
plants is aimed at improving the productivity of its remaining
factories, a supplier forced to become more competitive might be
expected to become a healthier business.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn and Hanawa acknowledged that their plan is nothing until
it is executed. ``Ninety-five percent of the work remains,'' Hanawa
said. ``It is not going to be an easy process. It will be a very
difficult one.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be costly to Nissan. The company will take a 200
billion yen accounting charge, or about $1.9 billion, to cover the
costs of the restructuring in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn said the year's losses would be much larger than the 60
billion yen the company had forecast in May. In addition, Nissan's
liabilities will swell this year as changes in accounting rules
force it to include previously unrecognized pension and other
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The financial pain will not be limited to Nissan, either.
Renault SA, the French carmaker that purchased a 36.8 percent stake
in Nissan in March and installed Ghosn and several other foreign
executives to help lead a turnaround, said Monday that it would
take a $317 million accounting charge related to its Japanese
partner's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's costs in human terms and in corporate pride are
expected to be even greater. Traditional labor practices and tough
labor laws make layoffs as they are known in the United States
virtually impossible. ``The plan is roughly what the doctor
ordered,'' said Jay Woodworth, an independent automotive analyst.
``Now I hope Mr. Ghosn has all his ducks in a row, and in
particular has Nissan's labor union on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the rest of his speech was straightforward, Ghosn
finessed the part on job reductions, using the same cautious
language employed by Japanese executives forced to broach that
uncomfortable subject. He said Nissan, which has a global work
force of around 148,000, plans to prune its work force through
attrition, the increased use of part-time employees, spinoffs and
``early retirement,'' a euphemism in Japan for layoffs sweetened by
generous severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Endo of Schroders said he had spoken with the chairman of the
company's union not long ago, who told him the union would be
unhappy with any job cuts of more than 3,000. While it is almost
unheard of for Japanese unions to strike, their cooperation is
considered critical to the plan's success.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn and Hanawa played down such concerns Monday. ``Already in
the past we have had reallocations of personnel,'' Hanawa said.
``This won't be a first-time experience.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, the plan was blunt and direct. ``The key
facts and figures about Nissan point to a reality: Nissan is in bad
shape,'' Ghosn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese automaker's market share has dropped to 4.9 percent
worldwide from 6.6 percent in 1991. It has turned a profit in only
one of the last seven years, and its debts, excluding potential
liabilities related to leasing cars, are estimated at $12.6 billion
by the close of this fiscal year, at the end of March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring plan presents a litany of cuts that go beyond
plants and workers: Purchasing costs, which now eat up 58 percent
of Nissan's net sales, will be cut 20 percent. Platforms, the
backbone of a vehicle, will be reduced to 14 from the current 24 by
2002, and to 12 by 2004, and Renault and Nissan will produce some
cars on the same platforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Ghosn made it clear that the plan was not only about cutting
back and casting away, but also about creating new,
more-exciting-looking vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product development will be at the heart of Nissan's
revival,'' he said. In one sign of Ghosn's commitment, the design
team in Japan is being removed from the engineering group and
placed under the oversight of Patrick Pelata, the French head of
product development, in hopes of insuring that Nissan's future
models will have greater consumer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's plan was announced after the stock market closed here.
Earlier, its shares tumbled 7.1 percent to 637 yen, or $6.06. Later
in New York, Nissan's American depository receipts closed unchanged
on NASDAQ at $12.875. Renault shares fell a little more than 2
percent in Paris to 49.9 euros, or $54.10.

<P>
   Harold Clarence Passer, an economic forecaster for business and
the government, including the Nixon White House, died on Oct. 8 at
his home in Portsmouth, N.H., where he retired in 1983. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Passer served as assistant secretary of commerce for economic
affairs from 1969 to 1973. At the time, he sat on the President's
Council of Economic Advisers and regularly appeared at news
conferences about the country's economic health and prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after his years in Washington, he worked as an
economic analyst for the Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester and was the
company's assistant treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Passer was born in Lakefield, Minn. He graduated summa
cum laude in 1943 from Harvard University, where he earned an
master's degee in economics in 1948 and a doctorate in the subject
in 1950. He taught economics at Harvard before joining Eastman
Kodak in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Passer also lectured at the University of Rochester and Cornell
University. He served as chairman of the New York State Council of
Economic Education in the 1970s and earlier as a consultant to the
Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote many articles and a book, ``The Electrical
Manufacturers'' (1953). Passer is survived by his wife of 32 years,
Astrid Louise Anderson Passer; a stepdaughter, Christine Thurber
Streeter of Portland, Maine; a stepson, Dr. David C. Thurber Jr. of
Raleigh, N.C.; and a sister, Carolyn Passer of Faribault, Minn. &QL;

 &HT;    Irene still doing damage
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins, Sally D. Swartz and Jim Reeder
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A major raw sewage spill Monday afternoon
suddenly eclipsed power outages and flooding on the list of
Hurricane Irene-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   In an incident officials say was likely caused by a tremendous
increase in stormwater that surged into Fort Pierce Utility
Authority plumbing, a 36-inch pipe burst, causing untreated sewage
to spill out onto the authority's plant grounds and pour into the
Indian River at the rate of about 625,000 gallons an hour. By 8
p.m. Monday, between three million and six million gallons of
sewage had drained into the river, said Fort Pierce Utilities
Authority director of operations Tom Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure exactly what occurred but it's pretty big,'' he
said of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   He said the authority notified the St. Lucie Health Department
and the state Department of Environmental Protection. Boaters and
others on the river were warned to steer clear of the plant on
Seaway Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The burst pipe was 15 years old, ``We never would have expected
it to fail,'' he said. ``I would expect a pipe like that to last 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, about five million to six million gallons a day flow
through the pipe, but with Irene's rains that rose to 15 million
gallons a day, Richards said, adding he suspected the increased
flow at least partly caused the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's too much of a coincidence to say that it's
not related,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The massive spill capped a day which saw Treasure Coast
residents cleaning up flooded homes, while government workers
repaired damage to public buildings in both counties.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 17,000 St. Lucie County and 4,000 Martin County residents
still had no electricity at noon Monday, but Florida Power &AMP; Light
Co. officials expected to have service restored to most or all
areas by late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eight to 10 inches of rain from the storm were reported in
Martin County. Emergency officials reported gusts up to 92 mph on
Jupiter Island during the storm and sustained hurricane force wind
of 75 mph in various parts of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Damage assessments are still underway. Federal, state and local
officials were out in the field Monday and may have a preliminary
estimate of the damage today, St. Lucie's Emergency Management
Director Jack Southard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a very preliminary figure for wind damage only of
$140,000 to $155,000,'' Southard said. ``More reports are coming in
and there's flood damage on top of that.''
</P>
<P>
   County Administrator Doug Anderson said he drove around Saturday
and saw extensive flooding in Lakewood Park and Indian River
Estates. Houses near Bell Avenue and South 25th Street were also
flooded
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a lot of trees toppled because the ground was so wet,
carports and screen rooms damaged,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson plans a helicopter flight with officials from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to assess the damage today.
</P>
<P>
   And taxpayers will be paying for Irene's blow in additional
areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ The toll for the South Florida Water Management District will
top $5 million, according to spokeswoman Ann Overton. That includes
$2.5 million in damage to district buildings, $2.3 million in
damage to canals, and about $127,000 spent per day on extra staff
to deal with the storm.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Florida Department of Transportation will spend at least
$1 million to repair damage to state roads in South Florida,
according to spokeswoman Barbara Kelleher. That includes a $150,000
repair job for the interchange at Interstate 95 and Indiantown
road, which suffered heavy erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers begins today to release water
from swolen Lake Okeechobee, now at 17.47 feet, about 8 1/2 inches
higher than normal for this time of year. An estimated 2.9 billion
gallons daily will be dumped in the Caloosahatchee River to the
west of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Corps workers wakened Col. Joe Miller, the Corps' chief for the
state of Florida, at 3 a.m. Saturday for permission to open the St.
Lucie gates wider. ``We were afraid the structure would be damaged
if we didn't,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Local runoff still is pouring through the St. Lucie canal
spillway into the St. Lucie River at a rate of 1.9 billion gallons
a day, and that amount probably will remain about the same when the
Corps decides to release water from lake, Corps spokeswoman
Jacquelyn Griffin said. That decision could come as early as today,
but the Corps will stay in close touch with Martin County officials
so flooded areas downstream aren't further damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas in Martin and St. Lucie counties were slow to drain
because fallen trees blocked creeks and feeder canals, water
district spokesman Paul Millar said. A breach in a reservoir dike
at Riverland Groves Monday sent grove runoff into the C-23 canal,
which runs along the Martin-St. Lucie county line into the St.
Lucie River, Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   Irene's winds damaged several St. Lucie County buildings,
including libraries, the County Administration Building and
warehouses. Most seriously damaged were the courthouse and the
Legal Arts Building in downtown Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning equipment on the courthouse roof was damaged by
the wind and inoperable Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof came off the Legal Arts Building and it's
uninhabitable,'' St. Lucie Administrator Anderson said. ``We have
to find new offices for the Guardian Ad Litem program and new
storage space for the court records that got wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Dwight Geiger postponed jury selection until this
morning because of the lack of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 street signs throughout the county are missing,
blown away or their poles broken by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hopes to have a damage figure by tonight's County
Commission meeting so he can ask permission to transfer money from
reserves to pay for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In Martin County, a section of County Road 609 in the
southwestern part of the county washed out in the storm and some
unpaved roads were impassable for low-riding vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the new Blake Library on Monterey Road in Stuart was
damaged and a maintenance building nearby at Witham Field had major
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Martin County Chapter of the American Red Cross reported
about 40 homes received mostly minor damage from wind or water,
Executive Director Mary Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is offering assistance with food, temporary
shelter and clothing for those affected by the storm and has vans
touring neighborhoods offering bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County Health Department officials are advising residents
to boil drinking water if their wells were submerged or if their
water company lost power. No contamination to any water supplies
was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Martin County opened on time Monday, but only after
maintenance crews spent the weekend mopping up and making repairs
at several schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Hobe Sound Elementary, the carpet in the media center had to
be replaced and four classrooms had at least 3 inches of standing
water in them, said Jerry Smith, director of facilities for the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Power was knocked out at South Fork High School until 2 a.m.
Monday, and sewer lines were replaced at Martin County High.
</P>
<P>
   Across the county, water seeped in through doorways and windows.
``We took a lot of water intrusion at just about every site,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Damage at St. Lucie County schools was relatively minor,
although one school, Woodlands Academy, remained without power
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   C.A. Moore Elementary required fascia repairs, and Port St.
Lucie Elementary was without electricity until about 6 p.m. Sunday.
Other schools reported roof leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think overall we're OK,'' said Senior Project Manager Andrew
Favata.
</P>
<P>
   A fish kill off Hutchinson Island in St. Lucie County discovered
Monday was blamed on winds from Irene that caused a drop in the
water's oxygen levels. As many as 20,000 mullet were found floating
in Big Mud Creek off the Indian River, near FPL's St. Lucie Nuclear
Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
   The creek includes a large back bay where fine silt settles on
the bottom, Department of Environmental Protection biologist Doug
Strom said. Decaying material on the bottom was stirred up by
strong eastern winds that robbed oxygen from the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This same thing has occurred at this site a couple of times in
the last few years,'' Strom said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen levels in the water are returning to normal, Strom said
Monday
</P>
<P>
   In Okeechobee County, where about 60 percent of the residences
are mobile homes, the wind was the main problem, said Gene O'Neill,
the county's director of emergency management. The wind was
sustained at 40 to 45 mph and blew in gusts of 55 to 60 mph in the
county, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some mobile homes that had some damage from carports,
screen rooms and partial roofs blown off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the county had shelters on standby that could have
opened them in 15 minutes, but ``didn't feel it was necessary'' to
open them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our decision,'' he said.

 &HT;    Ted Celeste may make Senate run
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ohio Democrats could find a familiar name on
the ballot when they go to the polls next March to pick a U.S.
Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Celeste, younger brother of former two-term Gov. Richard F.
Celeste, said Monday that he is ``taking a look'' at the race.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have much time before the Jan. 7 filing deadline but
said, ``I am trying to give it as serious consideration as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat, Richard Cordray of suburban Columbus, an
unsuccessful candidate for Ohio attorney general last year, entered
the Senate race last week. A second candidate, Marvin McMickle,
pastor of a Baptist church in Cleveland, is expected to announce
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Celeste, 54, who recently stepped down as chairman of the Ohio
State University board of trustees, is president of a real estate
company in Grandview Heights, a Columbus suburb. While he has never
ran for elective office, he has run several statewide campaigns
from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he has discussed the Senate race with his older
brother, now U.S. ambassador to India.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother told him that a statewide race against an
incumbent _ Republican Sen. Mike DeWine _ would be an ``uphill
battle'' and require him to raise a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Celeste was on the statewide ballot four times from 1974
to 1986 _ three times for governor and once for lieutenant
governor. Richard Celeste left office at the end of 1990 after his
second term.
</P>
<P>
   The Celeste name would be an advantage, said state Sen. Rhine
McLin, D-Dayton, who succeeded her father, the late C. J. McLin, in
the Ohio House before going on to the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it like this,'' McLin said. ``Half the politics in
Ohio is a name game.''

   ATLANTA _ As incredible as it may seem, the Atlanta Braves have
the look of a loser. They have actually positioned themselves to
suffer another post-season disappointment. The Mets, on the other
hand, have put themselves in position to be winners. Who woulda
thunk it?

   The score of the National League Championship Series still
favors the Braves. With three victories, they need to win only once
more to attain their coveted goal of getting to the World Series.

Wednesday night, if necessary, they would seem to have the odds on
their side.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets would have to win both games to spoil the Braves'
plans. Their pitching prospects are not as favorable as the Braves'
well-rested duo. Al Leiter starts Game 6 on three days' rest for
only the second time in his career, and a yet-to-be-named pitcher
would start Game 7 out of rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But recent developments suggest a different scenario. They
create at least the possibility of the Mets becoming the first team
of the 24 that have started a seven-game post-season series 0-3 to
win the next four games and the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, to begin with, have squandered late-inning leads in
the last two games. They were four outs from the World Series with
a 2-1 lead in Game 4 and lost, 3-2, and they were two outs from the
World Series with a 3-2 lead in Game 5 and lost, 4-3. Now they are
27 outs or 54 outs from the World Series. The task becomes tougher.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't simply that they lost Game 5 by allowing the Mets
to score two runs in the second half of the sixth hour Sunday
night; it was the way they played in the many innings leading up to
that juncture and their reaction afterward that raised questions
about the ability of the Braves to hold on to their once seemingly
insurmountable lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves put 25 runners on base and drove in only three of
them. In a middle-innings stretch, nine of 14 Braves batters
reached base, and none scored. As good as the Braves have been all
year, they could not figure out a way to push even one of those
runners across. ``It's a problem,'' said Don Baylor, their
playoff-experienced hitting coach. ``It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, after the game, the Braves' hitters did not take
responsibility for their failure to hit when they had opportunities
to drive in runs. They bemoaned the inability to hold the one-run
lead they had going into the Mets' half of the 15th. They didn't
come right out and say it was Kevin McGlinchy's fault, but the
rookie pitcher was the one who gave up the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the Braves at their finest moment, and
uncharacteristic though it might have been, the scene did reflect a
different mind-set from what the Braves usually have. It presented
a different picture, too, one in which the Braves didn't have the
look of a team going to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood might have added to their questionable look Monday when
he praised the Mets' ability and said, ``It wouldn't surprise us
whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What might happen if the Mets take a lead early in Tuesday
night's game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll jump out to an early lead like we did in
Cincinnati,'' John Franco said, referring to the playoff for the
wild-card spot when the game was only two batters old and the Mets
had a 2-0 lead. ``If you jump out to an early lead, it puts
pressure on them to be a little more aggressive at the plate, maybe
swing at pitches they normally wouldn't swing at, try to make
things happen instead of being patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who benefited from the early lead against the Reds,
recalled another post-season Game 6 in which the team trailing by
three games to two had the lead. It was the Philadelphia Phillies
in the 1993 World Series, and they were leading Toronto, 6-5, until
Joe Carter clouted an electrifying three-run home run in the ninth
inning that ended the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all along we thought we had them,'' said Leiter, a
member of the Blue Jays then. ``But if we had lost Game 6, we
wouldn't have felt too good about Game 7. If the Phillies had won
that game, there would have been a total momentum swing to them.
Tomorrow is do or die for us, but emotionally the answers will be
different after tomorrow's game if we win as far as where the
pressure lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood expressed the precise feeling Leiter recalled, saying,
``We definitely don't want it to go to a seventh game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are only the second team in history to win Games 4 and
5 after losing the first three games of a four-of-seven series. The
NLCS has produced both of those series, the first coming only last
year, when the Braves won those two games before losing Game 6 to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   No team, of course, has gone from 0-3 to 3-3, but the Mets would
surprise no one at this point if they became the first. ``There's
some kind of 1-800 psychic line behind us the way things have been
happening,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Leiter observation is at play here. After he beat the
Braves in New York last month and ended the Mets' seven-game losing
streak, he cited similarities between that game and the one in
which he beat the Yankees in June and ended an eight-game losing
streak. He also noted that his June victory began a four-game
winning streak and that a four-game winning streak was what the
Mets needed to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They lost the next day to the Braves but achieved the four-game
winning streak anyway, beating Pittsburgh in the last three games
of the regular season, then knocking off the Reds in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets fell behind the Braves, 3-0, what did they need to
advance to the World Series? A four-game winning streak. They are
halfway there. Leiter, however, didn't want to talk about the
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of it,'' he said. ``We don't want to jinx
our chances.''

CITIGROUP REPORTS BIG REBOUND IN PROFIT FOR 3RD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services
company, said Monday that its third-quarter profit had more than
tripled as its banking and trading businesses rebounded from a weak
performance a year earlier, when global financial turmoil hurt big
banks and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of rising revenue and sharp cost-cutting helped
improve results for virtually every segment of Citigroup's
far-flung operations, from making consumer loans to trading bonds
through its Salomon Smith Barney investment-banking unit. At the
rate it has been going in 1999, Citigroup would end the year with
nearly $10 billion in annual profit.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding $15 million in restructuring charges, Citigroup earned
$2.45 billion, or 70 cents a diluted share, compared with $729
million, or 20 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1998. The
results were about even with those for the second quarter of this
year and slightly higher than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Of 22 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, the
average estimate was 68 cents a share. Citigroup's stock rose
$1.562, to $43.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major banks, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.,
also reported net income Monday that exceeded analysts' estimates.
Bank of New York Co. reported record earnings that were inflated by
a large gain on the sale of a business.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., earned $2.15 billion,
or $1.23 a diluted share, up from $893 million, or 50 cents a
share, excluding merger-related charges. That total exceeded
analysts' expectations of $1.21 a share, according to First Call.
Bank of America's shares rose $1.375, to $49.5625.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan posted a bigger surprise, reporting net income of
$442 million, or $2.22 a diluted share, up from $156 million, or 75
cents a share, in the third quarter of 1998. Its stock jumped
$7.3125, to $113.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New York reported net income of $773 million, or $1.02 a
share, but that total included a gain of $573 million, or 75 cents
a share, from the sale of a business-financing unit. A big increase
in the bank's provision for loan losses ate into the bank's
operating profit for the quarter. It set aside $90 million to cover
bad loans, up 500 percent from $15 million in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Bank of New York to earn 42 cents a share.
Its stock gained 43.75 cents, to $34.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers indicate the health of the banking industry,''
said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
``Bank earnings continue to be quite robust and credit quality is
still quite pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   The generally strong performances by the banks demonstrated how
much healthier the market remained last quarter for financial
services tailored for consumers than those aimed at investors and
corporate customers. Citigroup and other multinational banks
reported smaller declines overall from the second to third quarters
than did their counterparts on Wall Street, whose fortunes are tied
more tightly to the ups and downs of the stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the consumer businesses are really driving
earnings momentum'' at Citigroup, said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``This company embodies the concept of
diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Citigroup is involved in more sectors of the financial
services industry than any other U.S. company. Along with its
commercial and investment banks, it is a major player in insurance
through its Travelers unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Weill, one of the company's two chairmen and chief
executive officers, said he was happy to hear that lawmakers in
Washington were progressing toward passage of a bill that would
reform Depression-era rules that separate the banking, insurance
and brokerage industries. The merger of Citicorp and Travelers that
created Citigroup might have to be restructured if long-anticipated
changes in those laws are not approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar said he thinks Citigroup will hold off on making any
more acquisitions until the legislative issues are sorted out. But
once they are, he said, the company could start spending some of
the cash it has been building up. He estimated that Citigroup has
about $7 billion more than required by regulators. That excess
capital could be spent on acquisitions or to buy back stock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weill and John Reed, the company's other chairman and chief
executive officer, described last quarter in unexciting terms,
suggesting that the company is humming along after a period of
post-merger turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to make those gains without having to take major
risks in some of our businesses,'' said the famously risk-averse
Weill. ``All of this was done without overleveraging our balance
sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he pointed to the shrinkage of the highly
volatile bond-trading operation Travelers inherited when it bought
the Salomon Brothers investment bank before merging with Citicorp.
Weill said that the capital committed to that trading unit, known
as global arbitrage, had declined by more than 90 percent, to $7
billion from $100 billion. He declined to comment on published
reports that some traders in the unit may leave to start one or
more hedge funds and that CitiGroup is considering investing in the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bond arbitrage, making huge bets on small discrepancies in the
prices of various bonds, was responsible for the bulk of the loss
of $1.3 billion that Salomon Smith Barney incurred in the third
quarter of 1998 when investors stampeded out of emerging markets
after Russia defaulted on its debt. Overall last quarter, the
corporate and investment banking division, which includes Salomon
Smith Barney, earned $1.15 billion. That compared with a loss of
$221 million a year earlier and a gain of $1.26 billion in the
second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's global consumer businesses, including lending and
insurance, had income of $1.12 billion, up 38 percent from $806
million a year before. Claims for damage caused by Hurricane Floyd
cut into profit for the personal-lines insurance business but
profit from commercial lines of insurance rose 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Travelers management has instilled a
cost-cutting discipline that has Citigroup on track to surpass its
stated goal of reducing annual expenses by $2 billion by the end of
this year. The company's return on equity, a key measure of
profitability, was 21.9 percent, exceeding the company's target of
20 percent on average.

ONYX AND WARNER-LAMBERT AGREE TO JOINTLY DEVELOP NEW CANCER DRUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Monday that it
had entered a collaborative agreement with the Warner-Lambert Co.
to jointly develop and market a new cancer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Warner will pay Onyx, a biotech company based in Richmond,
Calif., up to $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx has developed a novel therapy that uses a
genetically-modified virus to kill cancer cells. The drug has been
tested in more than 200 patients, and Onyx said it expects to begin
a phase 3 trial in head and neck cancer by the end of the year. The
Food and Drug Administration typically requires three phases of
clinical trials before considering a new drug for marketing
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx shares closed at $8.875, up 25 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
Warner-Lambert shares closed at $70.5625, up $2.6875, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal was a critical one for Onyx, which had
only enough cash to survive another nine months and could not
afford to fund the phase 3 trial without assistance. Together with
its acquisition earlier this year of Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
the deal helps move Warner-Lambert further into the area of
oncology.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the deal, Warner-Lambert will make a
cash payment and equity investment in Onyx over the next two years
totaling $15 million and will provide $40 million in funding for
the Phase 3 trials and other ongoing studies for the drug,
currently known as ONYX-015. Warner-Lambert will also provide
support for the research and development of two new additional
products. In addition to the committed funding, more than $100
million could be payable to Onyx on the achievement of milestones
such as positive trial results or marketing approval.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx and Warner-Lambert will co-promote ONYX-015 and the two new
products in the United States and Canada, and will share equally in
resulting profits. Warner-Lambert will commercialize the products
in the rest of the world and will pay Onyx a royalty on net sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite enthusiastic about this arrangement on several
fronts,'' Hollings Renton, Onyx's president and chief executive,
said in a telephone interview. ``The ability to share ONYX-015 and
the two new additional products in the U.S. and Canada, plus this
financial support gives us the opportunity to become a fully
integrated specialty oncology company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx has a previous agreement with Warner in which it supplies
biological targets and screening tests for the development of
conventional cancer drugs. Drugs resulting from that agreement will
be marketed by Warner with Onyx receiving a royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we've had such a great relationship with
Warner-Lambert that we have a great deal of comfort in this
arrangement,'' Renton said.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx-015 is an adenovirus that has been genetically altered so
that it only replicates in cells that are lacking a gene called
P-53, which is a known tumor suppressor. Because cancer cells lack
the gene, the virus multiplies in them and ultimately destroys
them. It has no effect on normal cells. In patients, side effects
have been limited to flu-like symptoms that typically go away after
a few days. Onyx is also studying ways to use the virus to carry
therapeutic genes to tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``One issue with this drug is that patients do mount an immune
response against the virus,'' said Sushant Kumar, an analyst with
Mehta Partners. That has not had an impact in the head and neck
cancer trials where the virus is injected directly into the tumor,
but could be of more importance in trials for liver, pancreas and
colorectal cancer, where the drug would be given systemically.
``That is something to be aware of for the expanded use of this
approach,'' he said. &QL;

TOP AMERICANS FIND SAILING SMOOTH IN AMERICA'S CUP QUALIFYING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The top three skippers in the United
States' bid to recapture the America's Cup won all five of the
races they sailed Monday as the four-month, eight-nation campaign
for the cup began here.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Americans gained one victory between them in four
starts, with two of the defeats inflicted by rival U.S. boats.
</P>
<P>
   But facing a marathon program of up to 400 races to qualify for
a showdown next February with the current Cup holder, New Zealand,
the winning crews declined to read much into their initial
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Bright morning sunshine and light breezes welcomed crews from
seven nations to the 3-mile course off Rangitoto Island, an ancient
volcano in Hauraki Gulf 15 miles north of this port city.
</P>
<P>
   But afternoon rain squalls, swept by freshening 11-knot gales
sent many of the 150 spectator boats home early, and one crewman,
Simone de Mare, of the Italian yacht Luna Rossa, was tipped
overboard while struggling to control a wayward spinnaker. He was
pulled aboard unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ten one-on-one races, each of them four legs covering 12 miles,
were sailed on this first day of the four-month regatta.
</P>
<P>
   These grueling qualifying stages comprise what is known as the
Louis Vuitton Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand defender, which defeated the United States off
San Diego in 1995, followed events at a discreet distance, cruising
one of its black-hulled yachts within sight of the challenge
racers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yacht Club, which held the Cup from 1851 to 1983,
began its second attempt to regain it with two victories Monday.
Its skipper, Ed Baird, led his craft, Young America, in comfortable
victories against modest opposition from San Francisco's America
True and then the Spanish entrant, Bravo Espana.
</P>
<P>
   The rival San Francisco yachts, America One and America True,
clashed Monday as well. America True, skippered by Dawn Riley, the
first woman to head an America's Cup syndicate, lost by 3 minutes
45 seconds in an afternoon event, after sailing more strongly in
the morning race and losing by only 37 seconds to the New York
Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   Abracadabra, entered by the Waikiki Yacht Club, and skippered by
John Kolius, defeated the Swiss entry, optimistically named Be
Happy, by 10 minutes. However, earlier, after some apparent winch
problems, the Hawaiian yacht lost by 40 seconds to Nippon Challenge
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The senior American skipper here, veteran Dennis Conner, began
his eighth Cup campaign with a cliff hanger, edging the lightly
rated French opponent, Sixth Sense, by only 9 seconds. The French
made a last-leg spinnaker rush at Conner's San Diego-based Stars
and Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   The official summary of the day _ issued by ocean race experts
advising the events sponsor _ declared that ``due to extremely
tricky and changeable conditions, it is unreasonable to draw any
serious conclusions'' from Monday's races.
</P>
<P>
   However, the three undefeated Americans, the Japanese, with one
victory, and Italians, with two wins, started impressively Monday.

IRENE HESKES, AN HISTORIAN OF MUSIC IN THE YIDDISH THEATER, DIES AT
75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.J.)   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irene Heskes, a historian and author who specialized
in sacred and secular Jewish music, including music of the Yiddish
theater, died on Thursday at Long Island Jewish Hospital. She was
76 and lived in the Forest Hills neighborhood in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was aplastic anemia, said Dr. Alan M. Kraut, her
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heskes was born in Brooklyn and studied music and history at
New York University, voice and piano at the Juilliard School, music
education at the Eastman School of Music and arts administration at
Harvard. She completed her studies of Jewish music at the School of
Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College and the Cantors Institute at
the Jewish Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Because she studied cantorial music in the 1950s, long before
cantorial positions were available to women, Ms. Heskes worked as a
researcher, writer and lecturer for the Theodor Herzl Institute of
the Jewish Agency from 1964 to 1976. She was also the director of
the National Jewish Music Council from 1968 to 1980 and a
consultant to the American Jewish Historical Society and to
libraries and academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Ms. Heskes founded the American Yiddish Theater Music
Restoration and Revival Project. Under her direction the project
assembled, cataloged and microfilmed a comprehensive collection of
Yiddish theater music, which is now available for study at the
Library of Congress. In 1992 the library published Ms. Heskes'
annotated catalog and resource book based on the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heskes also wrote extensively about Jewish music for
academic publications and Jewish newspapers and magazines, and she
wrote several books that covered the expanse of Jewish composition,
including ``The Cantorial Art'' (1966); ``Ernest Bloch: Creative
Spirit,'' with Suzanne Bloch, the composer's daughter (1976); ``The
Resource Book of Jewish Music'' (1985); ``The Music of Abraham
Goldfaden: Father of the Yiddish Theater'' (1990); ``Yiddish
American Popular Songs, 1895 to 1950'' (1992), and ``Passport to
Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions and Culture'' (1994). At the
time of her death she was working on another book,
``Yiddish-American Music: Melodies of Immigration, Acculturation
and Assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heskes is survived by her husband, Jacob Heskes; a daughter,
Deborah Aviva Kraut of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Walter Morris Heskes
of Edison, N.J., a granddaughter and two grandsons.

PIERRE MOULIN, WHO STARTED PIERRE DEUX SHOPS, DIES AT 73  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pierre Moulin, who with his business partner, Pierre
LeVec, created the Pierre Deux fabric shops and the charming
Provencal mix of colorful cotton, glazed tile and antique armoires
known as the Pierre Deux look, died Sunday at his Greenwich Village
apartment here. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   He died after a long battle with prostate cancer, said Jack
Bermingham, manager of Pierre Deux Antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Moulin was born into a prosperous bourgeois family in
Maisons-Laffitte, a suburb of Paris. His father, who died when he
was 5, owned a rug factory that employed 800 people, and his
grandmother was friends with Coco Chanel and Jean Lanvin.
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, the family lost most of its money, along
with its castle in Normandy. His mother took a job in the south of
France at Pierre's boarding school, from which Moulin graduated.
After World War II, he went to England and got a job on a farm in
Somerset, where he ran the dairy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was there I found my first serious love, farming,'' he
said. ``I knew I'd never be happy until I had a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised in two different worlds,'' he said, ``one
sophisticated, Parisian. My aunt had a fashion house. And on the
other side, I fancied myself as a farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he returned to France and began work for the Marshall
Plan, where he met LeVec. Later, when LeVec worked in Washington,
Moulin set up a farm in Winchester, Va., where he raised 25,000
broiling chickens and won prizes for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   When LeVec retired, the two men carried out a long-held dream.
In 1967, they opened an antiques shop on the ground floor of a
mid-19th-century brick town house on Bleecker Street in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Moulin had some pillows made from gaily
decorated French peasant fabrics and scattered them around their
upholstered furniture. The two Pierres began importing the fabric,
made by Soleidado in the south of France, and customers came in
droves. Before long, there were 22 Pierre Deux shops around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Moulin found something else so old it was new:
Toile de Jouy fabric, the fine-lined historical-document prints
that had captured the imagination of the 18th-century French. With
its depictions of American Indians, balloon flights and Lafayette's
battles, the material was by then passe; most of the printing
rollers had been turned into lamp stands. But Moulin unearthed some
in the basements of French factories, and he and LeVec invested
heavily into putting the patterns back into production. Decorators
pounced on the toiles, using them for pillows, wall coverings and
bed skirts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the men retired, selling all but one of the shops and
the fabric line and keeping only the original Bleecker Street
antiques shop.
</P>
<P>
   That year, they bought Callendar House in Tivoli, N.Y. The
house, built in 1794 and remodeled by McKim, Mead &AMP; White around
1910, was already a showplace. In the hands of Moulin, the
decorator, it was further polished into a hospitable establishment
run with old-fashioned magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   Even after LeVec's death a year and a half ago, Moulin kept a
staff: a live-in cook, a groundskeeper, a gardener and a
housekeeper. Callendar House was the scene of frequent parties and
charity events, notably baroque music concerts to benefit local
music groups.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Moulin reluctantly put Callendar House on the market,
saying it had become too big for him.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a half-sister, Dominique Delmedico of Florida.

ADVERTISING: CAMPAIGN IS PREPARED FOR LAUNCH AT COCA-COLA  
(DW) 
 STUART ELLIOTT AND CONSTANCE L. HAYS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ga.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Coca-Cola Co., the maker of the world's
best-known brand, will soon be exhorting consumers to take what
amounts to a magical mystery tour of the mouth by enjoying the
``unique taste sensation'' and ``sparkle on your tongue'' of its
flagship product.
</P>
<P>
   Starting early next year, the company will promote its
best-selling brand _ known as Coca-Cola Classic in North America
and Coca-Cola elsewhere _ in more emotional, elemental ways
intended to resonate with consumers who tell market researchers
they value attributes like authenticity and optimism and have been
eschewing colas in favor of beverages like water, juices and
flavored teas.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul of the flagship brand's advertising, marketing,
promotions and graphics, which amounts to a re-introduction of the
venerable soft drink, will end campaigns that have carried the
theme ``Always Coca-Cola'' since 1993. The changes will also
involve a revamping of Coca-Cola's relationship with its myriad
agencies around the world as the task of providing strategy for
sales pitches is centralized at the company and the duties for
creating ads for the flagship brand are narrowed to a shorter list
of shops. &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Frenette, chief marketing officer at Coca-Cola in
Atlanta, outlined the new magic-tinged methods of selling Coke in a
90-minute interview Monday at the company's New York office in
midtown Manhattan. While he described as premature discussion of
details like the new brand theme, he discussed generally a sweeping
overhaul of how Coca-Cola will be sold, from redesigning employee
uniforms to increasing the availability of modern versions of
Coke's traditional contoured bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette's talk of ``fireworks on the tongue'' and ``a little
magic'' generated by quaffing what he acknowledged was ``just a
soft drink'' sounded like phrases lifted from the pages of the
Harry Potter books. Coca-Cola could use such sorcery to enliven
sales of its flagship brand, which have been inching forward
worldwide but more slowly than during the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola Classic has held its own through the '90s,'' said
Gary Hemphill, vice president at the Beverage Marketing Corp., a
research, data and consulting company in New York. ``But they
always want to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola has gotten big by thinking small,'' he added,
``emphasizing broad-based marketing themes and focusing locally.
It's Coke's challenge to connect better with consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaigns for Coca-Cola will cover the United States and
overseas markets, where Coke sales have been disappointing in the
last year, hampered by economic crises and retail price increases.
</P>
<P>
   The reason ``Always'' is not forever is that although it
``served us extremely well,'' Frenette said, it was perhaps more
about ``Coca-Cola the institution'' than ``Coca-Cola the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy we're embarking upon is one of reconnecting with
consumers today,'' he added, by offering them ``an invitation to
view life through the optimistic lens that Coke provides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding people looking for touchstones,'' he added,
``that are real and dependable and genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking a Coke is ``just a simple moment of refreshment,''
Frenette said. ``We don't make the moment, the consumer does; we
just add a little magic.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaigns will be centered on a ``core proposition,'' a
strategic statement developed by Coca-Cola and shared with the
agencies: ``Only the unique sensory experience of an ice-cold
Coca-Cola brings a magical delight to the real moments of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the executives have spent considerable time thinking
about that. Frenette described Coca-Cola as offering ``enjoyment
inextricably linked to the power of the secret formula'' and
discussed how ``it awakens all of your senses.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief method to convey those intangibles will be to focus on
the contoured green-tinted glass bottle, the only Coca-Cola
container until the 1950's. The bottle _ originally six and a half
ounces, now eight _ has appeared recently on Coca-Cola labels,
signs and ads and inspired a successful line of 20-ounce contoured
plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Now the smaller bottle _ with the word ``Coca-Cola'' embossed in
glass again _ will play an even more prominent role to help prod
sales. The company plans tactics from samplings in malls to
contests to installing ice chests at convenience stores. Even so,
Frenette said its role would be mainly promotional, adding that he
expected American consumers to keep buying Coke in cans and plastic
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bottle is a metaphor for Coca-Cola, a metaphor of what's
inside,'' said Frenette, who took over as the marketing chief 18
months ago from Sergio Zyman. ``When that bottle is in your hand,
it says something.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst who follows Coca-Cola, Emanuel Goldman at Merrill
Lynch, praised the initiative because, he said, Coke in smaller
containers tastes better: ``By the time you're down to the lower
part of the 64-ounce bottle, you've lost the fizz. They're trying
to remind people the name of the game is refreshment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reminder will be the new graphics, produced by Lipson
Alport Glass &AMP; Associates in Northbrook, Ill., along with an
in-house team at Coca-Cola. The graphics show the brand's name in
larger type under the word ``Enjoy,'' which has been identified
with Coke for decades. There is also a glass bottle tipped to one
side, its metal cap off and the contents fizzing up and out. The
familiar red disk logo, in one design, is topped with crushed ice.
</P>
<P>
   That emphasis on chilled Coca-Cola evokes the major investments
that bottlers have made, at the company's urging, in refrigerator
cases and other equipment. For instance, one bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, announced a $5.2 billion investment plan last summer,
much of which was for such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The exhortation to ``enjoy'' Coke comes as its primary
competitor, Pepsi-Cola _ sold by the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of
Pepsico Inc. _ urges consumers to taste ``the joy of cola.'' The
current Pepsi-Cola campaign, by the BBDO New York unit of BBDO
Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, is centered on an upbeat
jingle infused with a perception of bubbly fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not `The joy of cola' but the enjoyment of life,''
Frenette said. ``We're pretty confident we can stand on our own.'' &QR;
</P>
<P>
   As for the agency relationships, Frenette played down reports of
a shake-up in creative responsibilities. Rather, he described a
process that would be streamlined to place ``more focus'' on a
short list of shops that have been considered first for Coca-Cola
work in various countries.
</P>
<P>
   He listed: the Leo Burnett Co. unit of Leo Group; D'Arcy Masius
Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications, part of MacManus Group; Doner; Edge
Creative, the lead creative agency in the United States;
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson
World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Publicis,
part of Publicis SA, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that they'll all be working off a common
strategy,'' Frenette said. ``And the winners are the ones who do
the best work.''
</P>
<P>
   With earnings shortfalls a problem, the company does not expect
to significantly increase its marketing budget to pay for the new
campaigns, Frenette said. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The move Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox didn't make at
the end of Sunday's wild Game 5 says all you need to know about his
level of confidence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, the way the New York Mets seem to respond in desperate
situations suggests Cox might be holding his feet just close enough
to the fire to get burned.
</P>
<P>
   Cox chose to stick with rookie reliever Kevin McGlinchy at the
end of Game 5 of the National League Championship Series, which
ended with Robin Ventura's game-winning ``grand single.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves still on top in the NLCS, Cox felt his best
course of action was to take his chances at Turner Field with Kevin
Millwood, who is scheduled to start tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood and Game 3 starter Tom Glavine were available to pitch
the 15th inning Sunday. And either almost certainly would have been
a better option than McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, that's hindsight. What lies ahead for the Braves
is a suddenly serious challenge from a Mets team that refuses to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Down 3-0 in the best-of-seven series after Friday's game, the
Mets have momentum on their side as they bid to become the first
team to overcome a three-game deficit in a postseason series.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the Braves were down three games to San Diego in
the 1998 NLCS before losing in six games.
</P>
<P>
   While some teams might crack under this type of pressure, the
Mets seem to welcome the win-or-go-home challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of getting used to it,'' manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``It seems like we've been doing this for a couple of weeks
now.''
</P>
<P>
   To hold up their end of the Subway Series _ a possibility that
seemed derailed just a few days ago _ the Mets will have to work
their magic for a couple more days.
</P>
<P>
   New York has lost seven of eight games at Turner Field this
season, including Games 1 and 2 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the driver's seat,'' Braves reliever Russ
Springer said. ``It comes down to us winning one game. Obviously,
we'd rather do it in Game 6 than in Game 7, so we'll come out
scrapping. In a game (as long as Sunday's), whoever wins it has a
big win, and whoever loses it has a big loss, and it's magnified in
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if the nature of Sunday's loss was so demoralizing
that the Braves won't be able to bounce back. Shortstop Walt Weiss
begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty easy to turn the page on one game when you play
every day for eight months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a lot easier if the Braves had any semblance of an
offense. They left 19 runners on base in Sunday's 15-inning
marathon and are hitting .211 in the series. Four of the five games
have been decided by a run, and the other was a two-run victory by
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the lack of offense puts increased pressure on the
pitchers, who are forced to work with minimal margin for error.
That can be a difficult task for a pitcher, even one who has the
word ``Braves'' embroidered across the front of his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a terrific team ERA of 1.82 in the NLCS, the Braves
haven't been able to put the Mets away. Tonight, Millwood will get
a chance to deliver the knockout blow some thought he should have
been given an opportunity to give Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Millwood said. ``This is the place everyone
wants to be, pitching in a game like this. I'm pumped. Everyone
wants to do it in the postseason. If you're not pumped now, there's
something wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Braves have an advantage because they are home and
because Millwood will be pitching on five days' rest. Mets starter
Al Leiter will be working on three days' rest, something he hasn't
done since 1995, by his recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``Why not? I've got four
months to rest. Any time there is a chance that your ballclub is
going home if you lose, you have to put on a good performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, the Mets always seem to do just that.

METS CAN'T SAVE 3 RUNS VENTURA LOST
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBN-METS-BRAVES, BBN-COLUMN) 
 (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The more he thought about it, the more Robin Ventura
decided he would have liked that grand slam home run.
</P>
<P>
   He relayed that sentiment to Todd Pratt on the team charter
flight Monday, as the Mets flew down here, more or less on their
own steam, to see if they could terrorize the Braves any further
Tuesday night in the sixth game of this suddenly extended series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had it all down,'' Pratt said. ``He was gonna do the Kirk
Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, playing with a knee just aching for some remedial
surgery, finally figured out that he could have emulated the
sore-legged hobble of Gibson, who hit the dramatic game-winning
homer in the 1988 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura never got the chance, however, after whacking the ball
over the fence with the bases loaded Sunday night, because Pratt
turned back from second base and initiated an emotional mosh pit,
with Ventura at the bottom of the scrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was busting on me,'' Pratt recalled. ``He was saying that I
was the only one who could do the home run trot.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot thickens. It was Pratt, you see, who hit the home run
to win the previous series with Arizona. Pratt made all the
highlight films with his dramatic gestures and low-gear rumble as
he passed first base. He has a tape of it back home. There will
never be a tape of Ventura chugging around the bases, gamely
dragging his sore leg behind him, because Pratt intercepted him.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Pratt did not consciously choose to disrupt a
grand slam home run. He had tied the game with a bases-loaded walk
off Kevin McGlinchy while sporting this huge almost disconcerting
smile on his face. (``It was weird,'' Pratt said. ``I knew he had
to throw me strikes. I knew I'd tie the game.'') Then Pratt never
saw Ventura's shot go over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the trajectory, and I thought it was a gapper,'' Pratt
explained Monday. ``I knew I had to touch second and the game was
over, and then I used the base as a sprinter's block and I ran to
Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   What's three runs between friends? Now, who wants to be the
designated worrywart to fret that the Mets may just have set off
some bad vibrations by their giddy little celebration in the swamp
of Flushing Meadow? Instead of a four-run victory, the Mets had a
4-3 triumph in 15 classic innings, enough to propel them down here
for the sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   I had not thought through the implications of those three
squandered runs. There were too many other things to think about on
that manic night, with the Mets winning one of the most epic games
in franchise history. Five hours into the game, in a steady
drizzle, there were still more Mets fans in Shea than there were in
arid Turner Field for the first and second games of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the land where foo'ball is king, I ran into a baseball
buff who was clearly preoccupied with the rashness of the Mets'
celebration. The Lenny 4 gleaming from his forehead was a subtle
clue that he was a Mets fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know, you can't carry over those runs to the next
game, I mean, not officially,'' said the fan, who identified
himself as Dave From Inman Park, originally from Long Island. ``But
I can just see it if the series goes seven. I can see Glavine on
the mound, smirking and saying, `Oh, so you can afford to just toss
away three runs, huh?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of what could happen in the future,'' added the
brooding Mets fan. ``His kid is going to go to junior high school
and some wise guy is going to say, `Hey, I thought your old man hit
a grand slam to win a famous playoff game for the Mets. It says
here in the record book that he only hit a single.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, noted that Ventura has ``a
knack for grand slams,'' 13 in his career, and that it is too bad
the Sunday shot will not count.
</P>
<P>
   ``He  &UR; did  &LR;  hit it,'' Valentine said Monday. ``I hope there's an
asterisk.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no asterisk. Ventura had seemed to motion to Pratt
to keep running before the hugfest got out of hand. And Ventura
assured reporters that he was fine with the loss of the grand slam,
but he did quip that he might feel differently after we all cleared
out of the clubhouse and he had time to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Ventura was busting on Pratt, the banter between
athletes who have suddenly done something remarkable, who have
prolonged their season and just might have more to say and do.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are down here, in the land where fans deliver a banal
tomahawk chop, a gesture borrowed from a university in another
state, for goodness' sakes. The record book may never identify that
Robin Ventura hit one over the wall in the 15th inning on Sunday.
But the Mets know he did. And so do the Braves.

CHIEF IS OUSTED AT RITE AID AND EARNINGS ARE RESTATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Directors of Rite Aid Corp. stepped in Monday in an effort to
stem a series of disasters at the nation's third-largest drugstore
chain, ousting Martin Grass, the chief executive, announcing that
the company will restate $500 million in pretax earnings since
1997, and placing control with four independent board members.
</P>
<P>
   With those changes, the company said that its lead bankers had
agreed to extend by one year $2.7 billion in loans and other debt
that had been due on Oct. 29. It said that Leonard Green &AMP;
Partners, the Los Angeles investment boutique, had agreed to invest
$300 million in new preferred stock that can be converted into
common shares worth 9.7 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   While the restatement will wipe out most of the company's pretax
earnings for the last three fiscal years, the moves, taken as a
whole, are good news for investors, some analysts said. They said
the heavy-handed management of Grass, along with a series of
problems this year, had badly damaged the company's credibility
with investors. And while Wall Street had been expecting a serious
earnings restatement, it had not been clear until Monday night that
the banks would roll their loans over.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Rite Aid have dropped 80 percent this year as the
company badly missed earnings expectations, said it would have to
restate earnings, and was charged last month by the Florida
attorney general with illegally overcharging uninsured pharmacy
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of the Grass dynasty,'' said Mark Husson, a
drugstore analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The directors and the
banks must have been very upset and frustrated and lacked
confidence in current management's ability to control this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the earnings restatement is severe, Husson said, investors
should be relieved that the banks agreed to the extension, and he
said the stock could rise in trading Tuesday from its close Monday
of $9.625. But he noted that the company did not say what interest
rate the banks would charge, and he said it might be some time
before investors and analysts are able to sort out Rite Aid's true
financial picture. The big restatements ``make you wonder what the
underlying earnings power of this company is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement Monday night, Rite Aid said its president and
chief operating officer, Timothy Noonan, had been appointed interim
chief executive. But the company also said that the board had
created an executive committee of four outside directors: Gerald
Tsai, the former Fidelity mutual fund manager; Preston Robert
Tisch, the co-chairman of Loews Corp.; Leonard Stern, the chairman
of Hartz Group, and Nancy Lieberman, a partner at the law firm
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Camp Hill, Pa., also said it had not been
able to find a permanent replacement for its former chief financial
officer, Frank Bergonzi, who said in June that he would resign. And
the company said it would delay the filing of its quarterly 10-Q
statement with the SEC, which had been expected Monday, but that
the document would show no ``material differences'' with
projections the company made on Oct. 11, when it said it expected a
second-quarter loss of $67.9 million, or 26 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Grass, the son of company founder Alex Grass, nor Noonan
could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman, Sarah Datz, said the executive committee
was formed to act for the full board between meetings and that it
would oversee the search for a permanent chief executive. She said
the earnings restatement came in response to issues raised in the
SEC review but said the company has not been told by the agency
that any legal action was expected. She also declined to say
whether the loan rollover was contingent on the departure of Grass.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary for Leonard Green, founding partner of Leonard Green
&AMP; Partners, said Green had no comment on the matter beyond a
written statement, in which he said his investment ``reflects the
confidence we have in Rite Aid's core business.''
</P>
<P>
   Green will join the directors' executive committee after his
investment closes, the company said. The preferred stock he will
receive will pay an 8 percent pay-in-kind dividend _ meaning
dividends will come in the form of more preferred stock. But in
what may be a good sign for investors, Green agreed to the
conversion price of $11, about 14.3 percent above Monday's closing
price.

HACKETT'S HACKLES RAISED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The search for answers following USC's two-game
losing streak has left USC coach Paul Hackett speechless. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talking's over. There's nothing to say,'' Hackett said.
``Until we go out and do something, I have nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-imposed gag order didn't last long, but it's clear
Hackett is frustrated over the Trojans' inability to play a
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all of out of tricks,'' Hackett said. ``We've got to go
out and play. I don't know whether the first-half or second-half
team will show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is disturbed that USC has blown fourth-quarter leads to
Oregon and Notre Dame, and a third-quarter lead to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we learned our lesson (last year) against Cal,''
Hackett said of USC blowing a 21-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also chose not to talk about Saturday's opponent,
Stanford (4-2, 4-0), which is atop the Pacific-10 Conference
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about anybody,'' Hackett said. ``We can't win a
game. We're .500.''
</P>
<P>
   His anger was not just restricted to how the Trojans (3-3, 1-2)
will play this week. Asked how his team's injured players were
recovering from the Notre Dame game, Hackett said: ``I have no idea
and I don't care. Whoever's ready to play will play.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety David Gibson echoed Hackett's belief that words no
longer suffice when talking about the Trojans' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talking's been done. It's all lip service,'' Gibson
said. ``Everyone just has to take it as a man and perform. We pride
ourselves on playing great defense and didn't step forward (against
Notre Dame).''
</P>
<P>
   Road kill: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward said USC's main problem
is figuring out how to win on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to learn how to like getting on airplanes and
winning in other people's houses,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   As unrealistic as it sounds, Soward is talking about USC's Rose
Bowl hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford is the only team undefeated,'' he said. ``It can be a
nine-way tie for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rough result: So was the 25-24 loss to Notre Dame the toughest
of Hackett's career? ``It's right up there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Double jeopardy: For the first time since Hackett became head
coach, USC has lost back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   Club 100: USC has had two receivers with 100-or-more yards
receiving the past two games. Windrell Hayes (115) and Kareem Kelly
(100) surpassed the century mark against Arizona; Hayes (107) and
R. Jay Soward (101) did it against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   What's the rush? USC is averaging 2.9 yards per carry, which is
on pace to be the Trojans' lowest average since the 1991 season,
when the average-per-carry was 2.66 yards.
</P>
<P>
   USC's all-time low in yards-per-carry since records were kept
was 2.51 in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Cal game time: USC's game at Cal on Oct. 30 will kick off at
3:30 p.m. and be televised locally on Channel 9 (KCAL-TV).

BERTKA'S AT HOME WITH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Bertka has survived four decades in a
profession that eats its wise.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder why. Bertka is universally respected and
genuinely liked in pro basketball circles. He has friends
everywhere and not one adversary, which makes him about as rare in
the buck-passing, backside-covering, ego-levitating NBA as the
player who wins league titles in both scoring and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   His affiliation with the Lakers pre-dates Jack Nicholson's. He
has a better seat than Dyan Cannon, even if he is less visible.
</P>
<P>
   In two tours with the team, Bertka has outlasted nine head
coaches and the Forum, too. He has stories older than any of the
Laker girls, fond memories of a game predicated on passing and
defense and a mindset as obsolete as the set shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the privilege of earning a living in the NBA,''
said Bertka, the only assistant from the 1998-99 staff to be
retained by new coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka is joined by Frank Hamblen, Jim Cleamons and 76-year-old
Tex Winter. Contrary to popular belief, Jackson did not approach
Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon about the role of scout/stat man
before offering it to Bertka, who is 72 but, as far as we can tell,
as ageless as Ann-Margret.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the respect of everybody in this business,'' Hamblen
said of Bertka, who is in his 19th season with the Lakers. ``We're
happy to be associated with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all blended families should get along so famously.
</P>
<P>
   Over a late snack on the second day of training camp, Winter was
completing Bertka's thoughts and Bertka was finishing Hamblen's
sentences and their conversation flowed without the slightest
break. Oh what rejoicing there'd be if the Lakers could run the
triangle offense so seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka's enduring place on the Lakers' bench attests to life's
weird geometry.
</P>
<P>
   He is close as kin to Winter. The two have known each other
since their undergraduate days at USC in the 1940s. Bertka met
Hamblen 20 years later when both were scouting for NBA teams (the
Lakers and San Diego Rockets, respectively). In those years, Bertka
and Hamblen spent more time hanging out with each other than with
their respective families.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players the Lakers drafted, based on Bertka's
legwork, was Cleamons in 1971. Another player Bertka evaluated went
on to have a decent career with the Knicks. He was a kid whose
effort far exceeded his talent. A fellow by the name of Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really ironic,'' Bertka said. ``It just goes to show you
never know how many times your path is going to cross with people.
You never know what your fate might be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers fired Del Harris in February and dismissed Kurt
Rambis three months later, Bertka figured the only organization in
his future might be AARP.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need his bifocals to see the writing on the wall. He
could understand Jackson wanting to bring in his own staff. Out
with the old, in with the new. Bertka braced himself to hear he was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, though, had other ideas. No sooner had the longtime
assistant packed his bags for Southern California than he started
politicking on Bertka's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed hard for (retaining) Bill,'' Winter said. ``I thought
it was very important we utilize Bill's background and
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertka long had been the good solider, doing whatever was asked
of him without complaint. He assiduously kept all the statistics
only a defensive player could love (not surprisingly, Robert Horry
has a special place in his heart for Bertka). He kept the head
coach's seat warm for one game against the Clippers after Harris
was fired and before Rambis was promoted.
</P>
<P>
   And when he met with Jackson over the summer, Bertka kept it
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him know I've been with the Lakers all my adult life
(save for a seven-year stint with the expansion New Orleans
Jazz),'' Bertka said, ``and that they can bury me in the
organization as far as I'm concerned. I told him I've never looked
for a damn job anywhere else and I wasn't about to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have done whatever they wanted, though a
(front-office) position (such as the one Rambis was force-fed)
wasn't my preference. I enjoy working with the guys. I like to
teach. It's the thing I like to do the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He can instruct us all, this genial man who loves the life he
leads and has a kind word for everybody he meets. The lesson?
Ambition takes tricky bounces, but decency's rebound always comes
back to you. &QL;

TV SPORTS: FOR MORGAN, SO MUCH TO SAY AND SO LITTLE TIME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Joe Morgan's frustrations as a baseball analyst for NBC
and ESPN is the lack of sufficient time to say everything that is
on his mind. Part of that stems from Morgan's failure to be a
chatterbox seeking to hog every free moment for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel the game is more important than my comments,''
he said Monday from his hotel in Atlanta, where he and Bob Costas
will call Game 6 of the National League Championship Series on
Tuesday night. ``If a guy is ready to hit the ball, it's more
important than what I have to say. If I talk during a home run,
that's the biggest sin I can commit.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's education as a broadcaster entered the master's phase
during his years as the Cincinnati Reds' second baseman, discussing
how a pitcher cocked his curveball with Johnny Bench or how a
hitter dropped his shoulder with Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every play contains something unique,'' he said. But he rarely
says it all. ``It's hard to say everything, because I'd be
preaching at you.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's a chance for Morgan to amplify and illuminate some of
his insights during Sunday's epic Game 5 of the Mets-Braves series.
</P>
<P>
   Mets first baseman John Olerud holds runners by starting off the
bag, then scampering back for a pickoff throw: ``It started with
Chuck Tanner, when he was managing the Pirates. When I played, he
moved Willie Stargell off the bag to stand in front of me and block
my view of the pitcher. I complained that he can't move around the
way he did, that you have to stand still in front of me. The Mets
take that correct approach, then Olerud broke to the bag. A good
base stealer should eat that up and take off. If the pitcher throws
to Olerud, he has to hit a moving target whose momentum is moving
toward first when he throws to second. But yesterday, with the game
on the line, Olerud held runners on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets reliever Dennis Cook appears in the seventh inning, throws
two pitches to complete a walk that was credited to Turk Wendell.
``I played baseball for 20-plus years, and the term was always, `He
has to pitch to a batter.' So it's a 2-0 count, he comes in, and
the walk goes to Wendell. He doesn't have a line. He was 0-0-0. If
he came in with a 1-0 count and walks the guy, it's his walk.
That's the confusion. The umpires were confused. I rode in today
with one of the umpires, Ed Montague, and he said, `We all had to
think about it.''' (Cook was credited with facing one batter, then
was removed.)
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Shawon Dunston fouls off half a dozen pitches with a
3-2 count in the 15th inning and then singles off the loser, Kevin
McGlinchy: ``Guys like Tony Gwynn keep fouling off pitches until
you make a mistake. The greatest I ever saw at that was Rico Carty,
the best at getting two strikes and fouling pitches off until he
got a good pitch. When he got it, he grunted. Carew and Brett could
do it. Normal hitters don't do it. I don't know if Dunston intended
to do it, but he did. Dunston's at-bat was the key one in the game,
forgetting Olerud and Ventura's home runs. Dunston's at-bat led off
the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, confers with reliever
Octavio Dotel in the 15th; on the air, Morgan says it is to warn
Dotel that Keith Lockhart is a good fastball hitter. ``The Braves
had three good fastball hitters _ Gerald Williams, Lockhart and
Chipper Jones. They can hit anybody's fastball and Dotel only has
one pitch. So the matchup wasn't good for the Mets. Dotel had no
choice but to throw him a fastball, so Wallace was there only to
tell him where to throw it.'' Dotel did not heed the lesson well
enough; Lockhart slashed a fastball for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Game 6, Morgan is bullish on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the Mets' offense is better than the Braves',''
he said. ``The Mets can put up numbers, with Henderson's speed, and
Alfonzo, Olerud, Piazza and Ventura who can drive in runs. They
have a better offense, but the Braves' pitching is better. But you
look at the Braves' lineup, and you wonder how they're going to
generate runs. The Mets are capable of stringing together eight
hits in a row. I don't think the Braves can hit three in a row.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday's Game 5 was memorable for more than its 5-hour-46-minute
length. The game held a vise grip on viewing in the New York
market.
</P>
<P>
   It began on NBC's Channel 4 with a 16.1 local Nielsen rating
from 4:15 to 4:30 p.m., concluded from 9:30 to 10 p.m. with a 36.9
rating, and was seen by 52 percent of the local television
households watching TV at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of single-minded focus on one program is rarely seen
except in mega-events. Last January, Fox-owned Channel 5 averaged a
38.4 local rating for the Super Bowl, and grabbed 56 percent of the
homes with their TV sets on.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets were beating Atlanta, the prime-time competition
was almost in hiding. In those final 15 minutes, the Yankees-Red
Sox game on Channel 5 rated a 4.1; a Farrah Fawcett movie, ``Silk
Hope,'' on Channel 2 had a 4.7 rating and ``Snoops,'' on Channel 7,
a 5.4.
</P>
<P>
   The two playoff games overlapped for two and a half hours, and
the Mets' telecast overwhelmed the Yankees'. But during that time,
they controlled 53 percent to 63 percent of the local market's TV
sets in use.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Mets won, the Yankee game leaped locally to a 22.7
rating from 10 to 10:30 p.m., and rose to a 27.0 in its final
half-hour, from 11 to 11:30 p.m.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE FACE OF BASEBALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Adds Mora's age, corrects spelling of his home town in
Venezuela.)  By WILLIAM RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is Melvin Mora?
</P>
<P>
   Mora is the Met who made his way out to left field on Saturday
with the uncomfortable mission of having to tell Rickey Henderson
that he had to come out of the game. This was the top of the eighth
inning in Game 4 of the National League playoffs last Saturday
night, a full house at Shea Stadium, another tight game. Usually
the switch _ Mora was replacing Henderson for defensive purposes _
would have been made between innings, in the privacy of the Mets
dugout. But Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager, said he had
forgotten. So he sent the quiet, mild-mannered Mora to break the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, thanks to Valentine, was well schooled in this kind of
humiliation. A similar experience happened to him last April, at
the end of a successful spring training. Mora thought he had made
the Mets' 25 player roster. He had outperformed his nearest
competitor _ hitting, fielding and exhibiting the proper attitude.
Finally after seven years in the minors, Mora, 27, was going North
to open the '99 season as a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   His bags were already on the bus as the team prepared to head to
Texas for the last exhibition game. That's when Mora got the news:
He had not made the roster and would be demoted. The Mets _ i.e.,
Bobby Valentine _ forgot to tell him, just as he'd forgot to tell
Henderson Saturday. Mora's bags had to be retrieved off the truck
headed to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Mora was crushed. When someone asked him to describe his
emotions, Mora said ``I feel like I want to go to a bridge and jump
off.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday, he broke the news to Henderson and watched him
leave the field angry, embarrassed. Mora understood. But he also
remembered how he'd kept his own spirits up when he was demoted in
the spring. ``I wasn't angry, I was sad,'' he said. ``But I told
myself I don't make decisions; I have to accept whatever they say
and continue to work. Now I have the opportunity to show everyone
that I can play, because if you can play in the playoffs, you can
play in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the spring training disappointment, Mora is the
leader of an undercard of unsung Mets players who have propelled
the team from 0-3 series deficit to an unlikely Game 6 against
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for respect began on Oct. 3, in the last game of the
regular season, when Mora, a rookie with just five hits to his name
this season, reached on a one-out single in the ninth inning. When
fellow Venezuelan Edgardo Alfonzo singled, Mora sped around second
and dived headfirst into third as the crowd went wild. Moments
later he raced home with the winning run on a wild pitch. The Mets
defeated Pittsburgh and earned the right to play Cincinnati for the
wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Mora made his third start of the season as part of
Valentine's lineup shakeup. He kept a close game close when he
threw a perfect strike to Mike Piazza to nail Bret Boone at the
plate. On Saturday, after replacing Henderson, Mora executed a
daring baseball play when he initiated a double steal with Roger
Cedeno on second, Mora on first and John Rocker on the mound. Mora
remembered being on third base in Atlanta and faking like he was
straying home, and saw how nervous it made Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Roger we have to put pressure on this guy,'' Mora
recalled. ``With a man at second base he's going to throw a lot of
pitches in the dirt; a man on third base is a different story _ he
has to throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   They executed the double steal, and then a John Olerud smash
grazed off Ozzie Guillen's glove and allowed both runners to score.
In a critical juncture of the game on Sunday, Mora may have saved
the game for the Mets when, in a heavy drizzle, he cut off a
hard-hit ball before it reached the right field wall, then fired
the wet ball to Alfonzo, who fired to Mike Piazza, who applied the
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Melvin Mora? Mora is the face of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Agua Negra, Venezuela, Mora came out of the Houston
Astros' academy in Valencia, but was overshadowed by other players
regarded as better major league prospects. Houston kept him on one
of their minor league clubs for six years. When the Astros did not
invite him to major league camp in 1997 Mora thought about quitting
baseball. Instead of doing that or going back to Triple A, Mora
went to the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan, though
he left a month and a half later.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, Mora contacted Edgar Alfonzo,
Edgardo's brother, a coach with the Mets' Class A affiliate in Port
St. Lucie. Alfonzo put Mora in contact with Jim Duquette, the Mets
assistant general manager of player personnel. Duquette offered
Mora a utility role with the Mets A team in St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what seems like a lifetime later, he's headed for Game 6
in Atlanta. Even as he does, he embodies for some the indomitable
spirit of the minor leagues. Bobby Floyd, the minor league field
coordinator, saw Mora when he returned from Taiwan and again when
he returned to AAA after failing to make the 25-plater roster this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melvin never quit,'' Floyd said Monday from Melbourne, Fla.
``It's like a fighter that keeps getting knocked down; he gets back
up and you just he will never let go until everybody _ everybody _
says `no we don't want you.' It's that wanting to go out there and
do it one more time, giving it all you've got and being able to say
to yourself when its all over and done that you gave it every shot
you could.''

BRAVES ARE BACK AT HOME AND CONFIDENT FOR GAME 6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves are not ready to panic.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets coming to town after winning two in a row is
not viewed with the same dread and despair as Sherman marching in
with the Union Army 135 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves still have good reason to feel confident about a
return to the World Series for the fifth time in this decade. They
still lead the National League Championship Series three games to
two when it resumes tonight at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel good about our chances,'' Braves pitcher Greg
Maddux said. ``We've been down this road before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets might have at least halted the Braves' momentum by
winning the past two games at Shea Stadium, including the 15-inning
4-3 thriller Sunday. But other factors favor the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the final two games are at Turner Field. The
Braves, unlike most playoff teams, might have trouble selling out
their place during the postseason, but they still play well there.
They went 56-25 at Turner Field during the season, including 5-1
against the Mets. They swept three from the Mets at home Sept.
21-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no mystery we haven't done well in Atlanta,'' Mets
center fielder Darryl Hamilton said. ``The one thing we have going
for us is everybody expects us to lose because no team has ever
come back from being down 3-0 in a series. I'm sure we still feel a
little pressure, but I'm sure those guys don't want to be the first
team to lose after being up 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Braves still have their pitching rotation intact.
Manager Bobby Cox resisted the temptation to use Game 6 starter
Kevin Millwood or Game 7 starter Tom Glavine in relief during
Sunday's 15-inning affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves didn't win the game, but Millwood will be fully
rested for tonight's game, as will Glavine if Game 7 is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' said Millwood, who beat the Mets in Game 2
Wednesday. ``This is the place that everybody wants to be in,
pitching in a game like this. I'm pumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine has to improvise to get his
rotation back in order. He will start Al Leiter on three days rest
tonight and Rick Reed tomorrow, also on three days. They normally
get four days off between starts during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Leiter said. ``Why not? I've got
four months to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza probably needs four months off right now
after two collisions at home plate in three games at Shea Stadium.
Piazza suffered a slight concussion in Game 3 when Bret Boone
crashed into him trying to score on a sacrifice fly. He also had to
leave Game 5 in the 14th inning when Keith Lockhart slammed into
him trying to score from first on a double.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza suffered a strained left forearm, basically the same spot
where Braves first baseman Ryan Klesko whacked him with his
backswing earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm banged up,'' Piazza said. ``But I'll go out there and do
whatever I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are well-aware no team in major-league history has
come back from three games down to win a best-of-seven series. The
Braves flirted with doing that last year when they lost three in a
row to the San Diego Padres in the NLCS, then won the next two.
Their hopes died, though, when they returned to Turner Field and
lost Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   But they realize now the Mets are dangerous, no matter how much
the Braves dominated them during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team, you give them a chance to win,'' Cox said. ``Nobody
is going to give up once you've gotten this far. Nobody is. Every
team should be the same way.''

CLINTON PROPOSES A DISCOUNT PLAN TO TRIM COSTS OF MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite 6th graf with an insert; inserts new 7th graf,

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a break from three decades of Medicare policy,
the Clinton administration asked Congress on Monday to steer
Medicare patients to certain doctors and hospitals that offer
discounts on the price of care they provide to people who are
elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation drafted by the administration and sent to
Congress, federal officials would notify beneficiaries of a list of
preferred doctors and hospitals that agree to offer ``discounted
rates'' to the government and to reduce the fees charged to
patients. The medical providers would attract more patients, making
up in volume for the lower charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and some Democrats, like Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida, say the proposed changes would save money and make
Medicare more competitive and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans oppose the idea, which has also provoked an
outcry from doctors and hospitals. Critics say the government would
emphasize price over quality and would steer Medicare patients to
mediocre doctors and hospitals that offered the biggest discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, doctors and hospitals that
wanted to be named as ``preferred providers'' would have to meet
new federal standards for the quality of care. But critics of the
proposal said that price would often be the dominant factor because
it was much easier to measure cost than quality.
</P>
<P>
   Since the creation of Medicare in 1965, beneficiaries have been
able to seek treatment from almost any licensed doctor or
accredited hospital. Until now Medicare has provided little
financial incentive for choosing a particular doctor or hospital in
its fee-for-service program. In its proposal, the administration
was asking Congress for broad powers to pick and choose providers
who would coordinate the care of Medicare patients who choose to
participate in the special arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that their proposals would not
require or coerce beneficiaries to do anything, and that patients
could decide for themselves whether to participate in the
arrangements. Patients would enroll voluntarily, but could be
locked into one of the new arrangements for six months or a year.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other details of the administration's proposal:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would designate specific hospitals
across the country as ``centers of excellence'' and would encourage
Medicare patients to use them for high-cost procedures like heart
surgery or hip replacement, provided the government saved money.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would hire specialists to coordinate all the
care needed by Medicare patients who choose to participate for the
treatment of particular conditions like congestive heart failure,
high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, asthma and diabetes.
Beneficiaries would voluntarily sign up for such services for a
maximum of one year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal officials could use competitive bidding to obtain
discounts on medical equipment and other goods and services
purchased for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare often pays more than
the retail price for common items like lancets and catheters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed interest in these proposals in June,
when he unveiled a comprehensive plan to redesign Medicare and add
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the proposals would modernize
Medicare and save money, by using selected techniques of managed
care to control costs in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare
program, which still serves 84 percent of the 39 million
beneficiaries. Vice President Al Gore supports the administration's
Medicare plan, including these proposals, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means
Committee plan to vote this week on legislation to restore some
money cut from Medicare in 1997. White House officials said they
hoped that the committees would accept the president's proposals,
which could offset some of the cost of undoing cuts made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Senate Finance Committee, Graham and Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., support the president's proposal to revamp the
purchasing of goods and services in the traditional Medicare
program. A third member, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., has expressed
support for some of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said that an experimental project in
Polk County, Fla., had shown that competitive bidding and similar
techniques could save money for Medicare without harming the
quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also strong criticism. Dr. Nicholas T. Kouchoukos,
president of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, said heart surgeons
were ``extremely troubled'' by Clinton's proposal because they
feared that ``excellence would take a back seat to discounted
pricing.'' It is, he said, totally inappropriate to send elderly
patients to the ``lowest bidder'' when they need life-saving
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pollack, executive vice president of the American
Hospital Association, said Clinton's proposal could reduce access
to specialized services in areas where the local hospital did not
win a contract with Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that doctors and hospitals were
afraid of true competition because it meant that there would be
winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say they oppose Clinton's proposal simply
because he covets the modernization of Medicare as part of his
political legacy. Republicans said they did not want him to be able
to take credit for such changes in the program unless they got what
they wanted: fundamental overhaul of Medicare, putting the original
fee-for-service program into direct competition with private health
plans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In March, 10 of the 17 members of a federal advisory commission
headed by Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana recommended that Medicare
compete directly with private health plans. To enhance such
competition, the panel said, Medicare officials should have more of
the purchasing tools available to private health plans, including
the ability to sign contracts with selected health care providers
who offer high-quality services and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday night Breaux, a Democrat, said the
president's proposal, taken by itself, was ``like robbing Peter to
pay Paul.'' The government, he said, would cut payments to some
health care providers so it could redistribute the money to other
doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Breaux said, ``I do not want to give the Health Care
Financing Administration more bureaucratic power, more regulatory
authority, at a time when it controls more than 80 percent of the
Medicare marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republican leaders of the panels that would have to
handle the legislation have said that they do not want to deal with
new initiatives this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is an obvious candidate for
designation as a ``center of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Kelly, director of government relations for the Mayo
Foundation, said Clinton's proposal was flawed because it failed to
consider that the centers of excellence would attract complicated
cases costing more than the average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unrealistic to think that the centers of excellence
would take the tougher cases and agree to be paid less,'' Kelly
said.

TEXAS NOT IN AWE OF NEBRASKA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas coaches and players spent yesterday
expressing concern about Nebraska's option game but confidence in
their ability to extend a two-game winning streak against the
unbeaten Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Big 12 began playing football in 1996, No. 18 Texas
(5-2, 2-1) is the only league school with a winning record against
No. 3 Nebraska (6-0, 3-0) heading into a 2:30 p.m. meeting Saturday
at Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are 2-0 against the Cornhuskers, prevailing both
times as double-digit underdogs. Texas won the 1996 league title
game, 37-27, in St. Louis and pulled a 20-16 upset last season in
Lincoln, Neb., ending the Cornhuskers' 47-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Texas finds itself in familiar territory again this week. The
Longhorns are 91/2-point underdogs. But they don't feel like it,
said wide receiver Ryan Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind we can win. They're beatable,''
Nunez said. ``Take that logo off their helmets and they're just
another team. That's something Coach \RMack\S Brown has mentioned
and it's so true.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Texas' success, said defensive end Cedric Woodard, is
viewing Nebraska with respect, not awe. Other teams, said Woodard,
tend to be intimidated by the Cornhuskers' 25-4 record against
league foes.
</P>
<P>
   Because half of those losses came against the Longhorns, Woodard
said: ``We realize we can play with them. They're just regular
players, like we are. You have to think that they are men, like we
are men. If you look at it like that, it's not as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   What is bad, from a Texas perspective, is finding a way to slow
an option-based attack that ranks seventh nationally in scoring
offense (39 points per game). Nebraksa also is third in total
defense, allowing 230.8 yards and 9.7 points per game. But it is
the Cornhuskers' option game that presents the greatest challenge,
said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense needs to penetrate and create havoc,'' Brown said.
``That's how you stop the option. If you don't stop their option,
you'll never see a pass. You need to make them two-dimensional. If
you don't, the game is over and you were never in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Longhorns' lone contest this season against an option
attack, Texas surrendered 209 rushing yards in an 18-13 victory
over Rice. Brown said his team did not create penetration or havoc
``until the fourth quarter'' against the Owls and must
significantly step up the timetable against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   As for the team's two-game winning streak against the
Cornhuskers, Brown said: ``It gives our team some confidence. But
usually, the best team wins on Saturday.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN Game Day crew (Chris Fowler, Lee Corso and Kirk
Herbstreit) will be in Austin for Saturday's game, marking the
show's first visit to Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for the Longhorns' Oct. 30 game at Iowa State has been
moved to 11:30 a.m. so the game can be shown as a Big 12 syndicated
telecast on KXTX/Ch. 39.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve tailback Victor Ike (ankle) remains questionable for
Saturday's game. Brown said three other players who have been
nursing ankle injuries (offensive tackle Leonard Davis and
linebackers De'Andre Lewis and Aaron Babino) are ``the best they've
been all season'' in terms of physical conditioning after last
week's open date.

UCLA LOOKS TO IMPROVE SECONDARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hoping to seal his porous secondary, UCLA coach
Bob Toledo said Monday that redshirt freshman Lovell Houston, a
huge talent with no experience, will compete for strong safety Eric
Whitfield's starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, a fifth-year senior, has missed tackles and blown
coverages in several games, including Saturday's 17-0 loss to Cal.
The Bears had five plays accounting for 184 yards, and Toledo said
Whitfield was involved _ or not involved _ in four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most experienced guy, but there comes a point when
you look at somebody else if guys don't play better,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, a former Parade All-American who picked UCLA over
Florida State, has been injured numerous times since his arrival
last fall. He recently switched from cornerback to safety and has
less game experience than some true freshmen. The Bruins aren't
sure he's ready, but they're desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to force-feed him,'' Toledo said. ``If he
can't do it in practice, he won't start. But we're going to give
him the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all: The situation isn't as dire at weakside
linebacker, but true freshman Marcus Reese could supplant starter
Ryan Nece with an impressive week of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Nece was UCLA's No.2 tackler last year and earned
honorable-mention All-Pac-10 honors. But he lacks Reese's speed,
and against Oregon State's aerial attack _ the Beavers lead the
Pac-10 in passing with 327 yards per game _ athleticism is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Nece has played that poorly, but we need to get
(Reese) in more,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell update: It appears senior cornerback Jason Bell will
redshirt because of post-surgery pain in his right heel. He hasn't
played since the Ohio State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to ride out the year and see what happens,'' he
said. ``But each game, (redshirting) gets closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could return in a week or two, Bell said: ``Not
unless something miraculous occurs.... I'm walking with less pain,
but right now, running is a no.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: In its last three games, UCLA has been
outscored 43-6 in the fourth quarter, with four turnovers and a
blocked field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle) won't
play Saturday on Oregon State's artificial turf. Foster, who has
three carries in the last three games, might return for Arizona on
Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (OSU) turf grabs your cleats, and he doesn't need anything
grabbing his cleats,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz (sprained shoulder) is doubtful.
Billy Pieper will replace Azziz as the No. 2 outside linebacker
behind Tony White.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends Bryan Fletcher (strained groin) and Mike Seidman
(sprained shoulder) are questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Freddie Mitchell, tailback Jermaine Lewis and Whitfield
did not practice Monday because of an upper-respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: After his Sunday film session _ yes, it looked as
bad on tape as it did in person _ Toledo did not name players of
the game. He also delayed naming captains until later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins weren't fazed by the Hector Mines earthquake Saturday
morning. ``My room shook for quite a while,'' fullback Durell Price
said, ``but I didn't budge. I was in Sylmar for the Northridge
quake. This was nothing compared to that.''

KIND OF BLUE: UMPS UNWITTINGLY BECOME THE STORY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Buckner is headlined in history, obscuring
previous mistakes by the Boston Red Sox before his error ended Game
6 of the 1986 World Series. And similarly, what Boston fans will
remember years from now is not that the gritty Red Sox really did
not play well against the Yankees in the 1999 American League
Championship Series, but that they were victimized by umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough that we've got to beat the Yankees,'' one fan
was bemoaning while filing out of Fenway Park after Game 4 on
Sunday night. ``But the umps are sticking it to us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the first four games, umpires committed blunders on
calls from which the Yankees benefited, and their subsequent
admissions of error will not reduce the disgust of the Red Sox or
their fans. Like the first in a row of falling dominoes, that rage
led to fans throwing bottles and other debris on the field in the
ninth inning of the Yankees' 9-2 victory Sunday, the Yankees being
ordered off the field by umpires, and a brief and nasty
confrontation between Yankees personnel and two members of the Red
Sox security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, the executive vice president of Major League
Baseball, said that Kevin Hallinan, baseball's top security
officer, arrived here from New York on Monday to oversee operations
for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But the most substantive discussions on how the umpires could
improve will take place in the off-season, Alderson said. He
mentioned the possibility that umpires will view videotape as part
of their training, review procedures and positioning for common
calls and discuss the protocol for consulting on decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson dodged a question about whether he thinks there is a
place in baseball for video replay, but he mentioned that instant
replay in baseball, because of ``its texture,'' might be unwieldy.
Alderson did not rule out that the use of instant replay would be
discussed, and he mentioned how the umpires' mistakes in the
post-season were indelible.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans here will always recall Larry Barnett's decision
that Ed Armbrister of Cincinnati did not interfere with catcher
Carlton Fisk of Boston while bunting at a critical juncture of the
1975 World Series, and fans everywhere will never forget the
mistaken safe call by Don Denkinger at first base in Game 6 of the
1985 World Series, which led to Kansas City eventually defeating
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And if Boston loses this series, Red Sox fans, who are blessed _
or cursed _ with exceptional retention, will always remember the
umpires' errors, more so than Boston's failure to hit with runners
in scoring position in Games 1 or 2, or the 11 errors made by the
Red Sox in the first four games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were winning, 3-2, in the bottom of the eighth
inning of Game 4. Boston's Jose Offerman was on first base with one
out, and Mariano Rivera was pitching. John Valentin hit a roller to
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who rushed in, gloved the ball and
attempted to tag Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch swiped his glove at Offerman, and then flipped to
first to retire Valentin. But Tim Tschida, the umpire at second
base, ruled that Knoblauch had tagged Offerman, meaning an
inning-ending double play. The Red Sox runner, the first-base coach
Dave Jauss and Manager Jimy Williams all argued the call.
</P>
<P>
   Tschida later viewed videotape of the play and saw what millions
around the country had seen: Knoblauch's glove missing Offerman's
right side by a substantial margin. There was no question. ``I
didn't make the right call,'' Tschida acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had sought input from another umpire, Tschida
said that even Williams had told him he understood that no other
umpire could be consulted on the play because no other umpire was
in position to make the call. But Monday, Williams had an entirely
different interpretation of his conversation with Tschida.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to ask somebody around here for help, just to make
sure you get the call right,''' Williams recalled saying to
Tschida. ``Because that's all I've ever been told by other umpires
in situations where they changed a decision against a club I was
managing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will ever know what would have happened if Tschida had
called the play correctly and Offerman had been ruled safe. At
best, the Red Sox would have faced a difficult situation, two outs
and a runner at second and a need for a clutch hit. Nomar
Garciaparra, the American League batting champion, was scheduled to
hit and the Yankees might have pitched around him and then Rivera
would have been pitching to Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera has not blown a save in three months, so it would be hard
to assume Stanley would have tied the score. But Williams would
have liked to take his chances; he would have liked the players to
have full control over the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   What gnawed at Williams, the Red Sox and their fans is that, for
the second time in five days, an umpire's call robbed them of an
opportunity. In the 11th inning of Game 1, Knoblauch dropped a
throw at second base, but the second-base umpire Rick Reed called
the runner out _ saying that Knoblauch lost the ball as he began a
double-play attempt.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of having runners at first and second and nobody out
with the heart of their lineup coming up in a tie game, the Red Sox
rally was sabotaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody makes mistakes,'' Williams said. ``I probably made
more than anybody in here. But I try to 0ilize our coaches the best
I can to help us in a game situation. So to me, that's trying to be
a team to win a game as a unit. To me, as umpires, you're trying to
officiate a game properly as a unit so it's fair for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored six runs in the top of the ninth inning of
Game 4, all but finishing the Red Sox. Garciaparra led off the
bottom of the ninth and grounded to third, and it appeared he had
beaten Scott Brosius' throw from third. But the umpire Dale Scott
called him out, and Williams exploded.
</P>
<P>
   After arguing at length, he threw his cap _ an act for which he
was ejected _ and kicked the dirt, the fans yelling all the while.
A fan launched a water bottle from the stands on the first-base
side, and soon there were many items airborne. Later, the Yankees'
principal owner, George Steinbrenner, said Williams had incited the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' response Monday: ``When Georgie Porgie speaks, I don't
listen. I didn't incite the fans. The situation incited the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said he did not believe Williams had incited the fans,
adding that as a manager, Williams often has a responsibility to
his team and the fans to express his displeasure with a call.
</P>
<P>
   When the assault of debris intensified, the Yankees were waved
off the field by Al Clark, the home-plate umpire. As the Yankees
descended into their dugout, some exchanged words with fans behind
the visitors' dugout. Several Yankees said that Steve Corcoran, the
head of security for the Red Sox, began screaming obscenities at
them and telling them to get in the dugout. Ultimately, teammates
restrained pitcher Jeff Nelson from going after Corcoran and
another security guard, and Manager Joe Torre criticized Corcoran
after the game.

CARDINAL O`CONNOR READMITTED TO HOSPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, who has been undergoing
radiation treatments for a brain tumor, was readmitted to the
hospital Monday at the request of his doctors, the cardinal's
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 79, the archbishop of New York, entered Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan at 3 p.m., said Joseph
Zwilling, his spokesman. O'Connor was expected to stay at least one
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal is experiencing fatigue from the therapy, which
is normal,'' Zwilling said. ``But given his age and the relatively
high dosages of radiation he is receiving, his doctors wanted to
make sure he is recovering normally.'' They also want to insure
that the cardinal is not becoming dehydrated because of the
therapy, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the cardinal had lost any weight, Zwilling said,
``I'm not sure.'' He added, ``People who have seen him say he may
have gained weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal canceled his appearance at a 5:30 p.m. Mass Monday
welcoming the relics of St. Therese of Lisieux to St. Patrick's
Cathedral. On Sunday, for the second week in a row, he canceled his
celebration of the 10:15 a.m. Mass at the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, he apologized for his absence. ``So much
for my promises,'' the cardinal wrote. ``I'll be back when I'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the cardinal had been hospitalized for 10 days, a
spokesman said on Sept. 4 that doctors had removed a small tumor
from his brain and that ``no other areas of the body were
affected.'' The announcement said O'Connor would undergo radiation
therapy for ``the next several weeks.''

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER CAMPAIGN FINANCE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   After months of delays, the Senate has finally begun its debate
on campaign finance. A surprise gambit last night by Sen. John
McCain to get a test vote on his bill, co-sponsored by Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin, was blocked by defenders of the current
system. Another attempt is due today. Now is the time for Trent
Lott, the majority leader, to fulfill a promise to allow votes on
the main bill and also on amendments that might expand the support
for reform.
</P>
<P>
   But there were reports last night that Lott would attempt today
to drop campaign finance reform from the agenda after two initial
test votes and go on to the subject of partial-birth abortion. Any
such effort would betray his pledge to McCain earlier in the year
for five full days of debate. If Lott tries to short-circuit the
process, McCain has no obligation to keep his promise not to
reintroduce campaign reform this year. The best result would be for
all pro-reform senators to demand that the Senate continue on this
critical subject.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell actually performed a service with his
extraordinary personal attack last Friday on McCain, a fellow
Republican who had the temerity to suggest that money corrupts the
system. To McConnell, the truckloads of cash for party coffers from
gambling, tobacco, health insurance and oil and gas interests are
just ``participation'' in politics. McConnell also complained on
``Meet the Press'' that this page had editorialized 114 times on
this subject since the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But as McCain has shown, persistence is necessary to any cleanup
of influence peddling in Congress. Even so, Democrats and
Republicans who favor reform are not fully unified. McCain angered
Democrats by not informing them that he would be moving abruptly
yesterday for a procedural vote on his own bill. But he acted out
of a reasonable fear that McConnell and Lott would try to prevent
the promised vote on a soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the maneuvers is the emergence of at least 53
senators favoring a basic ban on ``soft money'' donations to
political parties, the unlimited contributions from corporations,
unions and rich individuals that the parties use on behalf of
candidates in circumvention of the law. That support can grow only
if Lott fulfills his promise to allow a full debate, with
opportunities by Republicans and Democrats to offer amendments.
</P>
<P>
   We continue to support the basic objective of McCain and
Feingold to push for a simple soft-money ban, omitting for now the
separate provision that would regulate fund-raising by independent
groups. That measure has the best chance of gathering strength this
week. Thanks to McConnell's overplaying his hand, every senator
must ask whether his or her constituents really want a system that
is bought and paid for by wealthy outside interests. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Common sense and the rule of law both dictate that any
independent counsel charged with investigating a president has a
civic obligation to make a final report to the nation on his or her
findings. Kenneth Starr is skittering away from that obligation
even though the taxpayers, after the expenditure of $47 million,
have every right to expect him to be the government's most
knowledgeable official on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Whitewater
and related matters. Starr, who accepted the job of independent
counsel in 1994, likes to blame the White House for damaging his
reputation. But no one in the Clinton administration can fairly be
blamed for his failure to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   It was Starr's decision to hand off his duties to Robert Ray, an
aggressive racketeering and gang prosecutor, who joined the
independent counsel's office five months ago. President Clinton's
allies complained Monday that Ray overlapped briefly with Hillary
Rodham Clinton's likely opponent for Senate, Rudolph Giuliani, at
the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, and the new counsel needs
to be forthcoming on any questions of conflict of interest. Ray
says he intends to move the investigation forward in a ``prompt,
responsible and cost-effective manner.'' Those are reassuring
words. But they cannot disguise the fact that the public is being
cheated of a final summary of the evidence drafted, vouched for and
signed by Starr and backed by his five years of research.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may feel that any report from him would be tainted by the
perception that he has pursued a vendetta against Mr. and Mrs.
Clinton. But copping out on his duty is not the answer to that
problem. Having led the nation on a tumultuous journey punctuated
by the impeachment of a sitting president, Starr was obliged to
spend a few more months deciding on any final indictments and
delivering his professional conclusions about the quality of the
evidence on all aspects of his sprawling inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr took over as a former federal jurist with a
reputation for sound judgment. Monday, by leaving before his job
was done, he further diminished a reputation damaged for the most
part by his own legal and public-relations decisions.

HOSPITALS AND INSURERS BATTLE OVER PATIENTS' LENGTH OF STAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More and more managed care companies in the
metropolitan area are refusing to pay for one or more days of
patient hospital stays as a way to increase their own profits,
hospital administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group
representing area hospitals, has asked the state attorney general's
office to look into the practice, known in the industry as a ``day
carve-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals say that managed care companies most often refuse
payment for the last day of a patient's stay, but that they also
apply the practice to days mid-stay if they deem that the time was
spent inefficiently. Payment may be denied, for example, for an
entire Sunday during a stay that began on a Thursday and ended on
the subsequent Tuesday, because no tests or significant procedures
occurred that day.
</P>
<P>
   While the costs cannot by law be passed on to patients, the
hospitals maintain that this trimming in reimbursement rates is
hammering away at their profits and taking up hospital workers'
time with clerical tasks, both of which could undermine patient
care.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators also point out that the carve-outs are done after
a retrospective review _ an evaluation of a patient's hospital stay
after it has ended, instead of as it goes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``This activity has been just phenomenal,'' said Kenneth E.
Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
``The hospital and doctor frustration levels are rampant.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade association and hospital administrators said that the
practice of day carve-outs had increased substantially in the last
nine months, accounting for as much as 30 percent of days submitted
for billing. A year ago, that figure was closer to 5 percent, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the hospitals, reviewing the claim
information to determine whether any improper activity is
occurring,'' said Marc Violette, a spokesman for the attorney
general's office. ``We are concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies, while acknowledging the increase in day
carve-outs, counter that New York hospitals are woefully
inefficient and need to learn to do things like surgery and
diagnostic tests more quickly and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found an acute increase in the number of denied
days,'' said Dr. Marjorie Schulman, a medical director for Aetna
Inc. ``This points out how much further behind the New York market
is in getting with the program and becoming efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgeries are not taking place on weekends,'' Schulman added.
``Diagnostic tests are not being done on weekends and after hours _
most metropolitan regions are doing this. The payers are not
disputing the need for patients to be in the hospital. What we are
trying to apply are nationally recognized guidelines of what
constitutes acute care.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As with all things connected with managed care, New York is
coming to the day carve-out situation late, health care experts
said. While states like California have seen managed care companies
trim days for several years, New York is just starting to feel the
squeeze. This is because of the combination of a relatively new
payment system in New York and of increasingly aggressive
techniques among insurance companies all over the country, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, under deregulation of the New York hospital system, New
York changed its way of doing business with all insurers. Under the
old system, the hospitals were reimbursed by diagnosis, getting a
set amount, for example, for cardiac surgery and another for a
Caesarean birth. The number of days a patient stayed in the
hospital was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, hospitals are paid per diem. ``It dawned
on all the payers that if you can lop off days of stay, you can
save megabucks,'' Raske said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts outside New York said that while the day
carve-outs were motivated many years ago by rampant hospital abuses
_ admitting patients on Friday for procedures that would not be
done until Monday to gather their own ``megabucks'' _ the practice
may be gaining disturbing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some hospitals believe that some payers are automatically not
paying the last day,'' said Douglas A. Hastings, a health care
lawyer in Washington who has represented both insurance companies
and health care workers. ``We got day lengths down to about as far
as we can squeeze them, and some have gotten to point of wondering
if you can squeeze any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The trimming of days seems as random as it does rampant,
hospital executives say. No particular diseases or procedures are
chosen for the carves more frequently than others, and hospitals
staffs agreed that all of the region's major insurance companies _
Aetna, Oxford Health Plans, Cigna and Blue Cross and Blue Shield _
seem to use the practice regularly.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And large and small hospitals alike are seeing it. At Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx this year, for instance, a woman with a
history of heart problems was being prepared for outpatient surgery
but developed severe stomach pains. She was admitted to rule out a
heart attack, and it was determined the next day that she needed an
appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer, which the hospital declined to name, citing legal
issues, carved out the first day, contending that the pain
evaluation should have been done without the overnight stay. The
decision was reversed six months later after an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At Sisters of Charity Health Care on Staten Island, a woman went
through the emergency room one recent Sunday, bleeding from her
colostomy bag. The plan was to give her an internal exam the next
day, but she was admitted for the preparation and given fluids that
seriously needed replenishing, said Susan Hansen, administrative
director of clinical resources at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we have sent a 91-year-old woman who needed an IV home
and had her do her own bowl prep?'' Ms. Hansen asked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At New York University Medical Center, a young Wall Street
executive with a terminal brain tumor had the last day of his
three-day stay carved out because the insurance company believed it
was medically unnecessary, said Dr. Michael Gruber, head of
neuro-oncology there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are carving out days on the sickest patients,'' Gruber
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between hospital and insurance company
administrators has become so intense in recent months that
insurance companies have been forced to change some of the ways
they do business. At Oxford, for instance, retrospective reviews
were stopped altogether in August, said Dr. Alan Muney, the
company's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Payers constantly berate hospitals for not providing timely
information, but hospitals (and often patients) counter that
getting a live human on the phone at a health maintenance
organization is often akin to winning the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at HMOs also argue that keeping a patient in the
hospital longer than necessary ultimately exposes him or her to
more health risks, so pushing hospital efficiency is all the more
important. While some experts agree with that theory, they doubt
that it is the motivating factor of day carve-outs, or of hospitals
learning to do more services at odd hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two sides to this,'' said Robert I. Field, the
director of the graduate program on health policy at the University
of the Sciences in Philadelphia. ``I do think that insurers have
gotten people out of the hospital faster. But to the extent
hospitals increase the times they do surgery, it is to increase
volume. The implications that they are increasing quality of care
is probably not the case.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Hobbled by years of losses and high debts, Nissan Motor
Co. surprised Japan and the auto industry Monday with details of a
radical overhaul plan that will make unexpectedly deep cuts at the
company, Japan's No. 3 automaker, and reverberate more broadly
through the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year plan, presented by Nissan's aggressive new
chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, three plants will be closed
and 21,000 jobs eliminated, most of them in Japan. Nissan will also
halve its supplier base and close 10 percent of its dealerships,
with the objective of returning to profitability in the next fiscal
year, starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that a lot of people at Nissan will feel like
orphans in this plan,'' Ghosn said at a briefing for reporters and
securities analysts, where the details were released. ``But we have
no choice, and the fact that we have no choice is the strength of
our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He was echoed by Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president. ``There
is no other alternative for us,'' Hanawa said. ``In order for us to
survive, we must implement this revival plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Nissan spokesman, said that 1,400 jobs in the
United States would be eliminated through attrition and the sale of
divisions as part of the 21,000-person reduction in employment.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan plans to sell a 530-employee forklift division in
Illinois and a 380-person computer operations unit, he said, adding
that the remaining 490 jobs would disappear through attrition among
Nissan's 11,000 American employees, with no layoffs planned.
Slightly more than half of Nissan's American employees work at two
manufacturing plants in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the plan took securities analysts and executives
from other car companies by surprise, although its general
parameters were well known.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the numbers are concerned, it's even better than
expected,'' said Koji Endo, an analyst at Schroders Japan Ltd.,
speaking presumably of Nissan's aim of a return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the plan is like other corporate
reorganizations in Japan these days, but the magnitude of Nissan's
cuts makes it likely that its effects will be felt more strongly
than most others. About 500 parts and materials suppliers, for
instance, will lose Nissan's business, and the communities affected
by plant closings, still a rarity in Japan, could feel the most
acute impact.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan also plans to sell most of the shares it holds in
companies that have been linked through loans and
cross-shareholding, reducing its obligations to them as well as the
impact of stock-market fluctuations on its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few of those companies we consider as indispensable,''
Ghosn said. ``Over the next three years, a lot of these companies
will be out of the reach of Nissan.''
</P>
<P>
   How those businesses and communities respond to the challenge
created by Nissan Monday may in turn help shape the future of other
Japanese businesses. In the same way that closing three of Nissan's
plants is aimed at improving the productivity of its remaining
factories, a supplier forced to become more competitive might be
expected to become a healthier business.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn and Hanawa acknowledged that their plan is nothing until
it is executed. ``Ninety-five percent of the work remains,'' Hanawa
said. ``It is not going to be an easy process. It will be a very
difficult one.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be costly to Nissan. The company will take a 200
billion yen accounting charge, or about $1.9 billion, to cover the
costs of the restructuring in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn said the year's losses would be much larger than the 60
billion yen the company had forecast in May. In addition, Nissan's
liabilities will swell this year as changes in accounting rules
force it to include previously unrecognized pension and other
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The financial pain will not be limited to Nissan, either.
Renault SA, the French carmaker that purchased a 36.8 percent stake
in Nissan in March and installed Ghosn and several other foreign
executives to help lead a turnaround, said Monday that it would
take a $317 million accounting charge related to its Japanese
partner's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's costs in human terms and in corporate pride are
expected to be even greater. Traditional labor practices and tough
labor laws make layoffs as they are known in the United States
virtually impossible. ``The plan is roughly what the doctor
ordered,'' said Jay Woodworth, an independent automotive analyst.
``Now I hope Mr. Ghosn has all his ducks in a row, and in
particular has Nissan's labor union on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the rest of his speech was straightforward, Ghosn
finessed the part on job reductions, using the same cautious
language employed by Japanese executives forced to broach that
uncomfortable subject. He said Nissan, which has a global work
force of around 148,000, plans to prune its work force through
attrition, the increased use of part-time employees, spinoffs and
``early retirement,'' a euphemism in Japan for layoffs sweetened by
generous severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Endo of Schroders said he had spoken with the chairman of the
company's union not long ago, who told him the union would be
unhappy with any job cuts of more than 3,000. While it is almost
unheard of for Japanese unions to strike, their cooperation is
considered critical to the plan's success.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn and Hanawa played down such concerns Monday. ``Already in
the past we have had reallocations of personnel,'' Hanawa said.
``This won't be a first-time experience.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, the plan was blunt and direct. ``The key
facts and figures about Nissan point to a reality: Nissan is in bad
shape,'' Ghosn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese automaker's market share has dropped to 4.9 percent
worldwide from 6.6 percent in 1991. It has turned a profit in only
one of the last seven years, and its debts, excluding potential
liabilities related to leasing cars, are estimated at $12.6 billion
by the close of this fiscal year, at the end of March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring plan presents a litany of cuts that go beyond
plants and workers: Purchasing costs, which now eat up 58 percent
of Nissan's net sales, will be cut 20 percent. Platforms, the
backbone of a vehicle, will be reduced to 14 from the current 24 by
2002, and to 12 by 2004, and Renault and Nissan will produce some
cars on the same platforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Ghosn made it clear that the plan was not only about cutting
back and casting away, but also about creating new,
more-exciting-looking vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product development will be at the heart of Nissan's
revival,'' he said. In one sign of Ghosn's commitment, the design
team in Japan is being removed from the engineering group and
placed under the oversight of Patrick Pelata, the French head of
product development, in hopes of insuring that Nissan's future
models will have greater consumer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's plan was announced after the stock market closed here.
Earlier, its shares tumbled 7.1 percent to 637 yen, or $6.06. Later
in New York, Nissan's American depository receipts closed unchanged
on NASDAQ at $12.875. Renault shares fell a little more than 2
percent in Paris to 49.9 euros, or $54.10.

 &HT;    More foreign leaders making Austin stop as Bush lead grows
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The president of Colombia wants $3.5 billion in
foreign aid to boost a faltering economy that has his nation
reeling. So he's coming to see Gov. George W. Bush today.
</P>
<P>
   The world _ with its problems and leaders _ is finding its way
to Austin to meet the man who might be president. So far this year,
leaders from 22 nations have made the pilgrimage to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Some are dignitaries who would be interested in the governor no
matter who held the office. But others are folks interested in
getting a handle on the leading candidate for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say so,'' said Achilles Paparsenos, spokesman for the
Greek Embassy, when asked whether Bush's international profile has
soared with his poll numbers. ``Many Greeks follow the American
campaign very closely. And this will multiply when the campaign
gets into high gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Philon, the Greek ambassador to the United States,
made the trek to Austin to meet Bush in January.
</P>
<P>
   Today's private meeting at the Governor's Mansion was requested
by Colombian President Andres Pastrana as part of his effort to
make his case for foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Morales, spokeswoman for the Colombian Embassy in
Washington, said Pastrana is trying to meet with all of the major
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for President Pastrana to meet (Bush)
just to explain, as he has been doing here in Washington and will
be doing in Europe, what is the real situation in Colombia, and to
explain why it would be attractive to invest in Colombia,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said Pastrana also wants to meet with Vice President Al
Gore and former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, contenders for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is looking for help with an economy in deep recession.
Last week, workers staged a one-day nationwide strike to protest
Pastrana's economic plan, which includes a call for a freeze on
public-sector wages and cuts in social services programs.
</P>
<P>
   The nation recently secured a $2.7 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund and is seeking increased aid from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Colombian officials, acting on indictments from
a Miami federal grand jury, arrested 31 people targeted as major
drug traffickers in a nation that provides much of the U.S. supply
of heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush welcomes the
increasing attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is currently the front-runner and, from our perspective, it
is important for somebody who might be president of the United
States to begin establishing personal relationships that could be
key to conducting foreign policy later,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   But visits by foreign dignitaries also may be due to Bush's
being governor of the second-largest state in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose foreign policy experience is limited to dealings
with Mexico and meetings with campaign advisers trying to get him
up to speed, has met this year with officials from Australia,
Brunei, Costa Rica, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South
Korea, Laos, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, New
Zealand, the Philippines, Slovenia, South Africa, Taiwan, the
United Kingdom and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as Bush was laying the groundwork for the
presidential campaign, his international visitors included
officials from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, the Czech
Republic, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand,
Slovenia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and
Venezuela.Ken Herman writes for the Austin American-Statesman,
Austin, Texas.

EDITORIAL: PAKISTAN'S MILITARY TEMPTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, a corrupt and incompetent democratic government has
been replaced by a military dictator who now pledges bold and
necessary reforms. Gen. Pervez Musharraf's speech to the Pakistani
people Sunday night was reassuringly statesmanlike. But one big
omission was a schedule for restoring democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's speech promised peace talks with India, restraint on
nuclear weapons, a crackdown on corruption and a drive to collect
taxes from the privileged elite. He also condemned Islamic
extremism and promised to respect press freedom. He is already off
to an encouraging start by withdrawing thousands of troops from the
Indian border and giving the central bank a larger role in managing
Pakistan's troubled finances.
</P>
<P>
   But promises of reform have been made by previous governments
without lasting results. A real cleanup would be a heroic
accomplishment. But it would be drained of meaning if Musharraf
fails to re-establish democratic rule in a timely way. The
Commonwealth was right yesterday to suspend Pakistan's membership
until democracy is restored. Washington must also press for an
electoral timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, once appeared a
champion of democracy. But his government, like that of his
predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, acquired a reputation for corruption,
with Pakistan's financial resources allegedly flowing into foreign
bank accounts. Such failures do not justify the coup, but explain
why few protested.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf apparently seized power without any long-term plan for
governing. His most pressing problem will be halting the alarming
drain in government finances that has brought Pakistan close to
international default. Real reform would require big reductions in
military spending, something Musharraf is unlikely to attempt. Yet
failure to ease financial pressures would bring increased suffering
to millions of poor Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf should not make the mistake of Pakistan's last
military dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who prolonged his stay
in power for 11 years and left his country's political and business
mores more degraded than he found them. Instead he should set a
realistic timetable for genuine elections and let an independent
judiciary decide any corruption cases. The idea of a tough military
man imposing neat solutions for complex problems is appealing to
Pakistan's long-suffering people. It has never brought lasting
progress. &QL;
