Ruling May Frost Microsoft's Relations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Much of the high-tech industry has been gradually
distancing itself from Microsoft since the software giant's legal troubles
began, and that tendency is likely to accelerate regardless of whether
Wednesday's breakup ruling is upheld on appeal. While still an industry
powerhouse, Microsoft's name no longer carries the weight it once did because
operating systems have become less crucial components in the increasingly
important business of getting the Internet into everything from computers to
cellphones to automobiles.

AT&AMP;T Defers Plan To Raise Many Rates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being sharply rebuked by federal regulators, AT&AMP;T
said Wednesday it will defer its plan to raise many per-minute rates for tens of
millions of customers. The nation's largest long-distance carrier said it will
study ways to restructure its rates, focusing on basic rate consumers who make
few calls. The company will freeze its current per-minute basic rates until it
has completed its review and has informed customers of any changes and available
options. The move came hours after telecommunications regulators said they would
enforce a pledge by AT&AMP;T to pass on to consumers billions of dollars in savings
from a restructuring of the phone system.

Survey: Kids Fuel Internet Explosion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Children are fueling the Internet explosion,
according to a new national survey that found the number of 2- to 17-year-olds
logging into cyberspace has tripled since 1997. ''The notion that children are
an emerging market is no longer true. They have emerged,'' said Peter Grunwald,
president of the San Mateo-based Grunwald Associates, which conducted the
survey. The survey found that more than 25 million children in the United States
are on the Internet, up from 8 million in 1997. And by the year 2005, the number
of children online is expected to increase by another 70 percent, the survey
projected.

   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- A week after he was hospitalized for intestinal

then was sent home. The 97-year-old entertainer's appearance outside Eisenhower
Medical Center had been planned, but not his discharge. Hope decided Wednesday
that as long as he was up and dressed that he would go home, and his doctor

Dismissals Sought in Columbine Suits

   DENVER (AP) -- Jefferson County attorneys asked a federal judge Wednesday to
dismiss four lawsuits filed by families of Columbine victims saying the lawsuits
unfairly blame the sheriff's department for the massacre. ''Although it is
natural to assign blame after a tragedy of this magnitude, the law does not
support the attempts to blame law enforcement officers and government officials
for atrocities committed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,'' assistant county
attorney William Tuthill said in a statement.

Police were to close the 150-yard-long, 9-yard-deep tunnel later Wednesday,

Lakers Defeat Pacers 104-87
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal put up numbers worthy of a champion,
scoring 43 points and grabbing 19 rebounds as Los Angeles kept a comfortable
lead most of the way and defeated the Indiana Pacers 104-87 in Game 1 on
Wednesday night. As expected, O'Neal was an unstoppable force against an
opponent with few options for slowing him down. Whether they single-teamed him
or used double-coverage, nothing really worked for the Pacers in trying to stop
the Lakers' 7-foot-1 center.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Quake Shakes N. Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A strong earthquake struck northern
Myanmar early Thursday morning, but there were no immediate reports
of injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   The quake occurred at 4:17 a.m. Myanmar time, with the epicenter
95 miles north of Myitkyina, a town in a remote area near the
northern tip of Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country also known as
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary reading of the temblor was 6.5, according to
Geophysicist Trina Vithayathil of the U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo. The Northern Meteorological Center in Chiang Mai,
Thailand, gave a reading of 6.35.
</P>
<P>
   Quakes of that strength can cause severe damage. The area where
the quake hit, however, is little-developed and thinly populated.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Break Forces Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Mich. (AP) -- An underground pipeline ruptured
Wednesday, spilling thousands of gallons of gasoline into a drain
that carried it to the Grand River, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents living within a four-square-mile area of the leak in
Blackman Township, about 80 miles west of Detroit, were ordered to
evacuate their homes, and Gov. John Engler declared a local state
of emergency, The Jackson Citizen Patriot reported.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, but officials said it could be two or
three days before residents would be allowed to return. The
evacuation area included 450 homes in two subdivisions just north
of Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Between 50,000 and 100,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a
Wolverine Pipeline Co. storage facility and into ditches and
creeks, officials said. The cause was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The leak was detected about 10:30 a.m. when a drop in pressure
was recorded at a metering station along the Illinois-to-Detroit
pipeline, Jackson County Administrator Chet Taraskiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline rose to ground level, then began flowing into the storm
drain that eventually carried it to the Grand River, he said. He
said the leak was closed off and cleanup was underway by 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical and natural gas service was cut off to nearby homes
and businesses, and residents were told to avoid using generators,
which could produce sparks that might trigger an explosion. Rural
residents were also urged not to use water from wells.
</P>
<P>
   Taraskiewicz said it wasn't known late Wednesday whether the
spill had affected drinking water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   He said police were stationed at the leak site and along the
drain's 1{-mile-length leading to the Grand River to keep away
anything that might cause a spark that could ignite the gasoline or
its heavy fumes.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Convicted of Rape Is Caught  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- An Arkansas pastor on the run for more than a
year after being convicted of raping two young sisters was captured
Wednesday in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wilson, 46, was arrested by agents of the Minnesota
Fugitive Task Force in the south Minneapolis neighborhood where he
lived. He fled in his car, but turned the wrong way down a dead-end
alley -- right behind a Minneapolis police precinct station.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was on trial in March 1999 in Arkansas for raping two
sisters, ages 7 and 9, while he was a minister in a church near
Little Rock. He fled during a lunch break and was later convicted
in absentia and sentenced to 40 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, he obtained a driver's license using a false name
and passed a criminal background check to get a job as a manager at
a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was being held in the Hennepin County Jail, awaiting
extradition to Arkansas, expected within a few days. He faces
additional charges for fleeing to avoid prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Man Executed for Inmate Murder  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- A man who was convicted of a double murder,
only to have his death sentence overturned, was executed Wednesday
for another slaying -- the 1976 stabbing death of fellow prison
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Demps, 49, was put to death for the stabbing of Alfred
Sturgis, who was attacked in his cell. The dying Sturgis told a
prison guard that Demps and another inmate had held him down while
a third inmate stabbed him.
</P>
<P>
   In his final statement, Demps proclaimed his innocence and asked
his lawyer for an investigation into what he said was a very
painful procedure. He said it took almost an hour to prepare him
for execution and claimed he was cut in the leg and groin.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an execution, this is murder,'' Demps said before
his lethal injection. ''I am an innocent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush's spokesman said paperwork was delayed and
technicians had trouble finding a vein for the intravenous
injection. An official at the Department of Corrections said the
procedure was carried out properly and Demps ''suffered no undue
discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he was being executed because he had avoided the
death penalty earlier. He was sent to death row for killing two
people who were inspecting a citrus grove where he had fled with a
stolen safe in 1971. His sentence was reduced after the Supreme
Court threw out capital punishment nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the high court allowed capital punishment to resume.
Sturgis was killed two months later, and Demps was convicted and
again sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to execute me in this case for that case,''
Demps said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court in 1981 upheld Demps' death sentence
in Sturgis' slaying, rejecting his argument that it should be
overturned because the other two inmates were given life sentences.
Judges noted that the others had no prior murder convictions.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Wants Changes From U.N.  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's
government on Wednesday called on the United Nations to fire its
chief administrator and withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Cabinet approved a statement to be sent to the U.N.
Security Council demanding that it withdraw peacekeepers who
''violate their mandate, betray the trust given them'' and ''are
responsible for the ethnic genocide against Serbs and
non-Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the government was referring to all
peacekeepers or those from specific countries such as the United
States. Russia's upper house of parliament on Wednesday approved
extending deployment of Moscow's 3,000 troops in Kosovo for an
indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   In a television address, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic also
demanded the United Nations fire the chief U.N. administrator in
Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner of France, and revoke his decisions which
are ''contrary to the Security Council resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO-led troops entered Kosovo on June 12, there have been
more than 5,000 ''terrorist'' attacks that have killed more than
1,000 people, according to Deputy Foreign Minister Nebojsa Vujovic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some 350,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians have been
ethnically cleansed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members are expected to discuss Kosovo next
week, and a delegation of Kosovo Serbs left the province for New
York on Wednesday to meet with U.N. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   International peacekeepers took over the province after the NATO
bombing campaign forced Milosevic to halt his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists and withdraw his army and troops.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. war crimes investigators began tests Wednesday at a another
suspected mass grave site in central Kosovo, trying to determine
how many corpses may be buried in the garden of a local farmer.
Investigators have found two bodies in the village of Gornja Klina,
25 miles northwest of the provincial capital of Pristina, and
believe as many as 35 bodies may lie below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has learned about 440 gravesites this year, in
addition to the 170 examined in 1999. The number of sites is
expected to increase, said Paul Risley, spokesman for the
tribunal's prosecutor.

<HEADLINE> Mercury 82, Storm 49  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Brandy Reed scored 20 of her 24 points in the
first half as the Phoenix Mercury bounced back from their only loss
by beating the Seattle Storm 82-49 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who set the franchise record for a regulation game with 32
points against Houston on Saturday, saw little action after Phoenix
took a 44-32 halftime lead against expansion Seattle (0-4).
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Pettis had 15 points and Michelle Griffiths 14, helping
the Mercury (4-1) recover from a 76-61 loss at Utah the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Kamila Vodichkova had 12 points for the Storm, and Simone
Edwards had 11 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury have led by at least 10 points in each victory and
got there with 7:42 left in the first half when Pettis took a
defensive rebound into the frontcourt and pulled up for a 16-foot
jumper that made it 25-15.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a 16-7 run which saw the Storm go seven minutes
without a basket while Phoenix assumed a 37-22 lead with 2:12 left
in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle reserve Jamie Redd ended the field-goal drought with a
3-pointer with 1:39 to play, and scored six more points in the
final 32 seconds of the half.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed had the final word, sinking a spinning layup with 8.9
seconds to play -- her seventh field goal in eight tries. For the
game, she went 8-for-11 from the field and 7-for-7 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Edwards, scoreless in the first half, made a pair of
baskets as the Mercury ended any suspense with a 15-4 run in the
early in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Will Take Lie Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson will take a lie detector test if
someone puts up a $3 million reward to catch his ex-wife's killer,
defense attorney F. Lee Bailey announced on CNN's ''Larry King
Live'' Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Simpson passes the test, the reward money would be put in a
trust fund and paid out for information about the crime. If he
fails, the letter of credit pledging the money will be dissolved,
Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The results will be made public either way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be publicly seen, win, lose or draw,'' said the famed
defense attorney, who represented Simpson at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''O.J.'s not trying to make O.J. rich. He's trying to get enough
money out there to smoke someone out,'' Bailey told King from West
Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the former football player told The Associated Press
that he never has taken a lie-detector test but was hooked up
briefly to a polygraph machine to see how it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey on Friday had said during a Florida hearing where his
license to practice law is being challenged that he suggested
Simpson be stopped from completing a lie-detector test after the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 murders of
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. However, he
was found liable for their wrongful deaths in a subsequent civil
trial and was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   King also had Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, on the program.
Goldman said he hopes ''no one is stupid enough to give money ...
so he (Simpson) can smile at the world and claim he's innocent
again.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura, Minn. Might Lose Its Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Minn. (AP) -- The new city of Ventura, named after Gov.
Jesse Ventura, could end up with another name after more than
one-fourth of its 2,800 residents signed a petition to change it.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to put the question
on the November ballot. City Clerk Harlan Jopp said that with 800
signatures on the petition, the council felt the issue warranted a
popular vote. The council has not yet finalized a list of town name
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, formerly St. Augusta Township, was incorporated as a
city last month. It is in central Minnesota, about 70 miles
northwest of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Township officials had chosen the name Ventura because they
blame their legal difficulties in becoming a city on state
lawmakers. The governor wants to cut the Legislature from two
chambers to one, and township officials contend a single-chamber
Legislature would have been more friendly to their request.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Josh Wolff's pair of goals rallied Chicago past
Miami 2-1 Wednesday night, the Fire's fifth victory in seven games
and the Fusion's third straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (8-6-1), playing before a crowd of only 5,288, extended
its Central Division lead to four standings points over the Tampa
Bay Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (4-6-4) went ahead after 12 minutes on Jim Rooney's goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolff brought Chicago back, tying the game in the 33rd
minute thanks to a misplay by the normally solid Fusion defense.
Miami defender Leo Cullen lost control of the ball, allowing Wolff
to pounce on it 30 yards out and speed in alone on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff hit the winner with seven minutes left after a spectacular
run by Peter Nowak.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak sliced through midfield and broke clear near the top of
the box. He faked a pass to Dema Kovalenko on the right and slid
the ball over on the left side to Wolff, whose shot beat Miami
goalkeeper Nick Rimando.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has scored an MLS-high 34 goals in 15 games, including
five goals in the team's last two outings without league-leading
scorer Ante Razov. Razov, midfielder Chris Armas and defender C.J.
Brown are all playing with the U.S. national squad in the U.S. Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion have allowed eight goals in their last three games,
after yielding just 10 in the first 11 games.

<HEADLINE> Miller and Rose Lead Indiana  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reggie Miller issued a warning for the Los
Angeles Lakers after his dismal shooting performance in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they continue to give me these looks they're going to be in
trouble,'' he said. ''My first four baskets went in and out and
every shot but one felt good, so if they're going to play me like
that, it's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored a career playoff-low seven points on 1-for-16
shooting in his NBA Finals debut and the Indiana Pacers lost 104-87
to the Lakers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest series of our careers and you want to play
the best that you possibly can, but the good thing about it is
there's a game on Friday,'' he said. ''It's just one of those off
nights and Friday will be an on night.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 3-point ability was non-existent, a stunning showing
for the 12-year veteran who's hit more 3-pointers than any player
in NBA history. He missed on all three of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggie's just got to make a few,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird
said. ''He's carried us a long way and he'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Staples Center taunted him as he sat on the bench
in the closing minutes. Miller, a native of nearby Riverside who
starred at UCLA, never reacted, keeping quiet on a night when his
famous cockiness remained under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was angry, disappointed or frustrated, Miller
replied, ''Probably all three of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pacers fought back from two 17-point deficits to
get within two late in the third quarter, they sorely missed
Miller's fiery presence.
</P>
<P>
   But none of his teammates doubt Miller will be back firing in
Game 2 Friday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's our team leader and we're not going to win without him,''
said Austin Croshere, who had 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the team's heart and soul for 13 years, was scoreless in
the first half, missing all seven shots. Indiana didn't fare much
better, going 16-of-38 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   His first points came on two free throws at 8:19 of the third
period. His first field goal came on his ninth attempt about three
minutes later to draw the Pacers within 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel bad all I got up was 16 shots. If I was going to be
1-for-16, I at least should have been like 1-for-25 or something,''
he said. ''I felt I didn't get enough looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of his early attempts were wide-open looks, and the Lakers
generally conceded the baseline to Miller, although he was
unsuccessful shooting over 7-foot-1 Shaquille O'Neal, who had 43
points and 19 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continued to attack the basket,'' Miller said. ''That's what
you have to do especially in the Finals, you've got to try to get
to the line as much as possible. You just can't settle for jump
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers looked like a team playing in their first Finals.
Most of them, including Bird, didn't arrive until after 5 p.m. PDT
because one of the team's buses was caught in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Miller arrived on the first bus, giving him time to gather his
thoughts as he put wraps on his feet before slipping into his
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves seemed evident in the first half when Jalen Rose and Rik
Smits both dribbled the ball off their feet for turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't nervous,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, often known as ''Miller Time,'' he tossed
up an airball, then missed a 3-pointer with the Pacers down by 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a different showing than the fourth quarter of Game
6 of the Eastern Conference finals. Miller scored 17 of his 34
points in the period as the Pacers beat the Knicks in New York to
reach the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miller is the type of guy I've never really seen him off two
games, so he's going to come to play Friday,'' O'Neal said.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Boat Sinks Off Maine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine (AP) -- A 52-foot fishing trawler sank in
stormy seas about 17 miles off the coast, and two of its three crew
members drowned, the Coast Guard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard received a distress call from the Portland-based
Infinity late Tuesday and dispatched an airplane, a helicopter and
a high-speed rescue boat, said Petty Officer Dean Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers faced heavy rain, strong wind and 8- to 12-foot
seas. They located the site of the sinking after detecting the
smell of spilled fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor, Daniel Ela, was found clinging to the boat's
emergency beacon and was plucked from the water at about midnight,
Meyers said. Ela, 29, was taken to the Maine Medical Center in
Portland and was released Wednesday morning, a nursing supervisor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also recovered the bodies of Sean McDougall and
Jeffrey Martin, said Petty Officer Terrell Odom. Their home towns
and ages were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Bryant, Miller Look To NBA Finals  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Things are back to normal for the Los Angeles
Lakers -- get the ball into Shaq, and let him operate.
</P>
<P>
   And that meant a convincing 104-87 victory over the Indiana
Pacers in Wednesday night's opener of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had to battle Portland's behemoths throughout the
Western Conference finals, and barely survived. Revolving their
attack around O'Neal became an impossibility, and his teammates
struggled, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are just about always at their best when O'Neal
scores big, and that was the case on this night as he had 43 points
and 19 rebounds to thoroughly demolish the tandem of Rik Smits and
Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''This offense is designed to go away from pressure,'' Lakers
guard Derek Fisher said. ''We tried to attack the pressure against
Portland. Indiana tried to single-cover Shaq. I'd be surprised if
they don't play the next game differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers forward A.C. Green also said he expects the Pacers to
adjust in Game 2, to be played Friday night at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different style of defense they play, that's not how
it's going to be,'' he said. ''They're going to do some different
things, I'm sure. This is a game of adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   From the game's beginning, the Lakers had room to roam, and got
plenty of open shots from O'Neal inside and from Kobe Bryant, Ron
Harper, Rick Fox and other members of the supporting cast from
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were lulls. The Lakers led 33-18 after the first
quarter after shooting 15-of-21.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers cut the deficit to 12 points at halftime, and got as
close as two late in the third quarter before Bryant made
consecutive jumpers -- his first points since the first period -- and
Brian Shaw added another with 2.1 seconds left to make it 77-71
entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was 83-77 early in the period when O'Neal made a follow shot
to trigger a 6-0 run and end all doubts.
</P>
<P>
   That shot gave O'Neal 35 points, equaling his total of the last
two games against Portland in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 21 field goals in 31 attempts, and the Lakers
as a team were 45-of-88 (51.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very good to see guys playing team ball,'' Harper said.
''We did everything we needed to do. It's not just Shaq by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaq had a hell of a game, but he can't do it by himself.
Until you stop him, we're going to keep going to Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   With Harper leading the way, the Lakers did an exceptional
defensive job on Pacers star Reggie Miller, who was a dreadful
1-of-16 in scoring seven points -- all after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Miller entered the game averaging 23.8 points in the playoffs,
and scored 17 in the fourth quarter alone of Indiana's 93-80
clinching victory over the New York Knicks in Game 6 of the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set early, as Miller misfired on all six
first-period shots he took. Harper, the wily veteran who helped
Chicago win three championships during the 1990s, was terrific at
the offensive end, too, making three shots in as many attempts in
scoring eight points, and adding four assists without committing a
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't shut him down,'' said Harper, who wound up with 12
points and five assists in 21 minutes. ''He missed some shots. It
was other guys on my team, too. The main thing I was trying to do
is have a hand in his face. He's a guy who will get his shots, his
shots didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fox: ''Reggie's such a focal point along with Jalen (Rose).
It was only one win, he had an off-game. That's not characteristic
of Reggie.''

Views Differ on Microsoft Breakup
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Consumers were divided in praising and criticizing a judge's
decision to break up Microsoft Corp. But most people said the order would have
little impact immediately, if ever, as the case enters what is expected to be a
lengthy appeals process. Analysts generally agree that Wednesday's ruling will
have little immediate impact on consumer and corporate users of Microsoft's
products. Microsoft employees working at the company's pavilion said plenty of
people had mentioned their company's legal battle with the Department of
Justice, but more out of interest than concern about whether to invest in
Windows-based products.

study ways to restructure its rates, focusing on basic rate consumers who make
few calls. The company will freeze its current per-minute basic rates until it
has completed its review and has informed customers of any changes and available
options. The move came hours after telecommunications regulators said they would

<HEADLINE> Solomon Rebels Strafe Pols' Plane  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Gunmen on Wednesday fired at a
plane carrying two British mediators fleeing the Solomon Islands,
where fighting between rival groups intensified and truckloads of
armed teen-agers cruised streets.
</P>
<P>
   The British politicians -- Glenys Kinnock and John Corrie,
members of the European Parliament -- traveled this week to the
Pacific nation to act as mediators between rival islanders in the
Solomons chain.
</P>
<P>
   But Corrie and Kinnock became trapped in their hotel in the
capital, Honiara, as fighting intensified on the main Solomons
island of Guadalcanal, and they decided to fly out on a chartered
aircraft Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we taxied down the runway there was a tremendous
fusillade of shots at us,'' Corrie said. ''A small part of the
aircraft stopped functioning and we had to go back into the
terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But the second time there were no problems,'' Corrie told the
BBC from Papua New Guinea. ''We took off and have safely arrived in
Papua New Guinea. Everybody is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not known which group -- The Malaita Eagle Force or the
Istabu Freedom Movement -- fired on the plane, although the Malaita
Eagles took the perimeter of the airport in fighting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnock, the wife of European Union official Neil Kinnock, said
the situation rapidly ''became completely lawless'' after Monday's
coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police just seemed to concede to the (rebel) gunmen of the
Malaita Eagle Force under Andrew Nori. There were armed men roaming
around with homemade weapons and the streets were blocked and the
airport closed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous Istabu have been fighting to force the Malaitans
off Guadalcanal, where U.S. Marines in 1942-43 first began the long
fight back against Japan in a grueling seven-month battle after the
attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands government crisis had appeared to ease
Wednesday when rebels from Malaita island released Prime Minister
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu from house arrest and dropped demands that he
resign.
</P>
<P>
   But New Zealand's foreign minister, Phil Goff, who has been
closely monitoring the situation, said early Thursday that
Ulufa'alu had apparently been placed back under house arrest. He
said it was unclear whether Nori had reneged on the deal or whether
Malaita rebel leaders had lost control of their gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   A radio report early Thursday from the Solomon Island
Broadcasting Co. said Ulufa'alu's residence was surrounded by armed
men, but that there had been no new combat in the areas around the
airport, east of the capital of Honiara and the scene of recent gun
battles.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcaster's Web site on Thursday quoted Ulufa'alu as
saying of his seizure: ''Literally, it's a coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia said it was dispatching a warship Thursday to evacuate
its citizens and other foreigners who want to leave. There are 700
Australians in the Solomons but the ship could take up to 800
people, Defense Minister John Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels fought around the capital Wednesday, and stranded
foreigners reported seeing truckloads of armed teen-agers cruising
Honiara's streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about 15-year-old kids who have got machine
guns. It is a little daunting,'' said Australian businessman Derek
Harvey, adding that the rebels did not threaten foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said he drove to the airport Tuesday but turned around
after seeing vehicles flee from shots fired by snipers sitting on
top of coconut trees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Malaitan spokesman, Nori, said that his forces
fired from a stolen police gunboat on a rival rebel group on a
beach, killing 100. Nori said his comrades on the ground watched
from about 60 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no civilians,'' Nori said. ''They were all carrying
weapons. They were not holding a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nori's claims could not be immediately confirmed. A Solomon
Islands government spokesman and New Zealand officials said there
was a gunboat attack in the morning, but they had no information
about deaths.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff, whose nation is 2,300
miles southeast of the Solomons and who has been monitoring the
situation, said Nori's claims appear to contain ''a significant
level of exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people have been killed or left missing in recent
fighting on Guadalcanal, and 20,000 have been forced to flee their
homes.

<HEADLINE> Surgery Can Relieve Parkinson's  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Burning a tiny hole deep in the brain can relieve
some symptoms
of Parkinson's disease for more than five years, though certain
major improvements wear off, researchers reported today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The surgery is called pallidotomy and involves the removal of a
part of the brain that controls movement. It can be useful when
medicine alone cannot control the progressive neurological
disorder, doctors in Toronto concluded in their study published
today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery is different from that undergone by actor Michael J.
Fox, the Parkinson's patient who left television last month to
focus on finding a cure. Fox had a thalamotomy, a decades-old
operation that destroys overactive, tremor-causing nerve cells by
burning or freezing a pea-size spot in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a follow-up to one published in 1997 about the
first 40 patients the doctors treated with pallidotomy.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors knew that, over the short term, pallidotomy can relieve
symptoms such as tremors and stiffness, as well as uncontrollable
arm and leg movements caused by the medicines used to treat
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier study of 40 patients found significant improvement
both while taking medications and off them.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up found that the reduction in tremors and rigidity
while off medication was nearly as marked 4{ years afterward as at
the first checkup six months after the operation. So was the
reduction in the twitches and jerks caused by medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But improvements in the level of daily functioning did not last.
The study did not give details, except as composite scores in
several scales designed for Parkinson's patients.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only 20 of the patients could be included in the
follow-up, and they were generally the ones who had responded best
at the start, wrote Dr. Jennifer Fine, a neurosurgeon at Toronto
Western Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bias may limit the general applicability of our
results,'' Fine wrote.

<HEADLINE> Weight-Loss Herb Damaged Kidneys  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A Chinese herb in a weight-loss preparation damaged
the kidneys
of 105 patients at a Belgian clinic and apparently caused 18 cases
of cancer among them, researchers reported today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Our findings reinforce the idea that the use of natural herbal
medicine may not be without risk,'' Dr. Joelle Nortier of Hopital
Erasme wrote in today's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows how dangerous dietary supplements can be, and
should help convince Congress that they should be regulated, Dr.
David Kessler, former head of the Food and Drug Administration and
now dean of Yale's medical school, wrote in an accompanying
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA announced Friday it is stopping the importation of herbs
in the Aristolochia family because they had caused kidney failure
in Belgium and in Britain, where they were being used to treat a
skin condition.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases of kidney damage from Chinese herbs have been
reported in France, Spain, Japan and Taiwan, according to Nortier.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, the herb was not listed among the ingredients of the
weight-loss pills and was put into them by mistake, Nortier said.
</P>
<P>
   Aristolochia fangchi's name in Chinese is similar to that of
Stephania tetrandra, the herb that was supposed to be in the pills,
and it often is substituted for the Stephania, according to
Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since there is virtually no control over the quality of these
products, it is not unusual not to know what is actually in herbal
preparations and dietary supplements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The herb was in weight-loss pills prescribed in Belgium from
1990 to 1992, when Belgium banned Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the hospital in Brussels has treated 105 patients
for kidney damage and 43 of them for kidney failure, Nortier said.

<HEADLINE> Artery Scraping Too Risky for Some  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   A procedure in which doctors scrape out a partially clogged
artery in the neck may be too risky for people who have had no
signs of a stroke, researchers suggested today in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A stroke occurs when a clot blocks the flow of blood to the
brain. There is no question that scraping out a clogged carotid
artery -- a procedure called an endarterectomy -- can help prevent
strokes in people who have already had one.
</P>
<P>
   But the study casts doubt on the value and the safety of
endarterectomy in people who have no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In an endarterectomy, a surgeon opens up the neck, clamps the
artery around the blockage, scrapes out the fat that is blocking
it, then sews head and neck back up.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at 1,820 patients who had a partially blocked
carotid artery but were otherwise symptom-free. Half of them were
given the operation, the other half only medicine. A total of 122
people later had strokes caused by blood clots in the area of the
brain fed by the clogged artery.
</P>
<P>
   But in 45 percent of those strokes, the blocked carotid artery
was not the source of the clot: The clots had formed in the heart
or in small blood vessels within the brain. And those strokes
cannot be prevented by endarterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Henry J.M. Barnett of the John P.
Robarts Research Institute in London, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The group treated with medicine had a 6.6 percent risk that the
artery blockage would cause a stroke, compared with a 3.1 percent
risk for patients who had the operation. But Barnett said the
improved outlook for those patients is outweighed by the risk of
endarterectomy itself.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare figures indicate that endarterectomy itself carries
about a 2.5 percent risk of death. That does not include patients
who suffer strokes shortly after the operation; the rate of such
strokes is at least double the risk of death, Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the danger from having the operation greater than the
danger of not having it, he said. Until further research, ''the
scales are tipped against the routine use of endarterectomy in
patients who have no symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen L. Furie, a neurologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital, took issue with the conclusion. Rather than ruling out
surgery in all such cases, doctors should use ultrasound to see
which patients are most at risk, she said.

<HEADLINE> Enzyme in Alzheimer's Onset ID'd  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   An enzyme suspected of playing a key role in Alzheimer's has
finally been identified by scientists, an advance that could give
drug companies a promising target for treating the mind-wasting
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The disease causes the development of deposits that are thought
to kill brain cells. The deposits are created when a long,
string-like protein is cut in two specific places.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe a ''chemical scissors'' makes one of the
cuts, calling it gamma secretase without ever actually identifying
it.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's issue of the journal Nature, scientists at Merck
Research Laboratories in West Point, Pa., reported that they have
found strong evidence that gamma secretase is actually presenilin
1.
</P>
<P>
   Presenilin 1 has already been linked to a rare inherited form of
Alzheimer's that strikes people in their 30s and 40s. The new work
suggests it also plays a role in the more common, noninherited
variety.
</P>
<P>
   Working independently, a team at Harvard Medical School has also
identified presenilin 1 as the enzyme. They will report their
findings in the July issue of the journal Nature Cell Biology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Selkoe, a neurobiologist on the Harvard team, said
the finding still must be confirmed. But it provides drug companies
a potential target to create drugs that block the action of the
enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just pie-in-the-sky,'' Selkoe said. ''There is a
palpable sense that knowing what gamma secretase is, we should be
able to inhibit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is the latest development in Alzheimer's research.
Last year, scientists reported finding a vaccine that hinders
development of brain deposits in mice and the discovery of
beta-secretase, the enzyme that makes the other cut involved in the
formation of deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Alzheimer's is still not known, and effective drugs
for humans are still a long way off, said Steve Gardell, director
of biological chemistry for Merck.
</P>
<P>
   ''The significance of the work we described in our paper is it
helps better define the target for possible therapeutic agents in
Alzheimer's disease,'' he said. ''We are in the early stages of
this drug development campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Sangram Sisodia, chairman of neurobiology at the University of
Chicago, said he is not convinced gamma secretase is presenilin 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''This last piece of information to be published provides
stronger data,'' he said of the Merck research. But he argued that
presenilin 1 might just be an accessory to gamma secretase.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Pleas in Task Force Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Two men have pleaded guilty to firing
into the command post coordinating the manhunt for accused serial
bomber Eric Robert Rudolph. A third pleaded guilty to lying to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet pierced the building's wall and brushed past the head
of an FBI agent. No one was injured in the incident on Nov. 11,
1998, at the headquarters for the Southeast Bomb Task Force in
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Carringer, 31, pleaded guilty Wednesday to two counts of
assault and using a firearm in a crime of violence. He faces up to
20 years in prison. Wayne Burchfield, 33, pleaded guilty June 1 to
one count of using a firearm in a crime of violence. He faces a
mandatory 10-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of attempting to kill a federal officer were dropped
against both men as part of a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   William Lidseen, 28, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of
making a false statement. He faces five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A motive for the shooting has not been disclosed. U.S. Attorney
spokeswoman Suellen Pierce said Wednesday that prosecutors could
not comment about the motive until the men are sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,
including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in a 1998 explosion that
killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that performs
abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Rudolph disappeared into the western North Carolina
wilderness. A $1 million reward has been offered for information
leading to his arrest. The command post has since been vacated,
although the search continues.

<HEADLINE> Vatican OKs US Catholic School Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vatican has approved controversial new rules asserting
tighter control over who may teach theology at America's 235 Roman
Catholic colleges and universities, U.S. bishops announced.
</P>
<P>
   One rule will require a university theologian to obtain a
''mandate'' from the local bishop in order to teach. This could
give bishops, and ultimately the pope, leverage to stem open
dissent against church policy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has the world's largest Catholic higher
education network, enrolling 701,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, passed by the bishops last November over the
objections of college administrators, received only minor
amendments in Rome and will go into effect on May 3, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations say that a college's president should be a
Catholic who professes fidelity to the faith, and that ''to the
extent possible'' a majority of trustees and faculty members should
be Catholics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policy have warned that the rules endanger
academic freedom, the schools' prestige and government funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza of Houston and Galveston, Texas,
president of the U.S. hierarchy, said he will appoint a committee
representing bishops and academic organizations to work out how to
put the rules into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure that that process is very workable and is
agreeable to both groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules say that a bishop has the right not only to grant or
deny a ''mandate'' to a theological but to withdraw it later.
</P>
<P>
   The document says that a theologian should have a ''commitment
and responsibility to teach authentic Catholic doctrine and to
refrain from putting forth as Catholic teaching anything contrary''
to it.

<HEADLINE> Fires, Vandalism Mark School's End  </HEADLINE>
By HUNTER T. GEORGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUYALLUP, Wash. (AP) -- As the school year winds down, innocuous
senior pranks -- toilet paper strewn across the school yard, boxer
shorts flying from the flag pole -- are being outdone by a more
destructive brand of mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Schools across the country have been struck by vandalism this
year and experts say the incidents are growing more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   The worst incidents involved fires that caused a combined $10
million in damage at two schools. Other pranks have ranged from
spray-painting school property in North Carolina to racial slurs
and hanging a dead cat from a bell tower in California.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, experts note that school vandalism has been declining
for years. But they are concerned that the senior pranks --
considered rites of passage for thousands of teen-agers -- have
intensified well beyond reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each year, it escalates. Someone wants to top someone else,''
said Michael Carr, spokesman for the Reston, Va.-based National
Association of Secondary School Principals.
</P>
<P>
   The pranks come at a time of heightened sensitivity to threats
and increased security following a spate of school shootings,
including last year's rampage at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., where two teen-age gunmen killed 12 students and
a teacher before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In Puyallup, a town of 31,000 just outside Seattle, classes at
Ballou Junior High School were canceled Monday and Tuesday after a
weekend fire destroyed a 25,000-square-foot building. Damage was
estimated at $3.5 million, and authorities said they were pursuing
leads about suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In Eleanor, W.Va., three youths are charged with setting a fire
at George Washington Middle School last month, causing an estimated
$6.5 million in damage to the building. Classes were canceled for
2{ days.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Wauwatosa, Wis., are looking for whoever tossed three
fire bombs through windows at West High School early Monday,
damaging an assistant principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   At a high school in Asheville, N.C., officials on May 30 found
bleach poured on an athletic field, obscenities painted on the
parking lot, the scoreboard defaced and locks jammed with glue and
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Five seniors were issued citations for vandalism, but none were
suspended and all were allowed to participate in commencement
ceremonies Monday. The local chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People charged that school officials
were lenient because some students were children of prominent
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sixteen seniors at a Palm Springs, Calif., high school were
suspended and barred from graduation for allegedly scrawling racial
slurs on the building and stringing up a dead cat on Monday. Animal
feces and ketchup were thrown at the building and gasoline was
poured on the lawn. The principal called it ''a senior prank that
went awry.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Two 16-year-olds were charged with stealing two cars and
vandalizing two schools near Ticonderoga, N.Y., doing $50,000 worth
of damage and closing one school for a day. They used a crowbar and
hammer to smash into several classrooms, offices and the cafeteria
and destroy equipment, police said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Authorities say 12 high school students in Perry, Iowa, may
have played a part in a stunt just before Memorial Day in which hog
manure and the carcasses of deer, hogs, rabbits and chickens were
left on the school lawn.
</P>
<P>
   -- Students were turned away from Skyview High School in
Vancouver, Wash., on Tuesday after a threat of violence was left on
a computer printer at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dwyer, who teaches workshops for the Bethesda, Md.-based
National Association of School Psychologists, said troubled youths
see violence on the news and in the movies and figure its an
acceptable way to take out their aggressions.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions include responsible reporting by media and better
outreach and support to students who are angry or hurt or feel
rejected in some way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, of the principal's group, said part of the reason for the
escalating destruction is that youths want the notoriety of seeing
their work on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, you called them senior pranks, but I don't call
these things senior pranks,'' he said. ''These are individual
students getting out of control.''

<HEADLINE> Rich Lag in Mailing Census Forms  </HEADLINE>
By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Laura Rostvold won't name the famous
people who didn't mail in their census forms. As a census-taker,
she is sworn to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   But ''I recognized the name of a former professional baseball
player, and there are some celebrities,'' says Rostvold, who goes
door-to-door in wealthy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is making its biggest effort yet to encourage
homeless people, minorities and the poor to mail back the form for
the nation's once-a-decade count. But in other neighborhoods --
namely rich ones -- the bureau may have mistakenly relied too
heavily on people's sense of civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, census-takers are finding they can't even
get to the doors of many residents in gated communities and
condominium complexes where people pay dearly for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The owners of gated communities have been reluctant to
participate,'' said Frank Newton, a census official in Dallas.
''They feel like we're intruding on their property, and we are
trying to inform them that they are required by law to give us
access.''
</P>
<P>
   The government can impose fines of up to $500 if census-takers
are barred from entering a property.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the Habitat Co., which manages about two dozen
buildings and 12,000 apartments, requires that a census worker be
escorted by a custodian or building security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to cooperate with them, but people do have a
right to privacy,'' said James Watts, executive vice president.
''We're not digging out personal information from our files about
residents, and we are not letting (census workers) walk freely
around the building.''
</P>
<P>
   One gated community in Laguna Beach consulted lawyers before
letting census-takers onto the property.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. communities with affluent populations missed their
target rate for mailing in forms by double digits.
</P>
<P>
   In Malibu, the target rate was 70 percent; only 54 percent of
the households mailed in their forms. Palo Alto, home to Stanford
University, missed its target by 10 percentage points. At the same
time, Compton, a blighted city in Los Angeles County, exceeded its
target by 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Other wealthy communities with low return rates include
Greenwich Township outside of Philadelphia, which missed its target
by 11 points. New York's Roslyn village on Long Island missed by 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't that interesting? I think that says a lot,'' said
Jacquelyn Flaherty, a census spokeswoman in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 65 percent of Census 2000 questionnaires were mailed
back, a rate equal to the last census in 1990. In California, the
overall rate this year was 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Malibu resident Valerie Gable speculated as to why her fellow
citizens didn't mail in their forms: They feel their privacy is
invaded, don't feel the count affects them, or want to distance
themselves from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gable had a much simpler explanation for not sending in her long
form: She is in the middle of a yearlong home remodeling. ''I lost
it,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials did not count on having to aim publicity
campaigns at the rich because they are usually better educated and
are expected to understand the purpose of the count.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an assumption that (because) their return rates have
always been good, they were going to be good,'' said Karin Mac
Donald, program director of the Statewide Database for California
at the University of California at Berkeley, which collects and
analyzes data used in redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Though census figures are primarily used for drawing
congressional district lines, they are also used to determine
federal funding for such things as transportation, education,
health care and disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   The lower return rates may also be a result of a climate more
suspicious of government. Republican leaders complained that the
53-question long form was intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that some of the well-heeled may see no
direct benefit in answering.
</P>
<P>
   Said Martha Riche, director of the Census Bureau from 1994 to
1998: ''I don't imagine they are looking forward to getting any aid
from the government.''

<HEADLINE> Angels 10, Giants 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Darin Erstad hit a pair of two-run homers
and singled in the go-ahead run in the eighth inning Wednesday
night to lead the Anaheim Angels over the San Francisco Giants
10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad broke a 4-all tie in the fifth with a two-run homer off
Russ Ortiz, then connected for another two-run shot that capped a
three-run sixth and put the Angels ahead 9-4. It was his first
multihomer game this season, the third of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield allowed seven hits and four walks in six
innings, leaving with a 9-4 lead. Jeff Kent and Armando Rios hit
two-run homers in the seventh off Al Levine. Kent's homer was his
17th.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow's second RBI single tied it against Shigetoshi
Hasegawa (5-1) in the eighth. Snow has 57 RBIs in interleague play,
the most in the majors. Ken Griffey Jr. is next with 48.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Molina and Edgard Clemente then singled in the bottom half
off Alan Embree (0-2), setting up Erstad's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who has one win in his last eight starts, was pounded for
eight runs and nine hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim went ahead 4-0 in the first on Mo Vaughn's RBI single
and Troy Glaus' 17th homer, a three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco tied it in the third on Rich Aurilia's two-run
homer, Jeff Kent's sacrifice fly and Snow's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ortiz has allowed 17 homers, including two or more in seven
of 12 starts. ... Top Anaheim reserve Orlando Palmeiro went 2-for-2
in a rare start and has hit in 13 of his 14 starts (.354). ... Both
of Erstad's homers were caught by the same fan in the center-field
pavilion, Tony Montes. Erstad has had six consecutive multihit
games, going 15-for-29.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Reign on The Line  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The legacy of the Dallas Stars could be decided in
Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   A loss tonight at the Meadowlands would turn over ownership of
the trophy to the New Jersey Devils, ending Dallas' reign at one
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Stars can argue they're not one-time wonders
because they at least made it back to the championship round, many
will still view them that way -- especially if they go limping home
with only one win in the series.
</P>
<P>
   But should Dallas bring the series back to Reunion Arena, things
could get interesting. Even if the Stars don't ultimately win,
they'll at least have proven themselves unwilling to give up their
perch without a strong fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, talk is real cheap,'' center Mike Modano said.
''It's what you put on the ice, who comes ready to play. Guys will
be measured by how we do from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is the 26th team to fall behind 3-1 in the finals since
the NHL adopted a best-of-seven format in 1939. The '42 Toronto
Maple Leafs are the only ones to overcome that deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at it as three games, it's really daunting,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ''But we won three games about 12
times this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's daunting is that you have to win one game. Our whole
focus is on bringing it back to Dallas, building some momentum,
then let's see where it goes. The really bizarre stuff starts when
you play a sixth game.''
</P>
<P>
   The team was pretty loose at practice Wednesday. The players
were so relaxed that they even worked on the old pie-in-the-face
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a strawberry cake, and the reason was Modano's
30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prank, orchestrated by class clown Mike Keane, a
three-time Cup winner, indicates the Stars weren't too uptight on
the eve of what could be the end of their stay at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of had a feeling something was going on,'' Modano said
later, the white icing and red filling cleaned from his face and
hair. ''We don't usually pull together and talk among ourselves
during practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had just its third full practice in nearly six weeks
Wednesday morning before boarding a plane.
</P>
<P>
   The workout was almost over when all the players gathered near
center ice. With Modano on the outside of the group, Keane skated
to the bench to get the cake, then sneaked up behind Modano and
smacked him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anything about it,'' Brett Hull said. ''I guess
they don't think I can keep a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has been talking about his leadership group stepping
up on and off the ice. While the tension-breaking gag might fit
into that category, he was more pleased with what he saw them do
with the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good detail today,'' he said. ''That's a good
sign.''

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Tower Sparks Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDY, Ore. (AP) -- A 21st century version of an Old West range
war has arrived at the doorstep of George and Kathy Culp. Instead
of cattle and sheep, the dispute centers on the couple's decision
to let a cell phone company put a 250-foot tower on their raspberry
farm.
</P>
<P>
   It's turned serious: Someone fired four bullets into their ranch
house last month, with one of the slugs barely missing a sleeping
teen-ager. A fifth bullet pierced their sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Left on the windshield was a note that read: ''Your lives are in
danger unless the cell tower is stopped.'' It was signed ''an agent
of Coalman Road Neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over where to place cell phone towers have been going
on for years, but experts say this is the first time it's turned
violent.
</P>
<P>
   The Culps have added floodlights outside their house and now
send out their guard dog to patrol the property. They also are
sleeping in parts of the house with more protection from gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not really sleeping very much at all. We feel so
vulnerable -- it's like we're out in the open here,'' Culp said
Tuesday. ''We lock the doors at night and are just hoping that if
they come back we get a look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clackamas County Sheriff's Department said it has no
suspects in the May 30 shooting, which injured no one.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Culps' neighbors don't want the tower, which has not
been built. They say it would be an eyesore in this rolling scenic
countryside near Mount Hood, something that could lower their
property values.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   In New York's Adirondacks, environmentalists worry about the
towers spoiling the picturesque scenery and have suggested they be
designed to look like pine trees. The Ohio Supreme Court got
dragged into a dispute in that state about townships, zoning
districts and towers. And 100 miles southeast of Sandy, meetings
have turned highly emotional over some proposed towers that would
block homeowners' views of the Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   As cellular companies look to fill gaps in service between
cities, it is often scenic places like the Coalman Neighborhood in
rural Oregon that are being targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The case in Sandy, however, is the first time Jeffrey Nelson of
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association can remember a
disagreement turning violent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never heard of something like this,'' he said. ''We're
obviously sad for the family, but very happy nobody has been
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he believes disputes over towers have actually
calmed down in recent years as courts and regulatory bodies have
helped clarify what kind of control local governments have over
tower placement.
</P>
<P>
   The Culps said they knew many of their neighbors disagreed with
their decision to sign a 30-year lease with American Tower Corp.,
but they did receive approval from the county's land use hearings
officer.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Judy Todd, said an attorney told them they would
be wasting their money if they tried to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about scenery and property values, some
residents worry about potential health hazards from the microwave
radiation transmitted by towers.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they just wanted the tower moved farther away from a
subdivision -- and the nearest home, 200 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's right on top of them,'' said Janet Wilson. ''This is a
residential neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Culps said neighbors have stopped waving to them, while
others just turn their backs. Many residents also showed up at
various public meetings to voice their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like the neighbors got their say,'' Culp said. ''I

<HEADLINE> Olympic Flame Lands Down Under  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULURU, Australia (AP) -- Barefoot and smiling, Nova
Peris-Kneebone held the Olympic torch high over the rich red soil
of central Australia, shrugging off a couple of failed attempts to
ignite it.
</P>
<P>
   When the symbol of the Olympics was lit, she started to run
toward Uluru -- the giant glowing rock in the background -- to
commence the final countdown to the 2000 Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Peris-Kneebone, the first Australian Aborigine to win an Olympic
gold medal, today became the first torchbearer of a 16,740-mile,
100-day relay to Stadium Australia for the Sept. 15 opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Almost seven years after Sydney became the winning bidder for
the 2000 Olympics, the Olympic flame was welcomed by members of the
Uluru family, among the traditional owners of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Kunmanara Uluru accepted the torch from Australia's
Governor-General, Sir William Deane, and passed it to eight other
members of his family before it was handed to Peris-Kneebone, who
ran without shoes as a sign of respect for the traditional owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all very happy the firestick has come to my father's
place and we welcome you to our country,'' Kunmanara Uluru said.
</P>
<P>
   After a stuttering start to the ceremony, a strong breeze
whipping over the flat, arid landscape snuffed out the flame as
Deane was attempting to ignite it. It happened again when
Peris-Kneebone took possession. The torch was lit by a backup flame
carried from Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Knight, the Olympics minister and president of Sydney's
Olympic organizing committee, breathed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally,'' he said. ''The flame is in Australia, now we're
totally responsible'' for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The flame, initially ignited in a traditional ceremony at
ancient Olympia, Greece, on May 10, traveled through 12 Oceanic
nations and last touched down in New Zealand en route to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   After the flame arrived at an airport, Peris-Kneebone, followed
by a convoy of support vehicles and joined by Jessica, her
9-year-old daughter, ran the first leg of about 1 mile to Uluru.
</P>
<P>
   She handed the torch to the local Anangu, the indigenous people
of the region, who completed a 5.9-mile lap around the base of
Uluru before the relay continued north to Alice Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other aboriginal torchbearers will be two-time
Wimbledon champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11,000 Australians will carry the torch along a route
that takes it within a one-hour drive of about 80 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the opening ceremony, the torch will be submerged
with a scuba diver for about three minutes on the Great Barrier
Reef, off the Queensland coast in eastern Australia.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the country, in remote Western
Australia, the torch will be carried on camelback.
</P>
<P>
   Peris-Kneebone won gold in Atlanta as a member of the Australian
women's field hockey team before switching to track and field and
becoming a world-ranked sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get so many opportunities in sport, but this is a once in
a lifetime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was of huge significance for black and white
Australians that the torch landed ''in the belly of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Uluru ''is the heart of Australia, it's extremely important in
terms of aboriginal Australia ... for all Australians.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Skyrocket in Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA McCORD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Motorists everywhere are paying more for
gasoline, but prices at some Midwestern pumps have skyrocketed to
more than $2 per gallon because of a federally mandated fuel
designed to clean up the air.
</P>
<P>
   A new version of the cleaner gas means that motorists in the
Chicago and Milwaukee areas are shelling out 30 to 50 cents more
per gallon, with premium going for as much as $2.23 a gallon in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you come and fill up and it's $30 to $40, it's kind of a
shock,'' said Les Whalen of Elgin, Ill. ''You just wonder where
it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the average price of regular unleaded is $1.56, the
American Automobile Association said. Experts say prices are up
because of the high cost of crude oil and demand for gasoline at
the start of summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago, Milwaukee and 15 other metropolitan areas have some
of the worst air pollution in the nation and have been required
since 1995 to use a cleaner burning fuel, called reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered
retailers to start selling a new breed of reformulated gas --
designed to further preserve air quality -- by June 1, though most
service stations began offering the fuel in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the new gasoline was being implemented, the demand for
gasoline was very high,'' said Michael Bie of AAA Wisconsin. ''That
put a squeeze on prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts thought the new gas would cost no more than 10 cents
per gallon more than conventional gasoline. While that seems to be
the case in the other 15 regions, average gas prices in the metro
Milwaukee and Chicago areas have jumped.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices could be a result of the kind of reformulated
gas many Milwaukee and Chicago gas stations use -- a version blended
with ethanol, a corn derivative, said Erin Roth, executive director
of the Wisconsin Petroleum Council.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas use another kind of reformulated fuel which, while
in greater supply and cheaper, is thought to contaminate water.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for relief from high gas costs, legislators and industry
representatives in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas asked the EPA to
waive the fuel requirement. The EPA denied the requests, and
Wisconsin lawmakers are considering suing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois legislators so far aren't fighting the EPA, but some
lawmakers there say they will try to repeal the state's 5 percent
sales tax on gas to try to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya McCullum of Milwaukee said she decided to hitch a ride
with her mother each day to lessen her gasoline bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's expensive. I'm paying almost $2 a gallon,'' McCullum said
as she waited for her ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Goldberg, pregnant with her first child, leaves her home
in Kenosha, Wis., only for doctors' appointments. She said it costs
her $20 to fill up her car.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not for a doctor's appointment, I'm not leaving,'' she
said. ''It's just too much.''

<HEADLINE> Mourners Head to Obuchi Funeral  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The summit between North and South Korea.
U.S.-Japan telecommunications trade. Troubled relations between
Indonesia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures from around the world gathered Thursday at
the funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. But
behind the scenes was a buzz of diplomatic talk.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has lined up 15 meetings this week,
including talks with President Clinton, South Korean leader Kim
Dae-jung and Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who will be in town for less than nine hours, will also
have a full day, including a meeting with Kim. At the top of the
agenda will be the June 12-14 summit between North and South Korea
in Pyongyang, the capital of reclusive North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials say a tough dispute on Japan's
telecommunications market could be discussed when Clinton and Mori
meet. Washington is demanding sharp cuts in connection rates in
Japan. The White House, however, played down the possibility of
anything substantial coming up during the talk, saying that the
trip's central purpose would be to honor Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the funeral service, there will be plenty of
other sessions among the more than 80 international diplomats --
including one between Wahid and Australian Prime Minister John
Howard, who will try to patch up relations strained since Australia
led a U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping force that quelled
pro-Indonesian violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service follows a private funeral for Obuchi held
two days after he died May 14. Obuchi was hospitalized for a stroke
on April 2 and was replaced days later by Mori.
</P>
<P>
   The service took place amid doubts about how his illness was
handled by the government, which kept Obuchi's hospitalization a
secret for nearly 24 hours, then kept the news of his lapsing into
a coma quiet for another 12 hours. His doctors never spoke to the
media until after he died.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral also comes as Obuchi's successor is gearing up for a
battle in lower house elections scheduled for June 25. Mori is
fighting off a series of scandals that have hit his government in
the past few weeks, including statements that have been criticized
as echoing militarist rhetoric used before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's government also denied reports this week that Tokyo had
refused a visa to Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian to attend the
service out of fear of annoying China. Officials said a delegation
from Taiwan would attend, but they would not be officially
representing Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono met Wednesday
with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko and discussed
the upcoming visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin in August.
</P>
<P>
   Khristenko told Kono that the visit will be a good chance to
discuss the still unsigned peace treaty between the two nations, a
Foreign Ministry official said. The treaty has been stalled due to
a territorial dispute over a group of Russian-controlled Kuril
Islands north of Japan.

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Offer Estate Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Normally a reliable opponent of Republican tax
cuts, Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana is among 46 House
Democrats backing a GOP bill to repeal inheritance taxes -- and
causing headaches for Democratic leaders who are trying to prevent
wholesale defections.
</P>
<P>
   For Jefferson and other black and Hispanic lawmakers, the estate
tax is not just a rich man's problem but is seen as a threat to
minority businesses now thriving in the booming economy. Democrats
from rural areas are concerned that estate taxes cause family farms
to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason people are so interested is that it's an
anti-wealth-building tax in a time when African-Americans and
Hispanics are trying to build wealth,'' said Jefferson, who is from
New Orleans but grew up poor in northeast Louisiana. ''For many of
them, it's their first time ever to be able to build wealth. There
is a wealth gap in this country that we have to care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled Friday to consider a bill to gradually
reduce estate taxes over 10 years at a cost of about $105 billion
out of the projected federal surplus. President Clinton is
threatening a veto, citing the estimated cost of $50 billion a year
after repeal is completed in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, with strong backing by business and farm lobbyists,
long have sought to repeal the tax, but in this election year
they're gaining more Democrats than ever before. Current law
exempts $675,000 of a person's estate from the tax; $1.3 million
for farms and small businesses. Even though only about 2 percent of
all people who die ever pay the tax -- most of them quite wealthy --
the stories told by farmers and small businesses about their tax
fears and the high costs of estate planning are politically
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm afraid it will be the demise of the company,'' said Frank
Armstrong of the National Fruit Product Co. of Winchester, Va.,
which makes applesauce and other products.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an outside chance that enough Democrats could
defect to gain the necessary two-thirds House vote to override a
Clinton veto, which would force Senate Democrats to reconsider any
delaying tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe the Senate can sustain a filibuster,'' said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ''Any Democrat that
wants to vote against the estate tax is certainly welcome to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the estate tax was included in last year's vetoed $792
billion tax cut, a measure Republicans have taken apart this year
in favor of moving individual tax bills that have maximum political
appeal. A slogan like ''Kill the Death Tax'' is easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more easily defined and it helps broaden the base of
support,'' Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said of the stand-alone
strategy. ''We believe these issues we've been moving are issues of
tax fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to ward off defections, two senior Democrats
outlined an estate tax alternative Wednesday that is less costly
than the Republican bill -- about $22 billion over 10 years -- and
targets tax relief more toward family farms and small businesses.
Two sponsors are Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, senior Democrat
on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Charles
Stenholm of Texas, top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee and a
leading fiscal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said that given Clinton's opposition, the main purpose of
the GOP bill is to ''send out political messages, us against
them,'' but he acknowledged the attraction for many Democrats to
the repeal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good concept,'' he said. ''It sounds like the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One national poll taken for Republicans indicated that 50
percent of registered voters said they would vote for a GOP
candidate who backed repealing the estate tax, compared with 38
percent favoring a Democrat who preferred to use the money for
priority spending and Social Security. The poll of 800 registered
voters, taken May 15-17, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangel and Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., are reminding their
colleagues that the Republican measure would take billions of
dollars away from spending on such priorities as education and a
Medicare prescription drug benefit, as well as any plan to ensure
the future solvency of Social Security. They say farmers and small
businesses can be helped without complete repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should be looking at this from a surgical point of view,''
Cardin said. ''A lot of people who think they would like to repeal
the estate tax should put it in the context of fiscal policy. We'll
have a huge hole in the federal treasury.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The repeal bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers Eye Weapons  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson
is not happy. The European allies have promised to upgrade their
military capabilities and increase defense spending. They're not
doing it. At least not fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   So when defense ministers of the 19 allied nations open a
two-day session today at NATO headquarters, Robertson plans to give
them what one senior diplomat called ''a kick in the pants'' to get
things moving.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was also expected to
deliver a blunt message, pressing the Europeans to move faster
toward goals agreed to a year ago aimed at closing the gap between
American and allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was clearly illustrated during the 78-day air campaign
against Yugoslavia last year when Americans were obliged to fly the
vast majority of combat, surveillance and refueling missions as
well as providing nearly all the intelligence and much of the
logistics. And this at a time when the Europeans say they want to
develop their a capacity for military action without the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also will brief the allies on President Clinton's meetings
with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, particularly on
nuclear issues and other military matters.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and the allies are also eager to speak with Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who will be here Friday for a
meeting of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. They are hoping
he can provide more details on Putin's proposal to work with NATO
and Europe to develop an anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow opposes an American plan to deploy a limited national
missile defense system in Alaska. That involves a small number of
interceptor missiles which Washington says it needs to meet the
threat of missile attack by ''rogue states,'' such as North Korea,
Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The final test of the system is scheduled for early next month
and Clinton is expected to decide whether to go ahead with the
project by autumn so work can begin by spring on the accompanying
radar system.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says the U.S. plan is a threat to European security
because it could be expanded to defeat a Russian missile attack,
making Russia's nuclear arsenal useless. The United States insists
that's not true, but Putin has warned Moscow will pull out of all
nuclear arms agreements if the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
is breached.
</P>
<P>
   Though little progress was made on the issue at the Moscow
summit, the Americans say Putin at least agreed that a threat
exists and hinted he could be flexible in making alterations to the
ABM treaty.

<HEADLINE> Beloved Congo Cathedral Shelled  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Mortar shells from Ugandan forces
smashed into this city's Roman Catholic cathedral on Wednesday,
setting wooden roof beams ablaze on the third straight day of
fighting between the once nominal African allies.
</P>
<P>
   As a church bell tolled, weeping residents lugged water from the
nearby Congo River to fight the fire at the twin-spired stone
cathedral during a U.N.-arranged halt in shelling between Rwandan
and Ugandan forces.
</P>
<P>
   People scooped up prayer books and church vestments and dragged
wooden benches outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''When are they going to leave? They are destroying
everything,'' a distraught woman wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Residents woke up Thursday to a fourth straight day of heavy
bombardment as shells rained down regardless of promises by both
sides to stop firing. Tracer bullets lit up the starry sky over
Kisangani, followed by piercing sounds of missiles that detonated
at random.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are firing in self-defense,'' said Col. Karenzi Karake, a
Rwandan commander.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda entered the Congo 22 months ago to support
rebel forces opposed to President Laurent Kabila, but themselves
fell out over which rebels groups to support, and the two fought
battles in August and May.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the forces of the two nations were preparing to pull
out of Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city, to leave it to U.N.
control, when they began fighting again in the steamy Congo port.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan and Ugandan forces traded heavy artillery fire across
the Congo River on Wednesday, as U.N. military observers tried
desperately to get them to respect a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Danilo Paiva of Uruguay, commander of the 21-man
unarmed observer team, got the shelling to stop long enough to
allow residents to fight the cathedral fire.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Liebeskind, the Red Cross delegate in Kisangani, said
an estimated 50 people, 19 of them children, had been killed and
100 more injured since fighting broke out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are far from political and military solutions any time
soon,'' Liebeskind said.
</P>
<P>
   The city was without power and water Wednesday as shells rained
down, and small arms fire crackled.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions at University Hospital, where most of the injured
were taken, were desperate. There was neither power, water, blood
plasma nor medicine, and many doctors had not been able to report
for work because of the shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Kisangani, the former Stanleyville, has been a major logistics
base for both armies.
</P>
<P>
   Paiva, of the U.N. group, said the Rwandans were firing from
positions across the Congo on the south bank, and Ugandans were
firing from positions near the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the city and stuck in the middle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, both sides agreed to pull back 60 miles, leaving about
200 men each at bases in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace accord signed last summer in Lusaka, Zambia, all
five foreign armies operating in Congo agreed to withdraw under the
supervision of 5,537-strong U.N. force. Troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia are backing Kabila, Congo's president.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no more than 100 unarmed U.N. military observers have
deployed.

<HEADLINE> Women Seek Role in Negotiations  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Women don't have a say in most wars. But
as the primary victims of war, they are demanding a right to sit by
the fighters in negotiating peace.
</P>
<P>
   Women should be included in all stages of peacemaking -- from the
peace talks to confidence-building measures to the re-establishment
of democracy, said participants at a panel Wednesday that was part
of this week's women's conference at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason why if ... those who make war are at the
peace table, that (women) who sustain peace are not at the peace
table. We have every right to be at the peace table,'' said Noeleen
Heyzer, executive director of the U.N. Development Fund for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening women's role in peace processes was one of the
goals set at the 1995 U.N. conference on women's equality in
Beijing, which is being reviewed by delegates of 188 countries and
thousands of activists gathered at U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children constitute the majority of war refugees and
have recently become strategic targets for warring factions in
several of the world's conflicts, panelists said. Recent research
has also shown that some women have actively supported violent
organizations and uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   Including women in settlements to end those wars is not only a
question of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women and men can experience conflicts differently'' and both
perspectives must be included in the peace-building process, said
Angela King, U.N. special adviser on gender issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most women in Sierra Leone were opposed to the
amnesty granted to Foday Sankoh and his rebels in the peace
agreement signed in Lome, Togo, last year, said Amy Smythe, former
minister of gender and children's affairs in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''One wonders whether the rape, sex slavery, mutilations,
amputations ... that women have suffered will all be swept under
the table,'' Smythe said. ''Amnesty cannot be a foregone
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front has killed tens of thousands
of civilians and intentionally mutilated thousands of others in
more than eight years of civil war. In early May, the rebels
reignited the war by attacking government and U.N. troops and
taking about 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage; the captives have since
been released and Sankoh imprisoned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala, the presence of women in the negotiations that put
an end in 1996 to 36 years of civil war was essential, said Luz
Mendes of the Guatemala's National Union for Women, who took part
in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes said women assured that the agreement included the right
of women to have access to land and resources, as well as health
and education. The government also agreed to review laws to
eradicate discrimination against women and penalize sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incorporation of women's issues in the Guatemala peace
accord is the result of the direct participation of women in the
peace process,'' Mendes said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign by the United Nations and grass-roots groups
appears to be working: On Tuesday, the U.N. Development Fund for
Women announced that it had been invited to take part in the next
round of negotiations to end Burundi's civil war.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 9, Diamondbacks 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs have not lost this season to the
NL East-leading Atlanta Braves and NL West-leading Arizona
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the AL Central-leading Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The crosstown rivals open a three-game series Friday, and the
Cubs, who completed their sweep of the Diamondbacks on Wednesday
with a 9-4 win, can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love playing the Sox,'' Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said.
''The whole city shuts down for three hours. There's a lot of
energy on the South Side. It's great for the city of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a big fan of interleague play, but I am a big fan of
the Cubs-Sox games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs hope the games are the focus, and not an off-field feud
between Sammy Sosa and manager Don Baylor. Sosa, who had a solo
homer in Wednesday's game, feels Baylor criticized him unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young also hit a solo homer as the Cubs handed Brian
Anderson his first loss in 19 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill, Damon Buford and Grace each added two RBIs for
the Cubs, whose three-game sweep was their first against the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona dropped its fifth straight, its longest losing streak
since losing eight straight from May 5-13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in a mini-slump right now,'' Baylor said. ''They'll
get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (5-1) gave up nine runs on 10 hits and four walks over
5 2-3 innings for his first defeat since a 7-5 loss to Seattle on
July 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel too bad out there,'' Anderson said. ''After the
third inning, I was just trying to eat up innings and save our our
bullpen. By then, we knew it was out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserved much better,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Downs (3-1) won his second consecutive start, giving up
three runs -- two earned -- six hits, one walk and three strikeouts
over six innings. Todd Van Poppel pitched the final three innings
for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confidence is big,'' Downs said when asked about his
turnaround. ''I don't think it's physical. It's confidence, getting
things to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Young hit his fifth home run leading off the sixth to give the
Cubs an 8-3 lead. Sosa followed two batters later with his 18th, a
towering shot into the bleachers in straightaway center, chasing
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was estimated at 520 feet. Hill hit one that landed on
a rooftop across Waveland Avenue with a conservative guess of 490
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Glenallen is going to dispute the distance,'' Baylor
said. ''One leaves the ballpark and lands on the roof, and the
other stays in the ballpark and is longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also committed a fielding error in the seventh that led to
another Diamondbacks run. It was the right fielder's third error in
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and Baylor planned to meet to discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll talk like men, not like children,'' Baylor said. ''This
is not something I want in my clubhouse at all.''
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the third, Tony Womack scored from second on
Young's fielding error to give Arizona a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs sent 11 batters to the plate in a six-run third. With
two outs and runners at first and second, Grace hit an RBI double.
Sosa was intentionally walked and Hill hit a broken-bat single to
drive in two runs, giving the Cubs a 3-1 lead. Buford doubled to
right, scoring Sosa and Hill, and Buford scored on Willie Greene's
double to make it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit his 14th homer leading off the sixth. Matt Williams
and Steve Finley each singled, and Williams scored when Greg
Colbrunn grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Randy Johnson will start Friday for Arizona after missing
one start because of tenderness in his left shoulder. ... Anderson
had faced 117 consecutive batters without issuing a walk until
Grace drew one in the first inning Wednesday. ... This was the
Cubs' second sweep. They also took three games against Atlanta from
April 10-13.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Flock To Hong Kong Nunnery  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET WONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- After going through a total refurbishment,
local Buddhist nuns know their historic quarters can withstand
typhoons. They're far less certain about how to deal with an influx
of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Chi Lin Nunnery has long been an oasis of tranquility in
bustling Hong Kong. Nestled against a lush woodland at the foot of
Diamond Hill, it was founded in the 1930s to provide religious and
social services and a place for quiet meditation.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the rebuilt nunnery has been listed as a heritage
site by the Hong Kong Tourist Association, sightseers are showing
up by the thousands. The complex is designed to last for 500 years,
but its 60 residents worry that crowds of tourists could threaten
their monastic existence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nunnery has been always open to the public,'' said
spokeswoman Elaine Wan -- but only for worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the experience dealing with large amount of
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chi Lin opened to the public on May 20 -- attracting 13,000
visitors. The next day, 23,000 people arrived to see the
refurbished showcase for traditional Chinese architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is arranged with three entrances, a design dating to
the Tang Dynasty of 618 to 907 -- a time when Buddhism flourished in
China and ancient arts and crafts were at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year redevelopment, costing nearly $90 million, was
complicated and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Timber construction experts assembled wooden pieces in columns
and 400,000 Tang Dynasty-style tiles were imported from Japan to
create a roof builders say can withstand the ravages of Hong Kong's
tropical storms and typhoons.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it can survive the tourists is another matter. The
nunnery is also home to delicately crafted bronze lights -- which
the nuns say are getting smudged by so much hands-on attention.
</P>
<P>
   Two stone lights have been found damaged, with their roof-shaped
tops falling onto the ground -- although Wan said they might have
been broken during the official opening, which had makeshift
ceremonial platforms built next to the fragile pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards say most of the problems come from children and
teen-agers who have trouble telling the difference between the
nunnery and a playground or amusement park. Some youngsters have
used coins to scratch the wooden columns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We often have to stop children climbing over the balustrades
or throwing litter into the lotus ponds,'' said Leung Wai Chun, one
of 10 security officers at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns have voiced their concerns to the government, but
officials say it's up to the nuns to combat vandalism and theft.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the government can do is to appeal to the members of the
public to be careful and not to damage anything in the nunnery,''
said Varren Lee, a spokesman for Hong Kong's Home Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But it may take time and effort to educate the public on
treasuring the cultural legacies within, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to understand the nunnery is not a place for
entertainment but a three-dimensional piece of art for
appreciation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their bewilderment at the crowds, the nuns acknowledge
they aren't completely adverse to publicity and the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   They are selling video compact disks ''introducing the nunnery's
architecture to the public,'' for about $6.50 each to raise money
for maintenance and repairs, Wan said -- such as repairing the
broken stone lights.
</P>
<P>
   One recent visitor said the nunnery deserved more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see the difference between visiting here and other tourist
attractions,'' said Yip Oi Wah, 47, a Chinese businesswoman from
Jakarta, Indonesia. ''It's so calm and peaceful here.''

<HEADLINE> N. Myanmar Shaken by Earthquake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- A strong earthquake struck northern
Myanmar early today. The main town nearest the epicenter reported
no major damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The quake occurred at 4:17 a.m., with the epicenter 95 miles
north of Myitkyina, a remote town near the northern tip of Myanmar,
the Southeast Asian country also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   An official from Myanmar's meteorology department in Yangon said
the quake had a magnitude of 6.6. The Northern Meteorological
Center in Chiang Mai, Thailand -- 550 miles southeast of the
epicenter -- measured it at 6.35.
</P>
<P>
   Quakes of that strength can cause severe damage if they hit
heavily populated areas. The area where the quake hit, however, is
little-developed and thinly populated.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Gather for Obuchi Funeral  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Thousands of mourners gathered today to honor the
late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, praising him for his dedication
to his country and his efforts to pull Japan out of its lengthy
economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   The service for Obuchi, who died May 14 after suffering a
stroke, also provided a venue for a barrage of diplomatic meetings
between visiting dignitaries, including President Clinton, who
arrived this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, a friend of Obuchi since they
attended the prestigious Waseda University, said the late premier
spared no efforts to rejuvenate Japan's weakened economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one was more concerned with the current condition and the
future of our nation as we approached the tumultuous turn of the
century,'' Mori told mourners. ''Midway on the path to his goal, he
departed without witnessing the fruits of his own labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, Obuchi has been praised as a popular leader who
pushed through a series of spending programs and a massive bank
bailout to pull the economy out of a decade-long slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Obuchi's policies have been mixed. While the
economy is slowly improving, the progress has been uneven and it is
not yet clear when Japan will emerge conclusively from its economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the funeral service, Obuchi's son and wife
carried a large urn filled with his ashes into the central Tokyo
assembly hall, where mourners faced a stage displaying a
black-ribboned portrait of the former premier and Japan's rising
sun flag.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also showed a video presentation showing the
highlights of Obuchi's life.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering took place amid political turmoil that began when
Obuchi was suddenly hospitalized April 2, fell into a coma and was
replaced by Mori as premier three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's popularity has rapidly declined through a series of
scandals, including persistent anger about how the government
withheld details of Obuchi's illness from the public. Mori faces
lower house elections June 25, which would have been Obuchi's 63rd
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   While today's service was aimed at honoring Obuchi, the backdrop
was pure diplomacy. Representatives from more than 80 countries,
territories and international organizations were expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-profile talks were centering around Clinton, one of
only a handful of heads of state to attend. His stay, however, was
to be brief: He arrived on Air Force One after 11 a.m. and was to
leave less than 10 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mori spoke before the funeral. They discussed
bilateral relations and the upcoming summit between North and South
Korea. The U.S. leader said it was important for Pyongyang to
normalize ties with Seoul and other nations, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said. Clinton was planning to meet with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung after the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Mori also met with Kim, praising his policy of openness toward
North Korea and for arranging the North-South summit, Japanese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese leaders were trying to make the most of the
opportunity. Mori had lined up at least 15 meetings for this week,
and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had at least 16 others.
</P>
<P>
   In talks early today, Philippines President Joseph Estrada urged
Mori to keep the concerns of Asia in mind when meeting the leaders
of other wealthy nations at the G-8 summit in Okinawa in July, the
Japanese Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid thanked Japan for aid in
dealing with the recent earthquake in Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   And Australian Prime Minister John Howard told Mori he expects a
strong message on behalf of free trade to some out of the G-8
meeting, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Wahid and Howard were to try to patch up
relations between their countries. Ties have been strained since
Australia led a U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping force that quelled
pro-Indonesian violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before today's funeral service, mourners -- relatives,
friends, politicians and businessmen -- had been gathering at the
hall. The uninvited thronged outside, waiting for a chance to sign
a book of condolences afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sumi Ohashi, who was waiting to sign the book, said she ran into
Obuchi by chance three years ago -- before he became premier -- while
on vacation in southern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was extremely friendly and a sincere person,'' she said,
holding a photograph of him. ''I prayed for his recovery, but now I
feel very sad.''

<HEADLINE> British Diplomat Shot by Gunmen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A British diplomat was shot and seriously
injured as he drove to work today.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believed the diplomat was Britain's military
attache to Greece. He was shot in the face and in the chest and was
in surgery at the city's Red Cross hospital. His condition was
listed as critical.
</P>
<P>
   Two men on a motorcycle fired at the car on a main avenue
leading from the capital's northern suburbs into the center of the
city, police said. The gunmen fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a British embassy employee,'' Public Order Ministry
General Secretary Dimitris Efstathiadis confirmed it was a British
embassy employee and told local Alpha television it was apparently
the work of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Similar attacks have been carried out by a shadowy domestic
terrorist organization called November 17, whose 22 victims since
1975 include four American officials, among them the CIA station
chief in Athens.

<HEADLINE> Home Schooler A Spelling Success  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When other kids were reading Dr. Seuss or
Winnie the Pooh, George Thampy was curled up with Noah Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could sit with the dictionary for hours and hours, and
still enjoy life,'' said his mother, Bina Thampy, laughing. ''I've
never heard him in all these years say 'I'm tired,' 'I'm fed up,'
'Mommy, another day.'''
</P>
<P>
   George started with the dictionary at age 6 and kept on reading
it because ''I just really want to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off last week when the 12-year-old from Maryland
Heights, Mo., won the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee by
correctly spelling ''demarche'' -- a step or maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   According to George's parents, the key to his victory wasn't the
time he spent with the dictionary or the hours of preparation. It
was the hours he spent as a home-schooled student.
</P>
<P>
   ''We teach these children the art of studying,'' said K. George
Thampy, George's father. ''If I give him a new thing today, I'm
confident he'll become a master of it in a very short period of
time with very little help.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, George's second-place performance in the
National Geographic Bee a week before the spelling bee. He began
preparing just four months before the finals.
</P>
<P>
   George's successes, along with those of other home-schooled
students in such high-profile and high-pressure events, are
bringing attention to the home-schooling movement. The top three
finishers at this year's spelling bee were home-schooled, as were
four of the 10 finalists in the geography bee, the most ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Events like those of the last week have really helped drive
home a strong message that people need not worry about our academic
quality,'' said Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal
Defense Association in Purcellville, Va. ''We're going to do just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Home Education Research Institute estimates the
number of home-schooled children somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7
million, a number that's growing by at least 7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Thampys became part of those statistics while living in an
area of Houston where public schools had installed metal detectors.
That wasn't the kind of school environment the two immigrants from
India had pictured for their children.
</P>
<P>
   They made the decision to home-school six of their seven
children. Mrs. Thampy does most of the teaching, working during the
day on languages, economics, social sciences. Thampy, a fellow in
endocrinology at Washington University, works with his kids on math
and science at night.
</P>
<P>
   George's brother Eapen was a national finalist in the geography
bee in 1997 and 1998, and sister Mallika finished sixth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we can provide an all around education, an all
around development of the child,'' Thampy said.
</P>
<P>
   Farris cites a study that found home-schooled students scored
higher than public and private school students on two widely used
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just a few kids that really excel, but that the
average home school kid is a top student also,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   There are critics. The National Education Association, the
nation's largest teachers' union, doesn't believe home-schooling
can provide students with a comprehensive education.
</P>
<P>
   But NEA spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons admits there are obvious
advantages to home-schooling. ''What a great class size,'' she
said. ''Every teacher in America would like that.''
</P>
<P>
   George's education stresses the three Rs, as well as public
speaking, personal hygiene and health. He takes field trips with
other home-schooled students to museums, farms and his dad's
endocrinology lab at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he learns in a group with his siblings, but often he
is taught individually and frequently he does in-depth research on
subjects via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no trouble relating to kids who go to conventional
schools. They don't think I'm strange because I'm home-schooled,
especially since we study the same subjects, only in a different
way,'' George wrote in a letter published Wednesday in The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   His parents caution that it's not as easy as it might sound. The
couple put in long hours into teaching their children -- as well as
forging an extremely close, personal relationship with each of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle is the time,'' Thampy said. ''It is extremely
expensive in the aspect of time. You never can do all the things
you want for the children. Your work gets behind.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Raid Documents To Be Supoenaed  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee is considering subpoenaing
Attorney General Janet Reno for e-mails and other documents
relating to the federal raid on Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives to
determine whether congressional hearings are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want everything so if hearings aren't justified, we won't
hold them,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. ''If they are, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled committee meets today. If the
subpoenas are approved, they would go out immediately, Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the committee's ranking Democrat,
said a subpoena would be just a ploy to explain why there haven't
been any hearings on the controversy over the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ''would much rather talk about hearings than hold
hearings,'' Leahy said, noting that the Justice Department already
has turned over ''huge number of things that haven't even been read
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Justice Department was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service agents stormed the home
of Elian's Miami relatives on April 22 and delivered the boy to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Washington. On June 1, the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the INS acted within reason
when it denied an asylum request the Miami relatives made on
Elian's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Elian and his playmates spent much of the
afternoon at the National Zoo, stopping by at the reptile house and
making animal noises as they went.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, federal agents accompanied the group, which included
Elian's father, cousin, playmates from Cuba and the playmates'
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But sending in armed federal officers to retrieve a child,
''that's not America,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people in our society who are very concerned
with the way that house was assaulted: in the middle of the night
in full combat gear, automatic or semiautomatic weapons drawn, the
home trashed without any real mention in the court document that
they were concerned about violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Hatch says he plans to hold hearings ''unless the
administration can show ... that there's no reason.'' But ''it's
pretty hard to hold them without the documents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If hearings are held, Leahy said, they probably will focus on
generic questions of how much authority the INS has.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Hatch is delighted to send out subpoenas. He's
delighted to send letters. He's delighted to send staff members,''
he said. ''The only thing he doesn't want to do is hold full-scale
Elian hearings ... because the American people know what we know,
that the child belongs with his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department asked U.S. District Judge
Henry H. Kennedy Jr. in Washington to dismiss another lawsuit
brought by Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to prevent Elian
from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government asked Kennedy to dismiss the case because the
11th Circuit had decided the issues when it upheld the INS'
decision to let Elian's father have custody and decide the boy's
future.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Ban Common Pesticide  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing health risks to children, the
Environmental Protection Agency is announcing today a ban on one of
the most common pesticides for use in gardens and homes, while
curtailing its application in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, after a lengthy review, has concluded that the
pesticide, chlorpyrifos -- sold under the trade names Dursban and
Lorsban -- poses a risk to children because of its potential effects
on the nervous system and possibly brain development.
</P>
<P>
   For decades one of the most widely used insecticides,
chlorpyrifos is found on everything from pet flea collars to garden
and lawn chemicals and indoor bug sprays. It also has been used
widely in agriculture to protect fruits, vegetables and grains from
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement that heads off further regulations, Dow
Chemical Co., will immediately halt production of chlorpyrifos for
virtually all nonagricultural uses. The EPA also will impose
tighter restrictions on its use on some agricultural products,
specifically apples and grapes, and ban its use on tomatoes. These
restrictions are designed to eliminate the chemical's residues on
foods often consumed by children.
</P>
<P>
   While the insecticide will be prohibited for use by commercial
pest control or lawn care companies, the agency is not imposing a
recall of products already on the market and on the shelves of
stores nationwide, prompting complaints from some environmental and
health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the EPA identifies hazards it should stop their use,''
said Jay Feldman, executive director of the National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's concern that these products are going to remain on the
shelves'' and that the insecticide will continue -- although at much
reduced levels -- be used in agriculture, said David Wallinga, a
scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He said that
under the EPA phase-out, existing stocks of Dursban may continue to
be sold for household and garden use for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of consumer products contain the chemical compound and
many people can be expected to buy the products -- bug sprays and
lawn and garden insecticides, for example -- this summer not knowing
of the health risks, said Wallinga, who nevertheless called the EPA
action ''a good step.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in advance of
the formal announcement, said the new restrictions and the
agreement with Dow Chemical provides the swiftest way to remove the
material from the market. Most of the products containing
chlorpyrifos for nonagricultural purposes will be gone by the end
of the year, said one of the EPA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorpyrifos is among a family of 37 pesticides known as
organophosphates that attack the nervous system and are under
review by the EPA because of their potential health effects on
children. Congress passed a law four years ago requiring the review
to be completed by October, 1999, but so far only a handful of the
chemicals have been examined.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the agency banned the use of the pesticide methyl
parathion on fruits and many vegetables and restricted the use of
azinphos-methyl. Like chlorpyrifos, they are in the organophosphate
family.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an EPA draft study concluded that another
insecticide, diazinon, which is also that family, may pose a
greater health risks than previously thought. This pesticide also
is widely used in homes and gardens. A final review on diazinon is
expected before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, the EPA is required
to restrict or ban a pesticide's use if it poses a specific threat
to children. The increased concern about chlorpyrifos emerged after
studies -- some conducted by Dow Chemical Co. -- found that the
compound causes brain damage in fetal rats, whose mothers were
given the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   No such direct link has been established in humans, but the
animal tests were enough to trigger a finding that the pesticide
should not be used where children might become exposed, scientists
said.

<HEADLINE> Federal agents seize documents from rail contractors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLD SAYBROOK, Conn. (AP) - Federal agents on Wednesday raided
the joint offices of two contractors responsible for electrifying
the high-speed Amtrak rail line between New Haven and Boston,
seizing truckloads of documents and computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Balfour Beatty Construction Inc. and Massachusetts Electric
Construction Co. have been criticized for cost overruns on the
project. The price tag has ballooned from $321 million in 1995 to
over $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Inspector General, the agency in charge of
investigating Amtrak, would not comment on the investigation.
Balfour Beatty officials also refused to talk about the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The electrification work is a cornerstone of Amtrak's $1.7
billion plan to connect Washington and Boston by high-speed rail.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials, who have lauded the new high-speed Acela
trains in numerous promotions, insisted that the quality of the
overhead electrical system was not compromised by suspected
financial irregularities. They also said none of Amtrak's train
services would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical system has performed well since it began
operating in January, although more testing is being conducted,
Amtrak's spokesman Rick Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's board of directors hired Balfour Beatty, a
multinational company with U.S. headquarters in Atlanta, and
Massachusetts Electric of Boston to install 157 miles of overhead
electrical wires from New Haven to Boston in anticipation of its
high-speed train service.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was awarded after the original construction firm
hired to do the job ran into financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That firm, Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, completed the
initial design work for Amtrak's electrification in the mid-1990s.
Balfour Beatty has said it needed to redo much of that design work
at increased cost to Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   Electrically powered Acela Regional trains, capable of speeds of
up to 120 mph, began operating in January. In July, Amtrak expects
to launch Acela Express trains, which are projected to run at
speeds up to 150 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The new electrical system is in place in Connecticut, with only
a small portion of work remaining in the Boston area, Remington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Harris, chief of the public transportation bureau for the
state Department of Transportation, said independent inspectors
have not found any problems with the electrification system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fairly certain that, no matter what it costs, it's safe,''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour Beatty was fined in 1994 after the collapse of three
tunnels during the construction of the Heathrow Express railway
link at London's Heathrow Airport. Also in 1994, the company was
fined by Pennsylvania transportation officials amid disagreements
about a stalled highway project.

<HEADLINE> Greenwich appeals decision that would open beaches to all state residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - The doctrine cited by the state
Appellate Court when it ruled Greenwich beaches must be open to all
state residents does not exist, town attorneys claim in a petition
to have the case heard by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich - whose famous and wealthy inhabitants include Ron
Howard, Mel Gibson, and Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford - bans walkers
and joggers from its beaches, and allows out-of-towners there only
if they are accompanied by a resident and pay a $6 fee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Appellate Court ruled last month that policy violates
the so-called public trust doctrine, a body of law from cases
dating back over a century in which it said the Supreme Court has
found that municipalities hold parks and beaches in trust for all
of the state's residents.
</P>
<P>
   In asking the high court to review the case Wednesday, Greenwich
said that none of the court decisions cited by the Appellate Court
as comprising a public trust doctrine specifically addresses the
use of municipal facilities by nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found that no Supreme Court decision in Connecticut
ever upheld that,'' said Hartford attorney Ralph Elliot, a
constitutional law expert who represents Greenwich in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But if the doctrine does exist, Greenwich officials maintain a
1919 special act of the state Legislature granted the town an
exception. That act says Greenwich's parks and beaches are to be
maintained for the use of Greenwich inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say reversing the policy would damage beach ecology
and increase traffic at Greenwich Point, an already overburdened
area.
</P>
<P>
   Brenden Leydon, the Stamford lawyer who brought the original
complaint against Greenwich, conceded that no prior state Supreme
Court decision has specifically dealt with a municipality's
exclusionary parks access policy, but that the dozen cases cited by
the Appellate Court have addressed the issue and therefore
establish a public trust doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the cases the Appellate Court cited stated that when a
town holds a park, it does so for the state at large,'' Leydon
said, adding that those cases dealt with such related cases that
affirmed towns cannot sell a park without approval of the General
Assembly, which represents the state's entire population.
</P>
<P>
   He claims the 1919 special legislative act is elitist and
unconstitutional, and said it does not contain such specific words
as ''solely'' and ''exclusively'' when addressing use of Greenwich
parks and beaches by its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Leydon has until next Thursday to file his opposition to the
town's petition. Once that is filed, the Supreme Court whether they
will accept the town's petition and review the Appellate Court
ruling or let the lower court's decision stand.

<HEADLINE> Rest stop robberies may warrant warnings to tourists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Motorists on Interstate 95 could see
warnings about two rest stops in Sumter County, where seven people
have been robbed - including a Long Island woman who was beaten
last weekend - in five separate holdups since February.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks prompted AAA Carolinas to announce Wednesday it
would issue warnings to anyone who calls for travel advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to tell them to take extra precaution, which they
really should do anyway,'' AAA spokeswoman Kristy Tolley said.
''They should only stop in a well-lit, well-populated area.''
</P>
<P>
   The stops are about four miles north of U.S. 378 on opposite
sides of the interstate and are the only I-95 rest areas in Sumter
County.
</P>
<P>
   State tourism officials said Wednesday they are considering
posting notices at the Georgia and North Carolina state lines of
I-95, but are holding back while other state agencies discuss what
to do and who should do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are obviously concerned about the safety of the millions of
people that move up and down that area,'' said Parks, Recreation
and Tourism spokesman Lou Fontana. ''We want to make sure visitors
who come to South Carolina are safe, but we don't want to do
anything to hinder the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Law Enforcement Division has joined Sumter County
police in investigating the robberies. The question of
jurisdiction, however, seems to be a stumbling point.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol makes regular stops at rest areas, but turns
over non-traffic violations to local police. The state
Transportation Department is responsible for all rest areas, and in
Sumter County, the rest stops are run by a private company.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Sanders, who runs the rest areas in Sumter County for the
Transportation Department, said he found out about the first armed
robbery in February after an attendant from VMS Inc. called to
report closing the men's restroom to clean up a victim's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he learned of the other robberies from a reporter
and went to Sumter County on Wednesday to get a copy of the report
from the latest incident.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's robbery, Angelina Stuto, 63, of Riverhead, was
beaten and robbed in the ladies room of the southbound rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   Sumter County Sheriff Tommy Mims said Tuesday his department has
talked with the Highway Patrol about stronger security, but he
would not say what came out of those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wertz, who is responsible for maintaining the stops for the
Transportation Department, said the department has done what it can
to improve safety by installing lights and posting uniformed
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Sumter County's rest areas along I-95 appear to be the most
dangerous of the state's 33 rest areas and welcome centers,
according to preliminary information from police.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may have been occasions where some have had armed
robberies, but not this many,'' Wertz said. The I-95 welcome center
in Dillon County has had three robberies this year. Wertz said his
agency has gotten only seven reports statewide from police despite
requests for notification of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Three incidents have occurred at the northbound rest stop:
</P>
<P>
   About 3 a.m., Feb. 15, two men beat and robbed an 80-year-old
Florida man while he was in the restroom. He was hospitalized for a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:45 a.m., April 23, two armed men threatened to kill three
people if they didn't turn over their money. The robbers got away
with $380 and other items worth $37.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:30 p.m., May 1, a man put a gun to a New York man's
neck while another man stole his wallet with $530 and his driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier May 1 in the southbound rest area, a man put a gun to a
Maryland man's head in the southbound rest stop, forced him into a
stall and made him take off his shoes and belt. The robber took
some change and the man's wedding ring, then left with another man.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down, Nasdaq Up in Early Going  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 36 points in the early
going. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange held a 6-5 lead
over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index was ahead 48 points and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index was up fractionally.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's early course will depend largely upon the fortunes of
two of its components -- Microsoft and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares were higher in after-hours trading, after
yesterday's breakup order from a U.S. District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say Wall Street had already priced in the ruling,
and now is focusing on what's expected to be a lengthy appeals

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today, with
the latest profit warning from Procter &AMP; Gamble weighing down the
blue-chip Dow while technology stocks once again moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 106.19 at 10,706.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed, but faring better than the
Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 5.12 at 1,466.24, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 16.89 at 3,856.15.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $3.875 to $59 after company officials said
fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their ho-hum response to a federal judge's
order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares rose
modestly in after-hours trading on Wednesday, and today advanced
93.75 cents to $71.438.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Dell rose $1.125
to $46.375 and LSI Logic rose $2.063 to $63.063.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 112.00 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.30 to 516.84.

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian intelligence officers
opened fire on each other at their headquarters Thursday, and two
agents were injured, in an apparent eruption of an internal power
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   A witness said the shootout involved about two dozen agents
drawn into a rivalry between the head of the intelligence service,
Maj. Gen. Amin al-Hindi, and his deputy, Tarek Abu Rajab.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hindi said in a statement that two officers opened fire on
each other over a personal dispute, and that they were quickly
disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said the agents were holed up in two offices facing
each other across a courtyard, firing assault rifles and pistols
and hurling several hand grenades in a clash lasting several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports said five people were injured. Al-Hindi said two
people were lightly hurt.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Audit Finds No Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin's chief property manager
said Thursday that he had found no evidence to back corruption
allegations that have tarnished the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't found any deliberate violations,'' Vladimir Kozhin,
telling journalists that his audit of Kremlin assets had only
revealed cases of ineffective management that led to lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   Kozhin's predecessor, Pavel Borodin, has been accused in the
media of taking kickbacks from a Swiss construction firm, Mabetex,
and made money available to Yeltsin and his daughters. Swiss
prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for Borodin, charging him
of money-laundering through Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has denied the allegations and said they were aimed to
smear Russia. Yeltsin and his family have denied any wrongdoing.
When Yeltsin abruptly resigned on Dec. 31, his successor Putin
granted him lifetime immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin had presided over the Kremlin property empire, including
government buildings, resorts, hotels, planes and other assets with
an estimated value of several billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Kozhin said that Kremlin holdings include about 200 commercial
companies, some of which have proven ineffective and were closed
after the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, elected March 26, has named combating official corruption
among his top priorities. However, critics have questioned his
determination given the fact that Putin has given a new official
job to Borodin and kept several top members of Yeltsin's
scandal-tinged administration. Four of Kozhin's eight deputies
worked under Borodin, including one reportedly inked to the Mabetex
case.

</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $4.75 to $58.125 after company officials
said fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest round of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their ho-hum response to a federal judge's
order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares rose
modestly in after-hours trading on Wednesday, and today slipped
just 6.25 cents to $70.438.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Oracle rose
$2.313 to $82.313 and LSI Logic rose $1.875 to $62.875.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 275.14 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.42 to 516.96.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Arrest Journalist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian intelligence agents arrested a
journalist after he appeared on a talk show and criticized the
closing of TV stations by the Palestinian Authority, family members
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Maher Alami was called in for interrogation twice before being
arrested Tuesday in the West Bank town of Ramallah, said Alami's
son Amjad. No charges have been brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   Four television stations were closed by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority in the past two weeks following a deadly
outbreak of rioting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Frustration
among Palestinians has been building over the slow pace of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Alami, who writes for a magazine, was arrested in 1995 for
refusing to put Arafat's picture on the front page of the leading
Palestinian daily Al-Quds, which led to the paper's closure for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian intelligence officials could not immediately be
reached for comment on Alami's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Palestinian police released an Islamic militant who
was arrested for delivering a sermon critical of the Palestinian
Authority, family members said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Ahmed Nimr Hamadan, once a leading member of the militant
group Hamas, was released last Monday after spending close to three
months in a Gaza jail. Hamdan was expelled from Hamas two years ago
because his views were deemed too extreme.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Blamed in Congo Fight  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Frustrated by the continuing, random
shelling of Congo's third-largest city, the senior U.N. military
observer today accused both Rwandan and Ugandan commanders of
indiscriminately killing civilians trapped in the ferocious
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 civilians, 19 of them children, had been killed in
the shelling by late Wednesday, Red Cross and other aid officials
said. Hospitals have no water, power or medicine to handle the
injured. Bodies have been piled in the morgue because it has been
too dangerous to bury anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Shells rained down today on this Congo River port for the fourth
straight day. On Wednesday, shelling set the Roman Catholic
cathedral on the river's northern bank ablaze and shut off water
and electricity to some 200,000 trapped Congolese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan 107mm shells flew toward Rwandan positions on the south
bank of the river. Most of the shells landed in the river, falling
short of their target -- Rwandan artillery kept firing at Ugandan
forces trying to advance into Kisangani across the Tshopo River
bridge, two miles north of the deserted city center.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting defies a U.N.-brokered cease-fire that was meant to
demilitarize Kisangani, the main rear base used by Rwanda and
Uganda to support rival rebel factions fighting to overthrow
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commanders on the ground are the ones responsible for
blocking the cease-fire,'' said Lt. Col. Danilo Paiva, head of the
21-man U.N. military observer mission in Kisangani. ''They are
committing genocide against the civilians. They must be held
responsible for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Paiva said two of the four U.N. observation posts -- houses used
by the unarmed monitors to record the rounds fired by each side --
have been hit by mortar rounds, one Ugandan and one Rwandan. There
were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no valid argument that there need be so many weapons
fired,'' Paiva, a Uruguayan, told reporters while taking cover from
the shelling. ''Soldiers on both sides are safe in trenches.
Civilians die.''
</P>
<P>
   Paiva said he was in contact with the U.S. embassies in Kampala,
Uganda, and Kigali, Rwanda, attempting to put diplomatic pressure
on both countries to comply with a cease-fire that has already been
signed.
</P>
<P>
   James Wakapabulo, a senior Ugandan official, said a 24-hour
cease-fire could go into effect if some of the 21 unarmed U.N.
military observers stationed in Kisangani would take up position
behind the Ugandan lines outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Karenzi Karake, the senior Rwandan commander in Kisangani,
said he had received instructions to stop firing by 4 p.m. Earlier
he said the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, had been involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot shoot, even in self-defense,'' he said, adding that
Rwandan forces were to concentrate at Simi Simi airport while the
Ugandans were to assemble at Kapalata barracks outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Paiva said the commanders had been personally issuing the firing
orders for large weaponry, such as a 107mm Katyusha rocket launcher
and the BM-21 multiple-rocket launcher, Paiva said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Rwandans placed a battery in the middle of the city.
Whenever Ugandans counter the battery, they hit civilians,'' Paiva
said. ''They are not fighting in the field. They are hiding in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaspar Mande, 44, has been unable to get home from his job at
the Palm Beach Hotel for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is talking about Rwanda and Uganda. What about the
Congolese? It is as if we don't exist,'' he said, after another
sleepless night under heavy bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda entered Congo 22 months ago as nominal allies
to support a single rebel movement. The rebel group split into two
factions, and Rwanda and Uganda gradually threw their support
behind opposing sides. Last August, they fought a four-day battle
in Kisangani in which dozens of civilians were killed. Last month
they fought again for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace accord signed last July in Lusaka, Zambia, all
five foreign armies operating in Congo agreed to withdraw under the
supervision of a 5,537-strong U.N. force. Troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia are backing Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no more than 100 unarmed U.N. military observers and
logistics experts have been deployed in Africa's third-largest
country.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Divided Over Estate Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Normally a reliable opponent of Republican tax
cuts, Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana is among 46 House
Democrats backing a GOP bill to repeal inheritance taxes -- and
causing headaches for Democratic leaders who are trying to prevent
wholesale defections.
</P>
<P>
   For Jefferson and other black and Hispanic lawmakers, the estate
tax is not just a rich man's problem but is seen as a threat to
minority businesses now thriving in the booming economy. Democrats
from rural areas are concerned that estate taxes cause family farms
to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason people are so interested is that it's an
anti-wealth-building tax in a time when African-Americans and
Hispanics are trying to build wealth,'' said Jefferson, who is from
New Orleans but grew up poor in northeast Louisiana. ''For many of
them, it's their first time ever to be able to build wealth. There
is a wealth gap in this country that we have to care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled Friday to consider a bill to gradually
reduce estate taxes over 10 years at a cost of about $105 billion
out of the projected federal surplus. President Clinton is
threatening a veto, citing the estimated cost of $50 billion a year
after repeal is completed in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, with strong backing by business and farm lobbyists,
long have sought to repeal the tax, but in this election year
they're gaining more Democrats than ever before. Current law
exempts $675,000 of a person's estate from the tax; $1.3 million
for farms and small businesses. Even though only about 2 percent of
all people who die ever pay the tax -- most of them quite wealthy --
the stories told by farmers and small businesses about their tax
fears and the high costs of estate planning are politically
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm afraid it will be the demise of the company,'' said Frank
Armstrong of the National Fruit Product Co. of Winchester, Va.,
which makes applesauce and other products.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an outside chance that enough Democrats could
defect to gain the necessary two-thirds House vote to override a
Clinton veto, which would force Senate Democrats to reconsider any
delaying tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to ward off defections, two senior Democrats
outlined an estate tax alternative Wednesday that is less costly
than the Republican bill -- about $22 billion over 10 years -- and
targets tax relief more toward family farms and small businesses.
Two sponsors are Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, senior Democrat
on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Charles
Stenholm of Texas, top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee and a
leading fiscal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said today that he
hoped many of the Democrats currently supporting the GOP bill would
switch to their party's alternative once they learn more about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking to people about it,'' Gephardt said. ''A number
of them might be attracted to vote for our alternative, which they
hadn't seen when they signed onto that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   One national poll taken for Republicans indicated that 50
percent of registered voters said they would vote for a GOP
candidate who backed repealing the estate tax, compared with 38
percent favoring a Democrat who preferred to use the money for
priority spending and Social Security. The poll of 800 registered
voters, taken May 15-17, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangel and Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., are reminding their
colleagues that the Republican measure would take billions of
dollars away from spending on such priorities as education and a
Medicare prescription drug benefit, as well as any plan to ensure
the future solvency of Social Security.
</P>

Poll reports Christian boom among Asian-Americans
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- ''If spiritual revival has occurred among
any group of people in the United States in the past decade, it is
undeniably among Asians,'' says a report on U.S. religious trends
by the nondenominational Barna Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   In a February poll, 27 percent of the Asian-Americans told Barna
they had made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ that remained
important, and expect to reach heaven because they confessed their
sins and accepted Christ as their savior. That's how Barna defines
''born-again'' commitment. The poll of 1,002 adults had a 3 percent
sampling error
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 poll, only 5 percent of Asian-Americans said this.
</P>
<P>
   In another shift, 25 percent of born-again adults came from
households earning $60,000 or more, compared with 13 percent in
1991. Barna said this reflects both an increase in upper-income
households and in Evangelical faith among the more affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Barna also found a notable increase in born-again commitments in
the South, already a devout region.
</P>
<P>
   There was a born-again increase among adults in all age
categories except for those 18 to 29, where there was a
statistically negligible decline since 1991. Poll director George
Barna said young Baby Busters ''have proven to be the most
gospel-resistant generation the Church has seen in many years.''

Nebraska Methodist won't admit he led same-sex ceremony
</P>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- On the advice of his lawyer, a United
Methodist Church minister declines to confirm or deny that he
actually conducted a ceremony for a gay couple June 3 that he had
announced would occur.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mark Kemling opposes the denomination's policy against
such ceremonies, which was reaffirmed by the General Conference
last month, and said he expects to face church discipline. Another
Nebraska Methodist pastor was defrocked for this reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe I was called by God to make a stand on this
issue,'' Kemling said. ''Just as it's important for heterosexual
couples to make that kind of public commitment, people who love one
another and want to be a family together don't want to keep that a
secret.''

Struggling Catholic radio network is selling off stations
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. (AP) -- The financially troubled Catholic
Family Radio Network is looking for a buyer and could go off the
air soon if no one is interested, an investor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing certain is we can't continue to run the network
with the revenues not covering the expenses,'' said the Rev. Joseph
Fessio, whose Ignatius Press in San Francisco invested in the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Fessio was unsure how many offers, if any, the network has
received or how much money it had lost.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling company is increasingly using programming from
another Catholic network, EWTN, which is owned by another of the
investors, Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan. Catholic Family
Radio's Web site has merged with that for Monaghan's Credo weekly,
based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of nonstop religious radio programming, common for
Protestants, remains a possibility for Catholics, said Fessio, but
this company's ''business plan didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based network purchased seven stations from
Children's Broadcasting Corp. for $37 million in fall 1998. Former
Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker John Lynch, the founding chief
executive officer, was dismissed about six months ago, Fessio said.

Evangelicals' declaration insists on the right to spread their
message
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A group of 84 Evangelical Protestant leaders
issued a declaration Tuesday insisting on believers' right to
spread their message to all.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Chicago Declaration on Religious Freedom,'' named for the
city where it was drafted and issued, does not mention the uproar
over a summer evangelism project in Chicago by the Southern Baptist
Convention that has become a divisive issue between Jews and
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist officials were prominent in developing the
statement, along with figures like Bill Bright of Campus Crusade
for Christ, Charles Colson of Prison Fellowship Ministries,
president Richard Mouw of Fuller Theological Seminary, executive
editor David Neff of Christianity Today magazine, chief counsel Jay
Sekulow of American Center for Law and Justice and executive
director David Brickner of Jews for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The new declaration says that only free speech in ''the robust
marketplace of ideas envisioned by America's founders can safeguard
the true liberty, freedom and human dignity we all pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration acknowledges that some churches have lacked
''proper respect for the rights and dignity of others,'' and
denounces ''coercive techniques, dishonest appeals, or any form of
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   It rejects any assertions that evangelism efforts ''undermine a
peaceful, pluralistic society and may lead to intolerance, bigotry
and even violence.''

Research survey indicates religiously active people live longer
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An American Psychological Association journal
reports that people who regularly attend religious worship services
definitely live longer, judging from an analysis of 42 scientific
studies involving 125,826 persons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The odds of survival for people who scored higher on measures
of public and private religious involvement were 29 percent higher
than those people who scored lower on such measures,'' said lead
author Michael E. McCullough of the National Institute for
Healthcare Research in Rockville, Md., which examines links between
spirituality and health.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public'' involvement, which was particularly beneficial for
mortality rates, meant regular participation in a church, synagogue
or other religious institution, as opposed to personal prayer and
other private activities.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough and colleagues at Duke University, Iowa State
University, Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin
analyzed the 42 research projects for the association's Health
Psychology journal.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists suggested that religiously active people tend to
take better care of their health -- for instance, they show less
obesity -- and benefit from social support and friendships through
attending worship.

Christian Scientists plan $50 million library
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Christian Science Church has announced plans
to build a $50 million headquarters library for research and
display of rare church documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity, with
75,000 square feet of space, will house 7,000 historical objects,
14,000 photos and 500,000 unreleased papers related to the life of
Eddy, who founded Christian Science.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the heightened interest in women and spirituality, we
realized the need for greater availability of Mrs. Eddy's ideas and
life,'' said Virginia Harris, chairman of the Christian Science
board.
</P>
<P>
   The unreleased papers include Eddy's writings and correspondence
from others about the late 19th century and early 20th century when
Eddy was prominent.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston library completion is set for June 2002, and a
satellite library will open in 2003 at Seneca Falls, N.Y., where
Eddy founded the faith.

<HEADLINE> Brit Teen Ordered To Give Up Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A pregnant girl who became the center of
controversy last year after the Catholic Church gave her money to
stop her having an abortion, has been ordered to put her baby up
for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing at Exeter High Court last week, the girl lost
custody of the daughter she had given birth to in January.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's name has not been released and no reason was
disclosed for the court's decision, although her father has said
she has severe learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's case had focused attention on a controversial
program, Pro-Life Initiative, under which Scotland's staunchly
conservative Cardinal Thomas Winning gives money and other help to
encourage women not to have abortions. Her unemployed father had
approached the program.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was 12 when she was impregnated by a 15-year-old boy at
a special school. It is illegal to have sex with a girl under 16,
and the girl's father had pressed unsuccessfully for the boy to be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling became public Wednesday, Winning issued a
statement saying that the ''most important thing from the church's
point of view is to safeguard life, however the child is brought
up.''

<HEADLINE> Al Roker New Book About Fatherhood  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Few things seem to cloud Al Roker's sunny mood.
But last November the jovial weathercaster was feeling a bit sad.
His daughter Leila was marking another birthday; his little girl
was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Leila had turned 1.
</P>
<P>
   Any viewer watching Roker on NBC's ''Today'' can tell that the
portly prophet loves his job. He's also nuts for his wife of five
years, ABC News correspondent Deborah Roberts. But when it comes to
Leila and her big sister, Courtney -- well, in Roker's heavens, they
hung the moon.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence, read Roker's memoir ''Don't Make Me Stop This Car!
(Adventures in Fatherhood),'' which arrives in stores just in time
for Father's Day (more than coincidence?). It is full of feelings
and observations that will ring true for most any parent. Or
anybody who had one.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Roker tells of the nail-biting time he shared with
his former wife Alice in adopting Courtney, now 13.
</P>
<P>
   He recounts the not-just-making-whoopee campaign he and Deborah
waged to become pregnant (sperm-challenged Roker could lay claim to
a scant ''11 million guys trying to get to the deep end of the
pool'').
</P>
<P>
   Roker recalls his happy childhood in Queens. He had five younger
siblings, three of them adopted, and a ''really good guy'' dad (Al,
Sr.) who put in back-to-back shifts driving a city bus, yet still
made time for each youngster.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, he ponders the difference between being a kid in his day
and now, and the difference between his dual roles as dad of a teen
and a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   And he marvels at the law of nature dictating that all of us, as
parents, turn into our own parents. He recounts being at the wheel
on a family outing when Courtney and her cousins made a little too
much racket from the backseat. He was helpless. ''Those six little
words came out involuntarily, the ones that I had heard my father
use with us some 30 years ago: DON'T MAKE ME STOP THIS CAR!''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent chat with a reporter, Roker insists he didn't
set out to write a book on parenting, or anything. ''But I had
always kept a journal. And I write the daily journal for my Web
site.''
</P>
<P>
   From a tiny acorn the mighty oak grows, especially with a
publisher's deadline bearing down. Roker found himself pounding out
the pages, while Deborah, sneaking peaks, gave him regular
feedback: ''You can't put THAT in the book!''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs understandingly. ''I took a lot of stuff out. She was
still a little uncomfortable. But I convinced her: I think this
book is a good thing. If nothing else, it'll help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Roker drives home the principle that an
adopted child is no less ''natural'' to its parents than a child to
whom they gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   He gets downright indignant at theidea that Dad can't play the
parent game with the versatility displayed by any mom. Al Roker
wants you to know he sure as heck doesn't shrink from changing
diapers. Fatherhood, he declares with mock machismo, ''is
full-contact sport.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's the real national pastime, Roker contends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think most of us are prewired to be parents,'' he says.
''For some of us, the switch is hidden behind some sheetrock. But
once you have the baby, that sheetrock comes off and you flip the
switch, and you go, 'Oooh, I love this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes biology throws up certain obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Roker takes readers through the gantlet of fertility treatments
he and his wife endured. At first, Deborah had been reluctant to
try: What if it didn't work? Al, by contrast, writes that he is
''used to failure. After all, I'm a weatherman.''
</P>
<P>
   Their perseverance paid off. Next up: Lamaze class. A private
class, that is. As Roker writes, ''All I needed was some joker next
to me, kidding me about blowing Deborah's due-date forecast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 19 months old (almost grown!), Leila is walking and she's
talking -- preferably on Dada's cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's her favorite toy,'' Roker says forebodingly, perhaps
thinking of Courtney at that age, stuffing Lorna Doones in the slot
of the family VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, meanwhile, is a blossoming teen-ager interested in
boys, Harry Potter books and Britney Spears, and full of questions
(''Why does Bugs Bunny wear gloves?'') that even Daddy, in his
wisdom, can't answer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when Roker is asked to explain why fatherhood
is so great, his response is swift.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an adventure,'' he says, smiling brightly, no clouds in
his forecast. ''They can drive me crazy. But I look in Courtney's
eyes, or Leila's eyes, and I feel like I'm the king of the world.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers Meet  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson
is not happy. The European allies have promised to upgrade their
military capabilities and increase defense spending. They're not
doing it. At least not fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   So when defense ministers of the 19 allied nations opened a
two-day session today at NATO headquarters, Robertson gave them
what one senior diplomat called ''a kick in the pants'' to get
things moving.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply do not have enough of the flexible, mobile forces
needed for the new century,'' Robertson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strong defense means two things for NATO nations -- spending
wisely, but also spending enough,'' he said. ''Europe in particular
has to live up to its stated ambition to play a stronger defense
role. You cannot get defense on the cheap and there can be no real
security without adequate resources.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen also delivered a blunt
message, pressing the Europeans to move faster toward goals agreed
to a year ago aimed at closing the gap between American and allied
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was clearly illustrated during the 78-day air campaign
against Yugoslavia last year when Americans were obliged to fly the
vast majority of combat, surveillance and refueling missions as
well as providing nearly all the intelligence and much of the
logistics. And this at a time when the Europeans say they want to
develop their a capacity for military action without the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also briefed the allies on President Clinton's meetings
with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, particularly on
nuclear issues and other military matters.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and the allies are also eager to speak with Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who will be here Friday for a
meeting of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. They are hoping
he can provide more details on Putin's proposal to work with NATO
and Europe to develop an anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow opposes an American plan to deploy a limited national
missile defense system in Alaska. That involves a small number of
interceptor missiles which Washington says it needs to meet the
threat of missile attack by ''rogue states,'' such as North Korea,
Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The final test of the system is scheduled for early next month
and Clinton is expected to decide whether to go ahead with the
project by autumn so work can begin by spring on the accompanying
radar system.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says the U.S. plan is a threat to European security
because it could be expanded to defeat a Russian missile attack,
making Russia's nuclear arsenal useless. The United States insists
that's not true, but Putin has warned Moscow will pull out of all
nuclear arms agreements if the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
is breached.
</P>
<P>
   Though little progress was made on the issue at the Moscow
summit, the Americans say Putin at least agreed that a threat
exists and hinted he could be flexible in making alterations to the
ABM treaty.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 139; Nasdaq Up 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed on Wall Street today, with the
latest profit warning from Procter &AMP; Gamble weighing on the Dow
Jones industrials and the technology sector continuing its advance.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 138.57 at 10,674.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed, but faring better than the
Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 6.40 at 1,464.96, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 26.61 at 3,865.87.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $4.563 to $58.313 after company officials
said fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest round of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their ho-hum response to a federal judge's
order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares rose
modestly in after-hours trading on Wednesday, and today slipped
just 50 cents to $70.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Oracle rose
$2.063 to $82.063 and LSI Logic rose $1.375 to $62.813.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while investors appeared cautious, a sense of
burgeoning optimism pervades Wall Street, in contrast to the
interest-rate worries that dragged the market lower in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not willing to say that the Fed is done,'' Sowerby said.
''But I think investors had begun to overestimate how unfriendly
(Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan might be to stock investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 393.13 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.31 to
516.23.

<HEADLINE> Author Frederic Dard Dies at 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONNEFONTAINE, Switzerland (AP) -- Popular French writer Frederic
Dard, the author of more than 300 novels including the ''San
Antonio'' detective fiction series, has died. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Dard died of a heart attack Tuesday at Bonnefontaine in western
Switzerland, where he had lived for more than 25 years, authorities
in the village said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1921, Dard worked as a journalist in Lyon from 1942 to
1950 before dedicating himself to novels, theater and film. He used
a number of pseudonyms, among them Frederic Charles, Kaput and
L'Ange Noir (The Black Angel), and sold more than 270 million
books.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote more than 140 novels in the ''San Antonio'' series,
recounting the adventures of police superintendent San Antonio and
his faithful sidekick, Inspector Berurier.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his inventive and exuberant word play, Dard wrote his
novels -- including ''Sexuality,'' ''Is There a Frenchman in the
Room?'' and ''Between Life and the Morgue'' -- at a rate of between
three and five per year.
</P>
<P>
   Dard's last work, ''Napoleon Pommier,'' was published three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was often compared to Georges Simenon, the Belgian-born
writer who wrote some 200 novels, many featuring the crime-busting
hero Inspector Maigret.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Simenon, he was really the great eminence of the
detective genre and an author who was a literary phenomenon,''
Francois Riviere, Dard's biographer, said on France's all news
television channel, LCI.
</P>
<P>
   Tributes came from national leaders, thinkers and artists in
France.
</P>
<P>
   ''This morning, our language lost one of its magicians,'' French
President Jacques Chirac said in a statement that described Dard as
an ''immensely generous writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean d'Ormesson, of the prestigious Academie Francaise, said
that Dard ''invented not only a personage (San Antonio) but a
language.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Dard's daughter Josephine, then aged 12, was kidnapped
and eventually released -- an experience that he said ''traumatized
me for ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dard joked that ''my heart is too big, but that didn't stop me
surviving my cardiologist.'' In an interview published last year,
he added that ''I will have no regrets if I find myself going. I
will say thanks for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Dard was buried Thursday in Saint-Chef, a village in southeast
France near his birthplace, Bourgoin-Jallieu, in a ceremony
attended by his family and a few friends and village residents. He
had chosen as his final resting place a spot with a view of Mont
Blanc, Europe's highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and three children.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson

<HEADLINE> New Earthquake Hits Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENGKULU, Indonesia (AP) -- Left destitute by one powerful quake
and terrified by another, homeless Sumatrans on Thursday protested
government inaction and a political rival accused Indonesia's
president of heartlessness for going abroad instead of visiting the
disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after a magnitude 6.2 quake struck the devastated port town
of Bengkulu at dawn Thursday, about 100 people blocked a key road
to its airport, using rubble from their ruined homes to make a
barricade.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offshore temblor caused no reported injuries or
damages, but compounded residents' frustration. It came five days
after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake that killed around 100 people,
injured 1,900 and ruined thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding sticks and rocks, the protesters complained the
government was neglecting them even as foreign aid was pouring into
the quake zone. About 30 armed police struggled to diffuse tensions
as protesters scuffled with motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is no good. No aid has reached here yet. We
need tents food and medicine,'' said Yudi, 40, one of the
protesters. His 5-year-old son was injured and his home flattened
in Sunday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hungry, we are sick. Why doesn't the government care?''
read one protest banner.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial governor promptly ordered immediate distribution
of rice and noodles to the protesters, which were blocking
government relief trucks from leaving for outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of Indonesia's national parliament on Thursday
visited Bengkulu, about 310 miles northwest of Indonesia's capital
Jakarta, and accused President Abdurrahman Wahid of neglecting the
quake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid left Indonesia on Wednesday night on a two-week foreign
tour and has not visited the quake region.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite shameful. My president is not wise at all. Instead
of coming to this miserable region he travels overseas for
nothing,'' said speaker Amien Rais, a political rival of Wahid's.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid flew to Japan for Thursday's memorial service for former
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. He also was headed to the
United States, Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of aftershocks have followed Sunday's earthquake, but
life is returning to a degree of normalcy in Bengkulu.
Communications to the town have been restored and most shops are
open.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations resident coordinator in Jakarta reported the
food situation was under control but said water supplies were
short.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid has reached remote Enggano island, about 125 miles
southwest of Bengkulu, closest to the epicenter of Sunday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   One Indonesian and two Dutch navy ships anchored off the island,
using helicopters to deliver rice, noodles, tents and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch marines started knocking down structurally unsound
buildings on Enggano using sledgehammers.
</P>
<P>
   Naval vessels from the Netherlands and Belgium also have
anchored off Bengkulu. A half dozen nations, including the United
States, have pledged assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's quake was centered in a different area of ocean from
Sunday's temblor and was not classified as an aftershock, the
Indonesian geophysical service said.

<HEADLINE> Jolie Denies Relationship Gossip  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angelina Jolie has it all: the awards, her
choice of Hollywood roles and the adoration of gossip columnists
who have found the motherlode.
</P>
<P>
   After Jolie's gushing words of love for her brother at the
Oscars in March, rumor-mongers hinted at incest. After her
whirlwind Vegas marriage to Billy Bob Thornton last month, the
gossip mill had Jolie breaking up Thornton's relationship with
Laura Dern. After word leaked out about a steamy scene between
Jolie and Antonio Banderas for an upcoming movie, the tabloid
talkers speculated they were fooling around for real.
</P>
<P>
   None of it is true, Jolie said in an interview to promote her
new movie ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts when people just make light of things that are
important to you,'' Jolie said. ''Like taking your relationship
with your brother, which is a very beautiful thing, and twisting it
so your parents are watching the TV, it's a moment they'll remember
forever, and now rather than seeing a beautiful moment for their
children, they're thinking, 'Oh, my God, the whole world is calling
our children perverted publicly.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie said she and brother Jamie Haven, the children of actor
Jon Voight, are close siblings, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually felt like the people who wrote that should be a
little embarrassed because they came up with it,'' Jolie said.
''That's what's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her abrupt nuptials to Thornton, Jolie laughs off rumors
that he married her only as a friend who felt she needed looking
out for. They met while filming ''Pushing Tin'' two years ago but
did not become involved until a few months ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the rumor is he's with me because he wants to look after
me, I think that's beautiful,'' Jolie said. ''He does look after
me. And I wouldn't be half as strong and clear and OK as I am today
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Thornton has been married four times before and Jolie
once previously, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, she said this marriage
will last. The latest of her 10 tattoos is on her left shoulder,
reading ''Billy Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it will be forever,'' Jolie said. ''If I didn't meet
him until I was older, during those years I probably would have
been married four times, too. ... This is different. I know we've
found each other now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes,
for the title role in the HBO movie ''Gia,'' about a supermodel who
died of AIDS; for the TV movie ''George Wallace''; and for last
year's theatrical film ''Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Her supporting-actress Oscar came for that film, in which she
played a vampish sociopath in a mental ward.
</P>
<P>
   After that movie, Jolie said, she needed something down to
earth. She took the role of Sway, a former car thief drawn into one
last night of robbery to help her ex-lover, played by Nicolas Cage,
in ''Gone in 60 Seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a departure for her and a chance to just have fun,''
said director Dominic Sena. ''It wasn't like she was carrying the
picture. She got to be one of the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie cops yet another new hairstyle for the movie, a wig with
long blond dreadlocks, a sharp contrast to her current brunette
color. As she sits crosslegged on a bed in the Four Seasons hotel
for her interview, Jolie's simple white T-shirt and blue jeans also
contrast with Sway's flashy style.
</P>
<P>
   Sena and producer Jerry Bruckheimer said Jolie threw herself
into the role, even buying an old jalopy that she tore apart to
learn about cars and auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's two different lives, your work life and your private
life, and she was into her work life,'' Bruckheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jolie's private life, ''she's beautiful, she's smart,
she's interesting,'' Bruckheimer said. ''She doesn't fit a mold
that Hollywood would love to put on her. She's kind of the bad
girl, which people love. So she creates a lot of print.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Jolie stars as Lara Croft in ''Tomb Raider,'' based on
the video game. Shooting starts in July, and the movie is due out
next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's another choice that may raise eyebrows, given the critical
acclaim Jolie has earned. But Jolie said Lara is a good role model,
and the actress doesn't care how her professional and personal
choices are perceived.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my responsibility is to my work and what the films
say,'' Jolie said. ''My personal life, however it's interpreted,
it's not my responsibility to have a personal life that everybody's
comfortable with.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 139; Nasdaq Up 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed on Wall Street today, with the
latest profit warning from Procter &AMP; Gamble weighing on the Dow
Jones industrials and the technology sector continuing its advance.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 138.57 at 10,674.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed, but faring better than the
Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 6.40 at 1,464.96, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 26.61 at 3,865.87.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $4.563 to $58.313 after company officials
said fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest round of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their ho-hum response to a federal judge's
order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares rose
modestly in after-hours trading on Wednesday, and today slipped
just 50 cents to $70.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Oracle rose
$2.063 to $82.063 and LSI Logic rose $1.375 to $62.813.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while investors appeared cautious, a sense of
burgeoning optimism pervades Wall Street, in contrast to the
interest-rate worries that dragged the market lower in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not willing to say that the Fed is done,'' Sowerby said.
''But I think investors had begun to overestimate how unfriendly
(Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan might be to stock investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 393.13 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.31 to
516.23.

<HEADLINE> Patients' Rights Bill Debated  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Predicting the fate of the measure would
reverberate in fall elections, Democrats urged Senate Republicans
today to support a patients' rights bill that is much broader than
one they passed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure, which has bipartisan support, would give
Americans more leverage in dealing with health plans. It was being
proposed today as an amendment to a $309.8 billion defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said bringing the measure to the floor would put the
debate about patients' rights out in the open. They said a House
and Senate negotiators, which have met mostly in private to combine
two competing bills, were dragging their feet and had made little
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great opportunity (for Republicans) to make up for
the votes they made last year,'' Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate defeats the bill, Democrats promised, they will
make hay of the issue in the fall elections. ''People will be
shocked by the vote in November,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours of debate were scheduled for the patients' protection
bill, which closely resembles a bipartisan bill passed by the House
last fall. It provides many basic protections for consumers, such
as easier access to specialists and the ability to keep the same
doctors if employers change health providers.
</P>
<P>
   It also expands patients' rights to sue their health plans if
they are harmed when plans deny coverage of medicines, treatments
or other care. It would apply to all 161 million Americans with
private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill last year with many of the same
provisions, but no expanded right to sue. It also applies to fewer
people.
</P>
<P>
   The vote last year was 53-47, with just two Republicans crossing
party lines to vote with Democrats against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they oppose expanding the right to sue, saying
more lawsuits would increase costs and drive employers to drop
health benefits for workers rather than face expensive court
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say health plans should be held liable in court for
their actions just as other companies are. When the House passed a
bipartisan bill last fall, 68 Republicans joined Democrats in
voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators on the House-Senate committee offered a
proposal for limited lawsuits that they said moves closer to the
Democrats position. Democrats flatly rejected it as insufficient
and unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said their bill would help families get better care
and end HMO abuses such as ''drive-by mastectomies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The early tentative soundings are that we will have a stronger
vote than we did last time,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a
member of the House-Senate committee who spearheaded the move to
bypass the group and bring a bill to the floor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Korean Summit  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- On a quick trip to Asia, President Clinton met with
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on Thursday in a show of
solidarity before next week's first summit between the long divided
Korean nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is really no daylight between the United States and
South Korea on the proper approach to North Korea in this summit,''
said Ken Lieberthal, the National Security Council's senior
director for Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conferred with Kim after attending the state funeral of
the late Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. The president also
met briefly with Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori, as he spent less
than nine hours in Tokyo before heading home. The Tokyo trip came
just one day after the president's return to the White House from a
weeklong visit to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in the North's
capital, Pyongyang, for three days of talks beginning Monday. It
will be the first summit ever between the two Koreas, which were
partitioned into the communist North and the pro-Western South in
1945. They fought a three-year war in the early 1950s that left 5
million people dead, injured or missing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had high hopes that the meeting might yield a
process for the two Koreas to began talking about reunification.
</P>
<P>
   During their 25-minute meeting, Kim told Clinton he hoped the
summit would be a turning point in resolving tensions, national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Kim said during the meeting, 'We will still need
patience. This is just a first step,''' Crowley said. ''It's safe
to say decades of conflict are not going to melt away in one
meeting. But if coming out of this is a process for building a
dialogue, that would have a tremendous effect on reducing tensions
on the (Korean) peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced in September that it was easing
sanctions against North Korea. Crowley said the procedures for
implementing that decision would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately upon his arrival in Tokyo, Clinton went to the
Akasaka Guest House to meet with Mori. They spent about 30 minutes
discussing the summit of industrialized nations set for next month
in Japan, and U.S.-Japan telecommunications trade.
</P>
<P>
   Between meetings, Clinton attended the state funeral for Obuchi,
who died last month following a stroke. Along with U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Foley, Clinton bowed and laid flowers on a table before a
small casket containing Obuchi's ashes; he did not speak during the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Foley's residence, Clinton praised Obuchi for guiding
Japan through a severe economic crisis while maintaining a human
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think history will record that Keizo Obuchi rose to the
challenge with courage and confidence,'' Clinton said. ''(He)
represented to the whole world the Japanese virtues of honor and
loyalty, vision and determination, love for, and commitment to,
ordinary people. Our world is a better place thanks to the life
that he lived and the work that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled how Obuchi delivered an ''unhittable pitch'' to
Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa during a visit last year. He said
he cherishes a painting of Mount Fuji that Obuchi gave him during
his last visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Tokyo just as Mori finished meeting with the
South Korean president. Lieberthal said Mori noted the importance
of cooperation between the United States, South Korea and Japan in
getting North Korea to ''think in more creative and flexible
terms.'' They did not discuss easing sanctions, Lieberthal said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton and Kim were merely ''touching base and
reaffirming we will work closely together on this.''

<HEADLINE> Four Sentenced in 1998 Sweden Fire  </HEADLINE>
By TOMMY GRANDELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Four young men were convicted Thursday
for setting a 1998 blaze at a crowded dance hall that killed 63
teen-agers, the deadliest fire in modern Swedish history.
</P>
<P>
   The district court in Goteborg ruled that the four defendants
must have known that the fire could spread and jeopardize lives.
They were convicted of aggravated arson.
</P>
<P>
   Shoresh Kaveh, 19, considered to be the leader, was sentenced to
eight years in prison. Housein Arsani, 19, and Mohammad
Mohammadamini, 21, each received six-year sentences, while Meysam
Mohammadyeh was sentenced to three years in a community home. All
four are Iranian-born Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 29, 1998 fire started in the lower level of an
emergency stairwell that was cluttered with chairs, then raced
through a rented second-floor hall just before midnight. Panicked
teens had to flee down a single, narrow staircase. Many leapt from
the windows, and 200 youths were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hailed the sentences while the relatives of some
victims and survivors said they were too light. Defense attorneys
said they likely would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ashamed of the Swedish law that permits this and
morally it has hurt us, all the families,'' said Asha Adnan, who
lost a 17-year-old son in the fire in Goteborg, 300 miles southwest
of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the defendants poured combustible liquid over
chairs and added pieces of paper to the pile, then Kaveh lit the
flames.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants acknowledged being in the stairwell but said they
did not recognize any danger to the crowded party upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kaveh admitted that he set fire to a chair because he felt
humiliated that he was asked to pay a $5 admission. He said he
meant no harm to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the youths attending the dance were immigrants or
children of immigrants, primarily Muslims. Proceedings from the
two-week trial, which ended May 18, were translated from Swedish
into 13 languages.

<HEADLINE> 6 Killed in Brazil Prison Escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police killed six inmates in a
gunbattle Thursday when the prisoners tried to escape a maximum
security prison in northeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Police killed the inmates in the early morning as they were
trying to scale a 50-foot wall of the Paulo Sarazati Penitentiary
near Fortaleza, 1,550 miles northeast of Sao Paulo in the state of
Ceara.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guards saw the prisoners scale the wall with a makeshift
ladder and alerted a nearby precinct,'' prison guard Joao Nicolau
da Silva said by phone. ''There was a brief gunbattle that ended
with six inmates dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He said police would investigate how the guns used by the
inmates were smuggled into the prison. No one else was hurt or
wounded in the incident, he added.

</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest round of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their ho-hum response to a federal judge's
order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares rose
modestly in after-hours trading on Wednesday, and today slipped
just 62.5 cents to $69.875.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Oracle rose $2.25
to $82.25 and LSI Logic rose $2.50 to $63.50.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell $2.313 to $35.375, adding to the Dow's decline. The
company backed off from a plan to increase long-distance rates.
Federal regulators had harshly criticized AT&AMP;T's plan, noting that
the company recently promised to reduce monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while investors appeared cautious, a sense of
burgeoning optimism pervades Wall Street, in contrast to the
interest-rate worries that dragged the market lower in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not willing to say that the Fed is done,'' Sowerby said.
''But I think investors had begun to overestimate how unfriendly
(Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan might be to stock investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 571.21 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.56 to
515.98.

<HEADLINE> 19 Detained in Sri Lanka Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Police detained 19 men Thursday in a
suicide bombing that killed 23 people, and Sri Lanka extended
nationwide emergency rule for a month and placed more soldiers at
checkpoints in its jittery capital.
</P>
<P>
   The bomber with explosives strapped to his body chose Sri
Lanka's first War Heroes Day to strike, killing himself, Industrial
Development Minister Clement V. Gooneratne, his wife and 20 others
in Ratmalana, an industrial suburb on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility, but the government blamed the
bombing on separatist rebels fighting for a homeland for the Tamil
minority. Mobs on Wednesday threw stones at Tamil-owned shops in
Ratmalana.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament members extended nationwide emergency rule for
another month, then adjourned 45 minutes early to rush home in
their cars before heavy evening traffic posed more security risks
in the capital, Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency rule gives police and soldiers wide powers to detain
people, seize property and shut down newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   More reinforcements, wearing green capes against the monsoon
rains, appeared at bunkers and checkpoints Thursday to increase
security in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained 19 men as suspected accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the men were seized in a cafe near the bomb site and 15
were taken at dawn from apartments and houses in the same area,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who lost an eye during a
December assassination attempt, appealed for calm and asked people
not to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the rebels'
formal name, were trying to ''inflame communal passions by
provoking the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I appeal to all Sri Lankans to consider this earnestly and act
with patience to maintain peace at this hour,'' Kumaratunga said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 60 injured people admitted for treatment in the
bombing remained hospitalized, Dr. W.G. Gunawardena said.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose to 23 Thursday when Gooneratne's wife,
Shyama, died from injuries suffered in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bomber was a man, although in the past women
have cut their hair and posed as men in suicide bombings. Public
officials are barred from providing information to the press under
a strict code of conduct imposed in February.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have a suicide unit, the Black Tigers, known for
targeting government officials and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have assassinated several high-ranking
politicians, including President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993 and
former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers denied they killed Gandhi and have never
commented on Premadasa's death.
</P>
<P>
   War Heroes Day, on which the bomber chose to act, was declared
to raise war funds and boost the morale of 40,000 troops holding
off a rebel assault on the northern city of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   The government Information Department said Thursday that eight
rebels had been killed and five wounded Wednesday when the army
shelled a rebel vehicle after a mortar exchange, and attacked a
guerrilla bunker in the Jaffna Peninsula battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a police officer in Vavuniya, the last government
stronghold before Jaffna, said a remote-controlled Claymore mine
exploded on the town's outskirts, killing three members of a
civilian security patrol and wounding four.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 to establish a homeland
in the north and east of the island nation for the country's 3.2
million Tamils, accusing the Sinhalese majority of discrimination
in education and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Whatever happened to televising the Legislature? AP News Analysis </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - One of the abiding mysteries surrounding the
state Legislature, a place which practically runs on ego and
personal ambition, is why lawmakers have not put their sessions on
television systems around New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican minority in the state Assembly again pointed out
that failure this week when making recommendations to give GOP
members more voice and influence in the chamber. One proposal
called for gavel-to-gavel, unedited telecasting of the Assembly's
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a revolutionary idea.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation, people have been talking about letting New
Yorkers see the debating their 211 legislators are doing in Albany
at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   The generally acknowledged success of C-SPAN in Washington since
the channel's debut in March 1979 - a second channel was added in
1986 - has not compelled the Legislature to set up a similar system
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that at least 19 other states provide unedited
telecasts of their legislatures hasn't forced New York to move,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Money is hardly the issue, although it has been cited as one in
the past by legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature is spending just under $200 million on its
own operations in this fiscal year and lawmakers could easily find
the means to televise their sessions using either taxpayer money or
through an assessment on the state's cable television viewers.
C-SPAN is funded by the nation's cable TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not like legislators in Albany are camera shy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and Assembly spend well
over $1 million a year in taxpayer money on special television
departments. Video feeds of members commenting about the issue of
the day are made available to television stations back in their
home districts, or entire ''shows'' are taped for airing on cable
channels in which lawmakers answer softball questions posed by
legislative employees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New Yorkers cannot see the Legislature live unless they are
sitting in one of the galleries overlooking the chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is the electronic and computer age, old-fashioned
strong-arm politics is mostly at work in keeping the Legislature
off live TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Live TV coverage represents a potential threat to the broad
powers the legislative leaders enjoy in their chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders fear interminable debates as lawmakers grandstand
for the cameras. They are loathe to give minority-party legislators
a televised forum to bash bills and positions held by the
majorities in each chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Government reform groups say the leaders are also not eager to
let New Yorkers see how autocratic each chamber's majorities are in
controlling the flow of bills and in trying to exclude minority
members from participating.
</P>
<P>
   B. Thomas Golisano, the Rochester millionaire who ran for
governor in 1994 and 1998, has made TV coverage of the Legislature
an issue but has not, as proponents hoped, thrown his own financial
resources into the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, legislative leaders appointed an eight-member
task force to make recommendations on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Republican leader John Faso said he appointed
himself to that task force because of his longstanding interest in
TV coverage of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still waiting for the first meeting,'' Faso said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings or not, there is a recommendation before the task force
prepared by legislative staffers. It calls on the Legislature to
establish audio transmissions of Assembly and Senate proceedings
live over the Internet, according to John McArdle, spokesman for
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation calls for video coverage - of the creaky
Internet variety - to be added later to the Web sites maintained by
the Senate and Assembly. Such Internet transmission of legislative
proceedings is the way many other states appear to be going,
according to staffers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   McArdle said television coverage using the C-SPAN model was less
attractive. In addition to cost concerns, cable systems around the
state said they are not sure they have the capacity to handle a New
York legislative channel, according to McArdle.
</P>
<P>
   With the Legislature set to complete its 2000 session within the
next week or two, it is a virtual certainty New Yorkers won't see
any movement on the subject - let alone their legislators in action
- for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Capitol Editor Joel Stashenko began working for The
Associated Press a few months after C-SPAN debuted. He can be
reached at P.O. Box 7165, Capitol Station, Albany, N.Y., 12224.

<HEADLINE> Gormley concedes GOP primary race, congratulates Gormley  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State Sen. Bill Gormley has made it
official, conceding that U.S. Rep. Bob Franks is the winner of
Tuesday's razor-close primary for the Republican candidacy
</P>
<P>
   Gormley held off conceding for two days, although Franks had
declared victory on election night and spent Wednesday on a tour of
New Jersey diners as a kickoff to his campaign against Democratic
primary nominee Jon Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Franks and Gormley was so close it took nearly
six hours after the polls closed Tuesday to call the race. The
latest state tallies give Franks a 3,700-vote margin out of more
than 270,000 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said he had wanted to wait until a few more counties had
verified their election returns before calling Franks and offering
congratulations. His campaign did not seek any recounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I congratulate Bob on his primary election victory. While the
final vote is not yet certified, our goal must now be to help make
sure there is a Republican victory in November,'' Gormley said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   State Elections Director Sharon Young said the state's official
election results will not formally be certified until June 16, but
that her office's tally Thursday was reliable, according to reports
from all 21 counties that accounted for all of the state's 6,100
election districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the fight for 7th Congressional District seat being vacated
by Franks, Maryanne Connelly continued to declare victory in the
tight Democratic primary, but chief rival Mike Lapolla also has not
conceded that race.
</P>
<P>
   State tallies showed Connelly leading by 239 votes out of more
than 32,000 votes cast.

<HEADLINE> Congo War Blamed for 1.7M Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 1.7 million people have died in
eastern Congo as a result of the 22-month civil war in the central
African country, a U.S. aid group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The International Rescue Committee performed a mortality study
in three provinces in eastern Congo to determine the impact of the
fighting that began in August 1998 and has brought five foreign
armies into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''On average, some 2,600 people are dying every day in this war
and our research found that the first months of 2000 were even
worse than 1999,'' the study's author, epidemiologist Les Roberts,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' research determined that about 600,000 deaths would be
expected under normal conditions in Congo, but that since the war
started, more than 2.3 million have died. While 200,000 deaths were
attributed to violence, the rest were the result of disease and
hunger created by the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss of life in Congo has been staggering,'' said Reynold
Levy, the president of the International Rescue Committee. ''It's
as if the entire population of Houston was wiped off the face of
the earth in a matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has brokered a cease-fire between Congolese
President Laurent Kabila and two rebel groups, but fighting
continues between Rwandan and Ugandan troops, which support
opposing rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million people live in the five provinces checked
by IRC researchers. The group conducted five mortality surveys
between April 18 and May 27 to help determine the best aid programs
for the region and collect information about the war's impact.
</P>
<P>
   IRC called for increased humanitarian assistance to the region,
unfettered access for aid workers and an immediate cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> UN Inspects Mideast Border Village  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. teams inspected the demarcation of
the Lebanese-Israeli border Thursday to ensure that Israeli troops
have withdrawn from south Lebanon and to clear the way for
peacekeepers to fan out along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   A deployment of peacekeepers from the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon into areas vacated last month by Israel could lead the
Lebanese government to send its army south -- the first firm steps
toward restoring the rule of law in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of guerrilla harassment and detention of villagers
suspected of collaborating with Israel during 18 years of
occupation have increased. In the Shiite Muslim village of
Aitaroun, two miles north of Israel and 10 miles east of this
border village, residents said guerrillas have rounded up between
20 and 30 people the past two days for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''They placed a black hood on his head and took him away this
morning,'' said 15-year-old Rola Abbas, almost in tears as she
described how Hezbollah guerrillas came in two vehicles to pick up
her father, Mohammed, and a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Shiite guerrillas, who fought to evict the Israelis from the
south, have taken control of the region, emboldened by the hasty
pullout. Only token units of police, military intelligence and
state security have been dispatched to the former Israeli security
zone, 10 percent of Lebanese territory that is home to 120,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   UNIFIL's mission for now is to certify the Israeli withdrawal,
which can only be confirmed once Israeli troops fall back behind
the so-called ''blue line'' -- a boundary finalized by U.N.
cartographers earlier in the week over Lebanese and Israeli
objections. Without confirming the withdrawal, the 4,500-member
U.N. force cannot deploy to the international border as mandated by
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Two UNIFIL teams set out Thursday afternoon in white
four-wheel-drive vehicles flying the blue U.N. flag from their
antennas. One team drove along the Lebanese side of the border
fence from Naqoura, UNIFIL headquarters, on the Mediterranean coast
and another from Rosh Hanikra on the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped work at sunset, having covered only 12 miles of the
140-mile frontier and inspected five of 146 points, including the
fence at Ramiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   At Ramiyeh, U.N. officers from both teams discussed their
findings across the fence. Israeli and Lebanese representatives
stood back, a manifestation of the animosity between their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection began a day later than what U.N. envoy Terje
Roed-Larsen expected because of a last-minute dispute.
</P>
<P>
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said earlier the United Nations
objected to an Israeli position jutting into Lebanon south of
Misgav Am, a kibbutz across from the Lebanese village of Adaisseh.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's troops have in recent days abandoned positions and
leveled others to adjust to the new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Israeli military officials said on condition of
anonymity that Israel was acting to comply with U.N. maps except
for disagreements on minor points, namely at the Arab village of
Ghajar, now controlled by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. line cuts through Ghajar, where residents have rioted
and burned tires since Tuesday to protest the division. Goksel said
Thursday the United Nations had placed one border marker in Ghajar
but that Israel had not yet agreed to divide the village.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.N. teams moved from the coast inland, Ghajar's 1,700
residents waited for them. The elderly and children as young as 4
wielded sticks, metal rods and brooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they come we won't let them in, even if we have to die,''
said Halil Assad, a 35-year-old construction worker.

<HEADLINE> Guyana Army Said Deploying Troops  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Guyana is reportedly deploying more
troops on its border with Suriname even as foreign ministers
negotiate to settle a new flare-up in the South American countries'
long-standing dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A Guyanese army official confirmed reports of arriving troops
from residents in villages along the Corentyne River, which divides
the two South American countries on the northeastern shoulder of
South America.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a few
hundred soldiers had been sent to the border, but would give no
further details. Local police, employees at a telephone company
outpost and workers at the area's main Mahogany Hotel also reported
the troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the countries became more tense on Saturday
after Surinamese army boats forced a Canadian-owned oil rig out of
disputed waters near the border.
</P>
<P>
   The rig, owned by Toronto-based CGX Energy, was preparing to
drill under a concession granted by the Guyanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministers Clement Rohee of Guyana and Erroll Snijders of
Suriname met Tuesday in Trinidad but reached no agreement.
Negotiators will meet again June 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult problem and I don't think we'll find
solutions overnight,'' Snijder said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's meeting, Guyana had asked that CGX be allowed
to continue drilling while the two countries debate how to divide
up resources in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
   Suriname rejected the proposal and instead proposed drawing a
border extending from the Corentyne River at a 10-degree angle.
Guyana says its border is at a 24-degree angle.

<HEADLINE> CIA Agents Testify at Lockerbie  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Two CIA agents on Thursday
described bomb-making paraphanalia seized in West Africa that could
tie two Libyan defendants to the 1988 airliner explosion over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time covert operatives testified in the mass
murder trial against two suspected Libyan intelligence agents
accused of planting the bomb that killed 270 people aboard Pan Am
flight 103 and on the ground in Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA agents were whisked into the high security judicial
compound on this former U.S. air base in the Netherlands in a
motorcade of limousines with dark tinted windows.
</P>
<P>
   Before the two agents took the stand, a curtain was thrown
across the glass partition separating the courtroom from the public
gallery, and the images and voices broadcast on closed-circuit
monitors were distorted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began May 3, is focusing on a circuit board
fragment recovered from the Dec. 21, 1988, explosion. Prosecutors
believe it was part of an electronic timer that detonated the
plastic explosives in the cargo hold of the New York-bound jumbo
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
deny any role in the bombing, accusing Palestinian groups of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The American witnesses identified themselves as Kenneth Stiener
and Warren Clemens. Both said they had inspected weapons
confiscated from two unidentified men at Dakar airport in Senegal
on Feb. 20, 1988, 10 months before the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified men were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The agents described electronic timers among the confiscated
weapons that British authorities said in separate testimony were
similar to the detonator they believe brought down Pan Am 103.
</P>
<P>
   British investigator William Williamson told the court he
matched the fingernail-sized circuit board fragment from the
jetliner with the timers confiscated in Dakar.
</P>
<P>
   He said the timer was a model MST-13, and traced it to an
electronics manufacturing firm in Zurich, Switzerland, known as
MEBO A.G.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants ordered 60
electronic timers from MEBO in 1985 and late 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys, however, suggested that U.S. authorities had
attempted to frame the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross examination by defense council Richard Keen,
Williamson confirmed that when he went to Senegal in July 1990 to
investigate the clue, he found CIA agents were just leaving that
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had been there ahead of you in fact,'' Keen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's correct,'' Williamson responded.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier stage in the trial, defense attorneys had shown
that CIA personnel had visited the crash site at Lockerbie, and
insinuated that they may have concealed evidence from British
investigators.

<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 9.95 at 1,460.70, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 9.95 at 3,829.31.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $6.50 to $56.375 after company officials
said fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their measured response to a federal judge's
order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares rose
modestly in after-hours trading on Wednesday, and today fell $1.75
to $68.75.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Adobe Systems
rose $4 to $118.313 and LSI Logic rose $1.813 to $62.813.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell $2.50 to $35.188, adding to the Dow's decline. The
company backed off from a plan to increase long-distance rates.
Federal regulators had harshly criticized AT&AMP;T's plan, noting that
the company recently promised to reduce monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while a sense of burgeoning optimism has
pervaded Wall Street this week, investors are still showing signs
of nervousness over interest rates. Volume remained relatively
light, indicating that many investors lack conviction, said Michael
Strauss, managing director of Commonfund Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of volume is a sign that the market doesn't believe
that this is for real,'' he said. ''At this point, we know the
economy is probably not growing at the explosive rate it's been at,
but it may still be too heated for the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 671.60 million
shares, compared with 656.47 at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.92 to
515.62.

<HEADLINE> British Diplomat Killed in Greece  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A British defense attache was assassinated
Thursday and police found evidence pointing to the terrorist group
November 17, whose members have eluded capture despite a 25-year
legacy of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Greek officials are under enormous pressure to show results
after what appears to be the group's 22nd slaying: a .45-caliber
barrage into the chest and stomach of Brig. Stephen Saunders, the
defense attache in the British Embassy, while he drove to a meeting
to discuss possible tank sales to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Another failure to make an arrest would be an embarrassing blow
for a nation desperately trying to shed its image as an unstable
corner of Western Europe. Greece is expected to receive approval to
join the EU's single currency group later this month in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greece is unable to face the phenomenon of terrorism,''
complained parliament member Dora Bakoyannis, whose politician
husband, Pavlos, was killed by November 17 in 1989. ''We must not
have taboos to take the steps needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such demands are also coming from Washington. Among the November
17 victims are four American officials and one U.S. Embassy
employee.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by a Congressional commission proposed
sanctions on Greece and Pakistan for ''not cooperating fully'' in
the battle against terrorism. Hearings are scheduled next week. The
State Department has described Greece as ''one of the weakest
links'' in anti-terrorism efforts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight is also on Greece to develop a security plan for
the 2004 Olympics. Saunders, 52, was shot near the main stadium for
the games.
</P>
<P>
   But there have never been widespread demands for major
anti-terrorist sweeps from average Greeks, who generally feel
untouched by November 17 violence because it limits attacks to
foreigners and prominent Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics allege the governing Socialists lack the will to
crack down on domestic terrorism -- possibly fearing political
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Thursday in the Greek weekly Pondiki,
former CIA director James Woolsey suggested the Greek government
was ''not serious in its pursuit of November 17.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But all signs
pointed to November 17, which takes its name from the 1973
student-led uprising against the military junta that ruled Greece
from 1967-74.
</P>
<P>
   A police ballistics test indicated the .45 caliber pistol used
to killed Saunders was the same gun fired in past killings claimed
by the group. The site and method of the killing was almost
identical to two other November 17 slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Two gunmen riding a motorcycle pulled up to the passenger side
of Saunders' car, which he was driving alone on a roadway clogged
with morning commuters. The gunmen fired through the window and
fled into the heavy traffic. Saunders died later in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deeply brutal and pointless,'' said British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   November 17 claims to follow a mix of ideologies: Marxist,
ultra-nationalist and anti-militaristic.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was on his way to a meeting with a top British defense
ministry official, Baroness Symons, to discuss Britain's attempts
to sell Challenger 2E tanks to Greece. Britain is widely derided in
Greece for its close alliance with the United States and its
support of last year's NATO attacks on Yugoslavia, which were
strongly opposed in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also faces scorn from many Greeks for refusing to return
the so-called Elgin Marbles taken from the Parthenon in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, see the attack as part of a new anti-EU
position for November 17 and other smaller Greek terrorists groups
that carry out hundreds of arson and bomb attacks every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are turning their focus onto the EU and away from the
strict anti-American viewpoint,'' said E. Wayne Merry, a former
State Department official and senior associate at the American
Foreign Policy Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A diverse collection of Greek Orthodox religious activists and
ultra-nationalists see the 15-nation EU as a bureaucratic bully
seeking to force a common culture and perspective on its members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EU is now perceived as one of the main villains,'' said
Merry.
</P>
<P>
   November 17 has never targeted a Briton, but has claimed
responsibility for attacks against British sites. In April 1994, it
said it was behind a failed missile attack against the British
aircraft carrier Ark Royal.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister George Papandreou promised a ''most merciless''
response.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not allow the country's image to be blackened,'' said
Dimitris Efstathidis, general secretary of the Public Order
Ministry. But the years of failures against terrorism loomed large.
Last year, a November 17 communique taunted authorities: ''Come and
get us.''

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Sings About Diallo Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bruce Springsteen, in his warm-up performance
before opening a 10-night stand in New York, introduced a new song
apparently inspired by last year's police slaying of an unarmed
West African immigrant in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey rocker, playing Sunday night with his E Street
Band in Atlanta, debuted ''American Skin (41 Shots)'' about a third
of the way into the three-hour show.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cronin, 39, a die-hard Springsteen fan who attended the show,
said the Boss never mentioned the victim, Amadou Diallo. ''He just
said, 'This is a new song called 'American Skin (41 Shots),' and
they started playing,'' Cronin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The song opens with Springsteen repeating the words ''41 shots,
41 shots'' -- the number of bullets fired at Diallo by four police
officers who mistook his wallet for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old man from Guinea was hit by 19 of the bullets and
killed in the vestibule of his apartment building. The four
officers involved in the shooting were acquitted of murder in
February.
</P>
<P>
   According to one fan, the song contains the line, ''Is this your
wallet? Is this your life?'' At another point, Springsteen
reportedly sings, ''You can get killed just for living in your
American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The song is unrecorded and unreleased, and came as a complete
surprise to the sold-out crowd in the Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the great Springsteen songs of the last 15
years,'' said Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   The song sparked much comment on the Internet, where fans who
were at the Atlanta show universally agreed with Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow!! What a powerful song,'' wrote one visitor to a site for
Springsteen fans. ''Powerful and poignant.''
</P>
<P>
   A Springsteen spokesman had no comment on the new material or
its inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen opens a 10-night stand at Madison Square Garden on
Monday, with the final show of his reunion tour set for July 1.
Since Springsteen routinely changes his set list from night to
night, it's unclear if he will perform ''American Skin'' in New
York.

<HEADLINE> Panel Subpoenas Elian Documents  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee subpoenaed Attorney General
Janet Reno on Thursday seeking all documents concerning the federal
raid in Miami to seize 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, and announced
plans to subpoena the State Department as well.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the Justice
Department has yet to turn over all of its e-mails and documents
regarding its decision in April to storm the home of the Cuban
boy's Miami relatives to recover the boy for his father, Juan
Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want everything so if hearings aren't justified, we won't
hold them,'' said Hatch, R-Utah. ''If they are, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also called for a State Department subpoena after a
conservative group claimed the government collaborated with Cuba's
government during the fight over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this modification is warranted so as to inform the
Congress and the public of any involvement by the State Department
and the Cuban government in the raid,'' Hatch said. ''If there was
no such involvement, let's establish that. We will all be better
served by getting the facts out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-dominated committee approved the Justice
Department subpoena by voice vote. The State Department subpoena
will be considered next week, Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, a conservative group, said Wednesday that
documents it obtained through a Freedom of Information lawsuit show
that administration officials, including the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, have consulting with Cuba on Elian matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''These smoking gun documents help prove what we've suspected,
that the Clinton-Gore Administration was doing the bidding of Fidel
Castro when they raided the Gonzalez home using 151 armed federal
agents,'' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have denied dealing with Castro's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's push for a Justice Department subpoena met with a mixed
reaction from Judiciary Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., agreed with the move, saying
getting all of the information possible would help quell conspiracy
theories about what happened with Elian. ''This will deflate, not
inflate, the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats say the subpoena is not necessary. ''I think
there's a march to a witch hunt in everything this administration
does,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee's ranking Democrat,
said the subpoena would be just a ploy to explain why there have
not been any hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Hatch is delighted to send out subpoenas. He's
delighted to send letters. He's delighted to send staff members,''
he said. ''The only thing he doesn't want to do is hold full-scale
Elian hearings ... because the American people know what we know,
that the child belongs with his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending in armed federal officers to retrieve a child, ''that's
not America,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people in our society who are very concerned
with the way that house was assaulted: in the middle of the night
in full combat gear, automatic or semiautomatic weapons drawn, the
home trashed without any real mention in the court document that
they were concerned about violence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Music instructor accused of molesting student  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLOSTER, N.J. (AP) - A music instructor whose traveling ensemble
appeared at President Clinton's inaugural festival is accused of
having sex with a 14-year-old student at his home here.
</P>
<P>
   Woo Suk ''Harry'' Lee, 37, is charged with sexually assaulting
the girl, who was a member of his traveling musical group.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's family would drop her off at Lee's apartment for
music lessons, said Assistant Bergen County Prosecutor Patricia
Baglivi, and during some of those lessons the two had sex.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a trusted family friend and teacher,'' Baglivi told The
Record of Hackensack for Thursday's editions. ''In fact, he had
stayed overnight at the victim's house at her parents'
invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee founded Hanulsori, a Korean-American music and dance
ensemble that has performed in venues along the East Coast and in
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The group appeared at President Clinton's inaugural festival in
1997, as well as the Smithsonian and Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and the group of Korean-American youths traveled frequently
throughout the eastern United States. After a trip to Washington,
D.C., Baglivi said Lee brought the girl to his apartment for a
sexual interlude before returning her to her parents' out-of-state
home.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities learned of the alleged encounters after the girl
told her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Baglivi said prosecutors have found no evidence of other
victims.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- A group that works with autistic children
established a scholarship fund in memory of one of the Wendy's
shooting victimsThursday, hoping that it would allow her ''good
will and determination to continue to live on.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, Quality Services for the Autism Community,
established the Anita Smith Memorial Scholarship to assist college
students pursuing careers in the field of developmental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 23, and her mother Joan both worked for the group,
helping children with autism, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had planned to start taking classes at York College in
Queens in the fall. Her family said she wanted to major in social
work and was training to work with disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was one of seven Wendy's employees shot in the head during
a robbery two weeks ago. Only two survived.
</P>
<P>
   To make a donation to the fund, checks should be sent to The
Anita Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund, QSAC, 30-10 38th St.,

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Seeks To Govern Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Thursday moved to put
rebel Chechnya under his direct rule, apparently aiming to assert
the Kremlin's power even as rebels step up bold attacks on Russian
forces.
</P>
<P>
   In a decree that still must be approved by parliament, Putin
placed the civil administration in Chechnya directly under his
control. He said the move was aimed at ''protecting the
constitutional order'' in Chechnya and creating conditions to
restore its government, economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin already has authority in much of Chechnya, setting
up local administrations as its troops capture communities. Russian
forces occupy the northern two-thirds of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   How much the Kremlin can accomplish in Chechnya, however the
administration is structured, remains unclear while rebels pursue a
bold strategy of small but damaging lightning attacks against the
numerically superior federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels launched a stunning attack on an Interior Ministry post
in Alkhan-Yurt on Wednesday evening, driving a truck packed with
explosives up to the building and exploding it -- killing themselves
and two Russian servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels also attacked the car of a high-ranking Russian
commander, seriously wounding him, in the same western Chechen
region as Alkhan-Yurt. On Thursday, one soldier was killed and four
were wounded when a radio-controlled mine blew up their armored
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ground offensive, which began in September, has
stalled for months in the rugged southern mountains. The rebels
have kept up ambushes and bombings in the northern lowlands that
have inflicted a steady stream of losses on Russian forces and
sapped troop morale.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin and military commanders insist the rebels are on the
verge of defeat and Putin's move Thursday was seen as implying that
Russia believes it soon will be able to govern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be what Chechnya needs,'' Nikolai Koshman, formerly
the Kremlin's top envoy in Chechnya, was quoted as saying by the
news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russian forces withdrew from Chechnya in 1996 at the end
of a humiliating war of nearly two years, the republic has been
effectively independent although still nominally part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Under Putin's proposal, Koshman's post is being abolished and
the republic would be run by a provisional administration headed by
a Putin-appointed administration chief answerable to the president
and the Russian federal government.
</P>
<P>
   There are no obvious candidates to head the provisional
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's move also further weakens the influence of Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov in his proposals for peace talks. Russia
has consistently refused such talks, and the proposed establishment
of presidential rule indicates the Kremlin has no intent of
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have frequently called on Russia to seek a
political solution to the war. But Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the
Kremlin's top spokesman on Chechnya, said Putin's proposal should
satisfy foreign critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a signal to international public opinion that the
political process in Chechnya has acquired a new dimension,''
Yastrzhembsky said on the nationwide ORT television station.
''We've made a big step forward along the road of political
settlement of the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces continued to bombard rebel targets in the south,
with attack jets flying 20 combat missions and helicopters flying
more than 50 missions over the past 24 hours, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops re-entered Chechnya in September after militants
based there seized several villages in the neighboring region of
Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment bombings the
government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Deaf Teacher Sues Over 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Who wants to be on ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire''?
</P>
<P>
   Deaf people need not apply, according to a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolteacher Peter F. Liberti Jr., who's deaf, filed a federal
suit Wednesdsay accusing the ABC show of violating the Americans
With Disabilities Act by not accommodating deaf people during
telephone qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He cannot hear things over the telephone, and because of that,
the producers have essentially told (Liberti) there's no place for
him on their show,'' said his lawyer, Bruce A. Goldstein. ''We
thought it might be appropriate to ask for $1 million in damages in
this case, but all Peter wants is a chance to try out for the
million like any other person.''
</P>
<P>
   Contestants qualify by answering questions on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always looking for ways to improve our show and the
qualification process, and we value our viewers' input,'' ABC
spokeswoman Pat Preblick said. ''In several instances, we have made
appropriate accommodations for a number of disabled contestants who
have appeared on the program and will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberti would have little trouble reading host Regis Philbin's
lips should he make it as far as getting on ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' Goldstein said.

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Defends Gun Position  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell, a staunch gun control advocate,
is defending the concealed weapon permit her son's bodyguard
applied for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not my family is in need of armed guards, that
doesn't change my position on gun control,'' the talk show host
told People magazine. ''It's not inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association officials and others have accused
O'Donnell of hypocrisy since The Greenwich Time, her local paper in
Connecticut, reported May 25 a bodyguard who will accompany her
5-year-old son to kindergarten has applied for a gun permit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, the master of ceremonies at the recent Million Mom
March pushing for tighter gun laws, says the bodyguard will not
carry the gun to school. She told People in its issue out Friday
that her son may change schools because of the hubbub.
</P>
<P>
   She criticized Greenwich police for releasing information about
the application and said officers shouldn't have come onto the
school's property to search the bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has said she and her three children need protection
because of threats as a result of her outspoken stance on gun
control. She moved recently from Nyack, N.Y., to a gated community
in Greenwich, in part because of worries about safety.

refusing to do a film based on one of his ''Saturday Night Live''
characters.
</P>
<P>
   The studio had planned the comedy ''Dieter'' as one of its major
movies for summer 2001, the trade newspaper Daily Variety reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I informed Universal that the script does not work and it
needs more time to be fixed,'' Myers said in a statement. ''I
cannot, in good conscience, accept $20 million and cheat moviegoers
who pay their hard-earned money to see my work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Superior Court lawsuit filed Friday seeks damages of $3.8
million, plus lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches, Myers portrayed Dieter,
a slick-haired German host of the techno-pop dance show
''Sprockets.'' He and his black-clad guests would often dance at
the end of the show.

<HEADLINE> Ally Sheedy Is Wary About Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ally Sheedy, who made six movies while still in
her teens, won't allow her 6-year-old daughter to follow in her
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really can destroy you,'' she said in Sunday's Parade
magazine. ''For anyone, but especially for a young woman, this can
be a ruthless, cruel, painful journey that can also sometimes be
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   She called Hollywood a ''ferocious beast that goes for the most
vulnerable place.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 38, Sheedy fought a drug addiction that nearly derailed her
career 10 years ago. She appeared in a series of forgettable films,
some that never made it to the screen, but hit it big with critics
in 1998 in the independent ''High Art.'' The film led to a stage
appearance playing a German transsexual in an off-Broadway musical,
''Hedwig and the Angry Inch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned I can do things I've never done before,'' Sheedy
said.

<HEADLINE> Court: New Jersey man eligible for Medicaid in New York  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state's highest court ruled Thursday
that the wife of a New Jersey man who is now in a coma and
hospitalized in New York can transfer his assets to herself to make
him eligible for Medicaid benefits in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member Court of Appeals upheld the decisions of two
lower courts that Kashmira Shah was entitled to the transfer as
guardian of her husband, Bipin. The judges ruled that had Bipin
Shah been capable of making a sound decision, he would have wanted
to transfer the assets to his wife as part of prudent Medicaid
planning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agree with the common sense verity uttered by the Appellate
Division that the transfer here was properly authorized because
'... any person in Mr. Shah's condition would prefer that the costs
of his care be paid by the state, as opposed to his family,'''
Judge Joseph Bellacosa wrote in the unanimous opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Bipin Shah, a chemical engineer who lived with his wife and two
children in Upper Saddle Creek, N.J., was struck in the head by a
crane at a construction site in Amityville on Long Island in August
1996. He suffered irreversible brain damage and lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   He was first hospitalized at a Long Island Hospital but was
transferred a month later to Helen Hayes Hospital in Rockland
County, just across the border from his New Jersey home, at his
wife's request.
</P>
<P>
   When Shah's private insurance ran out in January 1997, the
hospital informed his wife that she would be responsible for the
medical charges, about $1,600 per day. Mrs. Shah signed a ''spousal
refusal'' form and filed an application for Medicaid benefits with
Rockland County. She also requested to become Bipin Shah's guardian
and to have his assets transferred to herself so that she could
support the family and he could qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The state and county had unsuccessfully challenged the
guardianship and the transfer. They argued that Mrs. Shah was not
entitled to all of her husband's assets and should only be allotted
support payments that the state Social Services Law would allow a
wife to receive from an institutionalized husband.
</P>
<P>
   The county also denied Shah's Medicaid application on the
reasoning that he was not a New York resident. Both the lower
courts and the Court of Appeals found that Bipin Shah had
established New York residency under state law - ''the state of
residence is the state in which the individual is physically
present'' - and could therefore apply for Medicaid benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman at the state attorney general's
office, said: ''It was a close case of statutory interpretation,
but we respect the court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shahs' attorney, Ellice Fatoullah, said she was
''delighted'' with the Court of Appeals ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is important in many respects. The court
expressly affirms the right of an incompetent person to do Medicaid
planning,'' Fatoullah said. ''The court basically ... allows the
incapacitated individual to transfer assets and make gifts assuming
the person would have done so if he was mentally competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatoullah said in a separate settlement related to the crane
accident, Mrs. Shah accepted an undisclosed lump sum payment from
the operators of the crane. Under terms in the settlement, the
court ruling in the Shahs' favor also meant that Mrs. Shah would
pay $200,000 less in medical charges to Helen Hays Hospital,
Fatoullah said.
</P>
<P>
   With the settlement, Fatoullah said the Shahs would not need
Medicaid, but she added that had they needed it, ''they would have
gotten it.'' Shah was moved into a New Jersey home in March, where
the daily costs for care was ''a fraction'' of the hospital's, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling will also benefit the elderly and disabled who
may be incapable of planning for long-term care when they need it,
said attorney Renee Reixach, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief
on behalf of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, Coalition
of New York State Alzheimer Organization and Friends and Relatives
of the Institutionalized Aged.
</P>
<P>
   ''This affirms that the rules aren't any different for people
who have to go through the guardianship process to do what they
would do had they been competent,'' Reixach said.

<HEADLINE> Feds OK Heart Monitor Frequencies  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators designated specific slices
of the airwaves for wireless medical services that monitor
patients' heart, blood pressure or other functions from a remote
location.
</P>
<P>
   The action Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission
assigns new frequencies for the equipment's transmissions to avoid
possible harmful interference.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Susan Ness, noting the potential of medical
telemetry to save lives, said there should not be obstacles
''interfering with the ability of those devices to do their
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   The service enables health professionals to keep tabs on their
patients' vital signs within a hospital or nursing home, but from
another room. Data from respiration monitors or other devices are
transmitted to nearby receivers.
</P>
<P>
   That lets patients begin moving around in the early stages of
their recovery, with health care workers still watching for any
change in conditions. One worker could monitor several patients at
once, potentially reducing health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   These kind of services have operated for now either on vacant
television channels or on portions of the airwaves now used for
other mobile services. But FCC officials cited the increasing
threat of potential interference.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly the result of the vacant channels being used more
as television stations make the transition to digital television.
During that process, each of the nation's 1,600 stations get a
second channel so that existing sets that cannot receive the new
signal will not be useless immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The potential conflict became apparent in 1998 in Dallas, when a
TV station began testing on a second channel, knocking out of
operation low-power heart monitors at two area hospitals. No one
was hurt, but the incident showed regulators the need for setting
aside new frequencies to guarantee reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association formed a task force to study
the problem after the Dallas incident, making recommendations to
the commission on ways to protect the service.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, AHA President Dick Davidson called the commission's
action good news. ''Dedicated spectrum for health care will prevent
disruptions in the sophisticated medical equipment that is part of
caring for patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's action, the service will move to several new
slices of the airwaves. One is TV channel 37, where it will coexist
with radio astronomy uses. The other two sets of frequencies are
former government bands that have been reallocated for
nongovernment use.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate the costs and delay of individual licenses, the
equipment will be able to receive blanket licensing,

<HEADLINE> 2 Cubans Seek Refuge in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Two Cuban political asylum seekers who
say they were kidnapped in a bid to send them home were permitted
to formally apply for refugee status Thursday, the U.N. refugee
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   An eligibility committee convened Thursday by Zimbabwean
authorities -- with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees acting
as technical adviser -- was expected to decide within a few days
whether physicians Noris Pena Martinez and Leonel Cordova Rodriguez
should be granted refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Martinez, 25, and Cordova Rodriguez, 31, were held in a
low-security holding center in Harare after being brought from a
prison outside the capital Thursday, said Dominik Bartsch, a
spokesman for the UNHCR regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased they have been availed of their right to lodge
an asylum claim and that Zimbabwe authorities have honored their
legal commitments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors say armed Zimbabwean security agents and Cuban
diplomats abducted them from a friend's house in an illegal attempt
to deport them to Cuba a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two were taken to neighboring South Africa on June 2 and
were about to be forced onto a flight to Cuba when they yelled for
help and slipped a note to airline employees saying they had been
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The airline refused to transport the two, who were returned to
Zimbabwe on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee agency officials who saw the Cubans on Wednesday at
Goromonzi prison, 25 miles east of Harare, said they had been kept
in satisfactory conditions and had not to been subjected to any
harassment, Bartsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has long maintained close cultural and ideological ties
with Cuba, and President Robert Mugabe, once a leading Marxist,
counts Cuban President Fidel Castro among his closest political
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were among a group of 152 Cuban doctors and medical
workers sent to assist Zimbabwe's ailing health service in recent
weeks under a Cuba's ''doctor diplomacy'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe government spokesman George Charamba said the two were
seized because they left a refugee holding center to stay with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency said the doctors did not realize they were not
allowed to leave the refugee center, and Zimbabwe's attempt to
deport them before their refugee status was assessed violated the
country's own refugee laws as well as international laws and
conventions to which it was a signatory.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, a Cuban Foreign Ministry spokeswoman denied
involvement in the attempt to forcibly repatriate the two doctors
and said that the African country had the right to make immigration
decisions about the pair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuba had nothing to do with that,'' Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Aymee Hernandez. Cuban diplomats, she said, ''don't
have any authority to extract people from one country and take them
to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, speaking to a regular Thursday morning news
conference, accused Cordova Rodriguez and Pena Martinez of
''embarrassing moral conduct'' in their attempts to obtain
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said that the doctors had committed no crime in Cuba,
but ''they have failed to fulfill the obligations of their work...
as well as the labor and migratory regulations of this brother
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, ''it corresponds to the authorities of
Zimbabwe to adopt the decisions that they deem pertinent.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Tightens Gun Security for Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is moving to tighten procedures
for law officers who need to carry guns while traveling on
commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday that it
is sending directives to airlines and airports to strengthen
procedures for verifying the credentials of officers who need to
carry firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Police accompanying prisoners or traveling for other official
purposes sometimes need to carry their weapons. But a recent
investigation by Congress' General Accounting Office discovered
that law enforcement credentials can be easily obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned from the GAO investigation ... that law enforcement
credentials can be easily counterfeited using sources on the
Internet,'' said Cathal L. Flynn, the agency's associate
administrator for civil aviation security.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law enforcement agencies are working with us to create a
new counterfeit-proof credential, but in the meantime, we're
intensifying airport and air carrier checks required for officers
carrying arms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency declined to discuss details of the tightened
procedures but said they will not lessen the ability of officers to
carry weapons as they have in the past.

<HEADLINE> Pay Gap for Women Is Disputed  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some economists disputed the widely touted
wage gap between women and men, even as women's groups urged
senators Thursday to strengthen equal-pay laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple differential in average wages between women and men
is frequently assumed to be the result of labor market
discrimination,'' said June O'Neill, an economist and director of
the Center for the Study of Business and Government at Baruch
College in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But ''such a conclusion would be wrong,'' O'Neill told the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in a hearing
on gender-based wage discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A simple wage comparison ''does not take into account gender
differences in skills and work related characteristics that would
create differences in wages even in the absence of gender bias,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Anita Hattiangadi, an economist with the Employment Policy
Foundation, ''The gender pay gap is a red herring. . . Members of
the Senate should look at the facts and not the rhetoric designed
to incite women and make them feel victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups quickly countered the economists' arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect to the economists appearing before you
today, it is not really necessary to deconstruct the pay gap to
determine that pay discrimination remains a fact of life in the
American workplace,'' said Judith Appelbaum, vice president and
director of employment opportunities for the National Women's Law
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The persistence of gender-based discrimination is documented
by case after case, after case, in which women have gone to court.
. . to vindicate their rights,'' Appelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and women's groups are pushing for Congress to act to
strengthen the Equity Pay Act, signed by President Kennedy 37 years
ago this week to require employers to pay equal wages for equal
work.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have pushed their case by pointing to figures showing
that women earn about 73 cents on every dollar earned by men.
</P>
<P>
   One economist, Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for
Women's Policy Research, countered her colleagues saying, ''The
weight of the evidence supports the contention that discrimination
in the labor market is still substantial and remains a significant
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 143  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply
today after Procter &AMP; Gamble surprised Wall Street with an earnings
warning and a management shakeup. The escalating blue-chip selloff
spread to the rest of the market, leaving most stocks with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 142.75 at 10,670.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled after Procter &AMP; Gamble officials said
fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble shares fell more than 8 percent. The broader
consumer-goods sector sustained only modest losses as investors
speculated that Procter &AMP; Gamble's woes weren't a sign of trouble
for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh punishment for P&AMP;G indicated the market remains fairly
volatile, said Michael Strauss, managing director of Commonfund
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''When bad news comes out, the market still appears ready to
grab onto it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors continued a measured response to a federal
judge's order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares
fell modestly today.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price. A number of
Wall Street analysts defended the stock today, reiterating ''buy''
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Adobe Systems and
LSI Logic rose.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell, adding to the Dow's decline. The company backed off
from a plan to increase long-distance rates. Federal regulators had
harshly criticized AT&AMP;T's plan, noting that the company recently
promised to reduce monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while a sense of burgeoning optimism has
pervaded Wall Street this week, investors are still showing signs
of nervousness over interest rates. Volume remained relatively
light, suggesting that many investors lack conviction, Strauss
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of volume is a sign that the market doesn't believe
that this is for real,'' he said. ''At this point, we know the
economy is probably not growing at the explosive rate it's been at,
but it may still be too heated for the Fed.''

<HEADLINE> Differences of Koreas Highlighted  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- When reunification comes, a South
Korean author once wrote, somebody could make a fortune tearing
down statues of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's revered late leader.
</P>
<P>
   Another moneymaking scheme? Turn dozens of summer houses that
belonged to the North Korean founder into tourist spots, writer Yun
Woong suggested in ''108 Ways For Making Money In Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of irreverence that would horrify communist cadres
in North Korea, who virtually deify Kim.
</P>
<P>
   South and North Koreans share the same language and together
navigated more than a millennium of often turbulent history until
they were divided in 1945 at the dawn of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But an internecine war and decades of enmity, as well as
radically opposed economic and political systems, have bred
differences that could take decades to overcome in the event of
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   While that day is distant, it appears a fraction more attainable
now that both sides' leaders will hold a summit next week to
discuss economic aid, reunions of separated families and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Economics are central to the wariness toward reunification: The
destitute North suspects the rich South will try to absorb it, and
the South fears the toll of propping up its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans anxiously study German reunification a decade ago,
in which the West absorbed the East at great cost. For now, many
southern companies, eager for a foothold in North Korea, hope the
summit will speed expanding inter-Korean trade.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of hostile propaganda on both sides of the Demilitarized
Zone, or DMZ, have fed distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Soon Young, a North Korean defector, said she was taught as
a child that the South was a slum-ridden U.S. colony ravaged by
free market evils.
</P>
<P>
   So, while in hiding in China after fleeing North Korea with her
family, she was relieved to watch programs on South Korean
television that showed people in traditional costumes singing love
songs -- a form of entertainment also popular in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized we are the same people,'' said Kim, who arrived in
South Korea in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the two Koreas' rivalry, government caricatures
in the South depicted northern agents as fanged and wild-eyed,
tails sticking from under trench coats. Armed infiltrators from the
North periodically crossed the DMZ, and navy boats from both sides
clashed in 1999 in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concern over Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs,
southern attitudes toward the North have softened. North Korea,
which endured deadly famine in the 1990s and relies on
international aid, is as much an object of pity as a military
threat.
</P>
<P>
   There is nostalgia, too. Many spectators who saw a North Korean
circus performing in Seoul this week on a rare cultural visit were
elderly. They clapped in encouragement even when a juggler dropped
a ball or an acrobat missed a step.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard for some older South Koreans who lived through
the 1950-53 Korean War to shed distrust of the North. Choi
Joong-kan, 82, said he doubts North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will
keep any promises he makes at the two-day summit, which begins
Monday in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their deeds don't agree with their words,'' he said. ''I was
forced (by the North Koreans) to work at underground tunnels during
the Korean War and they always told the workers that it was safe
until the last minute before air raids.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-communism that once pervaded South Korean textbooks has
faded. Today, a middle school ethics guide says there is no
democracy in North Korea, where power is centered on Kim Jong Il,
who took over after his father, Kim Il Sung, died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Linguistic variations also divide the sides, although they have
little trouble understanding each other. In the South, Chinese
characters and English words pepper Korean. In the insular North,
outside influence on the language is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   There are some different words: In South Korea, ''oboi'' is a
rarely used word that means ''parents.'' In North Korea, it refers
only to Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   The South's brash entrepreneurial spirit, evident in dolls and
T-shirts on sale in Seoul ahead of the summit, might shock many in
the North. On Thursday, men wearing masks of the Korean leaders
posed for photographers in front of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing about living in the South is definitely
freedom,'' said Han Chang Kwon, a North Korean defector who runs a
Seoul restaurant selling his homeland's dishes. ''You can say
anything, do anything, go anywhere and eat anything. As long as you
have money.''

<HEADLINE> Amsterdam sued by Spitzer over lack of recycling  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The City of Amsterdam on Thursday became the
first municipality in New York to be sued by the state for failing
to maintain a recycling program.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer had threatened to sue the Mohawk
Valley city after it suspended its recycling program on Jan. 1. He
agreed to a July 1 deadline for Amsterdam to get a new recycling
program running.
</P>
<P>
   But the Amsterdam Common Council on Wednesday night tabled a
resolution that would have awarded a $169,980 recycling contract.
Spitzer spokesman Marc Violette said the council's action made it
clear there would be no citywide recycling program in place by July
1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret having to take this step,'' Spitzer said in a
prepared statement. ''But the city abandoned its recycling program
on January 1, 2000, and has since squandered repeated opportunities
to resolve its problems on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Montgomery County
seeks to have a judge order Amsterdam to adopt a new recycling
program.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal recycling programs have been mandatory in New York
state since 1992. Violette said Amsterdam appears to be the only
municipality in New York state without a recycling program.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam's common council suspended its recycling program this
year, saying bids for a new contract were coming in too high. The
city had terminated its contract with its old waste hauler after
receiving complaints that recyclables were being commingled with
non-recyclables and dumped in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Common council members said this week that Mayor John Duchessi
Jr.'s proposal for a $169,980 curbside recycling contract was also
too expensive. Opponents of the contract noted there was only
$100,000 in the city's proposed budget for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam's corporation counsel, Philip Cortese, said there is a
request for a special meeting of the common council to resolve the
problem. He said the council does want to reinstitute a recycling
program, but ''the question is how much will it cost and what will
the program look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortese said one solution could be a program that involves
dropping off recyclables at a central location, which would be less
expensive than a curbside recycling program.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Urged To Act Against General  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirty House members are urging Defense
Secretary William Cohen to take action against the commanding
general of Fort Campbell, Ky., where a gay private was bludgeoned
to death by a fellow soldier last July.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cohen on Wednesday, the lawmakers said that as
base commander, Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark ''is responsible for
tolerating anti-gay harassment on the post'' prior to the murder of
Pfc. Barry Winchell ''and for doing little in the wake of the
murder to stop this type of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not specify what kind of action they believe should be
taken against Clark, who also is commanding general of the 101st
Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Clark, Army Maj. Pamela Hart said Thursday from
Fort Campbell that the general would have no comment until he had
seen the letter. Hart's office later said Clark planned to make a
public statement Friday ''addressing the post's command climate,''
an apparent reference to the issue of anti-gay activity.
</P>
<P>
   In an Associated Press interview, Wally Kutteles, Winchell's
stepfather, said he believes Clark should be held responsible for
what happened at Fort Campbell, even if he did not know then of
anti-gay harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know if he was aware of it, but that's his job to
be aware of it,'' said Kutteles, an Army veteran who lives in
Kansas City, Mo. ''I don't think he cared, and that's a general's
job to care.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they were concerned that Clark would be moved
to another assignment or promoted before the Army Inspector
General's office completes an investigation of the ''command
climate'' at Campbell. The investigation, which was triggered by
the Winchell murder, is due to be completed by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one day before the letter was sent to Cohen, the
Army announced internally that Clark had been chosen for
reassignment to the post of vice director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon. As is often the case, no
specific date was announced for Clark to report to his new post.
</P>
<P>
   ''Relocating and promoting Major General Clark prior to the
completion of this investigation would be wrong and undermine the
(Defense) Department's professed commitment to enforce the
gays-in-the-military policy in a fair and legal manner,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has not been promoted in rank. His final day as commanding
general at Fort Campbell is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clark's move into the Joint Staff job was
dependent on the outcome of the Army investigation, Pentagon
spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said, ''You don't assign officers
in whom you have no confidence to positions of responsibility, like
deputy director for operations on the Joint Staff. After having
said that, the review of the Army inspector general is still a work
in progress. So I wouldn't like to presuppose Secretary Cohen's
judgment in responding to the letter.'' He said Cohen had not yet
received the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said Clark was expected to begin his new assignment in
the Pentagon within ''a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, an executive director of the private
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, welcomed the lawmakers' plea
to Cohen and criticized the Army's decision to move Clark to a
Pentagon post.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army has sent a mixed message by appearing to reward him
with a prestigious assignment,'' Osburn said Thursday, even though
Clark has not been promoted in rank.
</P>
<P>
   Among the House members who signed the letter is Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., a leading critic of the Pentagon's policy of
permitting gays to serve in the military only if they keep their
sexual orientation private. Frank and other critics say that
military members suspected of being gay or lesbian are often
harassed, and that the Winchell murder was an extreme example of
how the gay policy has failed. Winchell's killer, a fellow Army
private, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Russ Oaks, a spokesman at Army headquarters in the
Pentagon, said the Army is not contemplating any action against
Clark and that the timing of his move to the Joint Chiefs job is
unrelated to the completion of the inspector general's report on
attitudes and practices at Fort Campbell with regard to enforcing
the Pentagon's policy on gays.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is a Vietnam veteran who commanded the 3rd Brigade of the
101st Airborne Division during the 1991 war against Iraq. He later
was promoted to division chief of staff and held several posts
elsewhere before returning to Campbell as division and base
commander.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Assesses U.S. Migration Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba praised the U.S. decision to refuse asylum to
Cuban baseball star Andy Morales, but on Thursday assailed American
policies that Havana says encourage people like Morales and Elian
Gonzalez's mother to migrate illegally to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run media renewed its attacks on the 1966 Cuban
Adjustment Act, saying it lures Cubans hoping to live in the United
States to risk sometimes deadly boat trips across the ocean toward
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced that 150,000 children would march
outside the U.S. Interests Section on Friday to protest American
immigration polices and continued delays in Elian's return to his
communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who along with 30 other Cubans was picked up by the
Coast Guard off Key West on May 31, was repatriated Wednesday after
U.S. immigration officials determined the 25-year-old third baseman
did not qualify for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a seminar on U.S. immigration policies aired on
Cuban state television called the American decision ''correct,''
the Communist Party daily Granma reported. The seminar, aired
Wednesday night, was not seen in much of Cuba because of a power
outage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This baseball player will return to his home like the rest of
those who have no pending problems with justice,'' Granma said.
</P>
<P>
   But the seminar and the newspaper blasted the Cuban Adjustment
Act, which allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay and apply
for permanent U.S. residency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The true cause of the tragedy of Elian Gonzalez, whose
kidnapping has moved the American public, is the Cuban Adjustment
Act,'' Granma said in a front page story on immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   One in every five Cubans who sets off for the United States
illegally by sea dies in the attempt, seminar participants said.
They also estimated that 85 percent of boat trips to the United
States are conducted by illegal immigrant smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, now 6, survived a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10
others trying to reach the United States in November. Since then,
he has been at the center of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   After Morales' boat was picked up, two suspected smugglers were
turned over to the U.S. Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Branding the act ''arbitrary, killer law,'' Granma said that of
the 399 Cuban migrants the U.S. Coast Guard has picked up sea
during the first five months of this year, 290 were repatriated. It
said that 612 other Cubans reached land and were covered by the
adjustment law.
</P>
<P>
   Morales hit a home run last year in a 12-6 victory by the Cuban
national team over the Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Emilio Vazquez of the Cuban-American National
Foundation -- a top exile group opposed to Cuban President Fidel
Castro -- said he was disappointed by Morales' repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Morales, being a well-known ballplayer, might be made to
be an example to instill fear in the Cuban people that anyone who
tried to defect or has an opinion different from the Cuban
government will be subjected to human rights violations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cardenas, the Cuban-American foundation's Washington
representative, compared the Morales case to U.S. justice
officials' decision to return Elian to his father, who wants to
take the boy home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases, he said, show the Clinton administration has decided
to ''whitewash the situation in Cuba, to pretend it is some sort of
normal country, where human rights are abused not any more than in
the next country.''
</P>
<P>
   After his rescue, Elian was placed in the temporary custody of
his Miami relatives, who are still fighting for custody of the boy.
An April 22 armed raid on the Miami relatives' home reunited Elian
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who remains in the United
States pending court appeals.

<HEADLINE> Both Parties Jockey on Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maneuvering for election-year advantage on
health care, Democrats and Republicans clashed over a patients'
rights bill in the Senate on Thursday and waged a quieter struggle
in the House on prescription drug insurance for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just as wrong for Congress to delay and deny these needed
reforms as it is for HMOs to delay and deny needed care,'' said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., as the Senate pointed toward an
expected close vote on the patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate GOP Whip, argued
that passage of the Democratic bill would lead to a ''dramatic,
draconian increase in the uninsured'' by driving up the cost to
businesses that now offer coverage for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists expressed satisfaction that win or lose,
they would succeed in requiring GOP senators -- 17 of whom face the
voters this fall -- to cast a public vote on the politically popular
measure. The legislation would extend to millions of Americans a
number of new rights including a broad new power to sue their HMOs
for denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, House Republicans lobbied Democrats to line
up behind their emerging plan to create a new prescription drug
program in which Medicare recipients could purchase coverage from
private insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota said, ''I'm going
to be there'' when the GOP unveils its plan on Monday, a step he
said was part of an effort to bring greater HMO Medicare coverage
to his state.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats, speaking on condition of they not be named,
said they were under pressure from their leadership to deny the GOP
a campaign-season show of bipartisanship on an issue of such
importance to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said party leaders were also attempting to gain backing from the
American Medical Association in advance of the formal announcement
of the legislation. Republicans also were hoping for a positive
signal from at least one insurance company, these officials said,
to cast doubt on claims that prescription drug policies would be
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Flying home from Japan, President Clinton weighed in on the HMO
debate, dispatching a letter that urged senators to ''put the
interests of patients before those of the special interests'' and
enact a measure along the lines of one that cleared the House last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted in response to a spate of HMO horror stories, the bill
would give patients easier access to emergency rooms as well as
specialists and women would be permitted to see a gynecologist
without needing a referral from a primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   The bill backed by the White House and congressional Democrats
would apply to all Americans with private health insurance.
Majority Republicans forced passage of a less sweeping measure in
the Senate last year, one that covered far fewer people and omitted
any right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-door negotiations to resolve differences between the two
bills have sputtered for months, although Republicans earlier this
week floated a compromise that envisioned a limited right to sue in
federal court, with restrictions on damages.
</P>
<P>
   In his Senate floor remarks, Kennedy said that so far, the
House-Senate negotiation effort ''has been an endless road to
nowhere.... It is time to take stronger action.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles tartly responded that behind the closed doors of the
talks, Republicans had made ''significant compromises and
adjustments.... We really have to ask ourselves, 'Are the Democrats
interested in an issue, political theater?' and that's exactly what
this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The events during the day underscored that even though the
election is five months distant, time is running short in the
congressional calendar and the leaders of both parties are intent
on scoring political points before adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and Medicare both rank high among the issues voters
care most about, public opinion polls say. Democrats traditionally
have held an advantage on them -- and an internal House GOP survey
two weeks ago gave the Democrats a 20-point advantage on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and most Democrats favor a new prescription drug benefit
for Medicare, but House Republicans are committed to an alternative
in which private insurance companies would offer policies on an
open market to Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the GOP plan circulating in the Capitol provided
little new detail beyond what Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
disclosed several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would provide full government subsidies to
individuals whose income is 135 percent of poverty and less. Those
with incomes of up to 150 percent of poverty would receive a
smaller subsidy. Another provision would cap costs to both
individuals and the insurance companies, and have the government
pick up the difference.

<HEADLINE> Blair Ridiculed for Speech  </HEADLINE>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Middle-aged and conventional, the Women's
Institute seemed an ideal audience for Prime Minister Tony Blair's
big speech about holding to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of members of the nationwide voluntary group booed,
heckled and slow hand-clapped in a public relations fiasco that
continued to provoke widespread ridicule Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that the hostile reception at the Women's
Institute meeting Wednesday reflected growing disillusion with the
publicists, slogans and attempts at mass appeal that are hallmarks
of Blair's New Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic problem ... is the prime minister's desire to
convince the whole community that he is on everybody's side
simultaneously,'' said Roy Hattersley, Labor's former deputy
leader. ''Unless he is prepared to make some enemies, he won't make
enough friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's aides had promoted the speech as a major initiative to
reassure ''Middle England'' -- middle-class voters who swung to
Blair's centrist Labor Party in 1997 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The women listened politely, if unenthusiastically, as Blair ran
through some favorite themes, couched in New Labor talk of the
''challenges of change'' and the ''renewal of community.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he moved on to a list of statistics about health and
education spending and to lauding the record of his government, the
trouble began.
</P>
<P>
   Hecklers shouted the speech was ''too political,'' a few women
walked out, and Blair stumbled and looked embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuff was the latest sign that Blair's administration,
while still way ahead of the main opposition Conservative Party in
opinion polls, is losing some of its political touch.
</P>
<P>
   Bedrock blue-collar supporters complain about New Labor's
middle-class image and tone, and relatively tight spending on
public services. And middle-class voters are wary of what
Conservative critics call ''tax increases by stealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters also disliked a string of denunciations by Blair's
Cabinet ministers of privilege and elitism in education after
Oxford University turned down a bright student from a poor
background for enrollment this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The latest opinion poll put Labor at its lowest popularity for
six years, but still with 48 percent support, compared with 32
percent for the Tories -- a huge lead for a government well past
midway in its five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, brushed off
Wednesday's debacle, saying Blair was not about to apologize for
talking politics.
</P>
<P>
   But newspaper headlines Thursday declared ''Blair Bombs'' and
''Handbagged.''

<HEADLINE> Court says minority defendants can have access to State Police records </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Dozens of defendants who say they were
victims of racial profiling will be allowed to see several years of
detailed state police records to help bolster claims their cases
should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants - mostly minorities charged with various drug
crimes after being stopped on state highways - contend prosecutions
against them were tainted by biased state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court Thursday threw out the attorney general's
arguments that the defendants did not show enough evidence to
deserve the information and that earlier rulings granting access
were too broad.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Burlington County has ordered the
state to turn over records, reports and other police logs detailing
every arrest or motor vehicle stop on the New Jersey Turnpike since
1993. Judges in Bergen and Hunterdon counties made similar orders
for records related to trooper activity on other highways.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 42-page ruling upholds those rulings and consolidates
all cases from each county and says a single judge should hear all
new issues surrounding pretrial requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we are very pleased with the ruling,'' said Kevin
Walker, a deputy public defender representing several motorists and
their passengers. ''It puts us one step closer to having our day in
court and having a jury decide these widespread charges of racial
profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the appellate division is telling the state to get off
the stick, put aside the high-tech arguments and produce the
documents,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr., said no
appeal is planned, and the state will provide whatever information
the judge orders.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the judges said they were dealing with the
pretrial exchange of records and reports and not ruling in any way
on the merits of the racial profiling charges.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said the state should be allowed to present evidence
on each case to show that the troopers acted properly. If the state
can show that, the cases should proceed, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the state can show that a stop was not based on the
discriminatory decision of an officer, or the discriminatory
exercise of the officer's discretion, and that the post-stop
conduct was not discriminatory, the state should be permitted to do
so before full discovery is required,'' the judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that defendants can request more than just
arrest records. Defense lawyers can have access to drafts of
attorney general reports that publicly acknowledged racial
profiling by troopers and the data used to support that finding.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will comply with all that the courts order,'' said Chuck
Davis, a spokesman for Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides agree that the materials sought are
extensive, possibly tens of thousands of pages of documents.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 143; Nasdaq Falls 14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply
today after Procter &AMP; Gamble surprised Wall Street with an earnings
warning and a management shakeup. The escalating blue-chip selloff
spread to the rest of the market, leaving most stocks with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 142.75 at 10,670.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.78 to 1,461.58, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 13.70 to 3,825.56.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,593 down, 1,350 up and 471
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 842.29 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
840.18 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.01 to 514.53.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled after Procter &AMP; Gamble officials said
fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. Today, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble shares fell more than 8 percent. The broader
consumer-goods sector sustained only modest losses as investors
speculated that Procter &AMP; Gamble's woes weren't a sign of trouble
for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh punishment for P&AMP;G indicated the market remains fairly
volatile, said Michael Strauss, managing director of Commonfund
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''When bad news comes out, the market still appears ready to
grab onto it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors continued a measured response to a federal
judge's order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares
fell modestly today.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price. A number of
Wall Street analysts defended the stock today, reiterating ''buy''
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Adobe Systems and
LSI Logic rose.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell, adding to the Dow's decline. The company backed off
from a plan to increase long-distance rates. Federal regulators had
harshly criticized AT&AMP;T's plan, noting that the company recently
promised to reduce monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while a sense of burgeoning optimism has
pervaded Wall Street this week, investors are still showing signs
of nervousness over interest rates. Volume remained relatively
light, suggesting that many investors lack conviction, Strauss
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of volume is a sign that the market doesn't believe
that this is for real,'' he said. ''At this point, we know the
economy is probably not growing at the explosive rate it's been at,
but it may still be too heated for the Fed.''

<HEADLINE> Congolese Hospital Struggles  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Hundreds of wounded, sick and dying
Congolese patients lay on bloodstained, filthy mattresses in the
smelly, crumbling hospital wards. But outside, Rwandan and Ugandans
shelled each other Thursday for a fourth day despite a U.N.
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Half-naked women at the Kisangani University Hospital clutched
their babies, crying in vain for medicine and food they had not
seen since the artillery bombardment of this Congo River portbegan
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor sweated while making a final cut and amputating the leg
of a Congolese man hit by shrapnel -- one of the three casualties
operated on with only local anesthesia and without running water,
electricity, blood plasma or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is horrible,'' Diodonne Mata, the overwhelmed doctor,
said, then asked:
</P>
<P>
   ''Where is the international community now?''
</P>
<P>
   But worse was to come Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A shell hit the general hospital in Kisangani across the street
from the university hospital. As black smoke billowed out of the
building, doctors and angry patients at the university hospital
shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did not understand that no world powers could
stop the two African neighbors from fighting their own war in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were ready to intervene in Kosovo. But who will come
here?'' Mata said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the shelled hospital, a woman cried for help as she
stumbled through a doorway with shrapnel from a mortar round stuck
on her infected face.
</P>
<P>
   A student who was hit by a bullet in his right thigh said he did
not understand what the Rwandan-Ugandan conflict had to do with
him.
</P>
<P>
   At United Nations headquarters in New York, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Rwanda and Uganda had agreed to a cease-fire in
Kisangani. But late Thursday, heavy shelling persisted in the city.
</P>
<P>
   As the forces of Rwanda and Uganda, once allies in the 22-month
Congolese war, kept lobbing mortars at each other across this
decaying colonial port, the extent of civilian suffering became
clear.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the International Rescue Committee, a U.S. aid
group, said Thursday that more than 1.7 million people have died in
eastern Congo as a result of the 22-month civil war in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
   ''On average, some 2,600 people are dying every day in this war
and our research found that the first months of 2000 were even
worse than 1999,'' the study's author, epidemiologist Les Roberts,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss of life in Congo has been staggering,'' said Reynold
Levy, the president of the International Rescue Committee. ''It's
as if the entire population of Houston was wiped off the face of
the earth in a matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Kisangani renewed Monday when Rwandan and
Ugandan forces were pulling out. But instead of leaving, the
Ugandan artillery started the relentless pounding Kisangani with
mortars and rockets, apparently targeting Rwandan positions firing
from inside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda entered Congo nearly two years ago as nominal
allies in support of rebels opposed to Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. Last August, they turned guns on each other in Kisangani,
leaving hundreds dead, most of them soldiers. Last month they
fought again for several days, disagreeing over the conduct of war
and which of the three rebel groups to support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Soldiers on both sides are safe in trenches. Civilians die,''
said Lt. Col. Danilo Paivo, the frustrated commander of the 21 U.N.
military observers in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace accord signed last summer, the five foreign armies
operating in Congo agreed to withdraw under the supervision of a
5,537-strong U.N. force. Troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
are backing Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no more than 100 unarmed U.N. military observers and
logistics experts have been deployed in Africa's third-largest
country.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Lawmakers Question Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illinois lawmakers, led by House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, are demanding that the Environmental Protection
Agency clear up a policy on the use of ethanol in gasoline that
they say has contributed to some of the highest gasoline prices in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has written the head
of the Federal Trade Commission asking him to investigate ''whether
illegal price gouging'' by oil companies is involved in gas prices
of more than $2 a gallon in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert joined 19 other Illinois lawmakers, including Republican
Sen. Peter Fitzgerald and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, in urging
EPA Administrator Carol Browner to adopt a rule recognizing
ethanol's beneficial impact on carbon monoxide and ozone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less, they wrote in a letter, ''will not have a
positive impact'' on the supply and price of the state's
cleaner-burning reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated, or oxygenated, gasoline is required to be sold in
Illinois and other states with serious air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   The use of corn-based ethanol in reformulated gas is strongly
supported in farm states and has the backing of the administration,
but is opposed by the oil industry because it is more expensive
than other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois lawmakers said the U.S. EPA should accept an
analysis of the Illinois EPA last year that, in anticipation of the
higher costs of the next phase of the reformulated gas program that
started June 1, justified a carbon monoxide credit based on the air
quality benefits of ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regrettably, you have ignored our repeated requests on this
issue and Illinois consumers are now bearing the burden of your
inaction,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Perciasepe, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and
radiation, said the agency would publish rules this year taking
into consideration the Illinois EPA analysis and findings of the
National Academy of Sciences on the benefits of ethanol in reducing
carbon monoxide levels.
</P>
<P>
   But he said their estimates of the added cost of the next phase
reformulated gas was only five to seven cents a gallon, much less
than the cost jumps being seen in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency is arranging a meeting with refiners in the
Chicago-Milwaukee area to seek an explanation for ''these
inexplicable cost differentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, in a letter co-signed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
asked FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky to look into whether oil
companies are exploiting consumers in the Chicago and Milwaukee
areas.

<HEADLINE> 3 arrested, 1 sought after wild shootout with police  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - A dice game gone bad led to a wild
shootout between four men and police officers in Jersey City and
Newark in which a police car was hit by more than 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Three Jersey City men were arrested Wednesday and a fourth
remained at large Thursday in connection with the May 30 incident
in which police officers traded dozens of shots with the men as
bystanders leapt for cover. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   During a high-speed chase from Jersey City into Newark, the
suspects blasted away at police with a shotgun, a handgun and a
modified .22-caliber rifle.
</P>
<P>
   At a Newark housing project, they jumped out of the car and
exchanged more gunfire with police officers, who returned fire 14
times, Jersey City Lt. Chet Major said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects escaped on foot into the housing complex, touching
off an intense manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all felt if these people could level that amount of
firepower at us, what would they do against unarmed citizens?''
said Sgt. Peter Gallagher, the head of Jersey City's warrants
squad. ''It increased the level of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident stemmed from a dice game on May 29 in which some of
the men won, but got beatings instead of cash as their payoff,
Major said.
</P>
<P>
   They found the people they believed had cheated them driving a
black livery cab on Ocean Avenue in Jersey City at about 1:15 a.m.
on May 30 and began chasing them in a white Chevrolet Caprice that
had been stolen in Jersey City four days earlier, Major said.
</P>
<P>
   The men in the cab flagged down a passing patrol car, telling
Patrolmen James Halter and Edward Myers Jr., ''Those guys in that
white car back there have guns and they're trying to shoot us.''
</P>
<P>
   The patrolmen chased the Caprice along Routes 1&AMP;9 South into
Newark, when the car's transmission began to slip and the officers
began gaining on them.
</P>
<P>
   The car's occupants fired at police as they sped into the Seth
Boyden housing complex in Newark. They leaped from the car as the
Jersey City police car pulled up behind them, continuing to shoot
at the officers, who began shooting back.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the housing complex, they began banging on doors,
demanding to be let in. At one door, Major said, a woman asked who
was there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Fat Cat!'' one of the suspects yelled. ''You know me! Let
me in!''
</P>
<P>
   But the woman refused to let him enter, and later told police
officers the nickname he used.
</P>
<P>
   That nickname, along with fingerprints recovered from the stolen
car, led police officers to Leighton Brown, Major said. He
confessed to his role in the shootings, and led police to the two
other suspects, Major said.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of his family, James Burgess telephoned police,
who kept him on the line long enough for the call to be traced to a
house in Orange, where he was arrested. David Darby was arrested on
the sidewalk on Carteret Avenue in Jersey City. Their ages were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still searching for Sharif Young, 21, who has
addresses in Jersey City, Bayonne, Newark and Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   All four have been charged with attempted murder, weapons
offenses and aggravated assault. They were being held Thursday in
the Hudson and Essex county jails on $50,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Baryshnikov Present Dance Premieres  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Audiences that like having fun and watching
movement for its own sake should head for the Brooklyn Academy of
Music and the White Oak Project. The deal includes Mikhail
Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   There were no plots, no deeper meanings -- and none intended -- on
Wednesday as Baryshnikov and five fellow-dancers presented two
premieres, a U.S. premiere and two dances by abstract choreographer
Trisha Brown.
</P>
<P>
   There was almost a theme, surely unintended, which was an
emphasis on arm motion, often the extended, unbent arm.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Baryshnikov is the oldest on stage, dancing as a team
member, and not presenting himself as the star he was in his ballet
days.
</P>
<P>
   The first dance was ''Homemade,'' a solo which Brown
choreograhed in 1965 and danced. Here, in silence, Baryshnikov
moved around with a movie projector on his back. When he faced the
audience, the backdrop showed his pre-filmed movements in this
dance, sometimes before or after he did them live. When he turned
sideways, the movie was beamed into the wings, out of the
audience's sight.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the movie was more interesting than the movements.
Baryshnikov's hands covered his face or wielded an imaginary metal
detector, and he mainly just walked.
</P>
<P>
   A later Baryshnikov solo, ''Peccadillos,'' a premiere by Mark
Morris, was amusing. Pianist Ethan Iverson played short Satie
pieces on a tinny piano small enough for a 3-year-old. Baryshnikov
danced and twirled, a cross between a human and a mechanical doll
on a music box. To one piece of music, he seemed sad and helplessly
trapped in stiffness. Most of the time, his air was jaunty and
military, his arms and hands stiffly reaching up with elbows bent
and making quick salutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yvonne Rainer premiere, ''After Many a Summer Dies the
Swan,'' used all six dancers -- Baryshnikov, Raquel Aedo, Emily
Coates, Rosalynde LeBlanc, Michael Lomeka and Emmanuele Phuon.
Music was by Grieg, Beethoven and Ike and Tina Turner. During
silences, dancers spoke lines said to be deathbed utterances,
starting with ''Don't let it end like this. Tell them I said
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was dedicated to Martha Duffy, dance critic of Time
magazine from 1975 to her death in 1997.

<HEADLINE> State Rests in Super Bowl Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Defense lawyers rested their case Thursday after
calling one witness in the trial of two men charged with murder in
the post-Super Bowl slayings of two Atlanta-area men.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, the attorney for defendant Reginald Oakley, also
asked Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner to instruct jurors to
consider an involuntary manslaughter charge for his client in
addition to the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner did not immediately rule on that request. She sent jurors
home early Thursday and told them closing arguments would be on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The only defense witness was a security guard, Keven Brown, who
jumped into the brawl to try to end it. Brown's testimony was
followed by a short examination of a rebuttal witness called by
District Attorney Paul Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Bonner agreed with defense attorneys that
prosecutors had failed to present evidence showing that Oakley and
co-defendant Joseph Sweeting were involved in both slayings. The
ruling means each defendant still faces one murder count.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not evidence from which a rational jury could
conclude that each of these defendants participated in the crimes
for which I've granted the motions,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was originally charged
along with Sweeting and Oakley in the slayings of Jacinth Baker and
Richard Lollar, who were stabbed to death during a street brawl
after a post-Super Bowl party Jan. 31. But Lewis pleaded guilty
Monday to misdemeanor obstruction of justice and testified Tuesday
against his two former co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting, of Miami, still faces a murder charge in the death of
Lollar. Oakley, of Baltimore, still faces murder charges in the
death of Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis testified Tuesday that he saw Sweeting and Oakley, friends
who were partying with him that night, fight with a group of men
that included Baker and Lollar. But he said the brawl was over so
quickly he couldn't tell if Sweeting or Oakley stabbed the victims.

<HEADLINE> FDA Pressed on Tainted Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers pressed the Food and Drug
Administration to increase efforts to block the importation of
tainted drug ingredients that could end up in American medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said Thursday that ingredients
containing a chemical impurity or that are deliberately mislabeled
endanger the health and lives of Americans. He said the FDA must
put up an ''iron curtain'' to prevent such items from getting in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are life and death decisions and we have to trust you
all that it's done right,'' Upton told FDA officials at a hearing
of the House Commerce oversight subcommittee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials told the panel they are unsure how many U.S.
pharmaceuticals have been tainted. The World Health Organization
and other analysts estimate it could be 5 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the overall quality of drugs sold in the United
States is high, the FDA officials acknowledged the agency needs to
strengthen its regulations of so-called ''counterfeit drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of issues that clearly have to be
resolved,'' said Dennis Baker, the FDA's associate commissioner for
regulatory affairs. ''We will correct these problems the best we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the bulk drug ingredients used in the
manufacturing of U.S. drugs are imported. But more than two-thirds
of the 6,030 foreign drug manufacturers who have made shipments to
the United States in the last two years have never been inspected
by U.S. authorities, according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said U.S. drug makers are inspected about every two years,
but there are not enough agents to inspect foreign drug
manufacturers. He also said the agency's computer systems must be
updated to keep accurate records of those manufacturers, a process
he expects to be finished late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members pressed for a faster response and
Baker agreed to outline a plan for solving the problem and submit
it within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Internal FDA documents show the agency believed since 1996 that
tainted ingredients may have led to deaths of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been four years since this revelation was made at the
FDA,'' said Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C. ''How long should we have to
wait?''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 case involved generic prescription drugs manufactured
by Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. and used to treat epileptics.
According to the FDA, several epileptics died from seizures while
taking drugs tainted by counterfeit ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also found last year that 155 patients had adverse
reactions to drugs that used ingredients from a Chinese company.
The agency is investigating the matter.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Supporting WTO  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Trade Organization, the target of
violent protests last December in Seattle, won unanimous support
Thursday from a House committee as it rejected legislation to pull
the United States out of the governing body for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee voted 35-0 against the resolution
after the Clinton administration and both Democrats and Republicans
on the panel argued that such a step would be foolhardy way to
register objections to globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the world's largest importer and exporter, the United
States has benefited more than any other country from the WTO and
its framework of rules,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said in a statement thanking the committee for its
support.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the negative vote, the measure, which was introduced
in March by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, will still be debated by the
full House, something that could occur as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lizardo, a legislative aide to Paul, said that the lopsided
negative vote in committee was not a surprise given the pro-trade
leanings of the Ways and Means Committee. The measure has seven
House co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and his supporters are arguing that the United States
should withdraw from the 136-nation WTO, which is based in Geneva,
because its rulings in trade disputes represent an attack on U.S.
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the WTO also complain that the agency deliberates
in secret and has refused to take environmental concerns and worker
rights into consideration when setting trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1994 legislation that authorized U.S. membership in
the newly created WTO, Congress required the administration to
submit a report on the costs and benefits of WTO membership every
five years.
</P>
<P>
   After the report is filed, any member of Congress can sponsor a
joint resolution to withdraw U.S. membership and the proposal must
receive floor action regardless of any committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House last month approved 237-197 legislation normalizing
trade relations with China over determined opposition from labor
unions who feared that the step, part of a process to admit China
into the WTO, would subject more U.S. jobs to unfair competition
from low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on withdrawing the United States from the WTO is not
expected to attract the same intensity of debate on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is House Joint Resolution 90

<HEADLINE> Senate Bill Would Disclose Donors  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans battled legislation
Thursday that would force a new generation of secretive political
groups to disclose their donors and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., working with Senate Democrats, tried
to attach the measure to an unrelated defense spending bill, but
many of his fellow Republicans moved to kill it on technical
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''These organizations are the new stealth players in our
election system,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would force disclosure on groups that have
organized under the once-obscure section 527 of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was created in 1975 to establish tax rules for
political organizations, such as the national political parties and
political action committees. But unlike these new, sometimes
secretive groups, parties and PACs register with the Federal
Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new 527 groups tell the Internal Revenue Service that they
are political organizations, but they maintain that as far as the
FEC is concerned, they are engaged in issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   This allows them to run television ads praising or criticizing
candidates for office without saying anything about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This year's presidential and congressional campaigns have seen a
proliferation of these groups supporting both Democrats and
Republicans. Some are established groups, like the Sierra Club,
which almost always supports Democrats. Others pop up overnight,
like Shape the Debate, which has run ads critical of Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just when you think that our campaign system couldn't possibly
get any worse along comes the discovery of this new loophole,''
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ''Section 527 is the largest,
most disturbing, pernicious loophole in a system rife with backdoor
ways to influence government.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that the amendment would doom the underlying
legislation funding defense operations. The Constitution requires
tax bills to originate in the House, and opponents said that would
cover this measure because it changes the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense bill includes this provision, they said, the
House would refuse to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the
bottom of the sea,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee and a former secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a way around those arguments: remove the measure
from the defense bill if the other side agreed to attach it to the
next appropriate legislation. Opponents objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have just totally disclosed what this is all about,''
McCain responded. ''This is not about the defense of the nation.
This is the defense of a corrupt system.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argued that the measure should cover other
nonprofit organizations that engage in issue ads. Under current
law, they also are not required to name their donors. But unlike
527s, they must release their tax returns to the public and they
face limits on their political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to do it in a comprehensive way and not leave out
some of the major players on the American political scene,'' said
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents offered to consider a ''sense of the Senate''
resolution supporting disclosure. Backers dismissed that as
meaningless.

<HEADLINE> Lineman Pleads in Fla. Attack Case  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Star football recruit Jason Respert pleaded no contest to
trespassing and simple battery Thursday, without admitting he
fondled a woman in her apartment during a recruiting trip to the
University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Respert, 18, an offensive lineman at Northside High School in
Warner Robins, Ga., was placed on two years' supervised probation
for the misdemeanor pleas after appearing in Circuit Court in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   He will serve 40 hours of community service. He also agreed to
be interviewed to determine whether he needs counseling.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jan. 29 incident, the universities of Georgia and
Florida rescinded their scholarship offers. Tennessee reportedly
still plans to offer him a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, we'll know next week,'' said Respert's attorney,
Virgil Adams. ''He has applied for school there. The application is
being processed.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Bill Cervone said the plea agreement was typical for
a first-time offender.
</P>
<P>
   ''The probation gives him a chance to prove it was an isolated
incident, as opposed to a deep-seeded problem,'' Cervone said.
''Now, what happens between him and Tennessee is between him and
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A police report said Respert, a Florida player and another
recruit wound up at the woman's Gainesville apartment early on the
morning of Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Respert went into the woman's bedroom,
pulled down the covers, pulled up her pajama top and put his hand
down her pajama bottoms. He left the room when the woman woke up
and called police.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with attempted sexual battery and burglary,
charges that could have brought up to 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors agreed to a plea in part because of the various
testimonials they received about Respert's character, his ties to
the community and his success in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone saw that this was a mistake by a young man,''
Adams said. ''They considered everything in his background, the
volunteer work he's done, the fact he graduated with honors.''
</P>
<P>
   Respert graduated in the top 10 percent of his class with a 3.6
grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   He made his court appearance flanked by his high school football
coach, Conrad Nix, and several other friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the plea gives him permission to return to
Gainesville ''for proper purpose only,'' which means he could come
back for the Tennessee-Florida game in 2001, Adams said.

<HEADLINE> Debt Reduction Measure Approved  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee, brushing aside warnings of
a possible threat to U.S. credit, approved legislation Thursday
that would set aside extra surplus dollars to pay down public debt
and lower the government's debt limit.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Democratic leaders, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said reducing the debt ceiling -- currently $5.95 trillion --
could restrict the government's abilities to meet its obligations
in future years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could be permanent damage to our credit rating,''
Summers said. ''That credit standing is a precious asset of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House Ways and Means Committee brushed aside those
concerns, voting 35-3 for the measure, which next goes to the full
House. All three no votes were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky., would require
that any fiscal year 2000 non-Social Security surplus dollars above
the $24.4 billion estimated in March by the Congressional Budget
Office would go directly into a new account in the Treasury
Department. The debt ceiling would be lowered by an equal amount.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said
the intent was to prevent Congress from using the unforeseen
surplus to increase government spending. The updated surplus
projection for fiscal 2000 is likely to top $40 billion, perhaps
reaching $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either we tie the hands of Washington and stop it from
spending our money, or Washington will tie the hands of our
children and spend them further into debt,'' said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt now stands at $5.7 trillion, with $3.6
trillion owed to the public and $2.1 trillion owed to Social
Security and other trust funds. If surplus dollars aren't used for
tax cuts or spending, debt is automatically paid down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if the bill were to become law, Congress could easily
pass another law allowing the extra surplus money to be spent, said
Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, senior Democrat on the Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fine as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far,''
Rangel said. ''We can spend some money if we decide to spend some
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, said the law would put pressure on
lawmakers to restrain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes a very strong statement on the part of the Congress
that we are serious about paying down the debt,'' said Rep. Jim
McCrery, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4601.

<HEADLINE> Plot thickens: Second killer pleads, implicates rabbi  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP)- A man who helped kill a rabbi's wife admitted
it Thursday, becoming the second to implicate the rabbi in an
alleged murder-for-hire scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M. Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken pleaded guilty to aggravated
manslaughter and robbery and told a judge that he bludgeoned Carol
Neulander to death in her home at the request of Leonard Jenoff,
who he said was hired by Rabbi Fred Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   But Neulander's lawyers, who continued to deny his involvement,
said details of the slaying given in court by Daniels don't jibe
with physical evidence from the crime scene. They said they would
vigorously challenge the credibility of both Daniels and Jenoff at
Neulander's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Neulander hired Jenoff for $30,000 to kill his
wife so he could carry on an extramarital affair with Philadelphia
radio host Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Neulander, 52, was beaten to death in her home Nov. 1,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander was charged in 1998, but Daniels and Jenoff weren't
implicated until Jenoff made a stunning confession to a newspaper
reporter in April, saying he could no longer live with the guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Daniels entered his plea as the Neulanders'
son, Matthew, and other relatives looked on from the gallery. Under
the plea, Daniels faces 10 to 50 years in prison but could get out
in as little as one year, 11 months if he gets the minimum term.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the original murder charge, he could have faced
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Craig Mitnick, described Daniels as a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic who had been sexually and psychologically
abused by his father as a child and had endured alcohol and drug
addiction as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   He looked up to Jenoff as a father or uncle and was easily
manipulated by him, Mitnick said. Daniels twice tried to kill
himself in the years between the killing and his arrest, Mitnick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was severely manipulated six years ago, and it ended him in
an orange jumpsuit,'' Mitnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Shackled at the waist and wearing the standard-issue orange
Camden County Correctional Center outfit, a medicated Daniels
slurred his words slightly as he responded to questions about the
killing posed by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   He told Superior Court Judge Linda Rosenzweig he was under the
influence of three medications - one for depression, one to treat
hallucinations and another to relax him - but that he understood
why he was in court and was not impaired. ''It has no impact. I'm
fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist had examined Daniels and found him competent to
enter the plea, Mitnick told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said he was sober when he and Jenoff entered the home to
kill Mrs. Neulander. Jenoff entered first and signaled to him come
inside, Daniels said. When he did, he found Mrs. Neulander already
on the floor, having been struck by Jenoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit her three times,'' he said. Asked about the weapon, he
said: ''It was a long pole. Like metal.'' He described it as being
2 to 3 feet long and said he hit Mrs. Neulander in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The two stole $50 from Neulander's purse before leaving, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was a mirror image of one held a week before in the
same courtroom, before the same judge. In that hearing, Jenoff, 54,
of Collingswood, admitted killing the rabbi's wife of 29 years at
Neulander's request.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, could be released in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is certainly not a slap on the wrist,'' said Assistant
Camden County Prosecutor James P. Lynch. Daniels could face a
substantial prison term.
</P>
<P>
   His sentencing, and that of Jenoff, has been delayed until after
Neulander's trial. No date has been set for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old Neulander, who with his wife founded
Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue, could face the death penalty.
Lynch said, however, no decision has been made on whether to seek
it.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't present in court for the hearing, but his lawyers
were. Afterward, Jeffrey Zucker and Dennis Wixted ripped Daniels
and said his story continues to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''No surprises, except for the fact there's about a million
inconsistencies in what he said in his statement and what he said
today,'' said Zucker.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zucker, an autopsy showed Mrs. Neulander's blows
were to the back of the head, not the face; at first, Daniels
denied being armed, then said he had a 6-inch dumbbell-type pipe,
Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels' plea to robbery bolsters what Neulander's lawyers have
said all along - that the killing occurred during a robbery that
Neulander had nothing to do with, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he was satisfied with the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this plea agreement is another step towards total
justice in this case,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge imposes light sentence based on rape, abuse  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) - After an emotional two-hour hearing, a judge
spared a woman a long prison sentence for setting the fire that
killed her son, saying he believed she was beaten and raped by the
13-year-old autistic boy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 20-year prison term sought by prosecutors,
Michelle Davis was sentenced to six years for setting fire to her
house while her son, Daniel Leubner, slept inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''A picture emerges here of an individual overwhelmed by
circumstances and a tragic act takes place,'' said Cayuga County
Judge Peter E. Corning.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney James Vargason asked for the harsher penalty,
claiming her allegations of abuse and rape were unsubstantiated and
nothing more than a ''compelling excuse, something hideous to seek
sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 37, faced a maximum of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors considered bringing death penalty charges against
Davis but allowed her to plead guilty in March to first-degree
manslaughter and use an ''affirmative defense,'' which holds that
she suffered from ''extreme emotional disturbance'' the night of
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted using a candle and nail polish remover to start a
fire in her Fleming home last Sept. 4, killing the boy. She told
police she killed her son to protect her two daughters after Daniel
raped her.
</P>
<P>
   During his remarks Thursday, Vargason said although there was
evidence that Daniel was violent on occasion, he maintained there
were no physical facts to support Davis' allegations of rape.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the testimony of two medical experts who testified
at an earlier hearing that Davis suffered from post-rape syndrome
and post-traumatic stress syndrome. That was the reason she waited
three weeks to report the rape, experts said. Davis reported the
rape after she had failed a lie detector test given by state
police.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor defended Daniel, saying he ''wasn't the monster
some would want this court to believe.'' Vargason noted that the
boy was asleep and not an immediate danger to anyone at the time he
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a selfish act,'' he said. ''She considered him an
obstacle to living a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vargason made his case for a long prison term, Davis sat at
the defense table shaking her head ''no'' to each accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney David Elkovitch presented a different portrait
of Daniel and Michelle Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He described the great lengths that Davis went to caring for her
son, even as the 5-foot-7, 180-pound youth became increasingly more
violent and interested in sex.
</P>
<P>
   He presented Corning with social services reports that assessed
Davis as a ''nurturing, loving and devoted'' mother. He also
presented letters from Daniel's teachers and aides who described
the type of growing aggression Daniel exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Daniel threw a chair at a teacher and gave her a
concussion, the letters said. There were other repeated incidents
of kicking, head-butting, slapping, punching and biting. The
letters also told how Daniel grabbed the breasts of female
employees at school and tried to have sexual contact with both
female and male classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Elkovitch said Davis was left to deal with her autistic son on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's biological father, LeRoy Leubner, divorced Davis 10
years ago and only saw his children a handful of times over a
period of four years, Elkovitch said. Just two days before the
fire, Davis separated from her second husband, who had been able to
control Daniel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elkovitch ended by playing an uncensored tape recording of a
police dispatcher talking to Davis in January 1999 while her son
assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must walk for years in Michelle Davis' shoes to understand
what she endured,'' Elkovitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, too, told Corning about the hardships she faced raising
her son. Shaking uncontrollably as she read her statement, she
denied concocting the rape story to gain leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was never my attention to expose or exploit Daniel's
abusive behavior ... what mother would,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she allowed Daniel to beat her when he became upset
so he would not hurt his sisters. The beatings, she said, became
part of his ''autistic routines.'' She said she never reported the
abuse because she did not want authorities to take Daniel from her
and institutionalize him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved him with all my heart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Corning also heard emotional statements from LeRoy Leubner, who
sought the maximum for his ex-wife, and Melissa Leubner, who made a
plea for mercy for her mother.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Tries To Curb HMO Closures  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is offering to
reduce paperwork and regulations for HMOs as more of the private
health plans announce intentions to close their doors to Medicare
beneficiaries next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you begin to make final decisions about benefits and
premiums for your (Medicare) products in the next contract year, I
am providing you with ... background on improvements we are making
to the program,'' Medicare administrator Nancy Ann DeParle said in
a letter sent Thursday to health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The health plans must tell Medicare by July 3 whether they will
participate in the program in 2001. Industry officials are
predicting a third year of widespread closings affecting hundreds
of thousands of elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurer, has
said it plans to close Medicare HMOs in as-yet-undisclosed areas.
Also, Cigna HealthCare has announced it will shut down HMOs for the
elderly in a dozen cities, from Baltimore to Los Angeles, affecting
104,000 enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle's letter ''is a signal from the administration that more
needs to done to stop the tide of plans leaving the program,'' said
Dean Rosen, senior vice president for the Health Insurance
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''My sense is it's not going to radically change
minds in the short term. ... I think there needs to be a
congressional signal in terms of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries who lose their HMOs do not lose health
coverage. But they must find another HMO, which may mean having to
switch doctors, or else return to submitting medical bills directly
to Medicare, losing the extra benefits many HMOs offer.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle noted in her letter that it would take congressional
action to grant HMOs' requests for more money. But she said she is
''committed to using the flexibility available under the law to
streamline requirements for participation by health plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers are troubled by continued HMO pullouts from
Medicare and Congress is likely to consider whether to increase
payments later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, DeParle said Medicare would give HMOs more
flexibility in marketing and drawing up contracts with doctors next
year.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle also said that HMOs' 2001 contracts would include ''an
assurance that no regulations or policies which create significant
new operational costs will become effective prior to Jan. 1,
2002,'' except if required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays HMOs a fixed monthly fee to provide all needed
care, and lawmakers have had high hopes that they would save the
program money.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens flocked to HMOs in the mid-1990s, partly because
many offered extras such as prescription drug coverage, which
Medicare normally does not cover. Enrollment growth has slowed to a
trickle of less than one percent so far this year, however,
according to HIAA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress curbed annual increases in HMO fees as part of
legislation to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, HMOs had started pulling out of Medicare, saying
payments weren't keeping up with inflation and they could no longer
afford to participate. Many that stayed scaled back extra benefits
or raised co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus continued this year, and in total, more than 700,000
Medicare beneficiaries lost HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare says that of its 39 million beneficiaries, 27 million
have an HMO open to them and 6.5 million are enrolled in one.

<HEADLINE> Death-penalty trial goes to jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A jury is weighing the life-or-death fate
of a man accused of killing a 14-year-old boy and his 2-year-old
nephew during a bungled robbery at a family residence.
</P>
<P>
   After 3 1/2 weeks of testimony, deliberations got under way
Thursday afternoon in the death-penalty trial of Jose Julian
Santiago, 25, who is accused of shooting dead Zyrone Scrivens and
his toddler nephew, Drequan.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed a mistrial request, ruling that prosecutor
Richard Keenan did not intend to seek a response from a juror
during closing arguments Wednesday when he looked at her and said,
''This defendant is not like you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the juror replied ''No,'' the defense immediately claimed
prosecutorial misconduct and argued the juror had formed an opinion
about Santiago and could no longer be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago also allegedly shot and stabbed the older boy's mother,
Bernetta Wims, 36, and her two daughters - Shuntavia Scrivens, 19,
who was Drequan's mother, and Chaquita Scrivens, 16. The women
survived, and all identified Santiago as their attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with first-degree and second-degree murder, Santiago is
the second person to stand trial for his life in Rochester since
New York restored the death penalty in 1995. Angel Mateo was sent
to death row last year for abducting and executing a mentally ill
man during a frenzied hunt for his estranged girlfriend in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that the case hinged largely on witness
testimony and that genetic and fingerprint evidence pointed to an
unidentified killer other than Santiago. Wims testified that she
freed herself after Santiago left her for dead and flagged down a
patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Police allege that Santiago, who was captured soon afterward,
confessed to the execution-style murders. They say he had known the
family for several months and that the weapon, a .22-caliber
semiautomatic pistol, was found hidden in a dog house at his house
a block away.
</P>
<P>
   The family said Santiago talked about being depressed and having
no money during a visit to their home the night of March 1, 1999.
They said he then grabbed some jewelry, demanded cash and turned
violent when Wims pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago pleaded guilty in Syracuse in 1998 to possessing crack
cocaine and was on probation when he was charged with the killings.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Expand GI Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to expand the GI Bill as a tool
to keep military personnel in the service, the Senate on Thursday
approved a measure allowing such service members to transfer unused
educational stipends to spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment to the defense authorization bill proposed by Sen.
Max Cleland, D-Ga., is an attempt to keep key workers who might
otherwise be tempted to leave the armed services for higher-paying
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved it by voice vote. The House rejected a
similar proposal last year, but Cleland believes he might have the
votes this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've increased pay, increased retirement benefits, but we
need to use the GI Bill as a retention tool,'' Cleland said. ''What
is happening now is that the military is basically married, so when
these careerists get to that eight- to 10-year mark, they don't
need the benefits anymore. We need to recruit a soldier but retain
a family.''
</P>
<P>
   More tricky will be securing money for an across-the-board
program, which Cleland also advocates. According to the
Congressional Budget Office, it would cost an estimated $9 billion
over 10 years -- almost a doubling of the program's current cost.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House passed a measure to increase benefits
under the GI Bill, the longtime federal law that pays veterans'
college costs, from $536 a month for a nine-month term to $600
beginning Oct. 1. The payment would rise to $720 a month in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cleland's measure, such benefits could be made available
to spouses and children once a military worker completes 10 years
of service. In addition, personnel who chose not to sign up for
free education upon enlisting in the armed services would be able
to do so later for a $1,500 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's proposal, which ran into funding problems,
this version allows the Pentagon to select which specific workers
could transfer their benefits. Supporters reason it's cheaper to
keep a pilot and help fund college education for a his or her
children than to train a new pilot at $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   A committee staffer for Veterans Affairs Chairman Bob Stump,
R-Ariz., said the changes make it more likely Stump and the full
House will support it this time.

   ''The military wants the time and resources to do their jobs,
and they want their families taken care of,'' said Sheila McNeill,
national vice president of the Navy League. ''I think this would
send a message to our military families that would be very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland questioned the CBO funding numbers, which assume
virtually all military workers will require GI Bill benefits for
either themselves or family members. Currently, about 400,000
people-- or about half of the military -- use the stipends, even
though nearly all of them sign up for them.
</P>
<P>
   The GI Bill has existed in some form since 1944, when the United
States developed the program to benefit World War II veterans who
were returning home. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the
original bill, which gave veterans housing assistance, business
loans and a paid college education.
</P>
<P>
   The educational benefit has had many different names since, but
it was modernized as the Montgomery GI Bill in 1984 with the help
of then-Mississippi Rep. G.V. ''Sonny'' Montgomery.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Super Bowl Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Defense lawyers rested their case Thursday after
calling one witness in the trial of two men charged with murder in
the post-Super Bowl slayings of two Atlanta-area men.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, the attorney for defendant Reginald Oakley, also
asked Superior Court Judge Alice Bonner to instruct jurors to
consider an involuntary manslaughter charge for his client in
addition to the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner denied the request, saying no charge less than murder
would be considered. She sent jurors home early Thursday and told
them closing arguments would be on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The only defense witness was a security guard, Keven Brown, who
jumped into the brawl to try to end it. Brown's testimony was
followed by a short examination of a rebuttal witness called by
District Attorney Paul Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Bonner agreed with defense attorneys that
prosecutors had failed to present evidence showing that Oakley and
co-defendant Joseph Sweeting were involved in both slayings. The
ruling means each defendant still faces one murder count.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not evidence from which a rational jury could
conclude that each of these defendants participated in the crimes
for which I've granted the motions,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was originally charged
along with Sweeting and Oakley in the slayings of Jacinth Baker and
Richard Lollar, who were stabbed to death during a street brawl
after a post-Super Bowl party Jan. 31. But Lewis pleaded guilty
Monday to misdemeanor obstruction of justice and testified Tuesday
against his two former co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting, of Miami, still faces a murder charge in the death of
Lollar. Oakley, of Baltimore, still faces murder charges in the
death of Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis testified Tuesday that he saw Sweeting and Oakley, friends
who were partying with him that night, fight with a group of men
that included Baker and Lollar. But he said the brawl was over so
quickly he couldn't tell if Sweeting or Oakley stabbed the victims.

<HEADLINE> Eminem Charged With Weapons Counts  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) -- Best-selling rapper Eminem was charged
with more weapons counts Thursday, this time for allegedly
brandishing a gun in a confrontation with a member of the rival
group Insane Clown Posse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is probably good publicity for him,'' Oakland
County Prosecutor David Gorcyca said. ''The mantra for a rapper is
to be a tough guy. Maybe among those in the rapper world, this
might be a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem publicist Paul Rosenberg rejected that claim as
''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't rewrite history,'' Rosenberg said after Eminem's
arraignment Thursday on the latest charges. ''But I'm sure he
wishes what happened Saturday night and Sunday morning never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest accusations came a day after the 27-year-old Grammy
winner, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, was charged
with carrying a concealed weapon and assault with a deadly weapon,
both felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges relate to a fight that broke out early Sunday
after Eminem allegedly saw another man kissing his wife, Kimberly
Mathers, 25, outside a nightclub in Warren, a Detroit suburb.
Prosecutors said Eminem hit the man over the head with an unloaded
gun.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new charges, Eminem also got in a dispute
Saturday with Douglas Dail of Insane Clown Posse outside a stereo
shop in Royal Oak.
</P>
<P>
   Gorcyca said Eminem and Dail exchanged words before Eminem
stepped from his car and pulled a pistol. Eminem did not point the
gun directly at Dail but threatened him, Gorcyca said.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem was charged with felony possession of a concealed weapon
and misdemeanor brandishing of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned Thursday by police, Eminem admitted displaying
the gun, which he said was unloaded, Kowolski said during Eminem's
arraignment later that day. For reasons unclear, the prosecutor
said, Dail has recanted his initial statement to police and
''refuses to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem later Thursday was freed after posting $1,000 of his
$10,000 bond and was driven off in a sport utility vehicle, waving
once to a handful of young, mostly female fans who screamed as he
sped away.
</P>
<P>
   The concealed weapons counts each carry up to five years behind
bars. The assault count could bring up to four years in prison,
while the firearm-brandishing misdemeanor carries up to 90 days in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's lawyer, Howard Hertz, said he believes his client will
be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that and believe that we will be able to favorably
resolve this serious matter, and Eminem looks forward to leaving on
his tour and resolving all of these matters in a very brief period
of time,'' Hertz said.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment in Warren on Wednesday, the rapper was freed
after posting 10 percent of his $100,000 bond and was allowed to go
on tour.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Eminem won a Grammy in the best rap album category
for his debut release, ''The Slim Shady LP,'' and another Grammy in
the best rap solo performance category for the album's hit single
''My Name Is.''

<HEADLINE> House Bill Would Cut Clinton Plans  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a promised veto, Republicans began
pushing a $339.5 billion measure through the House on Thursday that
would shave many of President Clinton's plans for schools, job
training and child care.
</P>
<P>
   With elections for control of the White House and Congress just
five months away, the mammoth bill -- the biggest of the 13 annual
spending measures -- has become a furious political battleground.
One fight, pitting labor against business, was over a provision
that would block federal rules aimed at preventing workplace
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The overall measure would boost spending for many education,
health and other programs over this year's levels, a move
Republicans hope will shelter them from Democratic attacks. For
example, the Education Department would get $39.6 billion, $1.6
billion more than this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Democrats focused on the GOP's reductions in Clinton's
proposals, including the $2.9 billion less than Clinton wants that
the Department of Education would get. And they contrasted that
with the 10-year, $105 billion cut in taxes on large estates that
Republicans planned to muscle through the House on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This vote, more than any other vote, defines the differences
between the two parties,'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said of the
spending bill. ''It tells us what your values are. It tells us
whose side you're on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This does define the differences between the two parties,''
countered Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., the bill's chief author.
''We're responsible for the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure contained language by Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., that
would block the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from
issuing final ergonomics rules that would require employers to take
steps to prevent injuries to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, labor lobbyists were hoping to avoid a vote
on removing the provision for fear that the effort would lose, said
union and Democratic officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
They believe they would have a better chance to kill the language
in negotiations on a final bill between the House and the Senate,
where opposition is stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, said he was ready to try to
remove the language anyway to ''help many of the concerns many
working people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Traficant's Rust Belt district has a strong organized labor
presence. But he has also battled openly with top Democrats since
earlier this year, when he accused party leaders of trying to
unseat him in his primary. Democratic leaders have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also strongly opposes the provision
that would block the ergonomics rules. Because of that, the rules
seem likely to take effect, but labor wants to prevent any
legislative momentum from building up to block them.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, in the works for nearly a decade, would cover 1.6
million employers when they are issued, which OSHA hopes will be by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency says the requirements are aimed at protecting the 1.8
million American workers who suffer musculoskeletal injuries
annually, 600,000 of whom end up missing work days.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA says the rules would cost business $4.7 billion a year to
implement, but reap $10 billion a year in savings from medical
expenses and workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Various business groups, however, have said the costs to
companies would be tens of billions of dollars in reduced
production and for training and new equipment. They say the rules
are based on insufficient scientific evidence.

<HEADLINE> Englishman Coles Leads Welsh Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, Wales (AP) -- Lightly regarded Robert Coles fired iron
shots close to the pins and matched his lifetime-best 64 Thursday
for a three-shot lead in the first round of the inaugural Welsh
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, a 27-year-old Englishman blistered the hilly, 7,324-yard
Wentworth Course at the Celtic Manor Resort. Mark James, the 1999
European Ryder Cup captain, Englishman Iain Pyman and Ivo Giner of
Spain were tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   Another shot back after 68s were local favorite Ian Woosnam,
Englishman Ian Garbutt and Anders Hansen of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where that came from. The last few weeks I really
haven't played or putted very well,'' said Coles, who also shot 64
in the 1997 Dutch Open at Hilversum, when par was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a 40-foot putt across the 12th green and a 12-footer
a hole earlier, none of Coles' birdies came on putts of more than 8
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried to think about what I was doing a few weeks ago
when I was playing well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, who has never played in a major event, has had his
problems in the past and his highest finish on the European money
list was 111th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his playing card in 1998 and was involved in a car crash
just before the tour school late that year, fracturing two ribs,
which forced him out of the qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he returned to the school and, despite just having his
wisdom teeth removed, qualified 19th to return to the tour full
time this year.
</P>
<P>
   He has missed seven cuts in 13 events including his last three,
with a best finish of tied 17th at the Rio de Janeiro 500 Years
Open in April.
</P>
<P>
   James toured the tougher back nine, where several long holes are
uphill, in 5-under 31, the best score of the day. ''I didn't start
great but I gradually got better and better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pyman birdied the last three holes for his 67 while Giner also
birdied the last.
</P>
<P>
   Woosnam's 68 had just one bogey, at the uphill 15th where he
missed the green with an 169-yard, 4-iron approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit it as good as I can and came up short,'' said the
Welshman, who knows the course better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Seve Ballesteros suffered more misfortune after missing
seven cuts in nine previous events. He was forced to withdraw after
eight holes with an injury to his back and right hip that left him
without power in his right leg.

<HEADLINE> Case Against Suharto Said Strong  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Indonesia's top legal officer says he is
confident of building a solid corruption case against former
Indonesian leader Suharto by midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Marzuki Darusman says he's also concerned
that Suharto's failing health could make it difficult to bring him
to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we present an open and shut case, it narrows the chances of
a misruling,'' Darusman said in an interview with The Associated
Press on Wednesday night. ''I don't think the courts want to take
the risk of being blamed by the public, which expects an
indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, the once all-powerful ruler of Indonesia, turned 79
Thursday at his home in central Jakarta, where he is under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and defense lawyers claim a series of strokes
have left him weak and sometimes incoherent, with dangerously high
blood pressure and mental blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorneys, the autocrat, who ruled Indonesia with an
iron fist for 32 years until riots forced him from office in 1998,
continually denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Suharto is the top suspect in a scandal involving the misuse
of millions of dollars by several charitable foundations controlled
by his family during his reign.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's current president, Abdurrahman Wahid, has said he is
willing to pardon Suharto if he returns any ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said the case is an important step in the country's
difficult and sometimes violent transition toward democracy. Prior
to Wahid's election last year, the nation had not held a
free-and-fair national election since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is crucial. It's the only way that we can draw the
line over the past and settle the matter,'' Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman, the former leader of Indonesia's National Commission
on Human Rights, said it would probably take years to bring past
human rights violations in the country to trial, and that a
commission for reconciliation may have to be set up to handle the
cases.
</P>
<P>
   His office also is investigating disgraced former army chief
Gen. Wiranto, one of several officials accused of being responsible
for last year's campaign of terror in East Timor. Pro-Jakarta
militias and Indonesian army soldiers went on a rampage on the
island after it voted for independence in August.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Oversee Cell Phone Safety  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to settle whether there really are any
health risks from cellular phones, the Food and Drug Administration
negotiated an unusual partnership with the phone industry Thursday
to perform about $1 million worth of scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public concern that cell phones might cause cancer or
other problems, there is no evidence yet that radiation from the
hugely popular phones poses a significant health risk, FDA
scientists stressed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But nor is there proof that cell phones are totally risk-free,
the FDA cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month advisers to the British government recommended
that children be discouraged from using cell phones for
nonessential calls, because they could not rule out the possibility
that scientists one day might discover long-term use is harmful. If
harm ever is discovered, the British panel theorized children could
be more vulnerable because their nervous systems are still
developing.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few studies that suggest the radio waves emitted by
cell phone antennas might cause certain biological effects. With 80
million Americans using cell phones, and more buying them each day,
uncovering even a small risk could be important to public health.
</P>
<P>
   So the FDA, which oversees the safety of radiation-emitting
consumer products, hopes its new research collaboration with the
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association will sort out the
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of scientific evidence shows that there is
no public health concern from people using wireless phones,'' said
CTIA spokesman Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''there are some conflicting pieces of information'' that
require more research, said Harvey Rudolph, deputy director of
FDA's Office of Science and Technology. ''Everybody wants to find
out if there are any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, CTIA will fund about $1 million in safety
studies. But the FDA will gather a panel of international experts
to choose what to study, pick independent scientists to do the
work, and then oversee that the science is done properly.
</P>
<P>
   All the results must undergo standard scientific review for
publication in medical journals, so doctors and consumers can be
confident in the findings -- and confident that if studies uncover
any problem, it won't be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear industry is not controlling the research,'' Rudolph
stressed. ''The only thing they're doing is funding it.''
</P>
<P>
   First on the agenda: studies to see if cell phones' low-level
radiation is capable of causing genetic toxicity -- a key to certain
health problems -- and if so, at what levels. Not all cell phones
emit the same amount of radio waves. Rudolph said those key studies
will start ''as quickly as possible,'' and results could be
obtained in two years.
</P>
<P>
   A few animal studies have suggested that cell phones' low-level
radiation could accelerate cancer growth, and some research
suggests it also causes subtle alterations in signals from brain
cells.
</P>
<P>
   But those studies all have scientific flaws, and Rudolph noted
they're outnumbered by other studies suggesting cell phones are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Until the issue's settled, what should consumers think? First,
the one clear risk from cell phones is using them while driving,
which increases the risk of a car crash, Rudolph stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics urge reserving cell phones for shorter calls or
using earphones that keep the antenna away from the head. Says
Rudolph: ''These are prudent things that if you're concerned you
can do.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Interview for Bird's Job  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While lame duck Larry Bird coaches his final
games for the Indiana Pacers, Rick Carlisle and Byron Scott are
waiting in the wings to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana president Donnie Walsh said Thursday he has interviewed
Carlisle, a Pacers assistant, and Scott, a Sacramento Kings
assistant who played two seasons for Indiana, for the soon-to-be
vacant coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Bird has said he will step down at season's end after three
years, and Walsh believes that within a week of the NBA Finals
ending, Bird will let him know his future plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's not going to coach,'' Walsh said. ''At a certain
point, I didn't think he was going to come back in an
administrative role and then I did, and at that point I stopped
talking to him and I told him I'll wait until the end of the year
and we'll talk about it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, whose 14-year NBA career included three championships
with the Los Angeles Lakers, has Carlisle beat when it comes to
name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ''That could be a factor, but I can't worry about that,'' said
Carlisle, who played with Bird when the Boston Celtics won the 1986
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlisle, 40, has an edge when it comes to knowing Indiana's
players and system. He coordinates the offense on a staff in which
Bird delegates more than most head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an advantage,'' he said. ''I've learned an awful
lot about the job of being a head coach in this position, more than
I could have learned anywhere else under any other circumstances
and that has been a great benefit to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle has paid his dues during 12 years as an NBA assistant
in New Jersey and Portland along with Indiana for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''One advantage he's got is he knows our team,'' Walsh said.
''He knows its strengths and weaknesses, so in a way he could hit
the ground running.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Walsh called Scott ''a tremendous
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pacers are in the Finals, the Kings on Wednesday
extended the deadline that allows the Pacers to talk to Scott. The
original negotiation period ended June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 39, joined Sacramento's staff in 1998. The former
shooting guard's duties include scouting, reviewing offensive game
plans, and working with perimeter players.
</P>
<P>
   ''Byron is a great leader and Byron is a guy that has been to
the top of the mountain and knows exactly why he got there, and
that's through hard work,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he had a dramatic effect on our team when he played.
When he was a player, we often talked about his desire to go into
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh could hire a new coach now and have him on hand when the
Finals end.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't do it out of respect to the situation right now,''
he said. ''It's going to be a tough decision on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle has been living with Bird's decision not to return as
coach for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been hard for everybody,'' he said. ''It's been tough on
the coaches at times.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carlisle might improve his own chances to take over if the
Pacers beat the Lakers in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just really believe that the better we do, the more we win,
the more we can help our players achieve this goal, the more it's
going to help all of us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Portland St. Out of Stadium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Renovations at Civic Stadium will force
Portland State to play its home games next season at the much
smaller Hillsboro Stadium in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Civic Stadium, which seats about 30,000, is being spruced up to
house a AAA baseball franchise moving to Portland from Albuquerque,
N.M. Structural reports showing a need for more seismic support on
the stadium's north side have caused delays in the $37 million
project.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsboro Stadium seats 4,000, although additional seating to be
added this summer will bring the capacity to a little more than
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The move wasn't made official until Wednesday, and the
uncertainty over the renovation cost the Vikings a home game
against Grambling State, with Grambling's athletic department
asking in March that the game be rescheduled for 2001. There also
is the issue of expanding concessions, adding restrooms and parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The move to a smaller facility is a disappointing one for a
fledging program trying to make the transition from Division II to
Division I-AA. The Vikings are coming off their first winning
season since moving up in 1996, and many starters are returning.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Vikings haven't played in a different home stadium
since 1967, when they played a home game at a high school, and they
were 5-0 in Civic Stadium last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like being in a major renovation in your home and you're
out of it for nine months and you come back and, hopefully, it's
done the way you like it to be done,'' Vikings coach Tim Walsh
said. ''Sometimes you have to pay the price to get something a
little bit nicer, so we're excited about getting back (to Civic
Stadium) in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are marketing concerns for Portland State. Usually,
the school mails ticket information in March, but that was delayed
because of the renovation uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Portland State has a season-ticket base of about 2,700.
Associate athletic director Brent Wilder said he has not faced any
major problems with ticket-holders but has meetings scheduled to
explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh also said the temporary move would not affect recruiting
and the renovation would be a major recruiting tool in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there will be some school who will try to use it
against us,'' Walsh said. ''But if we get the facility that we're
supposed to get, then they're going to be fighting a losing
proposition.''

<HEADLINE> Low-Power FM Radio Pushed For  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a setting more like MTV Unplugged than a
Capitol Hill news conference, the folk duo Indigo Girls used their
music to encourage lawmakers to allow more FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission ordered
the creation of hundreds of low-power mini-radio stations to give
local community groups, churches and schools more access to the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But the House has passed legislation that would scale back the
FCC's action. And a bill pending in the Senate, sponsored by Sen.
Judd Gregg, R-N.H., would reverse the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Indigo Girls, who appeared Thursday with Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.; Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and others at
a news conference, said the low-power stations would inject
diversity into monochromatic airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Ray said when the Indigo Girls started out in 1985, radio
was full of independent voices and myriad musical choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we don't enjoy that much commercial support at all,'' she
said. ''It's really because the way radio is set up now, if you're
in, you're in, and if you're out, you're out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We fight the big guys wherever we can,'' said fellow Indigo
Girl Emily Saliers.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting the low-power theme, they played two songs with an
acoustic banjo and mandolin: ''Get Out the Map,'' and ''Ozilline.''
Dozens of mostly young female congressional staffers whooped in
delight.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters opposes the low-power
stations, saying they would add unacceptable interference on
already overcrowded radio bands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers at Thursday's event called the broadcasters' argument
a transparent attempt to stifle any new choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of interference has been greatly exaggerated by
people afraid of a little competition,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others took particular aim at National Public Radio,
which says the FCC has not resolved interference issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''NPR has just sort of forgotten their roots,'' Kerrey said. He
said that when he signed public radio into law as governor of
Nebraska, commercial radio stations made the same arguments NPR is
making today.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain promised to ''do our best to carry your message,''
he has introduced a bill that has low-power advocates worried. It
would allow full-power radio stations to sue low-power stations
that interfere with their signals, with the burden of proof on the
low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions could scare away potential low-power operators,
said Cheryl Leanza, deputy director of Media Access Project, a
public interest law firm in Washington that helped put together the
news conference.

<HEADLINE> CBS Has a Hit With 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS's ''Survivor'' is fast becoming a summer
television phenomenon, with the cutthroat band of tropical island
dwellers beating ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' in the ratings
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled in the manner that viewers have responded to
the show,'' CBS spokesman Chris Ender said, ''and beating
'Millionaire' makes it that much sweeter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire,'' hosted by Regis Philbin, was last summer's
phenomenon. ''Survivor'' beat it in the Wednesday night ratings in
only its second week on the air.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives were miffed that ABC, at the last minute,
scheduled episodes of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' opposite
''Survivor'' for the first two weeks of the heavily hyped summer
reality series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' averaged 18.1 million viewers on Wednesday night,
compared with 15.5 million for ''Millionaire,'' Nielsen Media
Research said Thursday. Last week, Philbin's game show beat
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last half of the show, when a ''tribal council'' vote
sent retired contractor B.B. Andersen of Mission Hills, Kan., home
to reduce their ranks to 14, the viewership jumped to 19.4 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is also elated that ''Survivor'' is drawing a much younger
audience than its typical fare. Among viewers aged 18-34,
''Survivor'' had more than twice the viewers of ''Millionaire,''
Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' also drew more viewers Wednesday than the first
game of the National Basketball Association finals between the Los
Angeles Lakers and the Indiana Pacers, and a Britney Spears concert
special.
</P>
<P>
   '''Survivor' is the event of the summer and even the power of
Regis cannot beat it,'' said Marc Berman, a television analyst for
Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said ABC had severely miscalculated by scheduling
''Millionaire'' against ''Survivor.'' Now the game show looks
vulnerable and is in danger of burning out, he said. The viewership
for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on Wednesday was a little
more than half what it was during its peak this season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokesman Kevin Brockman said the network had no regrets
about using the game show against ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job is to bring as many viewers to ABC as possible,''
Kevin Brockman said. ''That's why we utilized these additional
'Millionaires' as strategically as we could. Kudos to CBS, but the
reality is 'Millionaire' is a proven performer that consistently
delivers a huge audience several times a week to ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' meanwhile, is a stunt instead of a long-lasting
series, he said. ''It's a good stunt, but it's a stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC has no further plans to schedule special editions of ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' opposite ''Survivor,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senator: Greece Lax on Terrorism  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee accused Greece of being too lax in dealing with a
terrorist group suspected in Thursday's assassination of a British
defense attache.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've long been distressed by the failure of the Greek
government to deal with this group,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., referring to the terrorist group November 17.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby spoke as his committee considered recent recommendations
by a congressionally appointed advisory panel on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby called the gunning down of Brig. Stephen Saunders, the
defense attache in the British Embassy, while he drove to a meeting
to discuss possible tank sales to Greece, ''a cowardly
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   Among recommendations by the National Commission on Terrorism:
that Greece and Pakistan be designated by the government in a new
category as ''not cooperating fully'' against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   That is one step away from being placed on the State
Department's list of nations that sponsor terrorism. There are
seven nations on that list: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North
Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bremer, the commission's chairman and the former top State
Department counterterrorism official, said in testimony to the
committee that, since 1975, terrorists have attacked Americans or
American interests in Greece 146 times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greek officials have been unable to solve 145 of those cases.
And just this morning, terrorists struck again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But commission member Jane Harmon, a former Democratic House
member from California, told the intelligence panel, ''I hope this
will be an opportunity for the Greek government to crack down on
that particular group.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope our NATO ally, Greece, would not be one we would single
out in the future'' for any designation involving terrorism, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer, the commission chairman, said that Iran ''is still the
most egregious state sponsor of terrorism, despite the election of
a reformist president.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether any of the seven nations on the
state-sponsored terrorism list had reduced their support for
terrorism. Bremer said one had: Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Opposing Views of Subway Series  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the World Series champion Yankees, the
Subway Series is mostly a nuisance, filled with incessant ticket
requests and media hype.
</P>
<P>
   For the upstart Mets, a meeting with their crosstown rivals
provides a test, a break to the monotony of the 162-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the electricity and excitement and tension that closely
compares to the playoffs,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips
said Thursday, on the eve of the fifth interleague series between
the teams. ''You have pressure at-bats and plays more than in an
everyday game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it. It's good for baseball and very good for baseball
in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre, who grew up in New York when there
was an October Subway Series almost every year, has a different
view.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to the three games against the Mets
because the quicker it gets here, the quicker it'll be over with,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees have won three World Series titles in four
years, the Mets are the underdogs in their own city and their
division. Atlanta has won the last five NL East titles and knocked
out the Mets two games shy of a Subway Series last October.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why they relish these games so much.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good test for us to see how we respond to the extra
energy and the playoff atmosphere,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said.
''I think it's a good time of the year for us because we do need
that adrenaline injection right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The past series have provided memorable moments: Dave Mlicki's
shutout win for the Mets in the first New York interleague game in
1997; the Mets ending Roger Clemens' AL-record 20-game winning
streak and their own eight-game losing streak last June; and Matt
Franco's pinch-hit single off Mariano Rivera that gave the Mets the
win last July in a game that featured five lead changes and seven
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those dramatic wins by the Mets, the Yankees own a 7-5
edge in interleague play and all those championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to beat them because they are the best team in
baseball,'' Piazza said. ''Until someone dethrones them they're the
world champions. Any time you get a chance to beat them, it gives
you confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that win against Clemens last June that sparked the Mets
in 1999. They entered the game with a 27-28 record, on their
longest losing streak of the season and had just fired three of
their coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In a tense pregame news conference, manager Bobby Valentine --
angry about the firings -- said he should be next to go if the team
didn't improve in the next 55 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then went out and beat Clemens, went 40-15 over the
next 55 games, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1988.
Not that it provided Valentine much job security.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips believes his team is even better this year as it
prepares to return to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''That team was not playing up to its capabilities,'' he said.
''We're not hitting on all cylinders yet this year, but we are not
at our darkest moment of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The opener of this year's series once again matches Clemens
(4-5) and Al Leiter (6-1). Andy Pettitte (5-2) will pitch for the
Yankees on Saturday against Bobby J. Jones (1-2), and ex-Met David
Cone (1-6) pitches the finale against Mike Hampton (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's back to the normal games until the Yankees go to Shea
Stadium for three more starting July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're out on the field at Yankee Stadium and it's a full
house, obviously that's fun,'' Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill
said. ''But all the other stuff that goes with it, we can do
without.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Announce Brownfields Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of wrangling, a bipartisan group
of senators has developed a plan to turn abandoned industrial lots
known as ''brownfields'' into space for condominiums, malls and
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The newly introduced bill would authorize $150 million per year
for fiscal years 2001 to 2005 for grants to local governments to
assess and clean up the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Brownfields are patches of land contaminated enough that
developers are unwilling to buy them, but not so polluted to be
eligible for cleanup under the Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   Cities suffer when these blighted areas are left untouched, said
Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., who spoke Thursday at a news
conference announcing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mayors don't like anything more than revenue and want the
life-sustaining revenue they could get from old industrial sites,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, a former mayor of Warwick, R.I., and chairman of the
Senate Environment and Public Works Superfund subcommittee,
estimates his tiny but heavily industrialized state has between 400
and 500 brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., estimated his state has about 100
brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a big-city, East Coast bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation aims to remove obstacles that have kept private
businesses from buying and restoring the land.
</P>
<P>
   The Superfund law, for example, allows the Environmental
Protection Agency to assess cleanups after they're over and insist
they be redone if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''New investors do not want to clean up the sites because they
fear the EPA will come in and second guess them,'' Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the EPA would only be allowed to step in
after completion of a cleanup in circumstances that presented an
imminent danger to a community.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is fear of liability for the contamination, the
senators said. The bill would provide protection for parties who
didn't contribute to the mess, including prospective buyers and
contiguous property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. and chairman of the Environment and
Public Works Committee, said he plans to get the bill out of
committee within the month and push for it to become law this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rioting Breaks Out in Nigeria  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Rioting brought Nigeria's commercial
capital to a standstill Thursday after last-ditch talks failed to
avert a nationwide strike touched off by a 50 percent hike in fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting youths in Lagos barricaded roads and attacked
commuter buses, halting traffic for several hours. Many people
abandoned their vehicles and made their way on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was similarly paralyzed in the southern cities of
Abeokuta, Ibadan and Benin City.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, offices and most banks were closed in major cities
across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. Airports also shut
down, Radio Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
   Trade union members barricaded the main office complex in the
capital, Abuja, and refused to let people enter. They were later
driven away by police.
</P>
<P>
   Armed police guarded Abuja's gas stations, which were closed in
the morning but opened in the afternoon, when long lines formed. In
Lagos, the gas stations stayed closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been the most successful strike action called by the
labor congress for quite some time,'' said Lekan Aderibigbe, a
Lagos school teacher. ''There is hardly any one in this city who
will say he was not affected by the strike in one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   However, oil production -- the country's economic mainstay -- was
not affected, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Production, loading of vessels and all other essential
services are going on uninterrupted,'' a spokesman for oil giant
Shell said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Government and labor leaders met throughout the night in Abuja,
but failed to reach agreement to avert the strike by Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford higher fuel prices,'' said Adams Oshimole,
president of the Nigeria Labor Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The NLC, a union umbrella group, has called for an indefinite
strike to protest the price hike, which increased the cost of gas
from about 76 cents to $1.15 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement Thursday afternoon said authorities were
prepared to reduce bring the cost of gas down to 95 cents per
gallon, but could not restore it to original levels.
</P>
<P>
   An exception was made for Kerosene, the main source of fuel for
Nigeria's rural poor, which could revert to its original price of
65 cents per gallon, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo says the government can no longer
afford the $2 billion annual subsidy required to keep fuel prices
down.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, which has a foreign debt of $30 billion, is also under
pressure from international lending institutions to deregulate and
reduce price subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders discussed the government's latest proposal with
their membership but rejected the offer, saying the strike would
continue until last week's decision was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the cost of major petroleum products prompted
violent protests Monday and Tuesday in Lagos and other cities
across southwestern Nigeria, which remains desperately poor despite
the country's status as the world's sixth-largest oil producer.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 144; Nasdaq Falls 14  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply
Thursday after Procter &AMP; Gamble surprised Wall Street with an
earnings warning and a management shakeup. The escalating blue chip
selloff spread to the rest of the market, leaving most stocks with
a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 144.14 to close at 10,668.72. Broader stock
indicators were also lower; the Nasdaq composite index fell 13.70
to 3,825.56 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.69 to 1,461.67.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled after Procter &AMP; Gamble officials said its fiscal
fourth-quarter core earnings should be even with last year's
levels. The consumer products maker had earlier predicted a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning followed a similar disappointment in
the last quarter. On Thursday, the company replaced chief executive
officer Durk Jager with Alan G. Lafley, president of its divisions
for global beauty care and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors made no secret of their frustration with the company's
latest bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on you if you disappoint once,'' said David Sowerby, a
vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''If you disappoint twice,
you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble shares fell $6.125 to $56.75, a 9.7 percent
loss. The broader consumer-goods sector sustained only modest
losses as investors speculated that Procter &AMP; Gamble's woes weren't
a sign of trouble for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh punishment for P&AMP;G indicated the market remains fairly
volatile, said Michael Strauss, managing director of Commonfund
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''When bad news comes out, the market still appears ready to
grab onto it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors continued a measured response to a federal
judge's order to break Microsoft Corp. in two. Microsoft shares
fell $1.688 to $68.813.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the judge's ruling came as little surprise and had
already been factored into Microsoft's stock price. A number of
Wall Street analysts defended the stock Thursday, reiterating
''buy'' ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of other technology stocks rose. Adobe Systems
rose $4.063 to $118.375 and LSI Logic rose $2.25 to $63.25.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell $2.438 to $35.25, adding to the Dow's decline. The
company backed off from a plan to increase long-distance rates.
Federal regulators had harshly criticized AT&AMP;T's plan, noting that
the company recently promised to reduce monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of a modest economic slowdown came from the
Labor Department, which reported that new claims for unemployment
benefits hit their highest level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the week ending June 3, the department said, 309,000
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits. Economists
cautioned that the weekly reading tends to be volatile, and many on
Wall Street were more concerned about the government's producer
price report, due out Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors are hoping for a gradual economic slowdown,
which could convince the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while a sense of burgeoning optimism has
pervaded Wall Street this week, investors are still showing signs
of nervousness over interest rates. Volume remained relatively
light, suggesting that many investors lack conviction, Strauss
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of volume is a sign that the market doesn't believe
that this is for real,'' he said. ''At this point, we know the
economy is probably not growing at the explosive rate it's been at,
but it may still be too heated for the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.03 billion shares,
compared with 1.02 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.88 to 514.54.

Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100

<HEADLINE> Study: HIV Began in 1930s Africa  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- AIDS evolved from a benign simian infection
into a human-killer in the early 1930s, long before it was
recognized as a disease, but it stayed in remote Africa until jet
travel, big cities and the sexual revolution spread it worldwide, a
new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers measuring the rate of genetic change in HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, found the current strains originated from a
common ancestor that first evolved from a simian virus in southwest
Africa between 1915 and 1941, with 1931 the most likely year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have been in humans even before that,'' said Tanmoy
Bhattachary, a researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in
Los Alamos, N.M. The study appears Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Bhattachary said the most common form of HIV worldwide evolved
from simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV, that was in the
chimpanzee. SIV genetically converted to HIV either while it was in
the chimp or after a human contracted SIV.
</P>
<P>
   The disease did not become a worldwide menace, he said, until
people left the isolated areas of Africa and carried the virus
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have evolved in humans and stayed in a very small
population, such as a village,'' said Bhattachary. ''That is
typically what most new diseases do. They are in an isolated
population and then something happens and it starts spreading all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings are consistent with earlier studies that suggested
that HIV originated early in this century and then was spread when
Africa became less isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Bhattachary said the date when SIV first evolved to HIV makes it
''very unlikely'' that a polio vaccination campaign in the late
1950s can be blamed for the rise of AIDS. Some researchers have
suggested that a polio vaccine made using chimpanzee kidney cells
could have transferred HIV into humans between 1957 and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new research could not eliminate that possibility
entirely, Bhattachary said, the fact that HIV originated before the
polio vaccine means ''you can probably discount that scenario''
</P>
<P>
   A type of AIDS virus called HIV2, which occurs mostly in Africa,
may have originated from sooty mangabeys, a type of African monkey,
the study says.
</P>
<P>
   But HIV1, the virus that has caused a pandemic, came from the
chimpanzee, a primate more closely related to humans.
</P>
<P>
   A form of HIV1 called Group M is the major virus spreading
throughout the world. It has infected about 50 million people and
killed 16 million. Bhattachary said Group M may have crossed over
from chimp to humans only once, or evolved from SIV in only one
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our study shows that the M group had a single origin,'' he
said. ''It could have come from one animal or from one human.''
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of HIV, he said, had ''multi-introductions.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common form HIV in the United States, called subgroup
B, first evolved between 1960 and 1971, with 1967 being the most
likely year, said Bhattachary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical symptoms of what later became known as AIDS were
reported in the United States in the late 1970s. AIDS was formally
diagnosed and named in 1981. The HIV1 virus was isolated and
confirmed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Moore, a microbiologist and AIDS researcher at Cornell
University in New York, said the study by Bhattachary and his
colleagues is ''outstanding and significant. They have looked into
this very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the findings emphasizes how science needs to be
concerned and alert to the risks of cross-species viral
transmissions, many of which are lethal or cause serious illness in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Another researcher, Jim Moore of the University of California,
San Diego, said the Los Alamos study is consistent with his
findings that conditions in colonial Africa were ripe, starting in
the late 19th century, for a new virus to take hold and spread.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial powers forced people out of villages, causing many to
live in the jungles, surviving by hunting and gathering, said
Moore, who is unrelated to the Cornell scientists. A major food was
meat from chimps and monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ''This created conditions ideal for the transfer (of a virus)
from chimps and a spread into small populations,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, large work gangs were organized to build roads
and mines, with some construction organizations promoting
prostitution to keep the isolated workers content. HIV is a
sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent decades, an age with easy transoceanic travel and
the sexual revolution, millions of people have been in and out of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said campaigns to vaccinate the African population against
small pox and other diseases may even have helped HIV spread,
saying, ''They weren't using sterilized needles all the time.''

<HEADLINE> White House: Gore E-mail Not Stored  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has told Congress that a
year's worth of e-mails for Vice President Al Gore and his staff
were never stored on backup tapes, adding a new twist to the case
of missing computer messages.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional investigators say they fear the e-mails
are lost forever, although presidential aides continue to search to
see if the messages were captured elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, said Thursday he has information that Gore was alerted
to the problem more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just the latest outrage'' in the saga of White House
e-mail that wasn't stored in computer archives, said Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   A White House lawyer informed Burton's committee this week that
vice presidential e-mails from March 1998 through April 1999 -- a
period that included the president's impeachment trial -- were never
backed up on tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been investigating why the White House failed to
archive and review thousands of e-mails to determine if they should
have been turned over under subpeona to investigations ranging from
fund-raising to Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are also reviewing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burton, a witness recently told the committee she
wrote Gore a memo at the vice president's request in April 1999
about e-mail in his office not being properly archived.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's request for the memo ''has led us to discover that'' an
''error apparently prevented e-mail on the OVP server from being
backed up from the end of March 1998 through early April 1999,''
White House lawyer Steve Reich wrote in a letter to the
congressional committee. OVP stands for Office of the Vice
President.
</P>
<P>
   Reich said that the White House has been unable to find any memo
by the witness to Gore on the e-mail archiving problem.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the controversy over missing White House e-mails,
Burton complained that ''first the White House counsel certified
that we had all documents responsive to our subpoenas. Then the
White House led us to believe that all the missing e-mails had been
saved on thousands of back-up tapes. Now we learn that not even
that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said the White House is cooperating fully to respond as
quickly as possible to Burton's requests.
</P>
<P>
   Computer contractors failed to schedule a back-up of the
computer ''E'' drive in the vice president's office. However, some
of the e-mails may be avilable from any paper copies that staffers
kept and any messages staffers stored on their individual
computers. Some of the e-mails also may be available on back-up
tapes made on the main White House computer system.
</P>
<P>
   White House computer problems that resulted in missing e-mails
were uncovered early this year in a lawsuit filed by a conservative
group, Judicial Watch. White House computer technicians had known
of the problem since 1998. But the White House counsel's office has
said it didn't realize the problems were causing its production of
documents for various investigations to be incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 28 interview with The Associated Press, Gore waved
off the issue of missing White House e-mails as a red herring
inspired by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he didn't know how much e-mail he'd
written, ''but whatever is there will be disclosed -- fully and
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail system in Gore's office is separate from the main
White House computer system, where an e-mail archiving problem has
led to missing message traffic for a period of over two years
starting in August 1996.

<HEADLINE> Insurance kingpin guilty of embezzling millions from policyholders  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A prominent businessman who built an
insurance empire stretching over dozens of states was convicted
Thursday of 20 counts of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated eight hours over two days
before finding Albert Lawrence guilty of illegally using more than
$35 million in company assets to save his failing companies and for
his own personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not a rushed or hurried decision,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney William Pericak. ''The proof was clear. The verdict
was clear. Mr. Lawrence took money that did not belong to him and
used it for his own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, visibly shocked by the outcome, left the courthouse
immediately after the verdict and was unavailable for comment.
During the monthlong trial, defense attorney Michael Koening argued
Lawrence was guilty of making bad business decisions, not
committing crimes. Koening maintained Lawrence went from being
worth $150 million to bankruptcy trying to save his companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, 72, of Rexford, was found guilty of wire and mail
fraud, embezzlement of insurance company assets, tax fraud and
embezzlement of pension benefit funds. Under federal sentencing
guidelines, Lawrence faces between six to nine years in prison and
fines totaling millions of dollars, Pericak said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who once headed the now-defunct Lawrence Group Inc., a
Schenectady-based holding company that owned most of the insurance
companies, will be sentenced Oct. 12 in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The jury determined that Lawrence breached his fiduciary duty by
defrauding policyholders of United Community Insurance Co. and
others by using insurance company assets to lend $5 million to
First Commercial Credit Corp. in December 1993 and to lend $27
million to Alpha Trust in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence showed that the $27 million loaned to Alpha Trust was
immediately loaned by Alpha Trust to Lawrence Group Inc., a company
wholly owned by Lawrence and was used by LGI to pay off a $26.4
million debt that Lawrence owed to Chase Manhattan and Fleet banks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence risked the policyholders' money to pay off his debt
even though other commercial lenders determined it was too risky,
Pericak said. LGI defaulted on the loans in October 1996, owing
more than $25 million. First Commercial Credit also defaulted on
the $5 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found Lawrence guilty of embezzling another $2.6 million
from Senate Insurance Co., another company he controlled. Pericak
said Lawrence used $1.6 million of that money to make the first
principal payment to Alpha Trust in what he characterized at trial
as ''robbing Peter to pay Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence also was convicted of embezzling $2.25 million from
Zurich American Insurance, which Lawrence held in trust as an agent
of that company. Pericak said Lawrence used that money to make
another payment to Alpha Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the jury found that Lawrence had withheld more than
$720,000 in taxes and $74,700 in pension contributions from
employee paychecks that he failed to pay to the Internal Revenue
Service or pension administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence used the stolen money for premiums on a $17 million
personal life insurance policy from which he drew money to pay the
mortgage on his Rexford mansion, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be up to a bankruptcy court to deal with the issue of
how much money will be repaid to creditors, policyholders and
employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not even sure whose first, but a lot of people were
harmed,'' Pericak said.

<HEADLINE> Judge calls conference to hear from land claim parties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge will hold an open hearing
Friday in a final effort to revive negotiations in the Oneida
Indian land claim.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Neal P. McCurn has asked one lawyer and one
decision-maker from each side to appear in U.S. District Court. The
judge has ordered the three Oneida Indian nations, the U.S.
Department of Justice, Madison and Oneida counties and the state of
New York to explain their positions on the ''gut'' issues holding
up a settlement on the largest and oldest Indian land dispute in
the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hearing will begin in public, the judge could send
the parties into private negotiations for much of Friday and into
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn said he will attempt to help the parties come together on
the three main issues. If there is ''substantial agreement'' on the
size of the Indian reservation, sales taxes and slot machines,
McCurn will allow mediation to continue for another 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   If the parties cannot compromise, the judge will declare an
impasse, discharge the mediator and begin a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business would be for McCurn to rule on a
December 1998 request by the Oneidas and the Justice Department to
expand the case to sue the state and about 20,000 individual
landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have been trying since February 1999 to sort out how
much land the Oneida Indian Nation can call its reservation and how
much authority the Oneidas' sovereign government can assert on that
land. There are also questions about a sales tax formula and gaming
rights on the land.
</P>
<P>
   Mediator Ron Riccio, a Seton Hall law professor, asked the judge
in April to declare an impasse. Riccio said he will attend Friday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the court and the parties are doing their best to try
to see if there's a basis for settling the case,'' he said. ''Where
there's a will, there's a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas, who now live in New York, Wisconsin and Canada, are
seeking compensation for 250,000 acres in Madison and Oneida
counties they claim the state purchased illegally in the late 18th
and early 19th centuries. Yearlong negotiations broke off April 4.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a settlement, the counties have insisted the
1,100-member Oneida Indian Nation of New York pay property taxes
and collect sales taxes from non-Indians who purchase goods on
reservation land. The counties have also demanded the Oneidas limit
reservation land to 25,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have offered to pay the counties $20 million, in the
form of $1 million each year for 20 years, to offset sales taxes
they say sovereign Indian nations do not have to collect. They also
have offered to set aside $25 million of the settlement money for
the counties to offset unpaid property taxes and limit their
reservation to 40,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state has asked for 25 percent of the Oneidas'
Turning Stone casino earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That last arrangement is not acceptable to Oneida Indian Nation
Representative Ray Halbritter, who has said it would be tantamount
to the Oneidas paying themselves to settle the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the state and federal governments have offered
to contribute equally to a $500 million pot of settlement money.
The plan would have to be approved by both the state Legislature
and Congress.

<HEADLINE> Defense cites threats against DA  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A defense attorney suggested Thursday
that threats against District Attorney Jeanine Pirro and her
children - including shots fired at her office window in 1987 -
were behind the installation of a $45,000 gate outside her home, an
expense challenged at her husband's tax evasion trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-examining an Internal Revenue Service agent who had
classified the gates as a personal expense and disallowed the
deductions taken by Albert Pirro's companies, lawyer Robert Giuffra
asked, ''Are you aware that as far back as 1987 that there were
threats against Jeanine Pirro? ... Are you aware that her office
windows were shot out in 1987? ... Are you aware of threats against
her daughter Kiki? ... Are you aware of threats against her son
Alex?''
</P>
<P>
   The agent, John Dennehy, said he was not aware of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, who arrived in court shortly after the
exchange, said outside, ''People in positions of power tend to be
vulnerable. My life is no exception. ... Security is important to
me and to those closest to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirro would not elaborate, but Anne Marie Corbalis, a
spokeswoman who has been working for her since Pirro was an
assistant district attorney in 1984, said, ''There were a number of
occasions on which criminal charges were filed against individuals
who had threatened the district attorney. ... It was not uncommon
to be in danger as a result of what you were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   She provided court documents including complaints, depositions
and orders of protection involving such threats.
</P>
<P>
   Corbalis said she could not recall a window being ''shot out,''
but did remember ''a hubbub about something hitting a window, and
... it's my understanding that it was a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbalis would not confirm that the children had been
threatened, saying, ''When it comes to the children we're very
careful about what we say about any remarks that were said about
them or about their safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy testified Wednesday that he classified the decorative,
wrought-iron gates as a personal expense because they were designed
long before Jeanine Pirro became district attorney in 1993 - though
they were installed afterward - and they were not very secure.
</P>
<P>
   Giuffra suggested - and Corbalis later confirmed - that a
committee, set up to determine the new district attorney's security
needs, recommended driveway gates and that a burglary was committed
before they were installed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Cathy Seibel objected to Giuffra's questions about
the gates, complaining that the lawyer, rather than the tax agent,
was testifying. Federal Judge Barrington Parker reminded the jury
that the evidence in the case consists of ''the answer, not the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro, a real estate developer and lobbyist, is accused
with his accountant-brother Anthony of hiding more than $1 million
in personal expenses as business deductions. Jeanine Pirro is not
accused, though her name has come up often in reference to lavish
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination of Dennehy was heavy on tedious
arithmetic, with occasional tense exchanges between him and
Giuffra. Giuffra tried to play down the improper deductions
allegedly taken by Albert Pirro's companies, comparing their value
to the millions of dollars in business carried out by the concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennehy eagerly reminded the lawyer and the jury that the
largest tax benefit accrued to Pirro himself when he did not
declare the value of his company's purchases - like a $123,000
Ferrari - as income.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Pirro underpaid his taxes by more than $400,000
between 1988 and 1996. Since the start of the investigation, he has
paid back almost $1 million in federal and state tax and interest.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when the defense attorney asked the tax agent to
add up all the deductions claimed by Albert Pirro's law firm,
Dennehy started, then stopped and looked up with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ''My calculator overloaded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pirro's lawyer, Roger Stavis, challenged Dennehy's
testimony about some mysterious entries, including $30,000 that
Dennehy said was added without foundation to a legitimate $517
deduction. Stavis suggested it was an ''input error.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had found evidence to support a $23,455 interest
deduction the government had disallowed. And he pointed out, by
comparing handwriting, that at least one other accountant worked
with Anthony Pirro on the ledgers.

   Meanwhile, in the fight for the 7th Congressional District seat
being vacated by Franks, Maryanne Connelly on Thursday continued to
declare victory in the tight Democratic primary, but chief primary
rival Mike Lapolla has not conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gormley waited two days before conceding the GOP race
in which Franks had declared victory on election night, he said
there was no bitterness or regret involved in the delay and he
simply wanted to make sure reliable vote tallies had been verified
in the various counties. His campaign did not seek any recounts.
</P>
<P>
   The latest state tallies give Franks a 3,700-vote margin out of
more than 270,000 votes cast. The balloting had been so close it
took nearly six hours after the polls closed Tuesday to declare
Franks the winner by less than 2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   State Elections Director Sharon Young said the state's official
election results will not formally be certified until June 16, but
that her office's tally Thursday was reliable, according to reports
from all 21 counties that accounted for all of the state's 6,100
election districts.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said he had no regrets, was pleased with his
''respectable showing'' and had enjoyed campaigning statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ran the campaign I wanted to. The numbers were pretty
good,'' he said. ''What I don't want to do, I do not want to be one
of those politicians who goes over for you what went wrong. The
battle injuries of politicians are one of the most boring topics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to campaign for Bob Franks the way I campaigned for
Bill Gormley. People will not know the difference at the level of
campaigning,'' Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting his penchant for jogging through neighborhoods to greet
residents and seek support, Gormley said, ''Everyone thought one of
the unique aspects of the campaign was my running door to door, and
I want Bob to pick the towns, and wherever he wants to do it, we
will coordinate it, I will run for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks issued a statement thanking Gormley and declaring the
party to be unified. ''Bill Gormley has an impressive record of
accomplishment and I am glad to have him in my corner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 7th District, state tallies showed Connelly leading
by 239 votes out of more than 32,000 votes cast, but Connelly
campaign manager Sujata Tejwani said several voting machines in
Essex County had been impounded for verification.
</P>
<P>
   Tejwani said she did not believe any of these machines could
alter the outcome, especially since four of them were believed to
have been backup machines with no votes on them.
</P>
<P>
   But Lapolla campaign manager Angie Bowen said the counting of
emergency ballots and cancellation of faulty absentee ballots was
due to be completed Friday and could alter the outcome. ''It is
still considered too close,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In Rick Fox's mind, his standout performance
in Game 1 of the NBA Finals came nine years too late.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Fox was on one of basketball's biggest stages -- at
the 1991 Final Four at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis -- he ''failed
the test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his final college game, Fox and his favored North Carolina
teammates lost to Kansas in the semifinals. Fox, the Tar Heels' MVP
that year, said he saw his standout performance in Game 1 as
redemption for a subpar effort nine years earlier in the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting for this for nearly 10 years,'' Fox said
after scoring 11 points -- nine in the fourth quarter -- in the
Lakers' 104-87 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been telling myself I was going to be calm when I got
here, and that's what I was when I went out there. I've thought
about this game almost constantly for my entire career -- what I
would do, what I would say, what I would be like -- and I did what I
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox had been most visible in the playoffs this year for annoying
the Portland Trail Blazers. Acting in somewhat the same role as a
hockey enforcer, Fox agitated Scottie Pippen, Rasheed Wallace and
company throughout the Lakers' seven-game series victory in the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Pacers, Fox started slowly but played the entire
fourth quarter. He hit a 3-pointer with 4:39 to play that capped a
game-deciding 11-2 run, and he also made four free throws in the
final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a role on this team, just like everybody else does,''
Fox said. ''Earlier, it was to do things that don't show up in the
box score. (On Wednesday) night, I had to hit some shots.''
</P>

   BAD BOYS: At least one person at Staples Center on Thursday
could think of a way to stop Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   John Salley entered the NBA in 1986 with the Detroit Pistons,
who were just developing their Bad Boys identity. Led by chief
instigators Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn and Dennis Rodman, the
Pistons crawled under their opponents' skin and ruled the court
through intimidation, all while winning two championships.
</P>
<P>
   Salley, now Shaq's seldom-used backup with the Lakers, would
have liked his old team's chances against O'Neal, who had 43 points
and 19 rebounds in Game 1 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Shaq to death, but he would have thrown a punch at
Bill,'' Salley said. ''And that's just what we would have wanted
him to do. We would have got him out of the game somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley takes the bulk of the pounding from O'Neal during Lakers
practices. He said the Pistons never faced an opponent with Shaq's
blend of brute force, quickness and offensive finesse.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's unique,'' Salley said. ''Maybe you look back at guys like
Wilt (Chamberlain) or Bill Russell or Artis Gilmore, but Shaq is
right up there.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TATTOOED FOR TICKETS: Would you get a tattoo on your posterior
to win a pair of playoff tickets? In L.A., you'd have to get in
line.
</P>
<P>
   After being given two tickets to Friday's Game 2 by loyal
listener Kobe Bryant, KPWR-FM morning disc jockey Luther ''Big
Boy'' Luffeigh offered them to a fan over 18 who was willing to get
an anti-Pacers tattoo on his or her rear end.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., more than 700 listeners to Los Angeles' leading
hip-hop station faxed their names to Luffeigh. The station planned
to choose a winner in a random drawing after 7 p.m., said Dianna
Obermeyer, the station's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The winner had to agree to be at the station Friday to pick up
the tickets and the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of Laker fans here,'' Obermeyer said. ''We've
seen people do more for less.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE BALLS: The Lakers' Game 1 victory was the fifth straight
win by the home team in opener of the NBA Finals. The last home
team to lose Game 1 was Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic, who were
swept by the Houston Rockets in 1995. ... Sacramento Kings center
Scot Pollard has been floating around the teams' practice sessions
this week, using a video camera to record his chats with players
and media members. He is working for the television show ''NBA
Inside Stuff.'' ... O'Neal is trying to become the 19th player to
lead his team to the championship in the same season he was named
MVP. Other than Michael Jordan, who accomplished the feat four
times in the 1990s with the Chicago Bulls, Houston's Hakeem
Olajuwon (1994) is the only other player to do it in the last 13
seasons.
</P>

   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ''We just have to go out and do our job, and
then we'll throw pie in their face.'' Indiana guard Mark Jackson,

<HEADLINE> Whitman, Torricelli press reforms after NJ primary  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman said Thursday she
will propose legislation to crack the anonymity of so-called
''stealth'' committees that influence campaigns with independent
ads usually harsh in tone.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also said she is concerned that multimillionaire
Democrat Jon Corzine's record-breaking, mostly self-funded campaign
for Senate is exacerbating New Jersey's reputation for political
excess. She urged Corzine to set some kind of spending limit for
himself in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I dearly want New Jersey to stop being the focus of national
and international attention for the type of races we run here,''
Whitman said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., spoke Wednesday to
coordinate a pitch for reform. They found common ground on the
issue of campaign advertising by independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said her staff is drafting a bill for consideration by
the state Legislature that would force independent groups to
disclose information about themselves if they pay for ads
mentioning a candidate by name.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, such groups can remain largely anonymous so long as
their ads do not explicitly urge votes for or against a candidate.
The groups get around that restriction by avoiding the phrases
''vote for'' or ''vote against.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said forcing such groups to disclose their sources of
funding would ''give voters some frame of reference with which to
determine how much credence to put into a particular ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli on Thursday announced his support for legislation
that would accomplish on a federal level what Whitman proposes for
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require nonprofit ''527'' groups - named
for the section of the IRS code they operate under - to disclose
information about their funding if they run an ad mentioning a
candidate by name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapid proliferation of these groups and the massive
escalation of spending could cause the electoral process to
collapse before our eyes,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Torricelli are unlikely avatars of reform this year.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli is one of the Democratic Party's leading fund-raisers
and was a prominent early backer of Corzine, who spent an estimated
$33 million to beat former Gov. Jim Florio for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is on the board of an independent group, the Republican
Leadership Council, that paid for advertising criticizing
Republican Scott Garrett, a conservative who narrowly lost his
primary challenge to moderate Republican Rep. Marge Roukema.
</P>
<P>
   The RLC and a group favoring Garrett, Club for Growth, ran
competing ads in the 5th District race. Whitman said she plans to
tell Lewis Eisenberg, the RLC chairman and a longtime Whitman
confidante, that she believes the group should begin disclosing the
identities of all its donors.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg commended Whitman and said the RLC ''will be the first
in line to adhere'' to any new law passed in New Jersey or
nationally. But he said the organization will not ''unilaterally
disarm'' by holding itself to higher disclosure standards than
required by law.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for an open House seat in the 7th District, a
largely unknown group called Council for Responsible Government ran
ads attacking two of the four Republican nominees.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th District GOP primary matchup between Dick Zimmer and
Mike Pappas, a group called Citizens for Tax Reform paid for ads
alleging a tenuous link between Pappas and the Ku Klux Klan. The
Pappas campaign presented evidence of footprints leading from the
group to Zimmer campaign consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she expressed her concern to Zimmer, whom she
endorsed, about the independent ads attacking Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Dick, you have to be absolutely clear that there's no
room for this. You don't need it, and it's illegal,''' Whitman
said. She added that Zimmer assured her he had nothing to do with
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she will propose two other reforms specific to New
Jersey's matching-fund system for gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   She said the state should stop matching contributions from
out-of-state donors. She said matching funds should not apply as
well to contributions under $300, the sources of which do not have
to be reported to the state Election Law Enforcement Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Senate race, Whitman said she hopes Corzine and
Republican nominee Bob Franks work out a voluntary agreement on a
spending cap, even if the cap is so high that only Corzine can
reach it.
</P>
<P>
   Though she supports Franks, Whitman said the move would benefit
Corzine as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just something that I think would elevate his
candidacy, so (that) it's about more than just buying an
election,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Paulson Leading Buick Classic  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NICHOLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. (AP) -- Dennis Paulson ended his first-round
problems in a big way in the Buick Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, who lost a playoff with Duffy Waldorf in this
tournament last year, shot a 6-under-par 65 on Thursday to take a
one-stroke lead over Waldorf, Davis Love III and Spain's Miguel
Angel Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leading the first day is no big deal. It doesn't matter. What
matters is not shooting 74, 75, 76,'' Paulson said. ''Anything in
the 60s or under par is a bonus. Leading doesn't matter until
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last 11 tournaments, Paulson has opened with only one
sub-par round -- a 68 in the Masters. In his last four events, he
started with three 75s and a 79.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been shooting myself out of tournaments,'' Paulson said.
''It seems like I'm always 2 or 3 over after four holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Waldorf birdied the final two holes to force the
playoff, and won with another birdie on the first extra hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't lose the tournament. Duffy won it,'' Paulson said.
''I haven't lost one bit of sleep over what happened last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, who started on No. 10 Thursday, capped his bogey-free
round with a two-putt birdie on the par-5 9th.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably the most solid round I've played all year,''
the former national long-driving champion said. ''I drove the ball
well when I had to, and I hit a lot of good iron shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to say I didn't putt very well because I made a lot of
6-footers, but the longest one I made was an 11-footer. I missed
probably five times from inside 15 feet -- one about 5 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   John Maginnes, Skip Kendall and Sweden's Gabriel Hjertstedt were
two strokes back, and Canadian Mike Weir and John Cook topped a
nine-player group at 68. Phil Mickelson, a three-time winner this
year, and Fred Couples shot 69s.
</P>
<P>
   Love, preparing for next week's U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, is
coming off a two-week break following consecutive second-place
finishes in the Byron Nelson Classic and the Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no substitute for playing -- playing competitive
golf,'' said Love, the 1997 PGA winner at nearby Winged Foot. ''You
can play all you want this weekend at Pebble Beach, but the guys
playing here under the gun are really playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   With its deep rough and tight tree-lined fairways, the
Westchester Country Club course is a good primer for the U.S.
Open's difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any traditional-style course -- any real good golf course like
this -- is a good warmup,'' Love said. ''There's deep rough and a
lot of long par-4s. The grass here is very similar to what we'll be
putting on at Pebble.''
</P>
<P>
   Love birdied the final two holes, making a 12-foot putt on No.
17 and two-putting from 20 feet on 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''All it would take is to win this week and win next week, and
it would be a huge year,'' joked Love, who has finished second
eight times since winning the 1998 MCI Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf closed with an eagle on the par-5 9th, holing a 20-foot
putt after a 2-iron approach from 220 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put the ball in the fairway. That was the key because the
rough is really tough,'' Waldorf said. ''When I had the
opportunities, I made the putts for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, playing his first full round on the course, hit all 14
fairways and missed only one green in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time, it was right in the middle. I'm driving very, very
straight,'' the European Ryder Cup player said.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, winless in the last 14 months, shot an eventful 70.
He had seven birdies, four bogeys and a double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els and Masters champion Vijay Singh, both two-time Buick
Classic winners, and Jose Maria Olazabal also had 70s.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Shigeki Maruyama, the Japanese player who shot a 58 on
Monday during U.S. Open qualifying in Rockville, Md., shot a 70.
... The field features four of the top six players in the world
rankings and nine of the top 15. ... Sergio Garcia, the 20-year-old
Spanish star, opened with a 74. ... Greg Norman, making only his
eighth tour start of the year, shot a 71.

<HEADLINE> Preventative Cancer Surgery Studied  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- More than half of women who tested positive for a
genetic predisposition to breast or ovarian cancer opted to have
their healthy breasts or ovaries removed to head off the disease, a
new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA test has been available since 1994 to determine whether
women have genetic mutations linked to the cancers, but the Dutch
research is the first to track how many women took it and how many
chose pre-emptive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of women in the study, all at high risk for the two
cancers, chose to take the DNA test, according to the research
published this week in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Young women with children were more likely than older women to
take the tests and to have mastectomies once they discovered they
had the mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., who has conducted similar research but was not
connected to the study, said it provides important new information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been people who say (surgery)... is selected by
only 5 percent of women,'' Hartmann said. ''That's based on their
own opinion and that's just not good enough. You need the actual
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 411 cancer-free women with one or more family
members with one of two genes linked to breast and ovarian cancers.
It found that 48 percent of the women took the opportunity to find
out if they carried the genetic mutation.
</P>
<P>
   When the tests revealed they had a mutation, 51 percent chose a
double mastectomy and 64 percent opted to have their ovaries
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 1 in 400 women have a mutation of one of
the two genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Those women can have an 85
percent risk of developing breast cancer and a 65 percent chance of
getting ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of women with gene mutations feel their breasts are time
bombs,'' said the study's lead researcher, Dr. Jan Klijn at Erasmus
University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Klijn said anecdotal evidence suggests there are regional and
national differences in the number of women opting for the tests
and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's partly cultural and it also depends on the attitude of
doctors,'' Klijn said, adding that, ''within 10 years, the
difference between countries will become smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   The study results, which Klijn presented at a U.S. cancer
conference last month, showed that of the 70 women who had their
breasts removed, none developed cancer in the six years that
followed. An earlier study by Hartmann at the Mayo Clinic showed
the surgery slashed the risk of breast cancer by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American
Cancer Society, said he expects to see an increase in the number of
women having their healthy breasts removed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Lynch, a professor of medicine at Creighton University
in Omaha, Neb., who has conducted similar research, said the demand
for pre-emptive mastectomy has increased over the last decade in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said his findings, to be presented at a conference this
month, are almost identical to those of the Dutch study.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shirley Hodgson, a geneticist at Guy's Hospital in London,
said more and more women are coming to her hospital for the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But Hartmann said the Dutch findings reflect a greater
propensity to take the genetic test among women who are already
seriously considering preventive mastectomies. Women who have no
intention of having their breasts removed are less likely to take a
genetic test in the first place, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Mackay, a cancer genetics expert at the Cancer
Research Campaign in Addenbrokes Hospital in Cambridge, England,
said that while more women may opt for mastectomy in the near
future, preventive hormonal treatments now being developed may be a
better option in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The knife has never been the real answer to the treatment of
breast cancer,'' he said. ''The big advances in prevention will not
come from chopping people's breasts off. In the long term, I'd put
my money on hormonal treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies of preventive drug treatment may show that women can
protect themselves against breast cancer and still keep their
breasts, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Miller Rediscovers His Hate  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reggie Miller feeds off his hatred, playing
his best when he loathes the most.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in what could be good news for the Indiana Pacers and bad
news for the Los Angeles Lakers, Miller rediscovered his malice
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was one look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need that extra motivation, you need to create that little
something that gets you ticked off, and I think I've created it
myself by going 1-for-16 in Game 1 of my first ever NBA Finals,''
Miller said. ''So, I'm more upset with myself now, and I've got to
contend with myself, which is kind scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Shaquille O'Neal's 43 points and 19 rebounds,
Miller's frightful shooting performance in Game 1 was the most
eye-popping statistic from an opening game that was controlled by
the Lakers throughout.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the game, Miller pointed out that 11 of his 16
shots were wide open ones that he simply missed. His only basket
came on a layup midway through the third quarter, and his seven
points -- five coming from the foul line -- were a career
playoff-low.
</P>
<P>
   Having been in the league for 13 years and having been through
96 playoff games, Miller didn't seem overly dejected by either his
performance or his team's 104-87 loss. It was, after all, only one
game in a seven-game series -- albeit a ghastly game from Indiana's
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is Friday night before the series shifts to Indianapolis
for the next three games Sunday, Wednesday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an easy series for us. The matchups are not good,
they're quick, big and strong, they're able to score points in
bunches,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said. ''But if Reggie picks his
game up and Jalen (Rose) picks his game up and Rik (Smits) starts
hitting a few of them shots that he had last night, we'll be right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said he felt the Pacers need to shoot 46 or 47 percent from
the field to have a chance to win. Indiana shot 42 percent in Game
1, a number skewed by Miller's 1-for-16 showing.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Croshere shot 6-for-7, Mark Jackson was 6-for-8, Smits
and Rose were 5-for-12 and Dale Davis was 4-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the Lakers was expecting a similar inept showing from
Miller in Game 2, nor was his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggie's a very confident player, there's no question about
that,'' Bird said. ''But this is a new experience for the young
man, a great experience for him. He just had to find out the hard
way last night, but believe me, this kid will bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers expect the Pacers to follow the pattern established
by Sacramento, Phoenix and Portland in the first three rounds of
the playoffs -- sending more and more defenders at O'Neal and trying
to keep him from establishing position deep in the low post where
he can convert so many different kinds of shots.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is averaging 41.8 points in his four Game 1s this
postseason; 28.0 in his three Game 2s.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pattern,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ''Teams
know it's going to be very difficult to beat us if he averages that
consistently through a series, so they'll throw more men at him and
throw different strategies. That's the adjustment we'll find from
Indiana, and we'll have to make the adjustment on the move in
tomorrow's game.''
</P>
<P>
   The added attention to O'Neal has meant more scoring
opportunities for Kobe Bryant, Glen Rice and the other Lakers. For
example, Bryant had 32 points and Rice 18 in Game 2 against the
Kings in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we've been doing all playoffs, just pick your
poison,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson brought the triangle offense with him to Los Angeles
when he took over as coach of the Lakers prior to this season. He
had always said the quirky offense would work best -- even better
than it did with Michael Jordan in Chicago -- on a team with a
dominant big man. He took the Lakers' job to get a chance to test
that theory with O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson feels the Lakers still haven't mastered the
secondary part of the triangle offense -- what to do when teams have
taken O'Neal away as an option. The ball movement and player
movement must be quick and precise, and the Lakers have shown a
tendency to abandon it in favor of a more freelance style.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what Jackson wondered entering Game 2 was whether his
team would run the offense correctly if Indiana, as expected,
double- and triple-teams O'Neal every time he catches the ball. The
Pacers didn't switch to that strategy in Game 1 until they had
fallen behind by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have the same plan. If they want to double- or
triple-team, that's nothing new to me and nothing new to this
team,'' O'Neal said. ''We know what we have to do. When I kick it
out, they have to take high percentage shots. And if I can get real
deep and beat the double-team, nothing will matter. We just have to
continue to play our same game.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, on the other hand, can't play the same type of game.
</P>
<P>
   If he takes another 16 shots, 15 can't be misses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't get no worse. It can only get better,'' he said.
''I'm going to shoot my way out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Harper: Consummate Pro  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers assistant coach Jim
Cleamons calls Ron Harper the consummate professional.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal says Harper is a master of the triangle
offense, and the one player who keeps the Lakers out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   John Salley says the 36-year-old guard is the ''father of the
squad,'' a cagey veteran who will pop the Lakers' balloon when
heads get too big.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who likened leaving the Clippers in 1994 to getting out
of jail, has been a big success with the other Los Angeles team
this season, although he hasn't received nearly the attention of an
O'Neal or Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ron's a great asset to this team,'' Lakers forward Robert
Horry said Thursday before the team practiced in preparation for
Friday night's second game of the NBA Finals at Staples Center.
''He gets us back on track when we get out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper went from a high scorer to a role player when he joined
the Bulls, and helped them win the last three of their six
championships under Phil Jackson, who last summer signed a
five-year, $30 million contract to coach the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Harper played his role to perfection, and more, in the first
quarter of the Lakers' 104-87 victory over the Indiana Pacers in
Game 1 of the finals, recording eight points and four assists
without committing a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he set the tone defensively on Pacers star Reggie
Miller, who missed six shots and went scoreless in the opening 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Harper finished the game with 12 points and five assists in 21
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won't come out and say so, it's likely Harper's on
the Lakers only because Jackson became their coach. Otherwise, he'd
probably be enjoying retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' Harper said with a big smile when asked if
he'd still be playing had Jackson and the Lakers not called. ''I
was fine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how long he'd continue to play, Harper smiled again
and said: ''Game by game, how's that sound? When the season ends,
I'll go home and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls renounced their rights to Harper last September, not
long after he underwent knee surgery. The Lakers signed the
6-foot-6, 216-pounder to a two-year, $4.2 million contract Oct. 13
-- the same day Kobe Bryant broke his right hand, causing him to
miss the first 15 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight championship seasons in Chicago, Harper and
Toni Kukoc were about the only two significant players who remained
with the Bulls after Michael Jordan retired and Scottie Pippen and
Dennis Rodman left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls went from the top of the heap in 1998 to the bottom
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Harper said: ''Last year wasn't that bad at all. I
just play, have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He's having a lot more fun this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ain't the Bulls, we don't have the same guys,'' he said,
adding that the Lakers ''have to learn the game, they haven't
gotten over that big hurdle yet.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from Harper, it looks like they just might in the next
10 days or so.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been times where this team tends to go the easy
way,'' he said. ''We can't be an in-between team, I don't think. We
have to stay on this team all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those times came last month, when after beating Phoenix
in the first three games of a second-round playoff series, the
Lakers lost to the Suns 117-98.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Harper said the Lakers had no killer instinct
whatsoever, that the Bulls' championship teams would have beaten
Phoenix ''by about 200 points,'' and the Lakers ''couldn't guard
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers proceeded to hold the Suns to 23 first-half points in
an 87-65 blowout to advance to the Western Conference finals, where
they eliminated Portland in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't let down after their battles with the Trail
Blazers. Now, they face another possible letdown situation, not to
mention an angry Miller, who wound up making 1-of-16 shots in
scoring seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would expect him to come out firing it up, shoot every
chance he gets,'' Harper said. ''He missed some shots. I didn't
change anything, just guarding him, hand in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if he's mad or not. I'm just going out there
doing the job I can do.''

<HEADLINE> Veteran Newsweek critic Kroll dead at 74  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Jack Kroll, the award-winning Newsweek drama
critic whose career covered more than half the magazine's
existence, died Thursday of colon cancer at a Manhattan hospital.
He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll, who won awards for a piece on the 1980 death of John
Lennon and for a 1982 cover story on comedian Richard Pryor, died
at the New York University Medical Center, the weekly news magazine
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll, a New York native, joined Newsweek in 1963 as an
associate editor in charge of the arts section and and never left
the magazine. He was responsible for 19 cover stories and more than
1,200 articles in his 37-year Newsweek career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jack Kroll possessed one of the liveliest, sharpest, most
passionate minds in American journalism,'' said Newsweek chairman
and editor-in-chief Richard M. Smith. ''We will miss him, and our
readers will miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroll graduated from the City College of New York in 1954 after
spending two years in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. He
received a master's degree in English and comparative literature
before taking a job as a copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he joined the staff of the magazine Art News, doing
some freelancing in his spare time. But it was after joining
Newsweek that Kroll's work began to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   He was promoted to the weekly's senior editor in charge of all
cultural sections in 1964, became drama critic in 1967, and was
named critic-at-large in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek special edition on ''The Arts in America,'' directed
by Kroll, won a 1974 National Magazine Award and a Page One Award
from the Newspaper Guild of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll, a passionate fan of the New York Knicks, also won a
George Jean Nathan Award for dramatic criticism in 1980, an
ASCAP/Deems Taylor Award in 1981 for his Lennon piece, and a Page
One Award for his 1982 story on Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   His last cover story was a Dec. 14, 1998, piece on Nicole
Kidman's Broadway debut in ''The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service was being planned, according to a statement
from Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll is survived by his wife, Joan Engels, a senior photo
editor at Newsweek; twin children from a previous marriage,
Lawrence Kroll of Irvine, Calif., and Sue Kroll of Los Angeles; and
a granddaughter, Laura.

<HEADLINE> NY attorney general says EPA ban doesn't go far enough  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's attorney general called on
retailers in the state to immediately pull from their shelves
products containing a pesticide banned Thursday by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said it was prohibiting
further manufacture of chlorpyrifos, which is commonly sold in bug
killers under trade names including Dursban and Lorsban.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said it would allow retailers to sell off already
manufactured products containing the substance, which is suspected
of affecting the nervous systems and possibly the brain development
of children. Stores could continue selling products with
chlorpyrifos through the end of 2001 even with the EPA ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said all sales of the
pesticide should be cut off and he urged major retailers to
voluntarily do so. He made the request in letters to chief
executives of Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Agway, Kmart, Pergament, Lowe's
and Ace Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ''The manufacturing of chlorpyrifos ... will cease today, but
many months will pass before you will have to legally remove this
product from your store's shelves,'' Spitzer said. ''However, you
have a unique opportunity right now, to protect the health of your
customers by voluntarily removing pesticide products that contain
chlorpyrifos from your shelves immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer told the executives that banning chlorpyrifos will
bolster sales of nontoxic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''By offering nontoxic pest control products, your store will be
well positioned in this growing market,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is going to stop selling products with chlorpyrifos at
the end of this October, or 14 months ahead of the timetable EPA is
demanding, spokeswoman Jessica Moser said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart has not yet determined what it is going to do, according
to spokeswoman Mary Lorencz.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a process of trying to identify what products we may
have'' containing chlorpyrifos, Lorencz said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said it will stop selling the products ''well in
advance'' of the EPA deadline and, until it does, will advise
customers on the safe and proper use of the pesticides. The
retailer also said it would stock more alternatives and inform
customers about their availability.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ace Hardware did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he urged EPA officials in December 1999 to ban
chlorpyrifos.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office will work with farmers in New York to phase
out the pesticide's use for agricultural purposes.

<HEADLINE> Two Cubans Visited U.S. Embassy  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before an abortive attempt to forcibly return
them to Cuba, two Cuban doctors in Zimbabwe sought advice from the
U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe on how to seek political asylum, a State
Department official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting May 26 was a week before the doctors -- Leonel
Cordova Rodriguez and Noris Pena Martinez -- were picked up by
Zimbabwean security officers and put on a plane out of the country.
The doctors managed to escape repatriation with the help of a note
alerting an Air France crew member that they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cordova and Pena were allowed to formally apply for
refugee status in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital. They were part of
a group of 152 doctors sent to Zimbabwe as part of Cuba's ''doctor
diplomacy'' program.
</P>
<P>
   During their visit to the U.S. Embassy, the two were told that a
determination about obtaining refugee status would have to be made
by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Zimbabwe, said the
State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors informed the embassy that they had an appointment
scheduled with UNHCR the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the visit to the embassy was disclosed in Thursday's
editions of The Miami Herald, which cited an e-mail sent by Pena to
Miami relatives the same day of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I went to the U.S. Embassy and they seemed interested in
the case,'' Pena wrote, according to a Herald translation. She said
she was taking the ''decisive step'' of abandoning the doctors'
mission in favor of seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Thiessen, spokesman for GOP Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
the doctors could have been spared the kidnapping if the embassy
had advised them they had the option of receiving temporary
sanctuary until their refugee status was determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson of the whole incident is, if a Cuban comes knocking
on your door seeking asylum, give him sanctuary,'' Thiessen said.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Ban Common Pesticide  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and manufacturers agreed
Thursday to phase out use of one of the most widely applied
pesticides because of concern that it poses health risks to
children in homes, schools and parks. Still, the product may remain
on store shelves until the end of 2001, prompting complaints from
some health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced it was banning the
use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos -- commonly sold under the trade
names Dursban and Lorsban -- for virtually all nonagricultural uses
and curtailing its application on some crops, including apples,
frequently eaten by children.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide can be found in more than 800 products from pet
flea collars and lawn care products to a variety of bug sprays used
in homes, schools, parks, and on residential lawns and gardens. It
is one of the most widely used pesticides with more than 20 million
pounds sold annually, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between the EPA and Dow AgroScience, a subsidiary
of Dow Chemical, and five other manufacturers, calls for all retail
sales to end in 18 months, although new production of the chemical
is to stop by the end of the year for virtually all nonagricultural
uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are turning off the manufacture of this chemical ... for
garden and home uses,'' declared EPA Administrator Carol Browner,
predicting the chemical will be largely off store shelves by the
end of the year because, she said, the market ''will dry up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow AgroScience, which is the leading manufacturer of the
pesticide, said it remains convinced the chemical is safe if used
properly, but that ''it no longer made business sense in the
current regulatory environment'' to continue making the chemical
for other than agricultural uses. That's because a 1996 law
requires the EPA to impose much tougher restrictions on a
pesticide's use if it is found to pose a special risk to children.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA also said it is imposing tighter restrictions on the
pesticide's use on some agricultural products, specifically apples
and grapes, and ban its use on tomatoes. These restrictions are
designed to eliminate the chemical's residues on foods often
consumed by children. The pesticide may still be used on a variety
of grains and other crops.
</P>
<P>
   While environmentalists and health advocates generally praised
the move, they questioned why the EPA did not pursue a recall of
products already on shelves and in the pipeline. Actual retail
sales will not have to end until Dec. 31, 2001 under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the EPA identifies hazards it should stop their use,''
said Jay Feldman, executive director of the National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides. ''It's a buyer-beware situation.
We're urging people to stop buying and selling this product.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wallinga, a scientist for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, called the action a ''good step'' but said that the EPA
should have pursued broader restrictions on agricultural products
and sought a faster phaseout of the nonagricultural uses. In
addition, Dursban can still be used in some areas such as on golf
courses and around houses under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers in lengthy negotiations strongly opposed a recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the fastest possible action that we could have
taken,'' said Browner. ''If we had been forced to go through the
legal process (for a recall or immediate ban) it would have taken
... years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chlorpyrifos is among a family of 45 pesticides known as
organophosphates that attack the nervous system and are under
review by the EPA because of their potential health effects on
children. Congress passed a law four years ago requiring the review
to be completed by October, 1999, but so far only a handful of the
chemicals have been examined.
</P>
<P>
   The American Crop Protection Association, which represent
manufacturers and pest control companies, called the EPA ban an
overreaction and said the agency's ban was based on ''a flawed or
incomplete process'' and ''uneven consideration of valid scientific
data.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Compensate Nuke Workers  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nuclear weapons plant workers made ill by
on-the-job exposure to radiation, silica or beryllium would receive
medical benefits and at least $200,000 apiece under a program the
Senate agreed upon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment calling for the program was added without a vote to
the defense authorization bill. The House version of the bill does
not include the program, whose fate congressional negotiators would
have to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Also, lawmakers have not set aside any money for the program,
which could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be real easy, simply because of the money
involved,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, chief sponsor of the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Senate's action is a big step toward helping people
suffering from cancer, silicosis or beryllium disease because of
their Cold War-era employment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something the government should have addressed a long
time ago. These people have waited a long time to get redress for
their grievances,'' said Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Added Energy Secretary Bill Richardson: ''The Senate today
furthered efforts to right the wrongs of the Cold War and get sick
workers and their survivors the help they have long deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department recently reversed 50 years of federal
policy by declaring that workers injured or killed by weapons-plant
exposure be compensated. The agency had proposed minimum lump sum
payments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimated that compensation under its plan would
cost about $520 million over the first five years, assuming about
3,000 people qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate's plan, workers would apply for benefits and
compensation through the Labor Department, which would review
medical and employment history in making its determination.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims might prefer to take their chances with a jury and
sue for damages rather than settle for the amounts provided under
the plan -- $200,000, tax free, or the amount of provable lost
wages, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who accept compensation would be precluded from suing.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan left out workers who contracted cancer because
of exposure to toxic chemicals -- rather than radiation -- in the
weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have the votes,'' said Sen. George Voinovich,
R-Ohio. ''It boiled down to maintaining the support of the
(Clinton) administration. Without them, we wouldn't have Democratic
support.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, about 600,000 people worked at bomb-making
and nuclear material plants across the country. It is difficult to
determine exactly how many of them were sickened because chronic
beryllium disease and many of the radiation-linked cancers take
years and sometimes decades to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The DOE said most of the people likely to qualify for
compensation would come from the Hanford nuclear reservation in
Washington state; Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee; Savannah
River Site in South Carolina; Nevada Test Site; Rocky Flats Complex
in Colorado; Pantex Plant in Texas; Mound Plant and Fernald
Environmental Management Project in Ohio; Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California; Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico; and gaseous diffusion plants at Piketon, Ohio;
Paducah, Ky.; and Oak Ridge, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Data on School Children Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States that receive federal money to boost the
learning of poor schoolchildren are using data too vague or
confusing to prove those students are benefitting academically,
government auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Texas, states that share more than $8
billion under the Title 1 program generally evaluated their
successes based on the performance of all students, rather than the
low-income or non-English speaking children the law is designed to
help, said the General Accounting Office. Texas alone includes the
performance of poor and minority children in its state definition
of yearly progress on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report -- which comes as policy-makers are demanding that
schools prove they are spending education dollars wisely --
concludes that ''states are not yet in a position to ensure
accountability for the educational outcomes of disadvantaged
students, the children that remain central to the mission of the
Title I program.''
</P>
<P>
   The report -- requested by three members of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee -- recommends that federal
lawmakers require states to collect specifics on the disadvantaged
students as well.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton in an executive order directed
Education Department officials to compile and publish information
on low-performing schools and help states fix them.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the report, Michael Cohen, a deputy to Education
Secretary Richard Riley, said in a letter that the Clinton
administration has proposed the state data requirement for the
renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That
legislation was stalled earlier this year by lawmakers grappling
over vouchers, money for class-size reduction and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chair of the Senate education
committee; Edward Kennedy, of Massachusetts, the panel's top
Democrat; and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sought the study delivered
to Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed in 1994 says that this fall states must start
reporting test scores and other student information based on their
gender, racial and ethnic group, English language ability,
disabilities, migrant status and economic status. Besides issuing
public reports, states are to supposed to use the information
gathered from schools and districts to decide how schools are doing
and what to do with ones that are failing to help students.
</P>
<P>
   But just a third of states -- 17 -- have collected the required
data in all six categories, the report said, casting doubt on
whether even most states will meet the deadline. Many did have data
for the race, poverty, and language categories in the fall of 1999,
the time period observed by the government researchers -- who also
visited education officials in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Tennessee and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas -- where Gov. George W. Bush has touted reforms in his bid
for president -- was cited for breaking test scores down by race,
poverty and other factors to measure school and district
effectiveness in helping specific groups of students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made steady progress in closing the achievement gap,
especially among African-American and Hispanic students, because we
insist on results,'' Bush said in a statement issued by the
governor's office Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Road Weary Orioles Back in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles returned to New York on
Thursday -- one day after leaving the city -- to complete their odd,
three-game series with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday night's game was rained out and the Orioles were
unable to find enough hotel rooms in the New York area, the team
chartered a flight back to Baltimore after Wednesday night's game
and returned for Thursday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't that bad,'' said manager Mike Hargrove, who earlier
said the extra travel would put his team at a competitive
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a lot easier than getting to Port St. Lucie in spring
training. I was home by 2 a.m. and slept in my own bed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles flew home right after Wednesday's 11-3 loss and
landed in Baltimore around 12:40 a.m. Most of the players were home
by 2 a.m. and back at Camden Yards 12 hours later to begin the
final leg of their 11-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players didn't participate in the round-trip commute. Cal
Ripken, Brady Anderson, Charles Johnson, Albert Belle, Jose
Mercedes and Scott Erickson stayed on their own in New York and
Friday's starter Pat Rapp remained in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove considered allowing his other starting pitchers to stay
back in Baltimore because they probably wouldn't be used Thursday
night, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being that this is an NL game, heaven forbid we needed any of
them to do anything other than pitch, so I wanted them here,'' he
said. ''I felt it was important that we did this together as a
team. To split it up and divide it wouldn't have been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina, the Orioles player representative, was upset the
Mets didn't schedule a doubleheader Wednesday to ease the travel
woes. But he felt it was important for the whole team to come back
to Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The odds of getting into a game are pretty slim, but I'd hate
to be sitting home watching in the fourth inning and see a
situation where I could have helped,'' he said. ''If some of us had
to do it, we all should have to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects Gotti son-in-law bail bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge has ruled that the son-in-law of
jailed mob boss John ''Dapper Don'' Gotti is a threat to the
community and denied his bail bid.
</P>
<P>
   In an order handed down Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Nina
Gershon reversed a decision by a federal magistrate which would
have allowed Carmine Agnello - a reputed Gambino crime family
solider - to be released on $18 million bond and put under house
arrest until his racketeering trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find clear and convincing evidence that the defendant
presents a danger to other persons and the community,'' Gershon
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Agnello's attorney, Scott Leemon, called the decision
''disappointing.'' The government, he added, ''conceives this as
another Gotti case, when it's not. We hope Mr. Agnello can get a
fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had opposed the release of Agnello, 38, who
has been in custody since March, when he was charged in Brooklyn
federal court with extortion, arson and income tax fraud in a
Queens scrap yard operation. They accused the defendant of engaging
in a pattern of witness tampering after his release on bail from a
related state case.
</P>
<P>
   During a series of bail hearings, Agnello himself took the stand
to deny he made a death threat against an unidentified cooperating
witness who turned him in. Prosecutors alleged that he had flashed
an ''Italian horns of death'' symbol - a hand signal with the
thumb, forefinger and pinkie extended - while searching for the
''snitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnello's wife, novelist Victoria Gotti, also told the
magistrate she would make sure her husband would behave if he were
freed on bail. She also agreed to put up her half of the couple's
$4.2 million Long Island mansion as collateral to bail her husband
out.

<HEADLINE> Belfast Protestant Parade Restricted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A government commission ordered
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant fraternal order on Thursday
to stay away from Catholic areas of north Belfast during a parade
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission placed restrictions on
the Orange Order's biennial ''Tour of the North'' march -- as it did
last time, in 1998. The commission said it made the decision
because of disturbances at the 1996 march and the likely impact on
relations between Protestants and Catholics if participants took
their intended route on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Orangemen and accompanying bands planned to take
part in the march in an area where sectarian divisions still run
deep.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ''Tour of the North'' parade was allowed to take its
traditional route through neighborhoods that a generation ago were
predominantly Protestant, but are now overwhelmingly Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Thursday, the commission noted ''the very serious
civil disturbances'' in 1996, ''with violent confrontation,
extensive damage to property and serious intimidation causing
significant and sustained damage to community relations in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week's parade was prohibited from going into parts of four
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said many Protestants saw the parade as a way
''to affirm a continuing Protestant identity in the area in the
face of perceived decline.''
</P>
<P>
   It also said various groups of Catholics had indicated that
parading through the contested areas ''would constitute little more
than an expression of sectarian triumphalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen's parades commemorate a variety of events important to
Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority, ranging from
17th-century victories over Catholics to Protestant casualties in
World War I. The Orangemen say Catholic protesters are denying
their right to public assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic protesters complain that the marches are
deliberately provocative, with their drum-thumping ''kick the
pope'' bands, and designed to make Catholics feel like second-class
citizens. Police have clashed violently with both sides in efforts
to keep them apart.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rejects Patient Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, holding ranks on a
politically charged issue, rejected a White House-backed patient
rights bill Thursday that would give Americans broad new authority
to sue their HMOs for denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-48 and came after GOP senators accused Democrats
of walking away from promising talks on a bipartisan compromise in
search of political advantage in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
was committing a ''cynical political act'' in forcing the vote. But
Kennedy, D-Mass., said the private talks thus far had been ''an
endless road to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The contentious debate unfolded on the Senate floor as officials
said House Republicans had quietly agreed to a larger role for the
federal government in their emerging plan for prescription drug
insurance for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., who has signed on as a supporter
of the measure, said he had been told the Department of Health and
Human Services would be empowered to step in and make sure
insurance was available in any region where private companies were
not willing to offer policies. Republican officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed his account, but offered no
details.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP, eager for a campaign-season show of
bipartisanship, pressed Democrats to join them in sponsoring their
Medicare prescription drug bill. Several Democrats, who refused to
be identified by name, said they were under pressure from their
leadership to deny the GOP support.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, though, said, ''I'm going to be there'' when the GOP
unveils its plan on Monday, a step he said was part of an effort to
bring greater HMO Medicare coverage to his state.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
party leaders were also attempting to gain backing from the
American Medical Association in advance of the formal announcement
of the legislation. Republicans also were hoping for a positive
signal from at least one insurance company, these officials said,
to cast doubt on claims that prescription drug policies would be
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote left the fate of a patients rights bill in
doubt. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the GOP whip, pledged to renew
the closed-door compromise efforts that he has been chairing. But
he and Republicans also said they may attempt to fashion a GOP
measure that some Democrats can support, and get it to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said, however, that the narrowness of the setback
indicated the effort to pass the measure was gaining ground, and
''a few more days like this and the Republicans will stop
stonewalling.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement saying he was disappointed
in the vote, adding it ''means that the American people will
continue to wait for the long overdue patient protections that they
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   All 51 votes against the measure were cast by Republicans.
Forty-four of the 45 Senate Democrats, joined by GOP Sens. Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, John McCain
of Arizona and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, registered their
support. Democrat Kent Conrad of North Dakota did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The patients' bill of rights affects thousands and thousands
of people on a daily basis,'' said Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota. ''Thousands of people who go into
hospitals and clinics hoping that the might be able to get the care
they so desperately need.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nickles argued that passage of the Democratic bill would
lead to a ''dramatic, draconian increase in the uninsured'' by
driving up the cost to businesses that now offer coverage for their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted in response to a spate of HMO horror stories, the bill
would give patients easier access to emergency rooms as well as
specialists and women would be permitted to see a gynecologist
without needing a referral from a primary care physician. Similar
legislation cleared the House last year, with the support of most
Democrats and some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill backed by the White House and congressional Democrats
would apply to all Americans with private health insurance.
Majority Republicans forced passage of a less sweeping measure in
the Senate last year, one that covered far fewer people and omitted
any right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-door negotiations to resolve differences between the two
bills have sputtered for months, although Republicans earlier this
week floated a compromise that envisioned a limited right to sue in
federal court, with restrictions on damages.
</P>
<P>
   The events during the day underscored that even though the
election is five months distant, time is running short in the
congressional calendar and the leaders of both parties are intent
on scoring political points before adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and Medicare both rank high among the issues voters
care most about, public opinion polls say. Democrats traditionally
have held an advantage on them -- and an internal House GOP survey
two weeks ago gave the Democrats a 20-point advantage on Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Census Reaches 97 Percent of Homes  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau has reached 97 percent of
the households in America, leaving 3.1 million homes that
census-takers must still find to gather information for the
once-a-decade count.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Census director Kenneth Prewitt
said his agency will increase efforts over the next month to find
the missing millions. He hopes to finish the door-to-door phase of
the census by early July.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states have completed all their cases for this phase of
Census 2000: Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, Utah,
Montana and Nebraska, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cases remaining are in big cities, including
neighborhoods with high concentrations of minority groups that are
traditionally undercounted, and areas with high-rise condominiums
and gated communities where people are more protective of their
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt visited Milwaukee, Chicago, Baltimore and Columbus,
Ohio, to boost head count efforts there.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau makes at least six attempts to find households
that did not return a form. If still unsuccessful, census-takers
will knock on a neighbor's door to try to get information on the
home, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a General Accounting Office report said that 10.8
million of the long forms, or 54.1 percent of the 20 million that
were mailed out, had been returned to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said that figure was
only 1.8 percentage points lower than what Census officials had
predicted before the count started.
</P>
<P>
   That is proof that criticism from several top Republicans,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, over
the intrusiveness of the 53-question long form did not affect the
public's perception of the count, said Chip Walker, spokesman for
Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform's
census subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's ranking
Democrat, disagreed, saying that a higher-than-expected short form
response allowed the Census Bureau to ''bail out political leaders
who attacked the long form.''
</P>
<P>
   Census spokesman Steve Jost said his agency has not determined
how many of the forms were not entirely completed, as some
Republicans had suggested doing. The Census Bureau said completed
forms were essential for the most accurate count.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Sell Kida To Japanese Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers announced Thursday that
right-hander Masao Kida cleared unconditional waivers and was sold
to the Orix BlueWave in the pitcher's home country of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kida, 31, ended his Tigers career with a 1-0 record and 6.42 ERA
in 50 relief appearances. He was 0-0 with a 10.13 ERA in two games
with the Tigers this season.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 appearances with the Tigers' Triple-A Toledo affiliate
this year, Kida was 2-1 with seven saves and a 2.16 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Kida signed a two-year contract worth $3 million in December
1998. He played the previous season for the BlueWave of the
Japanese Pacific League. Kida compiled a 54-64 record with a 3.81
ERA in 10 seasons in the Japanese leagues, all but one with the
Yomiuri Giants of the Central League.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak investigation focusing on contractors changes  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Amtrak is investigating why contractors
made hundreds of changes to the work plan for the $600 million
Northeast rail electrification project.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 subpoenas have been issued for documents from Balfour
Beatty Construction Inc. and Massachusetts Electric Construction
Co., Amtrak Inspector General Fred Weiderhold said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute changes are common in the construction industry,
especially for such a large, complex project as this, Weiderhold
said. But, the sheer number of changes made, for which the
companies requested reimbursement, was greater than expected, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas were issued after the companies failed to provide
documentation for the changes in a timely and complete way, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, agents raided the companies' joint office in Old
Saybrook and carted away vanloads of computers and documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing what we need to do to protect federal money,''
Weiderhold said. ''I expect we will continue to use our subpoenas
as we need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office are aiding the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've pulled a lot of documents and computers out of there and
we're going to look at them,'' said U.S. Attorney Stephen Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   More raids could follow at Balfour Beatty's Atlanta headquarters
or at Massachusetts Electric, in Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour Beatty-MEC, the joint venture working on the rail
project, issued a statement late Thursday expressing surprise at
the removal of the records. The companies said many of the
documents were already in Amtrak's possession, and federal
investigators had been given access to''voluminous technical and
accounting information.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disappointing that the records were removed without
first providing any indication why this course of action was
justified or appropriate,'' the companies said. ''BBC-MEC believes
that the changes and modifications to the contract are appropriate
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies so far have been paid about $487 million to
electrify 157 miles of rail between Boston and New Haven,
Weiderhold said.
</P>
<P>
   The project ties New England in with the electric rail system
that runs to Washington and is expected to cut two hours off the
time it takes to travel by train from Boston to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The entire joint contract is worth $680 million for the
companies, Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is not expected to further delay completion of
the project or the introduction of the new Acela trains along the
corridor, Remington said. Amtrak is planning to introduce Acela
Express trains in late July.
</P>
<P>
   About three miles of rail in the Boston area still needs to be
electrified. Amtrak is awaiting delivery of the new trains, from
another contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak awarded the contract to Balfour Beatty and Massachusetts
Electric after the original construction firm hired to do the job,
Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, ran into financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour Beatty has said it needed to redo much of that work,
costing Amtrak much more than the original price tag of $321
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been looking at issues concerning Balfour Beatty for a
while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiderhold said the contractors claimed in some cases they did
not have enough time to do the work, unless they added extra shifts
or purchased extra equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak told the contractors to do what they needed to get the
job done on time, but now auditors must determine if the added
expense was really necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors' work cuts across Connecticut, Rhode Island and
Massachusetts, and had to be done while the trains kept running.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour Beatty installed poles and devices to hold the wires, as
well as any buildings needed to hold equipment. Massachusetts
Electric installed the actual wires and tied the system into the
electric grid.

<HEADLINE> Senate OK's transportation bill as Whitman, Assembly resistance wanes </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Senate President Donald DiFrancesco not
only won enough votes Thursday to get his $4 billion transportation
bill through the Senate, he seems to have broken the resistance to
getting his ambitious proposal signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman on Thursday said she had lingering
concerns about tying up so much state money through 2004 without
any new revenue source, but her comments were less rigid on the
issue than previously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want everybody to make sure they understand what the
long term ramifications of decisions are,'' Whitman said. ''Every
time we take some general revenue funds off the table and put them
aside for specific, refined and defined usage, you take away
flexibility in the out years. That is just a concern to have in the
backs of their minds as they move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   This concern the governor wants lawmakers to be mindful of had
been firm opposition just two months ago, but there are now only
three weeks before the Legislature recesses for the summer so time
for dealing and amending is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said he preferred the $3 billion
bill in his house, but said it was an error to make too much over
the differences between the Senate and Assembly versions of the
bill. ''We agree on far more than we disagree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, it was DiFrancesco who refused to budge from his
four-year, $4 billion package plan. He cited the fact the
Transportation Trust Fund, which funds and finances highway
projects, had always had stable funding over several years instead
of relying on year-by-year appropriations from the general budget.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman on Thursday agreed this long view of financing the trust
fund still made sense.
</P>
<P>
   But until now Whitman has been reluctant to embrace
DiFrancesco's idea of diverting funds from the state's general
treasury and permanently dedicating them to transportation
purposes. DiFrancesco has targeted automobile-related revenues such
as extra funds from the gas tax, a gross receipts tax charged on
oil products, and the tax collected on automotive sales.
</P>
<P>
   On the sales tax, for instance, his bill would divert $80
million next year, $120 million in 2002 and $200 million in 2003 -
all of which is money that currently is used for other state
operations or state aid.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco also turned aside a spirited attempt by Senate
Democrats on Thursday to amend his bill to make sure the trust fund
over the next four years did not build highways that triggered more
suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sprawl is really emerging as a significant issue affecting
voters, affecting people everywhere in this state,'' said Sen. John
Adler, D-Camden. ''I am fearful that as we continue to build roads
everywhere ... we will increase traffic congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   After calling for amendments without success, Democrats gave up
and largely supported the final measure anyway. It passed 33-3.
</P>
<P>
   However, a companion bill to seek voter approval in November for
a constitutional amendment to divert these funds permanently to the
trust fund failed to get enough votes Thursday, so DiFrancesco
pulled it and will try another vote in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment would guarantee that the same funds
being used this year would be there for the Transportation Trust
Fund after June 2001. DiFrancesco said his main transportation bill
could move forward without this permanent dedication but that he
would prefer to have it.

<HEADLINE> Panel Clears Money Laundering Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to combat money laundering --
giving the government new authority to ban some transactions
between U.S. banks and offshore havens -- overwhelmingly cleared the
House Banking Committee on Thursday and appeared headed toward
House passage.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes as a trial opened in Florida, where five people
stand accused of participating in a money-laundering and investment
scam that allegedly robbed some 400 victims, including Dionne
Warwick, of $60 million. The case, dubbed ''Operation Risky
Business,'' which used a Caribbean bank, is said to be the biggest
money-laundering case not involving drugs ever pursued by the U.S.
Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Most money laundering involves illicit profits from drug
trafficking, prostitution or other criminal activities, which are
moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts to make them
appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering absorbs nearly $600 billion annually, or up to
5 percent of the world's gross domestic product. Public attention
focused on money laundering after last summer's revelations that
the Bank of New York, one of the nation's largest, had served as a
conduit for an astonishing $7 billion in Russian money, some of it
believed to be from criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Committee voted, 31-1, to approve the legislation,
the fruit of cooperation between the Clinton administration and key
Republican lawmakers. It combines earlier anti-money-laundering
proposals from the administration and Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the
banking panel's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation will give the Secretary of the Treasury
additional tools to root out international money-laundering havens,
which are used to funnel dirty money ... into the legitimate
international financial network,'' Leach said before the vote.
''Unfortunately, the U.S. banking system is hardly immune from the
dirty money that flows all too freely through the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give the Treasury Department the power to ask
U.S. financial institutions to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an offshore bank or financial company. In cases
where foreign governments shield banks from investigation, Treasury
would have the authority to cut them off from the U.S. financial
system without seeking congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called the Banking Committee
vote ''a significant step forward in our fight to protect the U.S.
financial system against international money laundering and to
confront those countries that serve as ready havens to hide and
move dirty money around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Risky Business'' case, law enforcement officials say
the defendants set up a bank on Antigua to hide profits from their
scam, which offered venture capital loans in ads in major U.S.
newspapers. Prospective borrowers, including Warwick, were asked to
pay ''advance fees'' ranging from $50,000 to $900,000, and to sign
a contract requiring them to obtain a letter of credit from a bank
for $2 million to $20 million -- within a week -- as a guarantee for
the loan.
</P>
<P>
   When the borrowers were unable to get letters of credit that
quickly, they were told they had violated the contract and their
''advance fees'' were taken from them, according to law enforcement
officials. Some people involved in the scheme already have pleaded
guilty. The trial of five defendants opened in federal court in
Gainesville, Fla., this week.

<HEADLINE> Korean Rookie Tied for LPGA Lead  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- South Korean rookie Jeong Jang, playing
in only her eighth LPGA tournament, opened with a 2-under-par 70
Thursday and was tied with Wendy Doolan of Australia for the lead
at the Rochester International.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not excited at all because I've been in this kind of
situation many times,'' said the 19-year-old Jang, who joined the
U.S. tour as one of the leading amateur golfers in her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get excited, next day I don't play very well, so I try to
subdue my excitement,'' she added through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Nine players were one shot off the lead, notably South Korean Se
Ri Pak and LPGA veteran Dale Eggeling. LaRee Pearl Sugg, making a
comeback on the professional circuit this year after a three-year
absence, had a double-bogey 6 on No. 18 and dropped to a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Jang, a native of Taejeon who lives in Los Angeles, finished in
a 13th-place tie at the Electrolux USA Championship in May, was in
the top 50 in three other events and missed the cut three times.
</P>
<P>
   She tied for 37th at the LPGA final qualifying tournament. Her
nonexempt status means she must either qualify for tournaments or
join a waiting list to fill a vacant slot.
</P>
<P>
   Jang chipped in from 20 yards off the 16th green for one of six
birdies at the tree-lined Locust Hill course but also had four
bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Doolan, 33, who is seeking her first win after four years on the
U.S. tour, said swirling winds made play very tricky at times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have been coming together,'' said the soft-spoken
Doolan, who has accumulated three top-10 finishes in three months,
including a career-best third-place tie at the Electrolux USA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   A rainstorm slowed play in late afternoon while a batch of
players vying for the lead were still on the back nine of an
already soggy course.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Karrie Webb of Australia, already a four-time
winner this year, shot a 2-over 74. A year ago, after opening with
a season-high 75, she squeaked past Cindy McCurdy on the final day
with three birdies on the last three holes.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Grace Park, who earned her first LPGA title at the
Kathy Ireland Greens.com LPGA Classic last week, tumbled back to
reality with an 82. Naree Song Wongluekiet, a 14-year-old from
Thailand, shot a 75, but her twin sister, Aree, faded with an 80.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle McGann got to three under, then dropped six shots on
the back nine and finished at three over.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old tournament's main sponsor is Wegmans, a regional
grocery store chain that hiked the purse from $700,000 to $1
million last year to lure marquee players like Webb and Sweden's
Annika Sorenstam, who shot a 76.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Military Recognizes Fujimori  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- In an unusual move, the armed forces on
Thursday formally recognized President Alberto Fujimori as their
supreme commander for a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's armed forces traditionally wait until after the
presidential inauguration, set for July 28, before swearing
allegiance to the executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this recognition of my position a full expression
of the subordination of the armed forces and national police to
civil power,'' said Fujimori, during a ceremony held on the grounds
of the military's command center, known as the ''Pentagonito,'' or
little Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The military announcement was ''a guarantee of the nation's
political stability,'' Fujimori said defiantly, flanked by three
rows of high-ranking officers.
</P>
<P>
   Defeated presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo has vowed to
put 4 million protesters onto Lima's streets on July 26 to block
Fujimori's inauguration two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who boycotted the May 28 presidential runoff vote,
claiming it was rigged, said Fujimori's victory was fraudulent and
calls the 61-year-old leader ''a dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   During the election campaign, Toledo, 54, contended that a
segment of military officers were growing increasingly discontent
with the politicization of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the military to oppose Fujimori's ''illegal''
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military leaders demonstrated that none of that has worked
and that they remain solidly behind the president,'' said Michael
Radu, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States, which refused to monitor
the voting, said the election was ''far from what could be
considered free or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAS on Monday stopped short of questioning Fujimori's
victory or imposing sanctions. Instead it resolved to send a
high-level mission to Peru to work on strengthening democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is credited with defeating two leftist insurgency
movements, co-opted the armed forces early in his 10-year
presidency by eliminating a time-honored promotion system based on
seniority and merit and installing loyalists in key posts.

<HEADLINE> O.J., Denise Brown Exchange Insults  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- O.J. Simpson and Denise Brown exchanged insults
in a televised confrontation Thursday, with his ex-sister-in-law
calling Simpson ''a pig'' for suggesting she wanted to have sex
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson called in to a live Fox News Channel discussion that
included Brown. He was angry that Fox News Live host Shepard Smith
had suggested Simpson testified that he had taken a polygraph after
his ex-wife's murder, something Simpson has denied.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion quickly turned personal.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes you think you could pass it now?'' said Brown, who
was interviewed in a studio in Anaheim, Calif. ''You murdered
Nicole and you know you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 murders of
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. However, he
was found liable for their deaths in a subsequent civil trial and
was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the show Thursday, Simpson and Brown bickered over money,
with Simpson saying he had been generous to the Brown family before
his ex-wife's slaying and that Brown had profited from the
attention she received in the aftermath of the court cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I avoid the media as much as I can,'' said Simpson, who called
from an undisclosed location. ''If there's a door opening, you guys
are showing up. You put your faces on TV so you can make money.
You're the only person who's benefited from this, Denise. You've
made money. You're not on welfare anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she and her family never received money from Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't get along because you couldn't control me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson retorted: ''We didn't get along because Nicole was
afraid you were going to have sex with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Your ego is riding a little bit too high,'' Brown said.
''Simpson, you're a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox News Channel's Smith tried unsuccessfully to get Simpson to
commit to taking a lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be some dancing monkey for you guys,''
Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson hung up after further discussion about the polygraph.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, appearing on a later Fox News Channel show Thursday, said
that after the argument, Simpson called her mother and apologized
for some of his comments.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Seeks Self for Coach Slot  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson said no, so
Illinois athletic director Ron Guenther moved on Thursday to the
next name on his list of potential Illini basketball coaches --
Tulsa's Bill Self.
</P>
<P>
   University of Tulsa sports information director Don Tomkalski
said Guenther called athletic director Judy MacLeod at
mid-afternoon Thursday asking permission to talk with Self about
the Illinois job.
</P>
<P>
   Tomkalski said he did not know whether Guenther had followed
through and contacted Self, who could not immediately be reached by
The Associated Press for comment. Guenther also was not available
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa television station KJRH quoted Self as saying he was
extremely interested in talking with Illinois, although Self
declined to appear on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther's call came less than 24 hours after Sampson spurned
Illinois. Sampson said he talked with Guenther and decided against
leaving the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   Under Self, Tulsa went 32-5 last season and reached the regional
finals of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history.
In his three seasons there, the Golden Hurricane were 74-27.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Sampson, Self's name has regularly surfaced when
college coaching jobs opened this year. Earlier this year, Self
resisted a higher-paying job at Nebraska. Last week, he signed an
amended contract with the school that reportedly raised his pay
from $350,000 to $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa is a private university that does not disclose workers'
salaries, but the Tulsa World has reported the deal -- a result of
fund-raising by university boosters -- also guarantees Self an
annuity of $750,000 to $1 million if he coaches the Golden
Hurricane for five more years.
</P>
<P>
   Several media outlets reported Thursday that Self and Oregon's
Ernie Kent were Guenther's next targets, but Oregon spokesman Dave
Williford said his coach and athletic director had not heard from
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois athletic department spokesman Kent Brown said no news
conferences were slated Friday, but circumstances could change
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Sampson, Self and other candidates, Brown said, ''I
can't confirm or deny any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was at his Norman, Okla., basketball camp Thursday and
was not available to elaborate on his reasons for saying no to
Guenther. He released a statement Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being considered for any job reinforces that you are part of a
win-win situation,'' Sampson said. ''Oklahoma is a win -- for myself
and for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports of a $1 million offer, Sampson's coaching
brethren said he has a good thing going in Norman, where he is
130-62 in six seasons and has made the NCAA tournament each year.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 3, Indians 0  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez just keeps getting better.
</P>
<P>
   His mastery of the Cleveland Indians grew even stronger Thursday
night as he allowed one hit in eight innings, winning his second
straight pitcher's duel, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett's 21st homer of the season, leading off the seventh
inning against Bartolo Colon (6-3), gave the Boston Red Sox the
offense they needed as Martinez (9-2) allowed no runs for the
fourth time in his last five starts. Derek Lowe pitched the ninth
for his 13th save in 15 chances, allowing one hit.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start May 28, Martinez beat Roger Clemens and
the New York Yankees 2-0 on Trot Nixon's two-run homer in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The AL's 1998 Cy Young award winner is 8-0 in his career against
Cleveland, including 2-0 in the playoffs, and handed the Indians
their first shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez extended his scoreless streak to 22 innings and lowered
his ERA to 0.95. Perhaps even more impressive is the number of hits
he's allowed per nine innings, 4.75. He struck out 10 and walked
one.
</P>
<P>
   He showed no ill effects from missing his last scheduled start
with a sore left side Saturday night in Philadelphia. Pitching for
the first time in 11 days, Martinez allowed only a clean
ground-rule double to right field by Russell Branyan with two outs
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was helped by two excellent fielding plays, a sliding
catch by right fielder Nixon in the third and a diving stop by
second baseman Jeff Frye in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Cleveland in the fifth game of the AL division series
last year, he pitched six hitless relief innings in his first
appearance since hurting his back in the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Colon was sharp through seven innings before allowing RBI
singles by Brian Daubach and Mike Stanley in the eighth. He gave up
three runs on nine hits in 7 2-3 innings, striking out nine and
walking two.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Branyan, the only runners against Martinez on Thursday
were Roberto Alomar, who reached on a throwing error by catcher
Jason Varitek in the first, and Richie Sexson, who walked after
Branyan doubled in the fifth. But Martinez then fielded Einar
Diaz's grounder and stepped on first base himself to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar left the game in the third with a head contusion after
Varitek's throw hit him in the back of the helmet. He was listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez faced the Indians for the first time since April 30
when he was ejected after hitting Alomar with a pitch in the
eighth. Earlier that game, Martinez sent Diaz sprawling with a
high, inside pitch. Cleveland's Charles Nagy then hit Jose Offerman
with a pitch. Martinez and Boston manager Jimy Williams were
ejected after Alomar was hit, and Martinez was suspended for five
games.
</P>
<P>
   On his first at-bat Thursday, Diaz was booed loudly. He swung at
and missed the first two pitches, then flied out to center.
</P>
<P>
   After Alomar reached base, Martinez retired the next 12 batters,
four on strikeouts, before Branyan's double.
</P>
<P>
   Colon was nearly as stingy until Everett's homer.
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff single by Frye starting the first, Nixon struck
out and Nomar Garciaparra grounded into a double play. After a
one-out walk to Daubach in the second, Colon retired the next 10
batters, five on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary's single broke the string with two outs in the
sixth, and he went to third on Varitek's single. But Wilton Veras
ended the inning with a popout.
</P>
<P>
   Colon retired the side in order in the sixth before Everett's
homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez beat Colon 1-0 in Boston on a solo homer by Midre
Cummings on July 15, 1998. ... One of Martinez's two losses was a
1-0 game May 6 against Tampa Bay in Boston. ... The Red Sox are 5-6
in their last 11 games. The Indians have lost twice in their last
seven. ... Diaz and Alomar were the only Cleveland hitters who
didn't strike out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks released wide
receiver Sean Dawkins, who led the team with 992 yards receiving
last season, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren, the Seahawks' executive vice president and coach,
tried to restructure Dawkins' contract but the two sides could not
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough decision, but in order to sign our draft

trying to get things in order so that this type of situation won't
happen in the future.''
</P>

   Dawkins signed with the Seahawks last offseason as an
unrestricted free agent. He played in 16 games, started 13 and had

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Name St. Dept for Truman  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress gave final approval Thursday to a
bill that would name State Department headquarters for Harry S
Truman, the nation's 33rd president.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was sponsored by the entire Missouri
congressional delegation. The House approved it May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft said the renaming proves today's values
mirror Truman's: ''Freedom and democracy for all people, support
and faithfulness for all of Americas allies, and the courage and
compassion to stand up for America's highest values whenever they
are threatened by totalitarians and dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both are Republicans, Missouri's senators have strong
ties to the Democrat from Independence, Mo. Ashcroft's Senate seat
was Truman's from 1935 to 1945, when Truman became vice president,
and Sen. Christopher S. Bond now occupies Truman's old offices in
the historic Russell Building.
</P>
<P>
   Another sponsor, longtime Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, knew
Truman and as a teen-ager attended his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, who rose to the presidency after the death of Franklin
Roosevelt, led the nation during a tumultuous period in world
affairs, overseeing the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan, the
end of World War II, the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, the birth
of Israel, the beginning of the Cold War and the Berlin airlift and
the outbreak of the Korean War.

House Votes on Workplace Injuries

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a defeat for organized labor, the House voted today to
block federal rules aimed at preventing some of the 1.8 million workplace
injuries that occur each year. On an issue that has pitted unions against
business for a decade, the House voted 220-203 to stop the government from

program disguised as a movie clip on 2,000 commercial and home computers,
positioning themselves to launch an attack designed to shut down Web sites.
Network Security Technologies, which does work for the Justice Department, said
the hackers, who used the nicknames ''Serbian'' and ''Badman,'' tested their
network of infected computers last night and could launch an attack at any time.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Praise Keizo Obuchi  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- At Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's state funeral
Thursday, his successor stumbled over the eulogy and even missed a
second bow of respect when he laid a white chrysanthemum -- the
latest in a string of gaffes for new premier Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral, held at a Tokyo assembly hall, drew 6,000 people
who paid their respects as the piano notes of a Chopin nocturne
filled the air, evoking memories of Obuchi's well-known love for
music. Mourners, some in tears, gushed praise for the fallen
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's private funeral was held May 16, two days after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   While still alive, he received mixed reviews for his efforts to
turn around the ailing economy through enormous public spending.
After his from a stroke at age 62, he was lauded as a visionary
politician.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasted with the view of Mori, whose lapses in protocol
at the funeral added to an already skeptical view of the new
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing and ritual are extremely important in Japanese culture.
The other guests, including President Clinton, seemed to have no
problem remembering to bow once before approaching the stage, again
before placing the flower and a third time afterward. Except for
Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who must lead his ruling party into an election June 25,
has seen his popularity ratings plummet.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly controversial blunder, Mori referred to Japan
as ''a divine nation'' centered around the emperor. The comment
drew outcries about a World War II imperialist mentality of
emperor-worship.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has repeatedly denied he was speaking about the prewar
imperial system and apologized for any misunderstanding. But he has
refused to retract the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's careless with his remarks, and that has people worried,''
said 41-year-old truck driver Katsumi Ito. ''I think Obuchi did a
better job. Up to his death, he was working really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori had initially banked on an easy campaign, billing himself
as pushing on with Obuchi's policies.
</P>
<P>
   The June 25 election date, which would have been Obuchi's 63rd
birthday, was seen as helping secure a sympathy vote for the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Mori's ''divine nation'' remark and the inelegant way he
handled himself about it -- cracking jokes about slips of the tongue
-- have left many Japanese a trifle disgusted, leading to a possible
election setback for the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats have ruled Japan almost continuously since
World War II. More recently, the party has not controlled
majorities in both houses of Parliament and rules in a coalition
with two other conservative parties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the opposition can't win enough votes to secure the
premiership, Mori is expected to be quickly replaced by another
Liberal Democrat after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''By his indecency, Mori has shattered the myth of the great,
unbeatable Liberal Democrats,'' said political commentator Minoru
Morita. ''If he had kept his mouth shut, he could have passed
himself off as Obuchi reincarnated.''
</P>
<P>
   The words of praise that flowed Thursday focused on Obuchi.
Initially ridiculed for his lack of flash, he won over public trust
through his understated but, some say, carefully crafted political
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, chairman of Seibu Railway, fought
back tears when recalling Obuchi as a friend and a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is even the slightest light dawning for Japan's
economy, that credit goes to you,'' Tsutsumi said in a speech at
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, at the residence of U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Foley, Clinton, too, praised Obuchi's character.
</P>
<P>
   ''Early in his career, Prime Minister Obuchi competed for votes
in the same district as two former prime ministers,'' Clinton said.
''He used to describe himself as a 'noodle shop sandwiched between
two skyscrapers.' As usual, he was being modest.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Serb Violence Condemned  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top Clinton administration adviser
condemned the ''systematic'' violence against Kosovo's dwindling
Serb minority Thursday as the European Union's security chief
called on NATO and U.N. officials to do more to Keep the peace in
the convulsed province.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violence that we are seeing against Serbs ... seems to be
systematic,'' said James O'Brien, special Balkans adviser to
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. ''We believe
that those responsible should be brought to justice as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's remarks come ahead of Monday's first anniversary of
the arrival of NATO and Russian troops in Kosovo under an agreement
which ended NATO's 78-day bombing campaign aimed at punishing
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for his crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he was dispatched to Pristina by Albright to convey
U.S. concern about a backlash against Serbs in the province that
has left several people dead in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, five Serb policemen were injured when their vehicle
struck a land mine planted by Kosovo Albanian ''terrorist gangs''
near the province's volatile border with central Serbia, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement distributed by the official Tanjug news agency,
Serb police accused the international peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo of complicity in the attack because of its alleged
''tolerance and lack of action'' against ethnic Albanian
''terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he met with moderate Serb leaders as well as
leading Kosovo Albanians to express U.S. concern over the recent
attacks. His aides handed out statements from Kosovo Albanian
leaders Ibrahim Rugova and Hashim Thaci pledging to work to counter
the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Serb violence -- much of it revenge-taking for the crackdown
on Kosovo Albanians that left an estimated 10,000 dead and hundreds
of thousands refugees before last year's Serb military withdrawal --
has led many Serbs to flee the province.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with a key Serb leader, the European Union's
top security official said Thursday that NATO and the United
Nations must do more to curb the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, who was NATO secretary-general during the
alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia last year, also appealed to Serbs
in the divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica to join with the ethnic
Albanians in institutions which the United Nations is trying to
build in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Serbian National Council, which groups moderate
Kosovo Serbs, broke off participation in the province's U.N.
interim government -- an embarrassing illustration of the U.N.
failure to create an environment in which Serbs and ethnic
Albanians can peacefully coexist.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the United Nations Thursday, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said that although much progress needs to be
made in Kosovo, the international community should be proud of
having intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was going on in Kosovo before we all stepped in was
impossible,'' she said, citing the ''ethnic cleansing'' by Serb
forces of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a long way to go, but I think we also have to
remember how far we have come and how important it was that the
international community took steps for Kosovo,'' Albright said.
''It is something I think we should all be very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   The German Parliament, meanwhile, approved Thursday a one-year
extension of a mandate for its troops to remain in Kosovo, with all
major parties backing the move.
</P>
<P>
   While the main opposition conservatives insisted that the
mandate must be debated again in a year, they joined Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's centrist Social Democrats and the Greens in
agreeing that the presence of German troops as part of the
international peace keeping force was vital.

<HEADLINE> Padres To Promote Reyes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres plan to promote
right-handed reliever Carlos Reyes on Friday, and send right-hander
Domingo Guzman back to Triple-A Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres will make room for Reyes on the 40-man roster by
moving left-hander Sterling Hitchcock from the 15-day disabled list
to the 60-day DL, general manager Kevin Towers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes returned to the Padres' organization for the third time
when he signed a minor league contract on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was promoted on Wednesday to take the roster spot of
right-hander Brian Boehringer, who went on the DL for the second
time this season, with tendinitis in his right shoulder. Guzman
pitched one inning in Wednesday's 10-4 loss at Oakland, allowing
one run, one hit and a walk.

<HEADLINE> Notes on Thursday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Indians-Red Sox:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Kane Davis was called up from Triple-A Buffalo of
the International League. The Indians optioned LHP Mark Watson to
Buffalo. Watson was 0-1 with an 8.53 ERA in six relief appearances
for Cleveland. ... C Einar Diaz was loudly booed when he faced
Boston's Pedro Martinez for the first time in the third inning. On
April 30, he hit the ground to avoid a high, inside pitch by
Martinez. Cleveland RHP Charles Nagy then hit Jose Offerman with a
pitch, and Martinez was ejected after hitting 2B Roberto Alomar
with a pitch. ... 3B Travis Fryman and OF David Justice have
trouble just getting the bat on the ball against Martinez. Entering
the game, Justice fanned 14 times in 37 at-bats, Fryman 12 times in
20-at bats against the right-hander. Both struck out in their first
at-bats Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Martinez only allowed runs in two of his last six starts
before Thursday night. In that span, he allowed just four runs and
27 hits in 49 innings. Three of his last five appearances were
complete games. ... Three of Boston's lefthanded-hitting regulars
entered the game in big slumps. 1B Brian Daubach was 5-for-41
(.122), OF Trot Nixon was 3-for-22 (.136) and OF Troy O'Leary was
19-for-96 (.198). ... With Thursday's makeup of a rained out game
on April 23, the Red Sox play in three different cities in three
days. They finished a three-game series in Florida on Wednesday,
played in Boston on Thursday, and start a three-game series in
Atlanta on Friday.
INTERLEAGUE:
Orioles-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Most of the Orioles were forced to fly back to
Baltimore after Wednesday's game because of a lack of hotel rooms
in the New York area. The team landed shortly before 1 a.m., went
back to Camden Yards and returned to their homes. They arrived at
Shea Stadium a little after 4 p.m. Thursday. ''It wasn't that bad.
It was a lot easier than getting to Port St. Lucie in spring
training,'' manager Mike Hargrove said. Cal Ripken, Brady Anderson,
Charles Johnson, Albert Belle, Jose Mercedes and Scott Erickson
stayed on their own in New York, and Friday's starter Pat Rapp
remained in Baltimore. ... RHP Calvin Maduro will join Triple-A
Rochester to begin a rehab assignment Friday. The Orioles hope to
have him back next week. ... Belle singled in the first inning to
extend his hitting streak to 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: OF Darryl Hamilton, out since the first week of the
season with a sprained left foot, took batting practice and is
close to beginning a rehab assignment. ... INF-OF Ryan McGuire
accepted his demotion to Triple-A Norfolk. ... OF Jon Nunnally,
designated for assignment by the Mets last week, will sign a
contract with the Orix BlueWave of Japan's Pacific League after he
clears waivers Monday.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Astros-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Mike Maddux, who was eligible to come off the disabled
list Monday after sitting out two weeks because of a strained right
groin, will have a couple of bullpen sessions before pitching
another simulated game later on this road trip. ''I threw one on
Tuesday, but it didn't go as well as we had wanted it to,
health-wise,'' Maddux said. ''So I kind of took a step backwards
and I'll have to start over at square one -- square two, anyway.
Maybe I overloaded it a little bit too soon. I can't do anybody any
good If I'm not able to do what I'm capable of doing.'' ... The
Astros' pitching staff has allowed more home runs than any team in
the majors except Kansas City. But they are the only NL team that
has yet to commit a balk this season. ... Richard Hidalgo, Craig
Biggio and Jeff Bagwell have been hit by pitches a combined 29
times. Their combined home run total is 33. ... The Astros have
lost 10 consecutive one-run decisions on the road, including all
eight this season.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: With Orel Hershiser doing some fine-tuning on his
mechanics with Class-A San Bernardino, the Astros were safe from
the right-hander -- who already has hit Houston batters six times in
two appearances, including Richard Hidalgo three times. ''I would
say Hidalgo's probably very happy,'' Hershiser joked. ''But they
know it wasn't intentional. I mean, this is a game of professionals
-- especially in that locker room. So they know that somebody with
my reputation would not be out there headhunting and that there
must have been a problem. And absolutely there was, because my
mechanics were that far off.'' ... No. 1 draft pick Ben Diggins got
a close-up look at his future digs when the Dodgers gave him the
grand tour of Dodger Stadium before Thursday night's game with the
Astros. ''The last time I was here, I was in the nosebleed section.
So it was neat to go down on the field, get a different perspective
and meet the players,'' said the 6-foot-7 right-hander, 10-4 with a
3.83 ERA in his sophomore season with the Arizona Wildcats. ... The
Dodgers obtained 18-year-old right-hander Kenny Lutz from the
Cincinnati Reds on Thursday, completing the April 1 trade that sent
reserve SS Juan Castro to Cincinnati. Lutz, who has spent this
season in extended spring training in Florida, was 0-4 with a 6.50
ERA in nine starts and three relief appearances for the Reds' Gulf
Coast team in 1999.

Frederic Dard
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONNEFONTAINE, Switzerland (AP) -- Popular French writer Frederic
Dard, the author of more than 300 novels including the ''San
Antonio'' detective fiction series, died Tuesday of a heart attack.
He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Dard worked as a journalist in Lyon from 1942 to 1950 before
dedicating himself to novels, theater and film. He used a number of
pseudonyms, among them Frederic Charles, Kaput and L'Ange Noir (The
Black Angel), and sold more than 270 million books.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote more than 140 novels in the ''San Antonio'' series,
recounting the adventures of police superintendent San Antonio and
his faithful sidekick, Inspector Berurier.
</P>
<P>
   Dard's last work, ''Napoleon Pommier,'' was published three
weeks ago.
</P>

Janis V. Giorgi
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Janis V. Giorgi, a leading AIDS researcher
who helped expand the understanding of how the body fights HIV
infection, died May 30 of uterine cancer. She was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgi, an immunologist at the University of California,
concentrated her research on how specific cells in the immune
system help protect some HIV-positive patients from developing
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   She also designed a reliable test that predicts whether HIV
would progress into AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to work after her cancer diagnosis, finalizing
plans for UCLA's first human HIV vaccine trial.
</P>
<P>
Jack Kroll
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jack Kroll, the award-winning Newsweek drama
critic whose career covered more than half the magazine's
existence, died Thursday of colon cancer. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll won awards for writing on the 1980 death of John Lennon
and a 1982 cover story on comedian Richard Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll joined Newsweek in 1963 as an associate editor in charge
of the arts section. He was responsible for 19 cover stories and
more than 1,200 articles in his 37-year Newsweek career.
</P>
<P>
   At Newsweek, he was promoted to senior editor in charge of all
cultural sections in 1964, became drama critic in 1967, and was
named critic-at-large in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek special edition on ''The Arts in America,'' directed
by Kroll, won a 1974 National Magazine Award and a Page One Award
from the Newspaper Guild of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll won a George Jean Nathan Award for dramatic criticism in
1980, an ASCAP/Deems Taylor Award in 1981 for his Lennon piece, and
a Page One Award for his 1982 story on Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   His last cover story was a Dec. 14, 1998, piece on Nicole
Kidman's Broadway debut in ''The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroll is survived by his wife, Joan Engels, a senior photo
editor at Newsweek, two children and a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
Jeff MacNelly
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Tribune cartoonist Jeff MacNelly,
three-time Pulitzer Prize winner and creator of the daily comic
strip ''Shoe,'' died early Thursday of lymphoma. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   MacNelly won the Pulitzer Prize for his editorial cartoons in
1972, 1978 and 1985. He won his first when he was only 24, after
working at the Richmond News Leader in Virginia for just 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 10 years at the News Leader, he joined the
Tribune in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But editorial cartoons weren't his only outlet. In 1977,
MacNelly began the daily comic strip ''Shoe,'' about a newspaper's
cranky editor and its two-bit hacks, all of whom just happen to be
birds. The cigar-chomping boss of the Treetops Tattler was P.
Martin Shoemaker, inspired by MacNelly's former boss Jim Shumaker,
now a University of North Carolina professor.
</P>
<P>
   He also illustrated humorist Dave Barry's syndicated column.
</P>
<P>
   The New York native took his first cartooning job in 1969 when
he dropped out of the University of North Carolina to take a
$120-per-week position with a weekly paper in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   MacNelly continued to produce ''Shoe'' and other cartoons until
his death.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Susan, and sons Danny, 25, and Matt,
13. Another son, Jeffrey Jr., died in 1996 of injuries received in
a rock-climbing accident in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Dona Agueda Martinez
</P>
<P>
   SANTA FE (AP) -- Weaver Dona Agueda Martinez, nationally known
for her serapes and colorful rugs, died Tuesday of a heart attack.
She was 102.
</P>
<P>
   The serapes and colorful rugs Martinez wove earned her national
recognition through a documentary on her work that was nominated
for an Academy Award in 1977. Her work is on display from the
Smithsonian Museum of American History to the state Capitol in
Santa Fe to an Albuquerque museum.
</P>
<P>
Dooley D. Shorty
</P>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Dooley D. Shorty, a Navajo man who
helped train the tribe's Code Talkers who played a key role in
America's eventual victory over Japan in World War II, died Sunday
following a brief illness. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Shorty was assigned to train fellow Navajos
in the deeply secret code based on the Navajo native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The 400 or so Navajo Code Talkers, as they were called,
transmitted messages in that language, undecipherable by the
Japanese military. The operation remained classified for 23 years
after the war ended.
</P>
<P>
Mackay Yanagisawa
</P>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Mackay Yanagisawa, founder of the Hula Bowl and
the Aloha Bowl college football games, died recently following a
long illness. He was 87. His family asked that no information be
released.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in 1935 as a salesman for a sporting goods
company, Yanagisawa was manager of the old Honolulu Stadium and
later Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa, who also managed several Hawaii baseball leagues,
sold the Hula Bowl in 1974 to Gannett Corp. The game was later
given to the University of Hawaii Foundation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Drug Indictment  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. government is seeking an
indictment on cocaine smuggling charges against an American
Airlines employee who is also the son of a former prime minister of
the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenrick Simmonds, who works for American subsidiary American
Eagle on St. Kitts, is wanted for conspiracy to distribute cocaine,
Michael Vigil, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's
Caribbean operations, told The Associated Press Thursday. U.S.
authorities plan to ask for Simmonds to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds is the son of former Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds
and an alleged co-conspirator with another St. Kitts man, William
Bridgewater, who was arrested June 2 by DEA agents on a boat in
international waters off St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Barbados said Bridgewater, 28, was arrested
as he was traveling to the Dutch island of St. Maarten to pick up
payment for an 11-pound cocaine shipment he had delivered to
undercover DEA agents in St. Kitts. He is in custody in Puerto Rico
pending a June 19 hearing on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Simmonds had met previously with undercover DEA agents in San
Juan to sell the cocaine to them and arrange its shipment to the
United States, the embassy said. Simmonds and Bridgewater received
$8,000 as a down payment on the shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgewater is an accused member of a smuggling ring allegedly
operated by Charles ''Little Nut'' Miller, who was extradited from
St. Kitts to Miami in February to face trial for a half-ton cocaine
shipment to the United States.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Nikki McCray scored 21 points and Chamique
Holdsclaw added 15 as the Washington Mystics defeated the Miami Sol
73-51 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Sam led Miami with 11 points, and Katrina Colleton added

a 14-6 surge that opened a 53-42 lead for the Mystics with less
than eight minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Miami led 10-6 to start the game, but Washington went on a 16-4

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in L.A. Cop's Kin Death  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An alleged member of the Crips street gang
was charged Thursday with murdering Police Chief Bernard C. Parks'
granddaughter, the accidental victim of a war between rival gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Gonzalez, 20, was shot to death in her car on May 28 as she
left the drive-through lane at a fast-foot restaurant. Detectives
said the intended target was her passenger, a childhood friend who
ducked when the gunman approached her car and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's friend and other witnesses identified the gunman as
Samuel Sharad Shabazz, 18. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and
police found him Tuesday when officers stopped him for drinking
beer in public.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we unite together as a department, city and community, we
can fight this violence. Enough is enough,'' Parks said at a news
conference. He noted that he had spoken at many news conferences
before but ''I never thought that I would be talking about my
granddaughter in this fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, who has previous robbery and assault convictions, was
arrested Tuesday and appeared in court Thursday, but his
arraignment on murder and attempted murder charges was postponed to
June 23. Prosecutors had not decided whether to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz was charged under a street gang murder law that went
into effect this year. Prosecutors alleged that Shabazz ''was an
active participant in a criminal street gang and the murder was
carried out to further the activities of the criminal street
gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Brian Carr identified Shabazz as a member of the West
Boulevard Crips, who are fighting with the P/Stones gang. The
intended target of the shooting was Gonzalez's friend Ernest Gray,
a member of the P/Stones. Police have said Gray was wounded by
rivals three weeks before Gonzalez was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was a Sunday school teacher who worked two jobs, took
English classes at a junior college and did occasional missionary
work in Tijuana, Mexico. She had driven from Orange County to Los
Angeles to visit her mother, one of Parks' daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Parks responded to criticism that so much attention was being
paid to the killing of his granddaughter when there have been many
other gang shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''My plea at this time is to the community and the media, is to
not just rally around this case but also to dedicate the same
effort and spirit of cooperation within this community against
every act of violence that is committed in this city,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing occurred as the Police Department grapples with
allegations that anti-gang officers at its Rampart station framed
and assaulted innocent people. Dozens of convictions have been
overturned, and numerous officers have been suspended or fired and
three have been charged with crimes.

House Votes on Work Injury Rules
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a defeat for organized labor, the House voted today to
block federal rules aimed at preventing some of the 1.8 million workplace

business for a decade, the House voted 220-203 to stop the government from
issuing final ergonomics rules that would require 1.6 million employers to take
steps to prevent injuries to workers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators designated specific slices of the
airwaves for wireless medical services that monitor patients' heart, blood
pressure or other functions from a remote location. The action today by the
Federal Communications Commission assigns new frequencies for the equipment's
transmissions to avoid possible harmful interference. The service enables health
professionals to keep tabs on their patients' vital signs within a hospital or
nursing home, but from another room. Data from respiration monitors or other

<HEADLINE> House Votes on Workplace Injuries  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a symbolic defeat for organized labor, the
House voted Thursday to block federal rules aimed at preventing
some of the 1.8 million workplace injuries that occur each year.
</P>
<P>
   On an issue that has pitted unions against business for a
decade, the House voted 220-203 to stop the government from issuing
final ergonomics rules that would require 1.6 million employers to
take steps to prevent injuries to workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has planned to
issue the final rules by year's end. President Clinton wants them
to take effect, and is virtually certain to veto legislation that
would prevent them from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, labor officials opposed having Thursday's vote,
worried that the effort to block the rules would prevail and give
momentum to the other side. They also said the vote would let
Republicans from districts with strong union membership cast
themselves as pro-labor by supporting the OSHA rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the mostly party-line vote, just 16 Democrats -- mostly from
the South -- voted to block the ergonomics regulation. Fourteen
Republicans, mainly from the industrial Northeast and Midwest,
voted to let them take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The battle came just two weeks after labor lost its battle with
business over the effort by Clinton and Republican leaders to
permanently grant normal trade status to China. Business won that
fight as the House approved the trading rights for China by 40
votes, and labor leaders vowed retribution against some of those
who opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the latest turn in the long-running fight over
whether to require employers to hold training sessions and take
other steps to prevent on-the-job injuries. Since taking control of
Congress in 1995, Republicans have repeatedly approved legislation
aimed at delaying the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was on whether to kill language that Rep. Anne
Northup, R-Ky., had written into a $339.5 billion measure financing
education, labor and health programs next year. Her provision would
block OSHA from finalizing the ergonomics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Northup said the OSHA rules were based on incomplete scientific
evidence and would drive up costs for business. The rules are ''a
bang you over the head, elephant in a China shop approach,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the rules said they would help prevent many of
the musculoskeletal injuries the governments says 1.8 million
American workers suffer annually. About 600,000 of them end up
missing work days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue about human beings and our dedication to
them,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In a political twist, however, Thursday's effort to let OSHA
proceed with its ergonomics regulations was driven by Rep. James
Traficant, a maverick Democrat from Ohio, and some Republicans from
strong labor districts.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, whose Rust Belt district has a strong organized labor
presence, said he wanted to fight for the regulations to ''help
many of the concerns many working people have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Traficant has also battled openly with top Democrats since
earlier this year, when he accused party leaders of trying to
unseat him in his primary. Democratic leaders have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., read a letter from
Peggy Taylor, lobbyist for the AFL-CIO. The letter said
Trafficant's amendment was ''being offered against the wishes of
the AFL-CIO'' and ''appears to be an effort on the part of some to
provide cover and encourage members to support legislation that is
blatantly anti-family.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's reference was to the overall spending bill, which some
moderate Republicans might find easier to support after voting to
remove its restrictions on the OSHA rules. Clinton, most Democrats
and organized labor oppose the spending bill because it cuts
Clinton's proposals for many school, job training, child care and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   After Obey read the AFL-CIO letter, Trafficant noted that the
AFL-CIO has not supported him.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA says the rules would cost business $4.7 billion a year to
implement, but reap $10 billion a year in savings from medical
expenses and workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Various business groups, however, have said the costs to
companies would be tens of billions of dollars in reduced
production and for training and new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups and companies plan to file suit against the
rules as soon as they are finalized.

<HEADLINE> Missing Teacher Found in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A missing teacher who wandered the rugged
terrain of west Texas for at least six days after his car got stuck
was found Thursday with a sunburn and a few scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lemmon, 50, told authorities he stayed alive by eating
cactus and following the Brazos River.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really figured that we would be looking for a cadaver,''
said Fisher County Sheriff's Deputy Eliot Mize. ''After six days
out there, we didn't really expect that he would be alive ... the
rattlesnakes are just everywhere out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon's 18-year-old son, Chris, said he worried about his
father after not hearing from him since May 27. The family reported
Lemmon missing on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon was hospitalized Thursday at Fisher County Hospital,
where his son described him as ''a little sunburned and
dehydrated'' but in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Mize said authorities found Lemmon, who had traveled in three
different directions from his abandoned car, about 10 miles from
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shocked us when he walked up,'' Mize said. ''It was like he
didn't see us, even with all those vehicles there.''
</P>
<P>
   A search team had been looking for Lemmon since Friday when his
vehicle was found. Mize said Lemmon, a computer science teacher
from Roscoe, told searchers his car got stuck while he was trying
to take a scenic route from Sweetwater to Lubbock.

<HEADLINE> Stars, Devils Scoreless in Game 5  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils, in their
first attempt to wrest the Stanley Cup from Dallas, played two
scoreless periods with the Stars on Thursday night in Game 5 of the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey holds a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and one
more victory will clinch the second Cup in Devils' history. Dallas,
the defending champion, lost two straight games at home after
splitting the first two at New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The play picked up late in the second period as the teams traded
high-sticking penalties.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Petr Sykora went off with 5:17 left when he hit
Darryl Sydor. Dallas registered three shots with the man advantage,
including one by Jere Lehtinen that Martin Brodeur stopped by
stacking his pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' flurry had Brodeur's wife, Melanie, covering her eyes
in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   With only 2:59 remaining, Lehtinen hit Patrik Elias with his
stick and was sent off. Bobby Holik, who midway through the period
hit the post with a shot, was denied by Dallas goalie Ed Belfour's
right pad. A rebound attempt hit the outside the net.
</P>
<P>
   Holik's try was New Jersey's only shot on goal with the man
advantage, but the Devils outshot the Stars 11-6 in the middle
period.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 20 minutes, both teams were able to generate
scoring chances, including several odd-man rushes. The Devils' best
opportunity came on their first and last charges into the Dallas
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo's quick deflection of Claude Lemieux's shot 2:03
into the game was stopped by Belfour, who made seven saves in the
period. New Jersey also had a 2-on-1 break during the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took 11 shots on Brodeur. Grant Marshall took two pokes
at a rebound midway through the period, but Brodeur was able to
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Each team spent 42 seconds on the power play in the first
period. Shortly after Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher hooked
Pandolfo in the Dallas zone, the teams went to a 4-on-4 situation
when Holik interfered with Richard Matvichuk behind the Stars goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is trying to become the first team since Vancouver in
1994 to win an elimination game in the finals.

<HEADLINE> Former Ky. Recruit Freed From Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- A judge released former Kentucky
basketball recruit Michael Southall from jail Thursday, about 14
hours early, saying his loss of a scholarship has added more
punishment for his drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Southall, 18, pleaded guilty Tuesday to misdemeanor marijuana
possession charges and received a six-month stayed jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He also pleaded guilty to felony marijuana delivery but, under a
deferred prosecution agreement, that count will not appear on his
record if he fulfills terms of a two-year probation.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Ramona Gonzalez had ordered him to stay in jail
until 4 a.m. Friday, an hour before his departure for Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Kentucky coach Tubby Smith announced the
school was revoking Southall's scholarship ''because his behavior
was detrimental to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Southall's trip was canceled, Assistant District Attorney
Todd Bjerke went to court Thursday with a request that the judge
reconsider Southall's jail time. He had initially requested 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Kenneth Peterson protested that probation was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not out of this as you know,'' Peterson said. ''He's got
two years (probation). He's going to be on thin ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez abruptly granted Southall's immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   The judge she had ordered the jail time with the assumption that
Kentucky would still want Southall to attend as a student-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the scholarship adds an ''additional punitive
measure'' for Southall to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Southall walked away from the jail about 30 minutes later and
said ''I have no comment'' to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Southall, a 6-foot-10, 225-pound center, averaged 20.7 points,
13 rebounds and 6.7 blocked shots for West Salem High School last
season.
</P>
<P>
   He and five others were arrested May 10 after a restaurant gave
authorities an abandoned video camera that containing a tape.
</P>
<P>
   According to a criminal complaint, the videotape showed him
smoking marijuana at a party. When investigators found evidence of
marijuana in Southall's car and in his home, he told them he had
sold marijuana to other teens in small quantities.

<HEADLINE> Gore Proposes Safeguards  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore pushed a pair of
initiatives Thursday -- one to outlaw ''identity theft'' trafficking
in Social Security numbers, and the other to shield Medicare from
budgetary raids.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we should do for Medicare what we've done for Social
Security: set it aside, protect it and ensure that the trust fund
money is not ever used for anything except the purposes for which
it is collected,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said he spoke with President Clinton and
Democratic congressional leaders before announcing the proposal,
which members of both parties had floated on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it has an effect on the dialogue between the executive
branch and the legislative branch, because it has an effect on this
year's legislative session, I felt that it was only proper for me
to give a heads-up,'' Gore told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He would not detail his consultation with Clinton but said,
''This was not the unique case but it was the rare case.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pledged cooperation on the
Medicare proposal but was hardly giving Gore credit for the
lock-box idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as the vice president did not invent the Internet, he
also did not invent the Social Security lock box,'' Hastert said,
adding that it was congressional Republicans who fought for the
measure and President Clinton, who ''finally agreed to our
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House took issue with Hastert. ''We are not for their
version or their idea of a so-called lock box, which is simply a
slogan, not substance,'' said Clinton adviser Joel Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in California, Gore said he would make his Medicare
proposal official Tuesday in New York in a speech launching a
two-week ''progress and prosperity tour'' that he's counting on to
win him a fresh, approving look from voters.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he will travel to Kentucky, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Wisconsin and other battleground states where he must knock out
Republican rival George W. Bush to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Medicare announcement is meant to dovetail with the
possible release next week of new official budget projections
showing bigger-than-expected surpluses that will give the
government room to remove Medicare funds from general budget
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed putting Medicare Part A funds, which pay for
hospital care for about 40 million elderly and disabled people,
''into a lock box that's protected against the ambitions of those
in either party who might want to get into the Medicare Trust Fund
and use it for other purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use trust fund surpluses to pay down the national
debt, then reinvest interest savings into Medicare to extend its
solvency for the baby boom's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   On a three-day swing dominated by more than $1 million in
unregulated ''soft money'' fund raising for the Democratic National
Committee, Gore was dogged by a character wearing a wig and
Pinocchio nose, courtesy of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is after Gore for breaking a pledge not to use DNC soft
money for TV issue ads unless Republicans did so first. Democratic
ads began airing Thursday in key states.
</P>
<P>
   The race is close, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll
taken this week and released Thursday, with Bush at 48 percent and
Gore at 44 percent, with a 5-point margin of error. Bush had a
49-42 edge in the same poll late last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the more important state-by-state race, Bush leads in states
with two-thirds of the 270 electoral votes needed to win, while
Gore is ahead in states with fewer than half the needed votes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles County sheriffs training academy, Gore also
called for making so-called ''identity theft'' a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department submitted legislation to Congress on
Thursday that aides said Gore initiated after meeting several
months ago with the parents of Amy Boyer, who was stalked and
murdered last year by a man who bought her Social Security number
for $45 off a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make it a crime to buy Social Security numbers or
sell them for profit. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Ed
Markey, D-Mass., introduced it on behalf of the administration,
said Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sat with an arm around Boyer's mother, Helen Remsburg,
between the polished stones of a law enforcement memorial. When he
spoke, he was flanked by seven dozen uniformed sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make it a national priority to stop this kind of
traffic in personal data,'' Gore said. ''The information age should
not mean that your personal information is misused or abused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration's hot line received 30,000
complaints of Social Security number misuse in 1999. Thieves and
stalkers can use the numbers, available from a proliferating number
of Internet sites, to apply for fraudulent credit cards or obtain
detailed personal information.

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A prisoner attempted to escape Thursday
evening from the New Haven Correctional Center, but was caught
inside the facility's ventilation system, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Muriel, accused of third degree assault, was caught by
staff trying to climb through a vent on the roof at the jail, said

</P>
<P>
   ''When he tried to drop through the vent we were there,'' she

<P>
   Muriel was discovered missing at about 5:35 p.m. and was

</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, Polce said.

   Muriel was transferred Thursday night to Northern Correctional
Institution, the state's highest security facility, in Somers. He

<HEADLINE> Mexico Leader Vows Fair Elections  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Mexicans vote for their next president July
2, there should be no fear of fraud, Mexico's president said
Thursday during a visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo assured an audience of about 400
people at a breakfast given by the Americas Society that electoral
reforms during his six-year term guarantee the elections will be
fair and free of government influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you that the next president of Mexico will be the
candidate who gains the majority of votes,'' Zedillo said. ''For
the first time in our history, the executive branch is not involved
at all in the organization of the electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo took office six years ago in an election that was
generally considered fair, winning just over 50 percent of the
vote. He became the latest in a long line of leaders of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party to hold the presidency. The PRI,
as the party is known, has ruled Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, following reforms that have created the fairest
electoral conditions in Mexican history, the PRI candidate,
Francisco Labastida, is in a close race with Vicente Fox of the
National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida said Monday that there could be disturbances if he did
not win by a large margin, and since then, Mexico's stock market
index and its currency, the peso, have fallen markedly. The peso
closed Thursday at its lowest point since March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group that included many investment bankers,
Zedillo's comments appeared aimed at calming investors' jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said electoral reform was one of the major achievements
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''These democratic reforms have created an electoral system that
is independent of the government, fair to the candidates, and
ensures the integrity of every Mexican's ballot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo was in New York during a three-day trip to the United
States, accompanied by top Cabinet officials. On Friday, he is to
meet with President Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Zedillo pointed to Mexico's recent economic
growth and decreased inflation as indications that his government's
policies had succeeded. He also touched on efforts to fight
corruption and drug trafficking, saying ''this is a shared
problem'' that both Mexico and the United States must deal with.
</P>
<P>
   At an evening dinner in Washington sponsored by the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, Zedillo credited Clinton for the warm ties between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton has shown a ''profound respect for Mexico as a
sovereign nation and for its history and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the chamber headquarters, protesters demonstrated
against Zedillo's keeping company with the captains of American
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zedillo, understand, the country is not for sale,'' the
demonstrators shouted.
</P>
<P>
   They also protested against free trade. In his speech, Zedillo
registered his ''very strong disagreement with those who oppose
free trade. And certainly I don't care about demonstrators.''

<HEADLINE> Many Evacuated From Solomon Islands  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Hundreds of foreigners -- mostly
women and children -- boarded an Australian navy ship Thursday
docked off the Solomon Islands, escaping rebels battling in the
jungles and capital of the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   A radio report hours later indicated a possible easing of
tensions on the islands: the prime minister appeared to have been
freed from house arrest and warring groups were trying to agree on
a truce.
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour evacuation, 250 people were ferried in
dinghies and landing craft to the HMAS Tobruk, which was to spend
the night anchored in the harbor of the capital, Honiara, said
Australian Defense Minister John Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, which can carry 800 people, would take on more who
want to leave Friday morning, he said. There are 700 Australians
and 220 New Zealanders on the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the evacuation seemed relaxed and generally free
of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected there to be a hassle, possibly arguments and
disruptions, but it's (the evacuation) all calm and orderly,'' said
Russell Byfield of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Australia Honiara correspondent Dorothy Wickham said those
leaving also included Canadians and New Zealanders that work in
Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   After days of negotiations and with parliament expected to hand
his government a vote of no confidence next week, Prime Minister
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu was finally set free on Thursday night, radio
journalist Johnson Houimae told The Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   There were no armed men surrounding Ulufa'alu's residence early
Friday, as there had been since Monday when rebels seized the
premier, Houimae said. New Zealand's National Radio said Ulufa'alu
was apparently being guarded by police, and not rebel gunmen, early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants from the nearby island of Malaita have been fighting
indigenous Istabu rebels in an effort to push them off the main
island of Guadalcanal. The Solomon Islands, slightly smaller than
Maryland, are 2,230 miles northwest of Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   The airport east of Honiara has been the scene of the heaviest
fighting this week between indigenous Isatabu rebels who want to
force their Melaitan foes off the main island of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   But in his comments to the AP Friday, Houimae said the
indigenous militants had finally agreed to terms of the truce, but
rebel migrants were still discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff, who has been closely
watching the situation, said he and other ministers from
Commonwealth countries hoped to visit the Solomon Islands soon for
a firsthand look, although the airport remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels led by lawyer Andrew Nori claimed they used a stolen
police gunboat, armed with a machine gun, to kill about 100 of
their rivals Wednesday on beaches near the capital's airport. But
on Thursday, the report was still unconfirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Islands radio said a reporter could not get close enough
to the scene to determine if there were any bodies. Goff had said
Wednesday that Nori's claims seemed exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months about 50 people have been killed or gone
missing while 20,000 had to abandon their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalcanal was the scene of a bloody and drawn-out World War II
battle, when U.S. Marines began their island-hopping Pacific
assault on Japanese forces after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to leave the Solomon Islands was a difficult decision
for Ian Judson, an accountant from Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment we don't feel our personal safety is as much at
risk for us to leave right at this very moment,'' he said, ''and
we're both trying to tidy up a few of our things at work before we
finally leave the country.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Disclose Donors  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Thursday to force a new
generation of secretive political groups to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was added to an unrelated defense spending bill on a
voice vote after Republican leaders tried to kill the measure.
Fourteen Republicans joined most Democrats in rejecting the effort
to kill the disclosure measure, 57-42.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., argued that the
public should know who is behind these increasingly popular groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''These organizations are the new stealth players in our
election system,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would force disclosure on groups that have
organized under the once-obscure section 527 of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was created in 1975 to establish tax rules for
political organizations, such as the national political parties and
political action committees. But unlike these new, sometimes
secretive groups, parties and PACs register with the Federal
Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new 527 groups tell the Internal Revenue Service that they
are political organizations, but they maintain that as far as the
FEC is concerned, they are engaged in issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year's presidential and congressional campaigns have seen a
proliferation of these groups supporting both Democrats and
Republicans. Some are created by established groups; others pop up
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just when you think that our campaign system couldn't possibly
get any worse along comes the discovery of this new loophole,''
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ''Section 527 is the largest,
most disturbing, pernicious loophole in a system rife with backdoor
ways to influence government.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that the amendment would doom the underlying
legislation funding defense operations. The Constitution requires
tax bills to originate in the House, and opponents said that would
cover this measure because it changes the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense bill includes this provision, they said, the
House would refuse to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the
bottom of the sea,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., explained that his vote against the
measure was actually a vote to support an Air Force base in his
state. ''Roth acts to protect Dover AFB'' was the headline on his
news release.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a way around those arguments: remove the measure
from the defense bill if the other side agreed to attach it to the
next appropriate legislation. Opponents objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have just totally disclosed what this is all about,''
McCain responded. ''This is not about the defense of the nation.
This is the defense of a corrupt system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain e-mailed more than 200,000 supporters from his
presidential bid, reminding them how 527 groups attacked him during
the primaries and asking them to call their senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that this is last minute, but I need your help now,''
McCain said in his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also argued that the measure should cover other
nonprofit organizations that engage in issue ads. Under current
law, they also are not required to name their donors. But unlike
527s, they must release their tax returns to the public and they
face limits on their political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to do it in a comprehensive way and not leave out
some of the major players on the American political scene,'' said
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents offered to consider a ''sense of the Senate''
resolution supporting disclosure. Backers dismissed that as
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he would consider the matter in the Finance Committee,
which he heads, later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC is also considering a proposal to force 527 and other
groups to register with the commission and meet its disclosure
rules. Democrats on the panel welcomed the initiative, but
Republican response ranged from wary to outright opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore backs the new disclosure rules. A
spokesman for Republican George W. Bush said the Texas governor has
not yet reviewed the measure.

<HEADLINE> Mets 8, Orioles 7, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blame it on the odd travel itinerary or
Baltimore's putrid pitching. Either way, the road-weary Orioles are
heading home with seven losses on their 10-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, forced to fly back and forth from Baltimore between
the last two games of the series, wasted a four-run lead Thursday
night and lost 8-7 in 10 innings to the New York Mets on Kurt
Abbott's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile added a three-run homer and Jay Payton went 2-for-4
with a homer and two RBIs as the Mets rallied from deficits of 4-0
and 6-3 to win for the second straight time heading into Friday's
Subway Series at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday night's rainout led to Thursday's makeup game, the
Orioles were unable to find hotel rooms in the New York area and
chartered a plane home after Wednesday's 11-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Six players stayed in New York, but the rest of the team didn't
get home until about 2 a.m. and was back at the airport 13 hours
later to finish the 11-day road trip.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the 10th, Abbott hit the first pitch from Jose
Mercedes (2-3) into the left-field seats to send the 9,540 fans who
showed up -- the smallest crowd in three years -- home happy, giving
the Orioles their second straight gloomy plane ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott pumped his fist as he ran to first and was mobbed by
teammates as he reached home plate following his second homer of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook (5-2) pitched a perfect 10th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's fifth homer gave the Mets a 7-6 lead in the eighth, but
John Franco and Armando Benitez couldn't hold it in the ninth.
Pinch-hitter Will Clark's sacrifice fly tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Johnson, who declined to stay back in New York, tired in
the sixth inning and remained winless in eight starts this season.
With the Orioles leading 6-3, Johnson walked Robin Ventura to open
the inning. Zeile followed with a single and Payton doubled to make
it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   After a sacrifice fly by Abbott and a flyout by pinch-hitter
Benny Agbayani, rookie Jason Tyner lined a single to right off
Buddy Groom to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have the second worst ERA in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken, who stayed in New York, homered for the second
straight game, and Delino DeShields had three hits for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles took advantage of B.J. Surhoff's leadoff walk
against Glendon Rusch to score three runs in the fourth and take a
4-0 lead. Brady Anderson -- who also stayed behind Wednesday -- had
an RBI double and Mike Bordick hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired the first two batters in the bottom of the
fourth before Mike Piazza hit a hard, one-hopper off his left side
for an infield single. Johnson appeared flustered, throwing 10 of
the next 14 pitches for balls. Two of the four strikes were hit
hard: a double by Ventura and Zeile's 11th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza grounded a ball off Johnson again in the fifth, but this
time it was the Mets catcher who got banged up on the play. Ripken
fielded the ricochet near third and threw Piazza out at first.
Piazza tripped over the bag and appeared to turn his right ankle.
He stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored two more in the fifth on Surhoff's RBI single
and Charles Johnson's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: This was the smallest crowd at Shea Stadium since June 2,
1997, when 2,672 fans showed up for a makeup game against Montreal.
... Rusch allowed six runs and 10 hits in five innings. ... Mets 2B
Edgardo Alfonzo struck out swinging in the fourth ending, ending a
42 at-bat stretch without a K. ... Charles Johnson, Albert Belle,
Jose Mercedes and Scott Erickson also stayed on their own in New
York, while Friday's starter against Philadelphia, Pat Rapp
remained in Baltimore. ... Jason Johnson won his last five starts
in 1999 before starting this season 0-4.

<HEADLINE> Kansas State, Former Coach Settle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas State and former basketball coach
Tom Asbury have reached a settlement on his contract, which had two
years to run when he was forced out at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   The university announced the settlement Thursday in a
three-sentence news release, saying terms were confidential and
that neither party could comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the settlement ''was accomplished in an
amicable way, and both parties are pleased to have the matter
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Asbury was 85-88 in his six seasons at Kansas State. The
Wildcats were 9-19 last season, finishing with an 11-game losing
streak capped by an 84-60 loss in the Big 12 tournament to Kansas,
a team Asbury never managed to beat in 17 games while at Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury said in late March that he and the university were far
apart on the negotiations to settle the contract, which had a base
salary of $165,000 a year. He also said then that he was ''very
bitter'' about what he called the ''very unprofessional manner'' in
which Kansas State handled his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury said that on Feb. 11, when the Wildcats were 8-13 and 1-9
in the conference, he asked for a meeting with athletic director
Max Urick. He said Urick told him he would get back to him but that
he heard nothing until Feb. 22, when his attorney told him the
university's attorney said Asbury would be fired a few days later
but asked to finish out the season.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury said he told Urick he wouldn't be a lame duck coach, and
that the university then decided to wait until the end of the
season to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury said that after the last game, Urick walked into the
bathroom area of the dressing room, stuck a piece of paper in his
pocket and walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State replaced Asbury with Jim Wooldridge, who was an
assistant coach with the NBA's Chicago Bulls.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Body Endorses Expense Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An NCAA governing body has endorsed a
proposal that would allow prospective student-athletes to accept
educational expenses from individuals or entities that make such
payments directly to their school.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy would cover tuition, fees, books, room and board.
Agents, professional sports teams or organizations and college
scouts would be excluded from making the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal will address a significant issue that affected a
number of basketball student-athletes this past season,'' said
David Knight, faculty athletics representative at the University of
North Carolina, Greensboro, and chair of the NCAA
Academics/Eligibility/Compliance Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this is a piece of deregulation that the membership
can support.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Division I basketball players who were suspended for
various periods last season for accepting tuition assistance at
prep schools were Erick Barkley of St. John's, DerMarr Johnson of
Cincinnati and Andre Williams of Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet, which was acting on a recommendation from its
Subcommittee on Agents and Amateurism, took the action at its June
5-7 meeting in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation will be forwarded to the Division I
Management Council at its October legislative session. The earliest
it could be approved would be April 2001.

<HEADLINE> Three Prisoners Killed in Crash  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- A fiery highway crash in heavy rain
Thursday killed five people, including three prisoners and a
federal marshal in a van. Four other people were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The van rolled down an embankment and landed upside down after a
crash involving two tractor-trailers and three other vehicles, the
California Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   CHP spokesman Mack Wimbish said it appeared that one of the
tractor-trailers had blown a tire, setting off the chain-reaction
crashes on State Route 65, north of Bakersfield in central
California.
</P>
<P>
   The marshal driving the van, Peter Hillman, 47, was killed along
with the three prisoners, officials said. A second marshal was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The three prisoners were en route from a state prison in
Tehachapi to a prison in Kern County, said Chief Deputy U.S.
Marshal Enrique Perez. Two faced federal prison terms. The third
was to appear in federal court in Fresno, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was likely the inmates were shackled at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the fifth person killed was not available.

   Three of the injured were hospitalized in fair condition. The
condition of the fourth was not available.

<HEADLINE> Germany Asks Workers Avert Strike  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A vast majority of Germany's public
workers union members on Thursday voted to start full-fleged
strikes, threatening to cripple public services in a bid for better
wage offers steadfastly rejected by employers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the OeTV public workers membership for a strike was
more than the minimum 75 percent required, and the DAG white collar
workers union was above its required 70 percent, the unions said in
a joint statements released in Stuttgart late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the 80,000-strong GEW teachers union released a
statement saying its membership had voted nearly 91 percent to
strike, as the did the tiny 26,000 member police union.
</P>
<P>
   The unions represent some 3.1 million workers, in transport,
offices, schools, hospitals and other public services at the
federal, state and community levels.
</P>
<P>
   OeTV chief Herbert Mai said that the union leadership would
immediately begin strategy planning for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday Mai said the strikes could begin on Tuesday
after the Pentecost holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Otto Schily, the chief negotiator for the
employers, told ZDF television upon hearing of the unions' apparent

</P>
<P>
   He repeated a plea for both sides to sit down again to settle
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   He said the unions were demanding a 5 percent pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke off on May 30, after a union commission declined to
accept an offer of retroactive raises of 1.8 percent effective
April 1, with a further 2.2 percent increase a year later.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Self Takes Illinois Job  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Tulsa coach Bill Self traveled to
Illinois on Thursday night to meet with school officials about
their vacant basketball coaching job after hurriedly meeting with
his players and telling colleagues the discussions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com, quoting an unidentified source close to Self, reported
he would become the Illini coach as early as Friday. The
(Champaign) News-Gazette also reported Self will be given the job.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois officials would not confirm reports Self would be
announced as the new coach Friday or that Self was coming to
Champaign late Thursday night to talk about the job. But that was
the impression he left with people in Tulsa after leaving the
school's basketball camp on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spoke with every single player today before he left and put
them on notice about what was going on, that he was going to be
speaking with Illinois,'' said Tulsa assistant coach Norman
Roberts, who was waiting to hear back from Self on Thursday night
with an update. ''I don't know what's happened after that. It's
just all happened so quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois athletic director Ron Guenther called Tulsa on Thursday
afternoon seeking permission to talk to Self about the job, less
than 24 hours after Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Tulsa sports information director Don Tomkalski both
said Self characterized the talks with Illinois as ''very
serious.'' Tomkalski said he spoke with Self late Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said they were going to have further discussions tonight
and if things move along, he would probably be heading that way at
some point, but he did not indicate whether that would happen
tonight,'' Tomkalski said.
</P>
<P>
   Self was traveling to Champaign on Thursday night to finalize
details and was expected to meet with Illinois assistant coaches
Rob Judson and Derek Thomas, ESPN.com reported. Self could not be
reached by The Associated Press for comment Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa television station KJRH quoted Self as saying he was
extremely interested in talking with Illinois, although Self
declined to appear on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Under Self, Tulsa went 32-5 last season and reached the regional
finals of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history.
In his three seasons there the Golden Hurricane were 74-27.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Self resisted a higher-paying job at
Nebraska. He recently signed an amended contract with the school
that reportedly raised his pay from $350,000 to $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa is a private university that does not disclose workers'
salaries, but the Tulsa World has reported the deal -- a result of
fund-raising by university boosters -- also guarantees Self an
annuity of $750,000 to $1 million if he coaches the Golden
Hurricane for five more years.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois athletic department spokesman Kent Brown said late
Thursday that no news conferences were slated for Friday, and
refused to comment about any of the reports about Self.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Hate-Crime Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A 19-year-old black man convicted of a
hate crime in the beating death of a mentally disabled white man
was sentenced Thursday to 48 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence McCray was convicted May 26 on charges of second-degree
murder and committing a hate crime. Under Florida law, he will be
required to serve 85 percent of his 48-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   McCray and Ledel Lawrence, 21, who was convicted and is to be
sentenced next week, were among five young Jacksonville men charged
in the Aug. 13, 1999, fatal attack on Gregory Griffith, 50.
Griffith, who lived in their neighborhood, died 13 days after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The other three men charged in the attack have not been tried.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said McCray had said the night of the attack: ''I am
going to beat the next cracker that comes down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   White supremacist David Duke attended the scheduled opening of
the trial and criticized as biased the media coverage of Griffith's
death because the victim was white and the suspects are black.

<HEADLINE> UN-Iraq Aid Program Agreement Near  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With just minutes to spare, the Security
Council agreed late Thursday to extend the U.N. relief program in
Iraq for another six months and authorize a far-reaching study on
the humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote on the British and French-drafted resolution
capped a divisive week of negotiations that saw the perfunctory
extension of oil-for-food program turn into a highly politicized
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appeals by U.N. officials to focus only on getting more
aid to Iraqis suffering under sanctions, negotiations took unusual
turns and split traditional alliances before ending in a compromise
that was approved shortly before the midnight expiration of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to allow Iraq to
use proceeds from U.N.-supervised oil sales to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods for its people suffering from
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution keeps the program going for another six months
and lets Iraq spend $600 million from its oil proceeds on equipment
to repair its dilapidated oil infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   In a new element intended to speed up the delivery of other
sorely needed machinery, the resolution allows water and sanitation
equipment to be added to a list of goods that can be ordered
without the approval of the council's sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had initially balked at the British-sponsored
automatic approval, concerned that the equipment needed to be
checked to make sure it wasn't used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated $1.6 billion worth of contracts on ''hold'' in
the sanctions committee, an estimated $138 million in contracts are
for water and sanitation supplies. The United States is responsible
for about 90 percent of all the holds.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington found it couldn't block the British suggestion
after repeated calls by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to improve
Iraq's access to clean water, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also reluctantly agreed to a British-French
compromise that Annan issue a ''comprehensive report and analysis''
on the overall humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   France, backed by China, Malaysia and Russia, had initially
proposed that the study specifically assess the impact of sanctions
on the lives of ordinary Iraqis over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, it agreed to a more general study after
Britain and the United States argued that the effects of two wars
and government policies also had bearing on the humanitarian
situation.
</P>
<P>
   China and Malaysia -- which have backed the French in pressing to
have sanctions suspended -- insisted the embargo be the focus of the
study and delayed the vote until late Thursday so they could check
with their home governments before getting the go-ahead to approve
the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Union Writers have Web Work Contract  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Writers Guild of America has created a
contract to protect people who write for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites that want to hire professional film and television
writers who belong to the guild will have to contribute to the
union health and pension plan and pay writers a guaranteed minimum
if a Web show is later sold as a television pilot or movie, said
Grace Reiner, director of contract administration for the guild.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other contracts, the new contract does not set wage
scales. Web sites will be free to negotiate salaries or one-time
payments with writers, Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to be very flexible on initial compensation and let
the market grow but at the same time protect those areas seriously
in need of protection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Web, animated short films and live
action series were created by newcomers, often amateurs with video
cameras and digital software who posted their creations on their
own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now that AOL and Time Warner, Disney and other major companies
have launched or invested in entertainment Web sites, professional
film and television writers have become interested in writing for
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there have been no rules governing pay or benefits or
granting rights to writers who create the content for thousands of
Web sites. The guild contract specifies how union writers should be
compensated for their work, including a clause requiring residual
payments similar to those paid to writers of television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile sites are affiliated with movie studios
that plan to use the Web as an incubator for television and film
projects.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore pushed a pair of initiatives
Thursday -- one to outlaw ''identity theft'' trafficking in Social Security
numbers, and the other to shield Medicare from budgetary raids. In an interview,
he said he spoke with President Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders
before announcing the proposal, which members of both parties had floated on
Capitol Hill. He would not detail his consultation with Clinton but said, ''This
was not the unique case but it was the rare case.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a defeat for organized labor, the House voted today to
block federal rules aimed at preventing some of the 1.8 million workplace
injuries that occur each year. On an issue that has pitted unions against

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators designated specific slices of the

pressure or other functions from a remote location. The action today by the
Federal Communications Commission assigns new frequencies for the equipment's
transmissions to avoid possible harmful interference. The service enables health
professionals to keep tabs on their patients' vital signs within a hospital or
nursing home, but from another room. Data from respiration monitors or other
devices are transmitted to nearby receivers.
