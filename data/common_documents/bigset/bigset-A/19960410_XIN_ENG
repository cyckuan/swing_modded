<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Spells Out China's Stand on Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing, on the eve of the signing of a treaty declaring Africa
free from nuclear weapons, said here today that China will never
be the first to use nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"At no time and under no circumstances China will be the first
to use nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official, who will represent China to sign two protocols
attached to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty here
Thursday, noted that China will also not use nuclear weapons
against the zones and countries that do not possess nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"This is China's consistent and justified stand in this
regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
The African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty, to be signed by
African foreign ministers, will prohibit nuclear tests in Africa
and ban the burial of imported nuclear waste on the continent.
</P>
<P>
China, along with the world's four other nuclear powers --
the United States, Russia, Britain and France -- will sign Protocol
I and Protocol II to the treaty, pledging not to use or threaten
to use nuclear weapons against African countries, which sign the
treaty, and conduct nuclear tests in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, while banning nuclear weapons, will urge nuclear
development for peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's signing of the two protocols testifies to
the "consistent support of the Chinese government to the just
cause of the African continent."
</P>
<P>
It also manifests "the solidarity between China and Africa," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also said that China supports the
establishment of nuclear weapon free zones through consultations
among countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Cairo press reported today that representatives from some 50
countries across the world will sign the treaty, also known as
the Pelindaba Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs to Be Invited to Brussels Conference:  Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The international community's
High Representative to Bosnia Carl Bildt said today that Serbs
would be invited to attend a post-war reconstruction conference on
April 12 and 13 in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs were "in full compliance" with the Dayton
accords by releasing all prisoners of war and they "will be
invited to attend the Brussels meeting," Bildt told a news
conference in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said he had sent a letter to Rajko Kasagic, Prime
Minister of Republika Srpska to inform him of this decision.
</P>
<P>
The parties in Bosnia now had to direct their efforts to future
tasks, especially economic revival and preparations for free and
fair elections which should take place in September, he said.
</P>
<P>
Serb authorities Tuesday released three prisoners and handed
over documentation to the U.N. Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia in the Hague concerning 16 prisoners it charges with
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Brussels conference Sunday threatened to
cancel the meeting if the three parties in Bosnia fail to release
all prisoners of war they should have freed by January 19 under
the terms of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
Donors are supposed to pledge 1.2 billion U.S. dollars for the
reconstruction of Bosnia this year. The war-torned Bosnia needs
5.1 billion dollars for reconstruction for the next three years,
according to the assessment of the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Clarifies Military Accord with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Faced with criticism from
neighboring Moslem countries for signing a military agreement
with Israel, Turkey today clarified that the accord would not have
any objectives directed at a third country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told a weekly press
conference that under the accord, only unarmed Israeli planes
could use Turkish airspace for training purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Each country's planes, which use the airspace of the other's
for training purpose, will be unarmed...and carry no equipment
that could be used for electronic monitoring," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's clarification on the Turco-Israeli accord signed on
February 23 in Tel Aviv came responding to the criticism of the
Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, Syria and Egypt, that it
threatened their security.
</P>
<P>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi said earlier this
week that the presence of foreign forces in the region was not
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"If the news is correct, it is going to hurt the feeling of the
Islamic nation," Habibi said earlier in a meeting with visiting
Turkish Deputy Foreign Undersecretary Ali Toygan.
</P>
<P>
Reporting from Cairo, Turkey's Anatolia news agency quoted
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa as saying that the accord was
a "dangerous example" for the region.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspaper Tishreen, known for its close ties with the
government, said the Turco-Israeli military agreement would
contribute to further instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to calm the worries of the Moslem countries, Akbel
said, "Turkey's flourishing relations with Israel are part of
what we have pursued from the beginning as a constructive and
balanced policy in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to think that Turkey...will enter into military
arrangements that would create new divisions and concern in the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that an undetermined number of
Israeli F-16 jet fighters, lack of enough airspace for training
at home, would be arriving in Turkey in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Although no details of the controversial accord were
available, the Israel daily Ha'aretz reported that the
Turkish-Israeli agreement would allow eight joint military
exercises to be held every year.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Turkish and Israeli forces had similar
planes, which made it useful and necessary for both countries to
launch technical cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Few Americans Worry About Terror Attacks in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Relatively few Americans
consciously worry about massive terrorist attacks on public places
in the United States, according to a poll released today.
</P>
<P>
Almost three-fourths of the respondents consider a nuclear,
chemical or biological attack a possibility. Fewer than one in
eight say they worry about it a great deal.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll, conducted on March 28-31 by the Pew
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press, involved a nationwide
sample of 1,500 people 18 or older and has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The center is a private
research organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 72 percent believe terrorists could use a
weapon of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical or biological --
against a U.S. city. But only 13 percent say they worry a great
deal about the possibility and 27 percent are somewhat worried; 59
percent said they worry little or not at all about such an attack.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Americans apparently believe a greater
threat stems from possible attacks originating inside the United
States. A poll taken in April 1995 by the Los Angeles Times showed
40 percent were more concerned about attacks coming from inside
the United States. In this year's poll, that number had risen to
49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the number of Americans saying they may have to
give up civil liberties to enable law enforcement to cope with the
terrorism threat is declining. In the Los Angeles Times poll, 49
percent said people might need to give up civil liberties. This
year's poll showed the figure had dropped to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Pew Research poll also found younger adults less worried
than older respondents about the threat of attack by nuclear or
other mass-destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some 56 percent of the respondents said federal anti-terrorism
laws are too weak while 3 percent said they are too strong, 29
percent about right and 12 percent did not know or did not answer.

UNITED NATIONS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali hopes that the current international
conference on the Chernobyl accident will facilitate a common
understanding of the causes and consequences of the worst disaster
in the history of nuclear power generation.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a message to the conference held in Vienna from
Monday through Friday, he said that the consequences of the
Chernobyl accident could not be regarded as the problem of a few
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Even today, its health, social, economic and environmental
dimensions, both immediate and long-term, remain to be defined,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy, which took place on April 26 ten years ago, had
displaced hundreds of thousands of people, severely affected the
social fiber of the states and continued to affect vast
populations there, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"More than 300 children have been diagnosed with thyroid
cancer. The fertility rate has declined dramatically, and the
mortality rate has increased," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the United Nations system, international
organizations and Member States had responded to the need for help
with compassion, energy and enthusiasm. The current conference
could do much to draw attention and support for this work, he
said.

Israeli position in the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>

In a retaliation for the attack, the Israeli occupation forces
resumed around 3:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT) shelling of the southern
Lebanese villages of Yater, Kafra, Sadigain and Jabal Al-Botem
with heavy artilleries.

</P>
<P>
The afternoon attack at Blat broke a tense calm in south
Lebanon, which had been shrouding the area since Tuesday
afternoon.

U.S. media campaign against Iraq aims at depriving the Iraqi
people of obtaining foodstuff and medicine.

U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: US Blockade Violates Human Rights of Cuban People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuban foreign minister today
strongly condemned the recent tightening of the economic embargo
against Cuba by the United States, saying that it is "the
cruelest violation of the right to life" of 11 million Cuban
people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd session of the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzales said the
"Helms-Burton" Act recently adopted in the United States to
reinforce its blockade of Cuba "represents an overt and declared
economic war against Cuba."
</P>
<P>
"It is a carefully planned course of action aimed at cruelly
forcing the Cuban people to surrender through hunger and
desperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban foreign minister also noted that over three decades,
Cuba had suffered hundreds of thousands of incidents of
provocation from the United States, which had resulted in a high
toll of innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Cuba would not yield to threat and pressure
and would not allow any government or institution to interfere
directly or indirectly in Cuba's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his speech, the Cuban foreign minister said Cuba
would continue to move towards sovereign transformation in order
to make its economy more viable and solid, to perfect its
socialist democracy and to continue to guarantee all human rights
to its people.

<HEADLINE> More Canadian Adults Suffer from Asthma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Many more young Canadian adults
are suffering from respiratory problems than in the past, said
a new asthma study.
</P>
<P>
A survey in six Canadian cities -- Halifax, Hamilton, Montreal,
Winnipeg, Vancouver and Prince Edward Island -- found that about 8
percent of the population is taking regular medication for asthma.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have estimated that about 4 percent of
Canadian adults suffer from the respiratory ailment.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 8 percent of young adults in Halifax
and at least 7 percent in Hamilton and Winnipeg reported asthma
attacks requiring medical attention during the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Asthma is an inflammation or constriction of the lung's airways
caused by reaction to an irritant. It makes breathing difficult
and severe attacks can be life threatening. It is often believed
to be a childhood ailment that people "grow out of," said Dr.
Malcolm Sears, an asthma specialist at a Hamilton hospital.
</P>
<P>
The survey is part of an international project begun by the
European Community that now includes Canada, the United States,
Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The asthma problem seems to be increasing around the globe. As
it is the first time such a study has been done internationally,
it is hard to compare the results, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sears said that when he began the study, he believed that
the increases would be found to be related to smoking or allergies.
He now believes the triggers are environmental pollutants,
according to a report on today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, some forms of air pollution have become less severe in
Canada in recent years. "This suggests a new factor may be
involved," Dr. Sears said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate today called
upon members of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to get rid of
the legacy of the Cold War and do some "deep soul-searching" in a
bid to improve the commission's work in the future.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yishan, alternate representative of the Chinese
delegation, told the commission session today that although the
Cold War had become a thing of the past, its spirit was still
reluctant to go.
</P>
<P>
"There is still no shortage of people bent on political
confrontation. Double standard remains unchecked as ever. The
politicization of human rights is still obstructing the
commission's normal functioning," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Deep soul-searching is called for on our part in order to
learn the lessons of the past and improve the commission's work
with an eye on the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang outlined a six-point position of China with a view to
improve the commission's work:
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguarding the principle of equality among different
countries. No country has the prerogative to interfere in the
internal affairs of others and impose its will on others;
</P>
<P>
-- Respect for each country's specific situation. To promote
human rights, governments and peoples are entitled to adopt
realistic measures suited to their national situations;
</P>
<P>
-- Sharping the work focus of the commission. The human rights
commission should be focused in the area of the right to
subsistence and the right to development, which are of cardinal
importance to the developing world, and strive to promote progress
in concrete terms;
</P>
<P>
-- Equal attention to political and economic aspects. Any
lopsided stress on and attention to a certain set of rights are
undesirable;
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the regional balance. More developing
countries should be invited to sit on the commission;
</P>
<P>
-- Setting up effective mechanism. Effective measures and
earnest reforms are required to avoid overlapping of functions and
overloading of agenda among U.N. human rights mechanisms and
organs.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, expressed
satisfaction here today with development of the friendly and
cooperative relations between China and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Carlos Lage, deputy chairman of the
National Assembly of People's Power of Cuba, Qiao said the
strengthened bilateral friendly ties serve the fundamental
interests of the people of both countries and will further
consolidate the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
Lage, for his part, reiterated Cuba's one China policy, saying
that interference in the Taiwan issue by any country is tantamount
to interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Qiao on Cuba's economic situation and recent
reforms, noting the importance and usefulness of China's reform to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Qiao expressed the belief that Cuba will surmount the economic
difficulties and achieve new successes as the country continues to
strive along the road of maintaining independence and keeping the
initiative in its own hands.
</P>
<P>
Qiao will visit a genetic engineering and biotechnology center
in suburban Havana later today.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the fourth leg of Qiao's current tour, which has
already taken him to Ukraine, Russia and Greece. After Cuba, Qiao
will go on to Canada on a 10-day official visit.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Romanian FMs Discuss Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Romania is ready to continue, to
the best of its abilities, the efforts to find a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem, the country's Foreign Minister Teodor
Melescanu said here today.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu, who is on a two-day official visit to the island,
also told the press that Romania has always been supporting the
sovereignty, integrity and independence of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian minister was speaking after a meeting with his
Cypriot counterpart Alecos Michaelides with whom he signed a
protocol of consultations between the two countries' ministries.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of this document which is trying to establish a
mechanism for cooperation between our two ministries is
expressing very well the desire of the two ministers and
ministries to act as a sort of catalyst in developing our
bilateral relations," Melescanu said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the good tradition of cooperation between Cyprus and
Romania, Melescanu pointed out that "there is a very solid basis
for developing bilateral relations." He expressed the wish for
the continuation of such a cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Cypriot foreign minister stated he discussed
with Melescanu issues of political, economic and cultural
cooperation, while they also talked about their common aim of
accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said that the infrastructure for further
cooperation between the two countries will be created, stressing
that the "protocol signed today is an indication of our desire
for continuous and substantial dialogue."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for "Romania's support to
efforts for the re-unification of the island and to put an end to
the present situation on the island which is unacceptable to
all."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Melescanu, who will leave Thursday, was
received by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, during which they
discussed the Cyprus problem, bilateral relations and other issues
of mutual interest.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Antiquities Protection Drawn Up in  Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek Culture Minister Stavros
Benos today presented a draft law on cultural heritage protection
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The draft law was drawn up to replace the 1932 law.
</P>
<P>
Benos said that the draft law, drawn up by a 40-member
committee during a period of six weeks, "comprehensively covers
issues pertaining to the protection of cultural heritage from
antiquity up to the present day."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the new legislation covered "not only the
works of man but also the natural environment in which they were
created."
</P>
<P>
A provision of the draft law stipulates, "Any person finding
antiquities is obliged to hand them over to the state, while the
archaeological service may, subject to terms and conditions, allow
a natural or legal person to possess antiquities."
</P>
<P>
It adds that the right of possession ceases upon the death of
the possessor.
</P>
<P>
One innovation of the draft law makes it obligatory for "the
collector or antiquities dealer to declare the full particulars of
the previous owner."
</P>
<P>
The archaeological aspect of the draft law distinguishes
between ancient monuments, which are considered to be "all movable
and immovable works, objects, remains and things in general which
date from ancient times up to 1700," and historical monuments
dating back from 1701 up to 100 years ago and contemporary
monuments dating back to the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, foreign schools of archaeology will be
permitted to conduct up to three excavations at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Benos said that the new law was better than the previous one
and responded to today's needs.

<HEADLINE> More Foreigners Evacuated From Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 103 people have so far
been evacuated from Monrovia, capital of strife-torn Liberia,
according to a spokesman of the evacuation program based in
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"More would be coming in as the operation is progressing
smoothly," said Commander Bob Anderson today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said so far, 50 percent of the evacuees are
American residents while the others included the Egyptian
Ambassador in Liberia, Ahmed Al-Missari, British and Irish
nationals as well as a number of liberians.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the evacuees also included 25 Lebanese, which
Anderson said he could not confirm.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Freetown International Airport, based in an
island 14 miles south of Sierra Leone's mainland capital, remains
very crowded with American marines mingling with local security
officials.
</P>
<P>
"It looks very much like military area," said a businessman
who spent nearly six hours waiting for the creaky ferry boat
which would take him across the Rokel River to mainland Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Many commuters reported being stranded for hours as long
queues of traffic wait endlessly for the ferry which can only
take in about 50 vehicles once at a time and some 100 passengers.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Gives Consent to Use of British Base for U.N. Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus would give its consent to
the use of British Royal Air Force (RAF) Akrotiri base on the
island in the U.N. operation "Provide Comfort" for the Kurds of
northern Iraq, if the U.N. takes decision.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides and Foreign Minister
 Alecos Michaelides expressed this position today when asked to
comment on a British Foreign Office statement that Akrotiri, one
of two military bases Britain has retained since Cyprus'
independence, could be an alternative to the Turkish base of
Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus government has not been asked to give its consent
on the use of Akrotiri in the operation," the spokesman said,
adding that "if this is a decision by the U.N. Security Council
to protect the Kurdish population in Iraq, then our consent is
given a priority."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's comments were echoed by the Foreign Minister,
who said "we are favorably disposed towards providing
humanitarian assistance on the basis of a Security Council
resolution."
</P>
<P>
"Should a decision be taken by the Council on the use of
Akrotiri by an international force to replace Incirlik, the
government of the Republic would see this in a very favorable
light because the matter concerns humanitarian assistance and
therefore we have every reason to facilitate such assistance,"
Michaelides said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister referred to U.N. resolution 688 of 1991 for
humanitarian aid to the Kurds in northern Iraq and the stationing
of an international force comprising 72 aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
"Permission for the use of Incirlik was renewed every six
months but differences of opinion in the new Turkish parliament
may not allow the renewal of the permit in June," Michaelides
explained.
</P>
<P>
It was first reported by the BBC that the Turkish parliament
will not renew the existing agreement for the use of Turkey's
Incirlik base unless important changes are made.
</P>
<P>
One alternative solution under consideration is to move
operations to RAF Akrotiri, in Cyprus, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The existing agreement gives the right to British, American,
French and Turkish aircraft to take part in operation "Provide
Comfort."
</P>
<P>
The operation, set up after the 1991 Gulf war, aims to offer
assistance to the Kurds in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dollar Tumbles Amid High Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Dollar tumbled three
percent against key currencies in March and looks set to weaken
further due to continued high inflation levels, a Zimbabwean
stockbroking firm said today.
</P>
<P>
Edwards Company predicted that inflation, currently pegged at
26.4 percent, would remain "stubbornly high" for the first half
of the this year, weakening the Zimbabwe Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has been sliding inexorably against major
currencies since the beginning of the year due to continued
importer demand.
</P>
<P>
Consumer price inflation averaged 22.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The firm said the three to 20 percent hike of fuel prices
announced on April 1, barely three months after the last round of
hikes, would offset any short-term declines in food prices.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets French Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng promised at
a meeting with the President of the French Senate Rene Monory
today that China will endeavour to enhance cooperation with France
in a number of fields, including politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
Li said his visit is designed to show the French government and
its people the willingness of the Chinese people to strengthen
Sino-French friendship and to enhance exchanges and cooperation in
politics, economy, science and technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang, who is with Li
in Paris, said the meeting was conducted in a warm and friendly
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that France was the first Western country to establish
diplomatic ties with China and said that today's sound bilateral
relations were achieved through the efforts of many people in both
countries, including the French Senate and its leaders.
</P>
<P>
Monory, who visited China in 1994, said bilateral relations
have developed rapidly. France and China are both major powers and
should strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Senate President also expressed his belief that Li's visit
would be a success.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Monory hosted a banquet in honor of the
Chinese premier and his wife Zhu Lin.
</P>
<P>
In his toast, Monory said France and China enjoy a long history
of friendly cooperation, and that the Sino-French relations
should be viewed from a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
As countries of world importance and permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, France and China should conduct effective
cooperation and establish a strategic partnership, Monory said.
</P>
<P>
A sound relationship between the two countries is not only
conducive to fostering European-Asian relations, but will also
benefit world peace and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said at the banquet that further progress has been made in
bilateral ties and many members of the French parliament have
contributed to that process.
</P>
<P>
He echoed Monory's view that prospects for mutually beneficial
cooperation are broad and promising.
</P>
<P>
He urged both sides to work hard to bring a sound and stable
Sino-French relationship to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The world is experiencing profound changes, said Li. China and
France should strengthen consultation and cooperation in
international affairs and make their contribution to world peace
and development.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands Turkey Recall Four Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
demanded the Turkish government recall its four diplomats who
were accused of espionage.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Iran's Foreign
Ministry asked Turkey to terminate the mission of four Turkish
diplomats in Iran and recall them to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the ministry was quoted as saying "such a
decision was taken as a result of the failure of the Turkish
diplomats to observe the diplomatic norms in Iran."
</P>
<P>
The report said that several espionage networks led by some
Turkish diplomats have recently been discovered in Tehran, Tabriz
and Orumiyeh.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced here Tuesday night that it has smashed a
Turkish espionage ring mostly made up of Turkish diplomats in the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, the intelligence director general of East Azarbaijan
province did not say exactly how many were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence director general provided their
identifications of the four linked to the espionage ring as
follows:
</P>
<P>
Ardal Kuzoghlu, Turkish political attache at the Consulate in
Orumiyeh; Khalil Olomoz, political attache at the Turkish Embassy
in Tehran; Ali Hussein Hakan Kadakal, political attache at the
Orumiyeh Consulate; and Qadri Jan, political attache at the
consulate in Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
He said further information on the espionage ring will be put
at the disposal of the media and the public opinion in coming
days.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence officer was quoted as saying that confessions
of those arrested and the documents discovered from the spy den
indicate that the spies garnered information and put it at the
disposal of the Turkish Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
The official said that members of the ring conspired against
the Islamic Republic of Iran and intended to interfere in Iran's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
They were trying to form clandestine groups in an effort to
carry out unlawful operations and acts of sabotage against the
sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the confessions of the members of the
espionage ring indicate that a number of Turkish intelligence
officers who were planted under the guise of diplomats at the
Turkish Embassy in Tehran and its consulates in Tabriz and
Orumiyeh, spearheaded these covert activities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest move taken by the Iranian
government would jeopardize the deteriorating relations between
Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Turkey have turned ice-cold after
the publications of news report that Turkey and Israel signed a
military agreement under which the Israeli air force is permitted
to train in Turkish skies.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister
AliToygun, Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi said, "If the
news is correct, it is going to hurt the feeling of the Islamic
nation."
</P>
<P>
In reply, Toygun said that Ankara attached great importance to
its friendly relations with other countries. It would not allow
any country to disrupt its friendly relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to an Iranian report, the Turkish official denied
that his country had put its airspace and base at the disposal of
Israel.

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Grows 1.1 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department said
today the productivity of the American workplace grew 1.1 percent
in 1995 but the drop in the last quarter of the year was deeper
than originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
The department said the growth in non-farm productivity was the
strongest since it advanced 3.2 percent in 1992, but still less
than half the rates of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
But it revised the drop of U.S. productivity in the last
quarter of 1995 to 1 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
from previously announced 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Productivity grew 0.2 percent in 1993 and 0.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, which measures output per number of hours worked,
is considered a key element of Americans' standard of living.
Greater efficiency means businesses can increase employees' wages
without raising prices since workers are producing more with the
same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, output jumped 2.7 percent, although it increased just
0.6 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate during the
October-December quarter. Hours worked rose 1.6 percent, including
a 1.6 percent rate of increase in the final three months.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, typically two-thirds of the cost of a
product, increased 2.5 percent, faster than the gains of 1.6
percent in 1994 and 2.1 percent in 1993. In the fourth quarter,
they were accelerating at a 3.8 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Hourly compensation rose 0.7 percent during the year, when
adjusted for inflation, including a 0.4 percent rate from October
through December.
</P>
<P>
Productivity in the manufacturing sector remained relatively
strong, increasing 3.7 percent during the year compared to 4.2
percent in 1994. Factory productivity had grown 2.1 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believed productivity in the U.S. rebounded
during the first three months of this year as output has increased.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Civil Servants Win Pay Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian civil servants and public
workers have won another 10 percent pay rise from the government
with effect from April 1, a trade union leader revealed today.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ)
Japhet Moonde told his members in Southern Province that
following an assurance of another 10 percent increment by the
government, his union and the Public Service Workers Union (PSWU)
had agreed with the government to solve the current pay rise
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The workers will therefore get a 10 percent increase over and
above their present salaries effective from April 1," Moonde
explained.
</P>
<P>
He further disclosed that the government had also agreed to
start negotiations with the two public service unions for this
year's pay increment.
</P>
<P>
The union leaders were going round the provinces to prepare
their members psychologically for tough negotiations this year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to ask for a living wage," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the civil servants and public service workers had
already obtained a 45 percent pay increase.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Hamas Plans War against PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today that the military wing
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has plans for a war
against the Palestinian self-rule authority.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, speaking at a session of the Palestinian Council (PC)
held today in the West Bank town of Ramallah, also said the
commanders of the Hamas militants are in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a declaration of war," Arafat told the members of the
PC as he read from what he said was a "Hamas document," adding
that the Hamas leadership is in Amman, capital of Jordan, where
the anti-PNA orders are coming from.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Arafat announced that he no longer trusted
Hamas to control its armed wing, saying "Hamas has tried more
than once to conduct coup against PNA after receiving external
orders."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian media reported that Arafat was particularly upset
that members of the Jordanian parliament sympathetic to Hamas had
distributed a fatwa (religious ruling) stating that "suicide
bombings against Israelis are not taboo."
</P>
<P>
Izzidine al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, had conducted a
series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel late February and
early March, which killed at least 60 people and wounded over 150
others.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip following the suicide attacks, and pressed Arafat and PNA
to crack down on the Islamic military groups operating inside the
Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police have arrested over 600 Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad activists, immediately deteriorating the relations
between the PNA and the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Today's PC session in Ramallah is the second meeting of the
88-member council in the West Bank since the inauguration session
of the legislative council was convened in Gaza on March 7.
</P>
<P>
The council also discussed a meeting of the donor countries
for the Palestinians due to take place in Brussels, Belgium,
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Over 15,000 Cattle Stolen in Zimbabwe Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 15,000 head of cattle
valued at 3.13 million U.S. Dollars were stolen last year from
farms throughout Zimbabwe, an increase of 381 beasts from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Police here said today a total of 15,731 head of cattle were
stolen in 1995, of which only 4,382 were recovered while 1,423
people were arrested for cattle theft.
</P>
<P>
The continued increase in cattle rustling is a major cause for
concern to cattle farmers who are battling to rebuild the
national herd, which was decimated by two successive droughts in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
To combat the thefts, farmers and the police are now offering
rewards where the cattle are recovered and the culprits
identified. This was introduced in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Stock theft has generally been on the increase. Since 1980, a
total of 133,000 head of cattle, estimated to be worth 20 million
U.S. Dollars have been stolen and only 28,853 cattle have been
recovered.

<HEADLINE> UK Car Sales Fall 0.9 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- New car registrations in Britain
fell by 0.9 percent year on year last month to 180,275, amid
further signs that demand from private motorists still remains
weak.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT) triggered immediate recriminations among car makers
and dealers as to responsibility for the poor state of car demand.
</P>
<P>
The March data confirmed that the new car market was being
sustained largely by fleet purchases. Yet even the 3.9 percent
rise in fleet and business buying last month was not enough to
offset the fall in private purchases.
</P>
<P>
Roger King, the SMMT's director of public affairs, said the 6.6
percent fall in private purchases "continues to cause concern."
</P>
<P>
The poor car sales were cited by Alan Pulham, the director of
the National Franchised Dealers Association, which represents most
car distributors, as evidence that car prices were too high and
private buyers were turning to cheaper "nearly new" vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Private car purchases will continue to slide until
manufacturers return to a realistic pricing policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
But King rejected claims that prices were too high. "Recent
references to U.K. and European car prices being higher than those
in the U.S. are misleading as they are based on the comparison of
different markets subject to different influences," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pocket Cash Can Be Placed on Plastic Card: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- People in New York and other
places will be able to put their pocket cash on a plastic card,
without the need to carry too many coins and bills.
</P>
<P>
As a program announced today by the Citibank, Chase Manhattan,
Mastercard and visa, they will issue improved electronic purse
cards after more tests later this year.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said that early tests of electronic
cash have had disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
The two leading banks based in New York decided to join efforts
to improve card reading. As a result, portable battery-powered
card readers, with the size of a big calculator, will allow
electronic cash cards to pay for everything, from restaurant
checks to taxi rides instantly.
</P>
<P>
No personal identification number is necessary. A small display
will show the amount of the purchase, and customers will simply
push one button to confirm the purchase, transferring the money in
instantly to a card owned by the merchant.
</P>
<P>
Banks are pushing aggressively into this unknown market,
because they see an opportunity for profits from electronic cash
and reduced costs from fewer tellers.
</P>
<P>
The cards will hold up to 100 U.S. dollars in spendable cash,
which can be loaded onto the cards by the owner from their bank
accounts by using automated teller machines or specially equipped
telephones in their homes, and eventually over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
But the banks will encounter some problems in pushing the card
selling. Some people may think it will become a burden to carry
another card, which may get lost and be used by anyone who picks
it up.
</P>
<P>
To get businesses to participate, the banks will have to
subsidize the cost of the car readers, which now run 500 U.S.
dollars to 1,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Troops in South Korea Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States and South
Korea have spent billions of U.S. dollars in recent years to
modernize their troops in South Korea, according to a published
report here today.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that during the Vietnam War era, the
U.S. military in South Korea slipped, as the best and most modern
equipment was shipped to Southeast Asia. But in the past 10 years,
particularly since 1990, the United States has almost completely
replaced its equipment in the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
For example, the entire fleet of 140 U.S. tanks has in the past
six years been replaced with Abrams M-1A1 tanks, a newer version
of the kind used in the Gulf War in 1991. Each of such tanks costs
nearly 3 million U.S. dollars and travels more than 40 mph over
rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military in South Korea has spent more than 3.7
billion U.S. dollars since 1991 to replace its entire fleet of
helicopters. The last of the Vietnam-era Huey utility helicopters
went out of service last month. The Hueys were replaced by 165
UH-60 Black hawk helicopters, which cost 8 million to 12 million
U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The armored personnel carriers that move soldiers around during
a war have also been completely replaced since 1991, at a cost of
more than 400 million U.S. dollars. The M-113 personnel carrier
has been replaced by a fleet of 180 modern Bradley Fighting
Vehicles.

voters, but only one in four regarded them as reliable.
</P>
<P>
The poll coincided with revelations that Japan's national
network Tokyo Broadcasting System decided not to air an interview
with lawyer Tsutsumi Sakamoto, a strong critic of the religious
group Aum Shinrikyo after showing it to key members of the cult.
</P>
<P>
Aum leader Shoko Asahara and several senior sector members have
been indicted on suspicion of murdering Sakamoto, his wife and son
in november 1989, nine days after the Aum members visited TBS to
watch the video.
</P>
<P>
Of the 270 lower house members who responded to Yomiuri
Shimbu's survey, 54 percent said newspapers are reliable or
"fairly reliable," but only 25 percent said the same of television.
</P>
<P>
And while 70 percent of the legislators said newspaper reports
are accurate, only 46 percent felt the same about television
programs, according to the poll.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sticks to Nuclear Cooperation With Iran: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia is prepared to build more
nuclear projects "for peaceful purposes" in Iran in spite of
Western objections, two high-ranking Russian officials said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, Deputy Russian
Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshov said that apart from a nuclear
power plant under construction in Bushehr, Iran, the two sides are
are also designing other projects aimed at using nuclear energy
for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets also
reaffirmed at a meeting with Iranian Ambassador Medhi Safari that
Russia will go ahead with the construction of the nuclear power
plant in Bushehr and will build a civilian aircraft plant in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Chernyshov told Itar-Tass that, "On the one hand, Russia does
not want a new nuclear state to appear, especially close to its
borders, on the other hand, it seeks to make a profit on the
projects and preserve the (nuclear) market for itself."
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia "does not want the isolation of Iran, but
the development of mutually-advantageous cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed Washington's position on Iran as "unreasoned and
isolationist." The United States suspects Iran of trying to use
Russian nuclear technology for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Ambassador Safari, Oleg Soskovets said,
"Russian-Iranian trade and economic cooperation will develop
regardless of statements against it."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia is trying to strengthen its foreign
policy in the south and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Safari said his country was interested in Russian-made nuclear
equipment for power plants and had already purchased equipment for
its fuel and energy complex worth 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said seven joint projects were being designed in
the field of petrochemicals and Iran is also ready to lease a
number of small Russian Yak-42 planes, Itar-Tass said.

PHNOM PENH, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo
Van Kiet and his two Cambodian counterparts today agreed to settle
their countries' border dispute peacefully through the border
expert commission, the Kampuchea Television Station (KTV) reported.
</P>
<P>
Kiet arrived in the Cambodian capital today for talks with

The two sides also held talks on the problem of Vietnamese
immigrants in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries have had border disputes in the
past, ties between them had been improving. But in January,
relations received a setback when Ranariddh accused Vietnam of
moving border markers into Cambodian territory. But Vietnam denied
the charges.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Complete Nuclear Arms Storage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that Russia will this year complete the withdrawal and
dismantling of former Soviet nuclear arsenals from Belarus and
Ukraine, the Interfax News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Yeltsin as saying Russia has done all it can to put
former Soviet nuclear weapons into storage and is building secure
storage facilities for nuclear material from dismantled nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Russian National Security Council
held in the Kremlin this morning, Yeltsin said, "Russia has done
all in its power to put all former Soviet nuclear weapons in
storage on its territory."
</P>
<P>
"This year will see the final stage of this work -- the
withdrawal of the nuclear arsenals from Belarus and Ukraine and
their disassembly."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council meeting was called to discuss preparations
for the Moscow G-8 summit on nuclear security scheduled for April
19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be held for the first time as a Group of Eight
meeting instead of the G-7 plus one format used to describe earlier
summits of the world's seven top industrialized countries with the
participation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 meeting will be chaired by Yeltsin and French President
Jacques Chirac and attended by leaders from Canada, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In preparing the summit agenda, Russia has blocked any
discussion of its military nuclear facilities or programs,
claiming any such talks would be an infringement of its national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin said Russia needs broad international cooperation
in developing its nuclear power projects and dealing with nuclear
waste.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is making serious efforts to ensure security of its
nuclear power engineering sector. But the problems relating to
nuclear security cannot be successfully resolved within the
framework of national programs alone," Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
"The development of joint projects of safe nuclear reactors of
the 21st century meets common interests, but the problem of the
destruction of the most dangerous lasting radioactive elements
must be resolved as well," the Russian President emphasized.

MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin

</P>
<P>
But he did not disclose the names of the mediators, the

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Loan Guarantees for SMEs to Help Create Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A new initiative to create jobs
by helping small and medium-sized enterprises cut their borrowing
costs was adopted today by the European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
The proposal is aimed at helping SMEs gain access to credit,
lowering their costs of borrowing thus supporting job creation, EC
Commissioner for economic and financial affairs Yves-Thibault de
Silguy told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The European Investment Fund will offer loan guarantees
amounting to one billion ECUs (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) to SMEs
in the European Union, with priority access for those employing
fewer than 50 people and those with cross-border implications.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner stressed that only investment projects which
create new jobs will get access to the scheme.
</P>
<P>
SMEs in the EU, acknowledged as an essential source of growth
and employment, often have difficulties gaining financing as banks
believe they represent a relatively high credit risk and they
often can't offer the kind of loan security required by banks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, SMEs in general have to pay higher interest rates
on their borrowings than large companies.
</P>
<P>
The EU is eager to fight unemployment, which at present affects
one in every nine of its citizens.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Meets with Thai Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, emphasized here today that China will never allow
anyone to bring about "Taiwan Independence", "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a meeting with a delegation of
Thai journalists.
</P>
<P>
"There are two kinds of issues in the world," he said, "one is
flexible and thus negotiable, and the other is rigid and with no
room for discussion."
</P>
<P>
He said that territorial issues belong to the latter. "It is
not open to doubt that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will never allow anyone,
under whatever pretext and by whatever method, to create "Taiwan
Independence", "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has made clear its definite
stand and adamant attitude on the Taiwan issue. "This issue is an
out-and-out internal affair of China, in which no other country
has a right to interfere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the delegation, Li said that the friendship between
Chinese and Thai people has a long tradition. The two countries
have enjoyed very good relations since the establishment of
diplomatic ties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Developing Sino-Thai friendly and co-operative ties has a
significant bearing on peace, stability and development in the
Asia-Pacific region, Li said. He expressed the hope that Thai
journalists would continue working for the expansion of the
friendly and co-operative ties.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the guests on China's internal situation. Since the
policy of reform and opening-up was adopted 18 years ago, China
has made great progress in developing its economy and improving
its people's living standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
There of course exist difficulties and problems in the course
of progress, Li said, but "we should face up to them, analyze them
and take concrete measures to solve them".
</P>
<P>
He said that the enormous achievements in reform and opening-up
should be fully recognized no matter what difficulties and
problems may crop up; China's reform and opening-up policy will
never be changed, because it has the support and endorsement of
the people throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Guo Chaoren, president of Xinhua News Agency, was present at
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Capable of Absorbing Iraqi Oil Output: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is capable of absorbing Iraqi oil
output if Iraq is allowed to resume limited oil export following
reaching an agreement on the "oil-for-food" program with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
OPEC President Omar Mekhloufi made the remarks today at a
meeting with Kuwaiti Oil Minister Abdul Mohsen Madaj, the Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mekhloufi said Tuesday that "if the oil market is capable of
absorbing an increase in the output of many oil-producing
countries, how could it be incapable of absorbing the oil output
of Iraq when it resumes oil production?"
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Iraqi officials started a third round of
negotiations Monday at the U.N. headquarters on the terms under
which Iraq might be allowed to sell 1 billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil every 90 days to buy badly needed food and medicine. The
two previous rounds of talks were held in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under comprehensive U.N. sanctions, including a
ban on vital oil exports, since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mekhloufi said OPEC member states would discuss the return of
Iraq to the oil market at a meeting to be held in Vienna, Austria,
on June 5. But he indicated that an urgent meeting might be held
in case the U.N. and Iraq could reach a speedy solution.
</P>
<P>
Mekhloufi, who is also the Algerian Minister of Energy and
Mining, and OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukmandd arrived here
Tuesday on a tour of OPEC member states ahead of the OPEC's next
ministerial meeting due to be held next June in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC president said the purpose of his current visit is to
discuss the future prospects of the organization and to give it an
impetus.
</P>
<P>
Mekhloufi and Lukmandd are scheduled to visit Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates Friday and Saturday, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Governments Sued Over Airbase Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of residents near a
U.S. airbase in Japan filed a class-action suit today demanding
compensation of 3.3 billion yen (about 31 million U.S. dollars)
for aircraft noise and a ban of night flights, Kyodo News Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, the fifth of its kind over noise at the Yokota
base in the suburbs of Tokyo, is the first to target the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"We want to fight directly with the U.S. government in the
court now that public attention to U.S. bases in Japan is growing
because of the Okinawa issue," Kyodo quoted a lawyer for some
3,100 plaintiffs as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. servicemen raped a 12-year-old schoolgirl in
September 1995. The incident triggered strong protests across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The residents are even planning to stage a rally to protest the
noise during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Japan next
Tuesday, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
They are demanding a ban on flights between 9 p.m. and 7
a.m. and compensation payments of 600,000 to 800,000 yen (about
5,560 to 7,400 dollars) for each claimant.
</P>
<P>
They also want the Japanese and U.S. governments to confirm
their obligations to negotiate future compensation claims,
according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
In February 1993, Japan's Supreme Court ruled that the Japanese
government should compensate residents near the Yokota base for
noise caused by U.S. jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, however, rejected the residents' demand for a ban
on night flights, saying U.S. jets' activities in Japan come under
the joint security pact and are therefore outside the jurisdiction
of the Japanese government.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S.Korean Parties Make Last Campaign Efforts  By Tang Shuifu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- With voting in South Korea's
parliamentary elections only one day away, all political parties
and candidates are making a last ditch bid for support.
</P>
<P>
Since the official election campaign kicked off on March 26,
violence and mudslinging have been reported in excessively fierce
campaigns, marring public hopes for fair and clean elections.
</P>
<P>
As of April 3, 456 people, including 131 candidates, had been
charged for breaking election laws, and 57 people imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
The poll on April 11 will elect 299 members to the National
Assembly - 253 through direct voting in electoral districts and 46
through distribution under a proportional system calculated on the
percentage of votes a party wins.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,385 candidates are running for the 253 seats, an average
of 5.5 candidates per seat, the highest ratio in the nation's
electoral history, according to the Central Election Management
Committee (CEMC).
</P>
<P>
Eight political parties are taking part in the election, but
there has been a significant increase in the number of independent
candidates, indicating a lack of trust in the established
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP), which has 150 seats in the
outgoing parliament has fielded candidates in all of the 253
electoral districts and hopes to retain its position as the
majority party by winning at least 130 seats.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP),
which currently has 55 seats, has put up 230 candidates and wants
to win at least one third of the seats up for grabs in the
election, the minimum needed to block constitutional revisionists
who want to change from the current presidential system to a
cabinet system of government.
</P>
<P>
The two minor opposition parties, the Democratic Party (DP) and
the United Liberal Democrats (ULD), have fielded 225 and 219
candidates respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ULD hopes to win 60 seats in the parliament so as to
introduce a constitutional revision motion for a cabinet system of
government, and the DP is looking for 30 or 40 seats.
</P>
<P>
The electoral landscape has become unpredictable as both ruling
and opposition parties have been hit by scandals.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the ruling New Korea Party were pessimistic about
their chances of winning a majority in the new assembly. But in
January, prospects brightened as the NKP recruited Lee Hoi-chang,
a former prime minister, and Park Chan-jong, a lawyer-turned
politician, who is particularly popular among voters in and around
the capital Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the ruling party's approval rating increased by 7
percentage points after their recruitment.
</P>
<P>
But the party suffered a major setback when a graft case
involving former Presidential Secretary Chang Hak-ro surfaced just
a few days before the election campaign started.
</P>
<P>
The case dealt a severe blow to President Kim Young-sam and
cost his ruling party at least 4 percentage points of public
support rating, election watchers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, say analysts, the NCNP, despite alleged
money-for-candidate-nomination deals, is still making its presence
felt in South and North Cholla Provinces, its strongholds, and
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The minor opposition DP, which saw its popularity sharply
increase after it revealed former President Roh Tae-woo's slush
fund scandal last year, is waging an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
The party, which has no regional base, appears to have been
pushed to the sidelines in the face of a showdown between the
ruling and two main opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The ULD was also hit by nomination scandals. But the party,
with the backing of voters in South and North Chungchong
Provinces, is widening its voter support across the nation.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper reported that the ruling NKP is gaining upper
hands in 79 districts, the main opposition NCNP in 65 and the
minor opposition ULD in 33 districts.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that tomorrow's general election will
not only bring about the restructuring of the four main South
Korean political parties but will also have a strong influence on
next year's presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Firms Call for Postponement of New Ruling  on Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 115 companies in central
Java, Indonesia, have appealed to the government to postpone the
implementation of regional minimum wage payment for 12 months,
according to a statement by the Textile Firms Association in
central Java received here today.
</P>
<P>
The companies found it difficult to implement the new ruling in
a short period and were afraid that it would lead conflict between
employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
The association said in the statement that the new wage system
need transition time before the new ruling is implemented.
</P>
<P>
Under the Manpower Ministry decree No 21/1996, companies are
required to pay minimum wages for 30 working days instead of 25
working days, effective on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The companies, most of them being later intensive one, argued
that the 30-working-day payments would actually increase the
minimum wage by 36 percent.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Government-approved foreign
investment in Indonesia declined by 15 percent within the first
two-and-a-half months of this year, while domestic investment rose
by 86.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment approved from January 1 to March 15 this
year reached 8.5 billion US dollars, far lower than the 10 billion
approved in the same period in 1995, according to data from the
Investment Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
In terms of projects, the number of foreign investment projects
increased by 72.6 percent to 271, from 157 in the same period in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline in foreign investment coupled with the increase in
projects seems to indicate that foreign investors are becoming
more interested in smaller ventures.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that foreign investment is mainly committed to
the paper industry, the chemical industry and housing and
industrial estates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBC),
the country's central bank, picked up a new monetary tool Tuesday
by officially launching the long-awaited open market operation in
bonds.
</P>
<P>
A bank source said that the PBC repurchased from commercial
banks a total of 290 million yuan in short-term treasury bonds on
the first day of the new business.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the launching of the open market
operation, deemed by many central banks worldwide as an effective
monetary tool for conducting indirect financial macro-control,
will enable the central bank to better manage the money supply and
distribute credit assets.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the central bank's new business, the Ministry of
Finance has, since the start of this year, reformed its way of
issuing treasury bonds and increased the proportion of short-term,
tradable bonds.
</P>
<P>
To date, the ministry has issued four batches of treasury
bonds, valued at 79.5 billion yuan in the aggregate. Commercial
banks as a whole subscribed 19.7 billion yuan-worth of registered
short-term bonds in the first quarter.

He said 27 others are on the way from Monrovia to Freetown,
capital of neighboring Sierra Leone to flee the new clashes among
Liberia's warring factions in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"The departure of the 27 U.S. nationals was slightly delayed
by a thunderstorm," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hitch in the operation so far and we have not
experienced any difficulties," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spokesman said he could not say how long the
evacuation operation will last.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the operation would be halted if calm returns to
Monrovia, Anderson said: "There is the possibility but this would
have to be made by people on the ground in Monrovia."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the factions agreed on a ceasefire to end four days
of fighting in the capital that has forced thousands of civilians
to flee their homes and stoked fears of a new, all-out civil war.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, agreed at talks late on Tuesday, each side
would cease hostilities and fugitive warlord Roosevelt Johnson
would turn himself in to the West African peacekeepers or the
U.N. military observers pending talks on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said despite the ceasefire promise, a total of 420
Americans will be evacuated as well as 400 others, mainly
international relief workers.
</P>
<P>
He said the evacuation operators are "having cooperation from
all sides."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Freetown International Airport in Lungi, a
town 14 miles from Freetown, hundreds of Sierra Leoneans and
other nationals watched from the arrival lounge as cargo
helicopters ferry the evacuees from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The United States Embassy in Freetown has set up an arrival
screening unit for the evacuees who are then brought to mainland
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The only hotel at the airport has put up a "no vacancy" sign
as all rooms have been taken up by embassy staff and marines
involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
A visibly shaken female official working for the U.S. Embassy
in Monrovia spoke of how she had waken up to heavy gunfire on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I saw people running to the shelters while others dived for
cover. The Greystone Compound (residence of U.S. diplomats) was
quickly full with women carrying their babies while toddlers
trotted behind," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Just when Monrovia was getting down to peace, war has erupted
once again," said another Liberian refugee.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot foresee peace just yet. Whatever agreement is
reached will only be temporary," he added.

<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said today that China takes a positive attitude toward mutually
beneficial cooperation with French automobile makers.
</P>
<P>
Li told PSA Peugeot-Citroen President Jaques Calvet he
appreciated what he described as the company's bold decision to
enter the Chinese market in 1986 when relations between the two
countries were at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Chinese premier on production matters, Calvet said
his company now enjoys good cooperation with its Chinese partners
and a loan agreement expected to be signed between the two
governments will help his company increase its production capacity
in China.
</P>
<P>
He was confident his company will become a component part of
the auto industry, designated one of China's four pillar
industries in its Ninth Five-Year Plan for 1996 - 2000.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the Chinese car market faces bright prospects
as the economy continues to develop. But competition will grow
fiercer as prices fall and more parts are produced locally.
</P>
<P>
Calvet said his company will introduce the most advanced
technologies to China and accelerate the localization of
manufacturing of parts used in Chinese-made cars.

BRUSSELS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An international conference to
raise urgently needed funds for the reconstruction of Bosnia will
be held on Friday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The rebuilding program for 1996 for the war-torn country will
cost about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, but less than one third of
the money was pledged at a Donors' Conference last December.

The aim of this, the second Donors' Conference, is to seek firm
financial commitments for the remaining 1.2 billion dollars needed
for the program and to secure political commitments for a
medium-term program.
</P>
<P>
Some 55 countries and 29 international organizations have been
invited to the conference sponsored by the European Commission and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission says Bosnia's urgent reconstruction
priorities over the next three to four years will require

<HEADLINE> Excellent Workers, Units to Be Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 workers and 300 units
who have made great contributions to China's economic
construction, reform and opening-up drive are to be honored by the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ni Haomei, vice-chairperson of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU) and its spokeswoman, said here today that the
name list of these excellent workers and units has been decided
upon. The ACFTU will give them May 1 Labor Merits and May 1 Labor
Certificates on the eve of the 110th International Labor Day,
which falls May 1.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the excellent workers are from grassroots
units. Ni said that this fully displays the guiding principle of
relying on the working class whole-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
Scientific researchers and engineers make up 15.4 percent of
all those who will be cited, and managers and factory leaders,
11.8 percent. Some 87 percent of the excellent workers are members
of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Ni said that the 1,300 winners were selected according to
strict democratic procedures. Two measures were adopted to ensure
the quality of excellent people and units. Any candidate for the
May 1 Labor Merit had to have been approved by his or her workers'
congress or congress of wokers' representatives. Party leaders,
administrative officials and trade union leaders of any unit to be
cited had to pass examinations held by the local industry and
commerce department, tax department, discipline inspection
commission and auditing department.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU also invited 10 workers to attend the celebration
activities to be held in Beijing. The 10 workers selected from
more than 100 million Chinese workers are all national or
provincial model workers. Five of them will report the efforts
made and achievements gained in their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
The Party and the State Council have rewarded 19,354 people
from industrial, agricultural, science and technology,
educational, cultural and public health fields as model laborers,
since New China was founded in 1949.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Officials' Gulf Tour Probably Includes Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) who are
currently on their tour to Gulf oil producers are likely to visit
Iraq later this month, an Iraqi oil industry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Before their departure to the Gulf area, OPEC President Omar
Mekhloufi and Secretary-General Rilwani Lukmandd decided in
principle to visit Baghdad on April 13, Saturday, following their
visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the source said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first official visit by OPEC top officials to
Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the OPEC officials' Gulf tour
includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC officials' visit to Baghdad indicates that OPEC has
taken a positive attitude in dealing with Iraq's oil export
sharing. Iraq has been barred by the United Nations from exporting
its oil, the main hard currency earner for the country, more than
five years ago for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the opinion that the OPEC action shows
that the world oil producers believe that a lifting of the
U.N. oil embargo imposed on Iraq as part of its blanket trade
sanctions is imminent and they call for OPEC to take measures to
prepare for Iraq's oil export in accordance with its oil quota in
the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began its third round of negotiations Monday with the
U.N. for a possible partial oil sale in order to buy food,
medicine and other basic requirements for its population.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official media voiced optimism today a positive
outcome of oil-for-food talks will be realized but Baghdad based
diplomats believe that problems still remains.
</P>
<P>
The most outstanding issue is the distribution of food and
medicine for the Kurds in northern Iraq. Iraq considers the issue
in the talks under U.N. resolution 986 adopted last April
infringes its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Water-Control Facilities Benefit Tibet Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The building of large number of
water-control projects in the Tibet Autonomous Region has helped
the development of its agriculture, industry and urban
construction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 769 million yuan was invested in carrying out 114
water-control and hydropower projects in the region on the world's
highest plateau in the past five years, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 25,300 hectares more fields were irrigated,
additional 20,000 kw was added to its installed electricity
capacity for farm use, and 21,000 more people and 74,000 more head
of livestock gained access to drinking water.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the region's irrigated area of farmland
reached 147,000 hectares, and that of grassland jumped to 120,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
There was no irrigated grassland before 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some areas with good water-control facilities have emerged as
regional production bases for market grain.
</P>
<P>
Aided by the newly built facilities, Tibet saw its seventh
consecutive year for bumper harvests and increase of livestock in
1995.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that water-control facilities have contributed
over one billion yuan in direct economic benefits in the past five
years.

<HEADLINE> UK Mortgage Rate Cut to Lowest in 31 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's second largest building
society, Nationwide, has fired a further shot in the mortgage
price war by cutting the cost of its home loans to its lowest
level in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
The 0.25 percentage point rate cut to 6.74 percent, was
immediately matched by Yorkshire Building Society, making the two
societies the cheapest high street lenders in the market.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide and Yorkshire, which remain committed to mutual
ownership, said the new rate would apply to both new and existing
borrowers from May 1.
</P>
<P>
It brings down the monthly cost of a 60,000 pounds endowment
mortgage by almost 24 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Savings rates will also be cut by the same percentage, but
Nationwide insisted its rates would remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
The two building societies' initiative is part of a growing
division between societies which are determined to remain mutual,
owned by their savers and borrowers, and rivals who have announced
plans to float on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Most major lenders said Tuesday they did not intend to cut
their rates, which currently stand at about 7.25 percent, which
translates into at least 47 pounds more a month on a 60,000 pounds
endowment mortgage than the Nationwide's.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Remains Confident of Peace in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today expressed confidence that the peace and order problem in
Mindanao will be resolved with the full participation of the
community there.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of a lot of people, surely we can fix the
Mindanao problem," Ramos said during a press conference in
Malacanang this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He justified the on-going military action in north Cotabato,
Mindanao, saying the government is just doing its job which is to
protect the lives of the people.
</P>
<P>
The president said the military and the police are just
enforcing the law after the Muslim extremists attacked six
military detachments in the area.
</P>
<P>
He cited the need for the local residents to work with
sincerity and dedication in bringing about peace and development
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that fighting broke out last week between
government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
guerrillas over a irrigation dam in north Cotabato, Mindanao. So
far, 16 persons were reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
The MILF insists that the presence of troops at the irrigation
project in north Cotabato violates an agreement it made with the
military in January 1995 on creating a five-kilometer buffer zone
around the irrigation dam.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan President Pledges to Abide by Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Mircea
Snegur said on Tuesday that he will abide by the ruling of the
Constitutional Court on his controversial sacking of his defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Court decided on April 4 that the president's dismissal of
Pavel Creanga on March 15 was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan law says the president has no right to directly remove
government ministers. They can only be dismissed by the prime
minister or by a vote of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Moldovan capital Chisinau say Snegur made the
remarks to a visiting senior justice official from the Council of
Europe. The president also said that "democratic legal reform" in
Moldova will continue.
</P>
<P>
A deputy speaker of the Moldovan Parliament told reporters that
the government should be restored to "constitutional order" and
Creanga should be temporarily reinstated as defense minister until
a non-military successor is appointed.
</P>
<P>
The deputy speaker said, however, that neither Creanga nor the
current acting defense minister Tutor Dabija, appointed by the
president, is suitable to be defense minister.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching Bucharest say a large number of officers
in the Moldovan army favor Dabija as the new defense minister.
</P>
<P>
President Snegur sacked Pavel Creanga on March 15, accusing him
of misusing army property, and appointed first deputy defense
minister Tutor Dabija as acting defense minister.
</P>
<P>
But Creanga refused to step down, saying the president's order
was illegal and the matter was referred to the Constitutional
Court.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Iran's Espionage Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry today
strongly denied Iran's accusation that four Turkish diplomats
based in Iran were involved in espionage and covert activities.
</P>
<P>
But Ankara has decided to call back soon the four diplomats in
the Turkish Embassy in Tehran or consulates in Iran for the sake
of their safety, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel.
</P>
<P>
"We reject all the accusations against our officials," Akbel
told a weekly press conference here. "Our diplomats in Iran are
carrying out their duties in accordance with international law
and diplomatic regulations."
</P>
<P>
Iran announced Tuesday that it had smashed a Turkish espionage
ring mostly made up of Turkish diplomats in Iran. Photos of the
four Turkish diplomats, accused of having links with the espionage
ring and conducting spying activities, were published in Iran's
leading newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's move was believed to be a counterattack on Turkey,
whose deputy undersecretary of Foreign Ministry is now in Tehran,
demanding that Iran withdraw four of its diplomats based in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has claimed that the four Iranian diplomats were
involved in political assassinations of Turkey's named advocates of
secular system.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman said Ankara regretted Tehran's
move as Turkey was trying to overpass obstacles with an approach
of "cooperation and mutual understanding."
</P>
<P>
But Akbel noted that Ankara at this stage did not consider
calling back its ambassador to Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Farmers from Ningxia Go on Pilgrimage to Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of 219 moslems from
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, most of whom are farmers, left
on a pilgrimage to Mecca today by airplane.
</P>
<P>
They paid for the trip using their own money, about 22,000 yuan
each. The oldest team member is 80 and the youngest is
30. One-third are women travelling with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
In the four decades up to the 1980s, only seven people from
Ningxia made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and no farmer was ever lucky
enough to make the journey because of poverty, according to an
organizer of the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The region in northwest China has more than 1.6 million people
of the Hui, or moslem, ethnic group, who account for one-third of
the region's population.
</P>
<P>
The organizer said that annual net income of local farmers went
from 594 yuan in 1990 to 1,027 yuan in 1995, and most of the
pilgrims are engaged in grain production, domestic animal
breeding, and business. Some have even become millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Moslems in the region enjoy full religious freedom, the
organizer said, and there are now more than 2,000 mosques, as
opposed to some 200 in the early 1970s, and there are 5,000
professional ahungs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more than 980 moslems of the Hui
ethnic group from Ningxia have made the pilgrimage to Mecca.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A new air route linking Hailar
city in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with Chita
in eastern Russia is to be opened May 3.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second international route operated by the Inner
Mongolia branch of Air China, the country's flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
The 580-km flight between the two cities will take about one
hour. An 89-seat British-made BAe146 will be used on the route,
and flights will be every Tuesday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chita, with a population of 400,000, is the primary
distribution center for Chinese goods in eastern Russia and an
important transshipping site for trade between China and Russia,
and between China and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
At present, 75 businesses in Chita are Chinese-funded,
including 34 Inner Mongolia-funded ventures with the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Hailar-Chita air route will greatly shorten
the journey from China to eastern Russia. It takes almost a whole
day from Hailar to Chita traveling by road.

JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Council (PNC) will convene on April 22 to discuss, among other
things, the revocation of clauses of the Palestinian covenant
calling for Israel's destruction, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Salim Zaanoun, acting chairman of
the PNC, Palestinians' parliament-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, a PNC session has to be held within two
months of the inauguration of the legislative Palestinian Council
(PC), whose 88 members automatically become members of the
PNC. The inauguration, a much-delayed event, finally took place in
Gaza on March 7, thus the PNC must amend the charter by May 7.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has promised to let all PNC members
living abroad return to participate in the special session, an
event that will prove important for the peace process according
to Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
According to Zaanoun, when the PNC meets, it should consist of
669 members. That includes 483 from abroad who attended the last
session in Algiers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the PC is due to meet in Ramallah this
afternoon for the second time in a week. PA President Yasser
Arafat has returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia and will attend
the meeting. Arafat might submit to the session a name list of
his new cabinet.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Though Roman Lebedev did not know
the Chinese word for "future", he believed that his study in China
would do his future career some good.
</P>
<P>
Roman, as he is called in China, is a Russian who has been in
Beijing for three and a half years. He described his future as
"nice" after having learned the Chinese word and a synonym.
</P>
<P>
Roman could not speak a single word of Chinese when he first
came to China after graduating from high school. He is now a
student of international economics at Beijing University, China's
most prestigious university. Previously, he studied Chinese at the
Beijing Language Institute, sometimes referred to as the "tiny
united nations" because of the 1,000 foreign students from more
than 100 countries and regions. There are more foreigners on
campus than Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Roman did not regret having missed the opportunity to go to
college in Russia and was even a little bit proud of himself for
going to a foreign country at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that he can find work in a Russian-Chinese joint
venture to make full use of his Chinese and knowledge of
international economics. "Or, to work in the Foreign Ministry," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Peter Fedotov was a law student at Moscow State University
before coming to China. He was one year short of graduation when
an educational exchange between his university and Beijing
University offered him the opportunity of two years of training in
China.
</P>
<P>
Fedotov chose to study Chinese law because, "there are few
people in Russia who know Chinese law." He was confident of
learning Chinese law and has tried to be diligent and do more
research in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
He said he firmly believes that his future career will have
something to do with China and hopes that he will become an expert
on both Russian and Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
Lin Baixue, a teacher in charge of foreign students affairs of
Beijing University, says that foreign students are becoming more
practical than in the past, choosing subjects and courses that
they believe will be useful in the future.
</P>
<P>
Currently some 450 students from Russia are studying in dozens
of colleges and universities across China. Zhang Yiqun, an
official from the State Education Commission who is in charge of
foreigners studying in China, says that they study international
economics, Chinese language, acupuncture and moxibustion, massage,
agriculture, computers, history, journalism, traditional Chinese
medicine, radio physics, and industrial management.
</P>
<P>
China and the Soviet Union began students exchanges in 1953
when China received 287 people from the Soviet Union. The
cooperation was suspended from 1965 to 1983, when educational
exchanges with other foreign countries were discontinued because
of the so-called "Cultural Revolution" (1966-76). China has
provided training for about 3,000 Russians in all.

<HEADLINE> Macao Expands Land Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao has expanded its land area to
a total of 23.5 square kilometers, more than double that at the end
of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
According to figures in the newly-published "Macao Panorama,"
Macao's total land acreage added up to 23.5 square kilometers in
1994, 2.2 times that at the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
Composed by three parts, namely, the Macao Peninsula, the Taipa
Island and the Coloane Island, Macao was only 10.29 square
kilometers at the end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Macao's land area kept growing over the past century as there
had been four major land expansion campaigns into sea since the
1860s. By 1985, Macao's land area grew to nearly 17 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Macao made more expansion into sea to make
for room for large projects like the Macao International Airport.
All of the three parts of Macao were enlarged.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula increased from 6.05 square kilometers in 1985 to
9.1 square kilometers in 1994, Taipa almost doubled its acreage from
3.78 square kilometers to 6.33 square kilometers, and Coloane's
acreage reached 8.07 square kilometers from 7.09 square kilometers.

<P>
In addition, friendly relations and cooperation between the
Chinese and Russian armed forces have been satisfactory and
provide evidence of the mutual trust and good-neighbour relations
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
By looking at the past, people can see that China and Russia
have made progress in developing a constructive partnership for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Yeltsin's visit, the third Sino-Russian
summit in less than three years, will draw worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
During that visit, the two sides will exchange views on a wide
range of issues, including bilateral relations and international
affairs of common concern.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to sign a political agreement which is
believed to have far-reaching significance, marking the outcome of
the visit. They will also sign a series of agreements on bilateral
cooperation in the economy, trade, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that these agreements will improve the
legal foundation of Sino-Russian ties and that the summit will
raise Sino-Russian relations to a new level.

President Jiang Zemin met with President Yeltsin in May 1995
while attending a celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the
victory in the world's anti-facist war in Moscow and both agreed
to develop this type of new relationship through common efforts.
</P>
<P>
During Premier Li Peng's first official visit to Russia in June
1995, the two countries signed a Sino-Russian joint communique and
seven co-operative agreements, contributing greatly to bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 and 1995, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Central Military
Commission Liu Huaqing visited Russia, and recently, Chairman of
China's National People's Congress Standing Committee Qiao Shi
paid a visit to Russia. Vice-premiers, foreign ministers, and
defense ministers of the two countries have also exchanged visits
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation and trade ties constitute an important
part of a new type of Sino-Russian relations. The economies of the
two countries complement each other to a great extent and there
are geographical advantages.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have been important trading partners for a
long time. In recent years the two sides have worked hard to
increase existing cooperation to a greater degree in order to keep
pace with other developments in their constructive partnership and
to make better use of their huge economic potential.
</P>
<P>
Peace along the 4,300-km border is another important mark of
the Sino-Russian friendly relations. An agreement on the western
section of the border took effect in 1995. Another agreement on
the eastern section has been in effect since 1992. With the two
agreements, most of the border is covered by law.
</P>
<P>
This not only benefits stability and economic growth along the
border area but is also conducive to peace, stability, and
development in the Asia-Pacific region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited visit to China
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin will undoubtedly be of great
significance to the two countries in long-term neighbourly
relations and mutually-beneficial co-operation.
</P>
<P>
As closely-connected neighbours, China and Russia are both
great nations and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In the new circumstance where the whole world is moving toward
pluralism in the post-cold war period, long-term co-operation
between the two nations will not only benefit them, but also play
an active role in establishing a rational, just, equal, and
mutually-beneficial world political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, Sino-Russian ties have had their ups and downs
in the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, during his Russia trip in 1994, pointed
out that neither confrontations nor alliances are in accordance
with the two peoples' fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
The best choice, he said, is to establish good-neighbourly
mutually-beneficial relations based on the five-principles of
peaceful co-existence to serve the interests of the two peoples
and contribute to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The relationship he referred to is a constructive partnership
for the 21st century, and is commonly understood by the two
nations. To have it, both sides have exerted great
efforts. High-ranking officials have had frequent exchanges and
visits.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, President Yeltsin paid his first visit to China and
the two countries signed a joint declaration on bilateral
relations and more than 20 agreements on bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin and Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin travelled to China on separate
occasions in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
In September of the same year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
paid his first official visit to Russia and both sides signed a
Sino-Russian joint declaration and a series of important
documents, laying a solid foundation for a constructive
partnership.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Exhibition of Teawares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of teawares which
vividly portrays the long-forgotten relationship between China and
Belgium in the 18th century was opened in Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
Leung Ding-bong, chairman of the Urban Council of Hong Kong,
said that the exhibition was an appropriate depiction of the
commercial activities, mostly based on tea trade, between China
and Flanders at that time.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the tea trade with China, the people of
Flanders acquired the habit of tea drinking and knowledge on other
aspects of Chinese culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features more than 120 exhibits drawn from more
than 20 public and private collections of Belgium, including ship
models, documents, items used by the sailors, tea caddies, tea
vessels, porcelain in daily usage, paintings and other trade
items.
</P>
<P>
Flanders is the region on the western part of Belgium adjacent
to France. During the 18th century, after the War of the Spanish
Succession, the region was occupied by Austria. Starting from
1715, merchants in Flanders began to develop trade with China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Suffers Severe Energy Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka is in the midst of a
severe energy crisis and the entire country has to suffer five
hour's power cuts every day.
</P>
<P>
According to Sri Lanka's Electricity Board sources, power cuts
may have to be extended to ten hours a day if the drought in the
catchment areas continues. Water in the reservoirs is sufficient
only to generate power till the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The power cuts are adversely affecting the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that economists have reasoned that the five
hour power cuts, if continued for two months, would mean a total
loss of over one month for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
It is found that the Electricity Board is the only institution
that is trying to limit the consumption of its commodity while all
other energy producers promote more use of their products.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, electricity is mainly produced by using water as
raw material which is freely and continuously available except
during some periods of drought as in the present instance. The
degree of environmental damage caused is also minimal.
</P>
<P>
The supply and distribution of electricity is the sole
responsibility of the Electricity Board.
</P>
<P>
Through the years the power grid has been extended to rural
areas with more and more hydro electric schemes being inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
Since the rainfall for power generation is irregular it is
essential to have thermal power plants back-up. But this is what
has been lacking in Sri Lanka and the cause for most of the energy
crisis, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the supply of electricity has become a
major problem in Sri Lanka mainly due to its ever increasing
demand which cannot be adequately met.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Sri Lankans use fuelwood for cooking purposes
while about 30 percent of the households in the country use
electricity for multiple purposes. In addition, electricity is
used for both small scale and large scale industries in the
commercial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The dimension of the crisis is that there is an inadeqaute
supply of electricity for existing consumers and this has hindered
growth in the industrial and commercial services and domestic
sectors. It has also adversely affected those in line to be
connected to the national grid and frustrated their expectations.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission has
banned, barring the prime minister, the use of government aircraft
at state expense during the general election by anyone including
some top political leaders being provided highest security cover.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission said in its order that in case of the
political leaders covered by special security, the use of one
state-owned bullet-proof vehicle for the protected person would be
permitted if the security agencies prescribe such use, the Press
Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
In all cases, where a party or a candidate hired a private
aircraft or helicopter, the complete cost would have to be
included as part of election expenditure without exception, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
It said the use of multiple cars as stand-by vehicles should
not be allowed unless specifically prescribed by the security
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicles to accompany the motorcade including
pilots and escorts would be strictly in accordance with the
instructions laid down by the security authorities and should not
exceed them under any circumstances, it added.
</P>
<P>
The order was part of the commission's efforts to curb poll
expenses in the general election which will be held from April 27
to May 30.

<HEADLINE> New Ways to Tackle Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- New ways of harnessing hilly and
sloping areas on the Loess Plateau in northwest part of the
country have proved very effective in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In an experimental zone in Mizhi County, northern part of
Shaanxi province, areas covered with trees and grass increased
from 37 percent to the current 53.6 percent, and soil erosion per
square kilometer dropped to 2,818 tons from the original 7,700
tons.
</P>
<P>
Despite two consecutive years' serious drought in the area,
local per capita grain quota went up from 210 kilograms to 350
kilograms, per capita income edged up by 500 yuan, reaching 1,050
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The experiment zone in Mizhi County has long suffered from
serious soil erosion due to broken land, sloping fields and lack
of afforestation.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, Chinese scientists devoted great
efforts to enhancing water and soil conservation, sparing no time
and efforts in developing agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was approved by experts from the State
Commission of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
and Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In the hilly area of the Loess Plateau, 60 percent is land with
a slope of or above 25 degrees. How to effectively make use of
sloping land remained a key task for harnessing the plateau in a
scientific way.
</P>
<P>
Through years of experiments, Chinese scientists mastered a way
to plant trees in sloping areas, with rain fall being mostly or
all stored. Scientists also introduced a group of biological
resources to enrich local biological resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, marked progress has been achieved in developing
biological technologies in the loess plateau.
</P>
<P>
A poison-free technology to graft seeding stem of mulberry
trees in tubes has been developed, the first in the world. Chinese
scientists also has successfully used seeding stem grafting to
breed poison-free apple seedling in the hilly area of the loess
plateau, providing technical guarantee for renewal of apple
planting in the area.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, 21 achievements of scientific research
and technical popularization were made, six of them winning
provincial or ministerial level awards.

<HEADLINE> State Of Food Emergency Declared In Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has appealed to
the world community for assisting nearly 100,000 famine-affected
persons with food supplies and agriculture inputs in Pemba
island.
</P>
<P>
This appeal was made in a statement issued by Brigadier Adam
Mwakanjuki, the isles' Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and
Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Mwakanjuki declared a state of emergency
relating to the availability of food in Pemba island.
</P>
<P>
Mwakanjuki attributed the food shortage in Pemba to the lack
of rains since late May last year, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
There are two rainfall seasons in Pemba, the short rains
starting in mid-October and the long rains from March to early
June. Short rains allow farmers in coral rag areas to plant
legumes such as cow peas, green gram, cereals and root crops.
Sorghum, maize, cassava and bananas are mainly grown in
plantation areas.
</P>
<P>
The lack of short rains has significantly affected the food
production trend especially in the coral eastern belt, the
minister stated, noting that crops like sweet potato, cassava,
bananas and breadfruits, the main elements of household food
security, were left stunted due to moisture stress.
</P>
<P>
The failure of cow pea, a cash and food crop, has compounded
the problem as many families lack both cash and food, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell similarly increased death toll for domestic
animals and left many animals emaciated due to diminished forage,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The drought cut off the supply of locally grown crops, pushing
up prices of other basic commodities like rice, sugar and maize
flour and grain, he further said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of food stocks at household level, coupled with lack
of cash, partly caused by a record low clove harvest, had made
many families miserable and with exceedingly low purchasing power,
the minister pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Can Forecast Yellow River Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have succeeded
in developing a system for forecasting disastrous flooding of the
Yellow River, the country's second longest river in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by some 70 scientists after five years of
efforts, can rapidly and accurately provide information in
relation to the rainfall, ice runs, rainstorms and flooding in the
river, according to the head of the research group.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of sub-systems, covering information checks,
rainstorm and flood forecast, flood control, loss evaluation and
corresponding relief measures.
</P>
<P>
The system, listed among the key projects in the national
Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995), has now passed state
appraisal.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Swiss Banks Consider Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's two biggest banks,
Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), are considering
a merger that would create the world's largest bank outside Japan,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Credit Suisse confirmed Tuesday
evening in a press release that it had proposed a merger with its
arch-rival UBS during a telephone conversation between the two
banks' chairmen last week.
</P>
<P>
UBS said it would consider the offer at a board meeting
Thursday evening, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
At current market prices, UBS is valued at more than 28 billion
U.S. dollars, and CS Holding, Credit Suisse's holding company, at
more than 17 billion.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the merger of the two banks would create a
banking giant with more than 600 billion U.S. dollars of total
assets, dwarfing either the London-based HSBC or Deutsch Bank.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted huge cost savings across the board, from
their largely overlapping Swiss retail branch networks to their
global investment banking arms.
</P>
<P>
However, many experts remained skeptical about the possibility
of the merger, noting that it would face strong opposition in
Switzerland on competition grounds and that the two banks have had
very different banking cultures, with Credit Suisse known as a
risk-taker and UBS an ultraconservative.

XI'AN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an's 100-year-old Jiaotong
University, one of China's most prestigious institutes of higher
learning, has found that scholars who have returned from overseas
are an important part of the university.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Li Changjiu, one of those who have returned, says that it
is fortunate that he returned after studying in Japan. At 32, he
is the youngest advisor for the doctoral candidates at the
university. He was appointed professor just three months after his
return and his academic research program was selected as one of
the country's scientific projects for the next century.
</P>
<P>
The school has sent more than 840 teachers and researchers to
23 countries and regions, and over 50 percent of them have
returned to the university, which has provided them with better
working conditions. Many have been appointed deans or directors of
research centers.
</P>
<P>
In return, the returning scholars have set up a number of new
research projects, helping the university improve its academic
level, and bring economic benefits to it.
</P>
<P>
These people include 47 Ph.Ds carrying half the teaching load
and research projects of the university.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka will recruit 1,000 new
policemen to the regular police force soon, police sources said

fact that some of them were already deployed in the northeast part
of the country where the ethnic war was going on.

<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Moving is no longer a traumatic
moment for Beijing residents, because they can now call for help
from a number of companies that provide this service.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The US's Microsoft and Motorola
are to work with China's Legend Group in developing a Chinese
version of Windows NT for the Power PC platform to provide a local
language solution for working on world-wide operations.
</P>
<P>
This will give Chinese businesses a faster hardware platform
that can be used more easily to meet their high performance and
critical computing needs.
</P>
<P>
The new system is expected to have a wide range of information
infrastructure applications in China such as the "Gold Card" (for
currency) and "Gold Customs" (electronic data transfer at customs
offices) projects.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's Beijing Office said today that Windows NT users in
Chinese government organizations and major corporations such as
the State Bureau of Taxation, Shanghai Baoshan Steel and Iron
Co. Ltd., and the People's Bank of China are expected to change to
the new Chinese version of Windows NT when it becomes available.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Nelson, corporate director for Microsoft Greater China
Region, says, "As China is modernizing its information
infrastructure through the 'Golden Projects', speeding up her
economic reform and transforming the state-owned enterprises into
more dynamic ventures, there are enormous opportunities for
Microsoft and Motorola to provide Chinese users with high
standards of networking, and offer the software developers in
China more business opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Motorola is one of the major platform manufacturers in the
world and one of the leading providers of mobile phones,
semiconductors, and advanced electronic systems and services.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Growth Slows down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- British consumers appear more
confident and willing to spend, but the growth of retail sales
slowed in March, according to a survey published today by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth successive month in which the number of
retailers reported an increase in business, rather than a fall
compared favorably with the situation a year before.
</P>
<P>
However, March saw the difference between those enjoying
an upturn and those suffering a downturn narrow to 27
percent, from 31 percent in January and 30 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that retail sales are regarded as only
just above average of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report says that all sectors of the high street saw more
buoyant trading in March than they did last year. But retailers
with the closest links to the housing market did well.

<HEADLINE> Improvements in China's Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- "China's securities market should
not be expanded too quickly, and should not leave problems for the
future," said a senior official with the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, the securities watchdog.
</P>
<P>
China's market should not be a worry for investors, the
official said, suggesting that China make an effort to train
regulatory personnel.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have sufficient people in regulatory institutions,"
she said, "even though the CSRC has empowered regulatory
administrations in 24 localities, including Beijing and Shanghai,
to improve market controls."
</P>
<P>
To improve self-regulation in the securities industry, the
Securities Association of China should be consolidated and the
legal guidelines improved.
</P>
<P>
"We should draw up regulations for different aspects of the
securities market before the Securities Law is promulgated," she
said. "We should have full confidence in the securities market,
when we take China's thriving economy into consideration."
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Information Center pointed out that
over the next 15 years, China's economy will develop a favorable
background for the growth of the securities market.
</P>
<P>
"China will hasten the process of international integration,
making the renminbi convertible, joining the World Trade
Organization, and dramatically increasing its role as one of the
top world traders.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, our country will be basically modernized,
and per capita GDP will catch up with that of a moderately
developed country.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy will be highly market-oriented, and planning will
have less influence on the market, which will play a larger part
in economic operations," said the official.

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure on Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today has
further eased the closure imposed on the Gaza Strip and West Bank
following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel since
February 25, which left more than 60 dead and over 150 wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israeli army announcement, ambulances from the
Palestinian autonomous areas will be allowed to enter Israel in
emergency situations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 50 Palestinians employed by foreign embassies
and consulates in Israel will be allowed to returned to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian citizens in the Gaza Strip will be permitted to
return home via the Allenby Bridge with Israeli escort.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, Israel had eased some aspects of the
six-week long closure as foodstuffs had been allowed into the Gaza
trip, and Palestinian goods have been permitted to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Israeli security source said Israel would
consider its stand on the closure only after Yasser Arafat,
President of Palestinian National Authority (PNA), arrests those
responsible for terrorist attacks in Israel.

<P>
He added that Israel would continue exerting pressure on
Arafat in order to arrest Mohammed Dief, head of Izzadin Kassam,
the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease the impact of the closure, Arafat has planned
to put 50,000 unemployed Palestinians to work for three months
cleaning streets and in similar unskilled jobs with a PNA loan of
15 million U.S. dollars from the West Bank and Gaza banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres also had
proposed a 100-million dollar international fund to create jobs
for the Palestinians in the Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
The PNA estimates losses from the closure, which has barred
more than 40,000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel, at two
to three million dollars a day from salaries alone, and about the
same in loss of trade.
</P>
<P>
According to a Palestinian Radio report, the U.N. Security
Council, as requested by the PNA, is due to hold a special
session this week to discuss the situations in the wake of the
closure.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Tops Clean Water Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Half of the waste water in port
city Tianjin is treated, with officials predicting that all
polluted water will be cleaned by the century's end. The city
leads the whole country with its clean water drive.
</P>
<P>
Northern China's largest port city has devoted great efforts
to disposing waste water while developing its economy, and these
efforts are proved effective.
</P>
<P>
The city launched programs to treat polluted water in the
early 1980s. Since then, two modern sewage treatment plants have
been built with a daily treatment capacity of 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to build six more sewage treatment plants,
to expand the daily treating capacity to 2 million tons. By the
year 2000, all the city's waste water is expected to be treated.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection officials said that, in future,
the city will focus on recycling of waste water to reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
City enterprises have also spared no effort in dealing with
waste water while promoting production.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Power shortages are no longer
plaguing people and slowing economic development in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), Guangdong's
power-generating capacity increased by 14.36 million kw at an
annual growth of 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the province raised a total of 12.58
billion yuan (about 1.5 billion US dollars) in joint ventures,
foreign investment, and by issuing stocks, as a means of
guaranteeing the smooth progress of this sector.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed this to a series of reforms put in place
by the province in investment, finance, and construction.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, installed capacity per unit in
Guangdong increased from 200,000 kw to 669,000 kw in the five
years, and operations at more than 50 sub-stations are automatic.
</P>
<P>
The province has completed construction of 10,715 km of 110-kv
transmission lines. A power grid with the provincial capital of
Guangzhou at the center covers the whole province and connects
with neighboring provinces and districts.

<HEADLINE> Alpine Fresh Water On Tap in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research in northwest
China has shown that alpine glaciers, inland rivers and
underground water all depend on each other in a natural recycling
roundabout.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have found that water resources in the
country's northwestern parts have peculiar characteristics, which
help to provide a non-stop supply of alpine freshwater.
</P>
<P>
In the area, most townships and villages are located in basins
between mountains, where various water resources, including
surface water, under-ground water and fountains, leak from the
surface. Most fountains in the area are open under-ground water.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists said that water resources in this area
benefit from vapor stopped by high mountains. The vapor is frozen
into alpine glaciers under cold conditions, and when the glacier
has melted, it flows down the mountains and forms rivers and lakes
in the low areas -- creating a continuous cycle.
</P>
<P>
Since the water resources are guaranteed by alpine glaciers,
and the rainfall is mostly in the summer, high-quality water
resources in this area are stable, favorable to agricultural
production, and importantly, helpful to the health of local
residents, Chinese scientists noted.
</P>
<P>
This discovery has aroused close attention from local
governments, who have been urged by scientists to use local water
resources in a scientifically controlled way.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Dalai Lake Nature Reserve in the
Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region has been almost doubled in size.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the central government, the reserve has been
enlarged from 4,000 sq km to 7,400 sq km, to become a
comprehensive nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
The main part of the reserve, located on the western part of
the Hulun Boir grasslands, is the Dalai Lake, which is the fourth
largest fresh water lake in China.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged reserve will not only protect the precious birds
living in the area, but also the lake itself, grasslands and other
landscapes of the region.
</P>
<P>
It will become the main habitat and breeding areas for northern
migratory birds. At present, the region is home to 26 species of
fish, 35 species of beasts, 191 species of birds, and 448 species
of plants.
</P>
<P>
Among the inhabitants are seven species of first-category state
protected animals such as black stork, sea eagle and red-crowned
crane. And there are also 32 species of second-category state
protected animals living in the area.
</P>
<P>
The state has invested more than two million yuan (about
240,000 US dollars) in setting up a series of scientific research
facilities, and sightseeing locations in the region since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has established long co-operation relationships
with many international wild animal protection organizations. It
has become a world important ecological research base for wet
grasslands.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A missile brigade of the Second
Artillery Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has earned
praise for the bravery of its officers, and a strict code of
self-imposed discipline.
</P>
<P>
The brigade has been commended as an advanced military unit for
its successful launch of dozens of missiles over the past 35
years, according to a front page story carried in today's
Liberation Army Daily.
</P>
<P>
Rules were formulated to ensure that members of the elite
brigade are not subjected to outside interference with their
military training, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Officers and soldiers are not allowed to hold parties at local
restaurants or hotels, they cannot enter local song and dance
halls, or receive invitations to dances and banquets. They are
also forbidden from joining in any cooperative businesses with
local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Along with mounting tides of market economy in recent years,
more than 20 local companies wanted to lease their trucks and
license plates, offering exorbitant payments, only to meet
refusals from the brigade.
</P>
<P>
Senior officers and members of the brigade's Communist Party
committee have been strict with themselves in both military
training and promoting qualified officers.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are active in taking dangerous tasks ahead of
others, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Believes the Year 2000 Begins 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has been
attempting to solve the puzzle of when the 21st century will dawn.
</P>
<P>
January 1st, 2000 seems the obvious starting point, but some
people believe the new century should wait in the wings of time
for an extra year, until January 1st, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Confronting the confusion about the starting point of the new
century, scientist Li Jing holds the view that the new century
should begin on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Both centuries and decades should be numbered from zero years,
astronomer Li Jing says.
</P>
<P>
Li acts as an academician to the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
and takes charge of examining and approving astronomical terms.
</P>
<P>
"The method is the view of most people in the world, and it
conforms with new trends," Li said, adding that the method catches
up with the widespread application of computers.
</P>
<P>
The astronomer explained that the Gregorian calendar, now a
convention around the world, was put into use on the basis of
Christian calendar more than 1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
There was one year A.D, and one year B.C., but the zero year
was neglected.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the inconvenience and confusion when centuries
start from "1" years, while decades start from "0" years, is
the crux of the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the 1990-1999 is accepted as the ninth decade of the 20th
century, while 2001 is taken as the beginning of the 21st century,
the year 2000 will not be able to fall into any decade. It is
neither the ending year of the 20th century, nor the beginning
year of the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and public organizations in many countries have put
forward different views and suggestions about the numbering of
centuries and decades, but there is no unified standard around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"It will be very funny that by the year 2000, some countries
believe they have stepped into the 21st century while some others
are still roaming the 20th century," the astronomer said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Li's counting method, centuries and decades
will be coordinated with both starting from zero years, only that
there is one special case, the first century only had 99 years.
People must achieve such a consensus, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made a point that any country can put forward their views
and suggestions, but the final conclusion should be drawn by
international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wore Jade Jewelry -- 8000 years ago, say experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Fashion conscious Chinese were
wearing high class jewelry 8,000 years ago, while the rest of the
world probably had to be content with bone and shell decorations,
experts revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists have discovered that people in northern
grasslands of China had already started to wear jewelry some 8,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The earliest jewelry of mankind ever found is a pair of jade
rings, unearthed from a tomb dating to the early Neolithic Age in
Chifeng city of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The rings from which a segment had been cut, were used as
earrings. Made of Manchurian jade, they still look bright, clean
and transparent.
</P>
<P>
"Such earrings suggest high craftsmanship in jade polishing and
drilling," the experts say.
</P>
<P>
The experts, who have also found a great number of jade items in
the shape of legendary animals dating 5,000 years in the area,
say that the area is an origin of Chinese jade ware.

<HEADLINE> Bronze Culture Remains in Northern Grasslands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Bronzeware with animal designs
have been found on northern China's grasslands, demonstrating that
the area did have a bronze culture of its own, contradicting what
was previously believed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the animal images, a horse's
body with tiger's claws or an eagle's beak, have not been found in
other parts of the country and are probably limited to this area.
</P>
<P>
According to scholars, such bronzes, found in many places in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, were mainly
decorations for daggers and swords.
</P>
<P>
The bronzeware date to the Xia (21st-16th Century BC) and Shang
(16th-11th Century BC) dynasties, as early as the Bronze Age in
central China, and suggest a break with previously held notions
that the northern grasslands had no bronze culture other than that
introduced from central China, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
The area does have some bronzeware that shares the same style
with that of central China, which was mostly found in the tombs of
nobility, and were probably introduced from there.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of items of bronzeware have been found in the Inner
Mongolian Autonomous region over the past four decades, including
weapons, chariots, and harnesses, and items for daily use.

<P>
NANJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
become one of the country's major rice producing areas with
highest per unit output.
</P>
<P>
Last year, provincial unit rice output grew from 505 kg per mu
to 533 kg, putting it at the top of the world's list of producers.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics from the provincial statistics
bureau, the more than 2.2 million ha of rice fields in the
province yielded 17.9 million tons last year, putting it third in
the country. Fengxian County had a record 650 kg per mu (0.066 ha).
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is located in an area between sub-tropical and warm
temperate zones, where double-cropping in rice is possible.
</P>
<P>
Because of the use of new techniques, rice output has been
increasing over the past few years. In 1984, provincial unit
output was more than 450 kg per mu, and by 1994, it exceeded 500
kg.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Stop Splittist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities must really
return to the "one China" stand, and stop splittist activities to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," a leading official
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so, can necessary conditions and an appropriate
climate be created for the resumption of talks between the ARATS
and the Taibei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), the
official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ARATS has consistently stood for promoting
talks with the SEF at all levels on the basis of the "one China"
principle.
</P>
<P>
"Advocated by us, and backed by the compatriots across the
Taiwan Straits, the first meeting between ARATS Chairman Wang
Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu was held successfully, and an
agreement was reached on the second Wang-Koo meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The sincerity we have shown, and tremendous efforts we have
made in this regard in the past four years are obvious to all," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He denounced some Taiwan leaders for wantonly conducting
splittist activities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"These activities have damaged the foundation for solid and
steady development of cross-straits relations, and this is the
real reason why talks between the ARATS and the SEF have been
forced to stop," he pointed out.

<P>
Only 89,800 babies were born in China's capital last year --
well within family planning targets set by officials.

During the past five years 480,700 babies were born in the

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The water pumped into Harare and
the environs from Morton Jaffray waterworks near Lake Chivero in
Harare is safe to drink.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is the results from two independent
laboratories which show that there are no chemical poisons in the
purified water or in the lake itself.
</P>
<P>
Harare's Director of Health Services, Lovemore Mbengeranwa
said on Tuesday that tests carried out by the University of
Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe Regional Drug Control Laboratory showed
no evidence of chemical poisons in the water to city residents.
</P>
<P>
He said the water met all the requirements of the World Health
Organization and had no bacteria while the mineral content was
low.
</P>
<P>
Harare residents are concerned about the quality of the water
they drink, especially after thousands of fish died at Lake
Chivero recently. Following the outcry, Mayor of Harare Solomon
Tawengwa decided to take reporters on a tour of the treatment
works and let senior council officials explain the purification
process that goes on at Morton Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
Mbengeranwa said the root cause of the deaths of the fish
should be investigated but stressed that whatever the factors
might be, they were not life threatening to humans.
</P>
<P>
He also dispelled rumors that sewage was being pumped into the
lake because tests had shown that no coliform bacteria was found
in the tested water. Coliform bacteria is found in human and
animal waste.

<P>
MOGADISHU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Radio South Mogadishu,
Somalia, supporting General Mohamed Farah Aideed has returned on
the air waves once again after a silence of more than a month.
</P>
<P>
The radio which started again its operation late yesterday
evening did not broadcast its usual news coverage. The radio came
on the air at a time when all the supporters of Aideed and his
opponents were equally expecting to hear an announcement of
his political and military point of view regarding the militia
battle between his supporters and those of his former financier,
Osman Hassan Ali Atto. The radio broadcast reiterated mainly on
programs emphasizing the legitimacy of Aideed's self declared
government.
</P>
<P>
General Aideed is currently reported to be reorganizing his
militiamen for a decisive battle against his rival Osman Atto.
The radio will mainly serve him to carry on his war and brain
washing propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto's radio has began warning the clans living in
Mogadishu to be aware of what it called General Aideed's
betrayals and keep both their children and armed wagons away from
the battle zones.
</P>
<P>
General Aideed's radio went out of the air after a dispute had
erupted between Abdi Haji Gobdon, the director general of General
Aidid's information ministry and Elmi Kulan Gedi, a close
relative of Aideed over the control of the radio station early
last month.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Orderly Migration of Rural Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To control random migration, which easily causes instability
and traffic congestion, the central government set up a unified
data system governing three labor markets, covering 21 provinces,
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Another labor market is expected to be set up in China's
northeast this year, in addition to the three in North China, East
China and South China.
</P>
<P>
To provide improved services, and protect the rights and
interests of the migrant workers, the labor departments are
extending their services to towns. And the localities are
encouraged to probe measures on better services and guarantees for
migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
The central government also decided to restrict rural surplus
laborers from working in major cities where unemployment rates are
already high.
</P>
<P>
It also intents to control the number of rural workers on the
move, by encouraging them find jobs where they live. And the
projected number of migrants is expected to be held at 30 million
this year, and 40 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The encouragements include that: surplus laborers in
under-developed areas shall be provided with more jobs in
government-subsidized projects, and given preferential tax and
monetary policies to reclaim wastelands and virgin mountains.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises, especially those in the interior regions,
will be further developed, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The labor official said that with the overall implementation of
the project nationwide this year, China is expected to solve the
problems of migrant workers by an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
The immediate goal set by the Labor Ministry is that
substantially fewer random rural workers will move around,
basically ending massive congestion and over-crowding in railway
stations around the coming Spring Festival in the early
1997.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Farmers Buying Things to Make Life Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in suburban areas of
east China's Shanghai are changing their spending patterns as they
make more money these days.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that telephones are popular consumer items
in suburban areas, with per-capita expenditure on telephones and
pagers of 54 yuan in 1995, 2.6 times the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Suburban Shanghai has become the first area in the country
where all telephones are program-controlled, and 26 percent of
rural families have telephones.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of rural families have cars, with per
family expenses in this area reaching 198 yuan last year, an
increase of 93.9 percent over 1994. At present, there are 22 cars
per 100 rural families.
</P>
<P>
To make life easier, more farmers are using gas to cook with
instead of coal and wood, with 70 percent of local rural families
using gas for cooking and heating water for bathing.
</P>
<P>
One of the most noticeable changes is the number of peasants
buying houses. Last year, 2.5 percent of the rural families
surveyed had bought houses, costing an average of 56,000 yuan
each. Per capita expenses in this area amounted to 324 yuan, 2.8
times the figure for 1994, and equal to 9.6 percent of per capita
living expenses.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has plans to move one-third of its farmers to towns
and cities by the end of this century. An increasing number of
farmers are expected to buy houses in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Orderly Migration of Rural Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China today announced new
measures to halt disorganised 'gold rush' by millions of rural
workers, official sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Migrating workers are flocking in large numbers to boom areas
of the country, often bringing chaos to road and rail systems.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government said today that it is to promote the
implementation of its "project of orderly trans-regional migration
of rural laborers" this year, in an effort to curb the chaotic
flow of rural surplus workers.
</P>
<P>
The project, started in 1994, has helped to establish a basic
trans-regional employment system, a labor market data system, and
service networks across the country, a Labor Ministry official
said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This will be "of crucial significance to ease the pressure of
China's urban jobless, pressure on transportation departments, and
maintaining social stability, as well as protecting the legitimate
rights and interests of rural workers," the official said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The widening gap of economic development between the coastal
east, and the interior regions in the course of China's reform and
opening-up to the outside world, has generated a booming gold rush
of rural workers.
</P>
<P>
The country's major railway stations have been plagued with too
many passengers around China's family reunion day, the Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
And large scale migration has also caused many other severe
social problems to the concern of the central authorities and the
public.
</P>
<P>
According to sample surveys and estimates by the Ministry of
Labor, up to 12.5 percent of the rural work forces are working at
places other than their residential areas, and nearly 30 million
are working outside their native provinces.
</P>
<P>
The orderly migration project has been organized by the
Ministry of Labor to counter this situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the project, before going elsewhere to work, each
rural worker has to obtain a permit from his own local government
with information that he may be employed there, and before
employed, he has also to obtain certificate from the local
government of his intended destination.
</P>
<P>
This practice has been enacted among workers already working
elsewhere, and will be expanded to all by the end of this year.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's purchase program

<HEADLINE> Third Force Said to Emerge as Largest Group in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- India's third largest party,
the Janata Dal, said Tuesday that the National Front - Left Front
Combine (the third force) and its allies will emerge as the single
largest group after the general elections, the Times of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
Janata Dal spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy said here that his party,
a major constituent of the third force, will lead the next
government.
</P>
<P>
He said the Janata Dal alone would win 100 of the 209 seats it
is contesting all over the country -- added to that would be the
score of the Left Front, the Samajwadi Party and its other allies.
</P>
<P>
The Janata Dal, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the
Communist Party of India, and some other parties formed the
National Front-Left Front Combine in the wake of the hawala
bribery scandal in a bid to confront the ruling Congress Party and
major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Both the Congress Party and the BJP have suffered heavily from
the 18-million-US-dollar bribery scandal while few leaders of the
third force were involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The general elections will be held in five phases from the last
week of this month to the end of May with a total of 543 seats in
the Lok Sabha (Lower House of parliament) to be contested.
</P>
<P>
Failing to form a third party, parties of the National
Front-Left Front Combine have succeeded in working out some
alliances at the state level across the country.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Named in Sexual Battery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Council
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was accused of sexual battery,
Chicago police said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the 25-year-old woman's complaint grew out of an
encounter Sunday night with Tyson and former WBC heavyweight
champion Oliver McCall at The Clique, a southside nightclub in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
A Chicago Police detective said they were investigating the
complaint, which was being treated as a criminal sexual assault,
but neither boxer has been charged. Police said Tyson had gone to
Cleveland, where he has a home.
</P>
<P>
WGN-TV in Chicago described the woman as a 25-year-old
resident of nearby Gary, Indiana. Her lawyer told WGN-TV that
she was frightened and wanted to keep her identity secret.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, a club manager said the woman had
been introduced to Tyson at her request. Tyson allegedly molested
her in a booth at the club.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 29, was released from an Indiana prison in March 1995
and won the WBC title on March 16th when he stopped Briton Frank
Bruno in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was convicted in 1992 of raping Desiree Washington, a
contestant in the Miss Black America beauty pageant the previous
year in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight champion from August 1st,
1987 to February 11th, 1990, when he was knocked out by James
"Buster" Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.

<HEADLINE> FINA to Investigate Fosch Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Officials of world swimming
governing body FINA said on Tuesday that they will began their own
investigation of embattled U.S. swimmer Jessica Foschi.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came one day after the American Arbitration
Association cleared the embattled 15-year-old swimmer of any
wrongdoing for her positive test for steroids last summer. The
panel lifted a two-year suspension, and she was cleared to compete
without undergoing the periodic drug tests that are part of a
two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
The Arbitration Association decided that Foschi, who resides in
Old Brookville, N.Y., was improperly punished for a violation she
did not commit. Foschi claimed she did not have any knowledge of
how the drug entered her body.
</P>
<P>
FINA officials, however, said they still have the power to
impose their own sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Foschi tested positive for steriods last August at the U.S.
Championships in Pasadena, Calif. A finding of steroids
automatically brings a two-year suspension, but a U.S. Swimming
review panel said Foschi might have been sabotaged and voted to
give her probation.
</P>
<P>
While awaiting the arbitration decision, Foschi competed in the
U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis in March but failed to make
the team.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Families Employ Domestics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- More and more families in
Guangzhou, booming capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
are employing household domestics -- from housemaids, to
child-minding nannies, and even nurses.
</P>
<P>
The growth of domestic service in Guangzhou helps local
families handle their shortage of time, and it makes for a more
convenient life.
</P>
<P>
"Looking for an appropriate housekeeper in a labour market used
to be very troublesome, because you know nothing about the
housekeeper," noted Lady Wang, who had employed two housekeepers
before.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's household service companies are no longer
intermediary organs. For them, registration and special training
is conducted before their housekeepers can formally begin to work.
</P>
<P>
Ye Enpei, general manager of the Tianyuan Household Service
Company, said, "The emergence of household service companies is
steering China's household labour market to a standardized level.
</P>
<P>
"With the registration of domestic workers, companies are held
responsible for both the clients and labourers", he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, Guangzhou boasts ten household service companies, and
one special school for the training of domestic workers.

<HEADLINE> China Backs Cuba's Efforts to Safeguard Sovereignty: Qiao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to support
Cuba's just struggle to safeguard its sovereignty and
independence, top Chinese legislator Qiao Shi told Cuban president
Fidel Castro today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, arrived here Monday on a four-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting today with Castro, which began with a friendly bear
hug, Qiao said: "China is opposed to attempts by outside forces to
interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, to exert pressure or impose
sanctions on the country."
</P>
<P>
Castro, president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, expressed
his thanks for China's stance as well as his pride in the mutually
supportive ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Havana fully understands and supports the stance of the
Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government on the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Qiao thanked Castro for his support, reiterating China's
resolve to prevent the division of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unacceptable and futile for any power, any
people to prevent or sabotage China's efforts to reunite the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent elections in Taiwan, Qiao said that the fact that
Taiwan is part of China cannot be altered no matter how the Taiwan
leadership is chosen.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to settle the Taiwan issue peacefully, he said,
and to maintain stability in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
But the country will not sit idle and remain indifferent if
outside forces invaded Taiwan or the scenario of an independent
Taiwan emerged, Qiao added, noting that China had never pledged
not to use force to reunite the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Qiao met with Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada,
president of the National Assembly of the People's Power of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the fourth leg of Qiao's five-country tour, which has
taken him to Ukraine, Russia and Greece. He is scheduled to go
next to Canada for a 10-day official visit.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Legislator Pleads Guilty to Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge today sentenced
former U.S. Congressman Dan Rostenkowski to 17 months in prison
after rebuking the lawmaker for abusing his position.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who chaired the House Ways and Means Committee,
pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud during a hearing at a
courthouse here.
</P>
<P>
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson accepted the guilty plea
and immediately gave him the 17-month prison term required under
the plea deal he had reached with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Johnson rebuked Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat, for a
"betrayal of trust," and said he had "violated the faith" of his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
She ordered him to report to a federal prison within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the hearing, Johnson asked Rostenkowski how he
pleaded to the two criminal charges. He replied in a soft voice,
"Guilty, your honor."
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski admitted he knew that some of his congressional
staff members had performed personal or political services in
violation of House of Representatives rules.
</P>
<P>
He said he also knew that merchandise purchased with official
funds from the House Stationery Store had been given away as gifts
to friends, again in violation of House rules.
</P>
<P>
The plea deal also called for the 68-year-old Rostenkowski to
pay a 100,000-dollar fine, minus the 82,000-dollars he already has
reimbursed to the House store. In return for the guilty plea, the
prosecutors agreed to drop corruption charges against him.

<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli and Russian Vice
Premier Vladimir Kadannikov signed on the accords at the end of a

<HEADLINE> Conference on Chernobyl Catastrophe Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on the
long-term impact of the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) Hans Blix said that the four-day conference would explore
the health, social and economic consequences of the world's worst
nuclear accident which occurred 10 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
The conference chairman, German Environment Minister Angela
Merkel, urged delegates to come up with a detailed resolution on
ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants in east European
countries and former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear energy will have good prospects only when its safety is
assured, she told the meeting attended by some 1,000 scientists
and 200 journalists.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, one of 15 former
Soviet republics, exploded on April 26, 1986, killing 31 plant
employees and forcing the evacuation of 135,000 people. Ukraine,
Belarus and Russia were hardest hit by the radioactive fallout.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yevgeny Marchuk told the conference
that his country will close the Chernobyl power plant in the year
2000 on condition that Ukraine gets financial aid from the West.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine has to spend several billion U.S. dollars a
year to deal the consequences of the accident.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin reviewed arms control and other
matters in a telephone conversation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that Clinton, who
initiated the call, and Yeltsin spoke for about 40 minutes in "a
good, useful conversation" ahead of next week's nuclear safety
summit in Moscow and their bilateral meeting there on April 21.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed Secretary of State Warren Christopher's meeting
last month with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov which
prepared for the upcoming summit and the bilateral talks, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Among security issues raised on the phone were troop limits
under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and differences
over interpretations of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that they would continue to look for solutions
that are appropriate for both sides; no solutions of the issues,
however," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
As both Clinton and Yeltsin face re-election this year, McCurry
said that they briefly discussed on-going re-election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that the two presidents privately agreed to support
each other politically when they met at an anti-terrorism summit

<P>
DHAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed
and 200 others injured Tuesday as members of rival parties clashed
in Bangladesh's biggest port city of Chittagong, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out between supporters of the former ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its biggest feud the Awami

<HEADLINE> Roof of the World Weather Forecasters Beat the Elements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese meteorologists are walking
tall after beating the weather elements on the "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
China's mountainous Tibet Autonomous Region is using space-age
science and technology to provide up-to-the minute weather
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of the towering Himalayas, Tibet has a
considerable impact on climates in east Asia, and even the general
circulation of the world's atmosphere, owing to its unique
geological circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The team of weather forecasters have won praise from
mountaineers battling against the world's highest peaks, and from
aviation departments for helping to avoid air crashes caused by
freak weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Today Tibet's meteorological undertaking is cashing in on
modern technology, instead of relying on man-controlled
meteorological stations. The introduction of auto weather stations
is partly due to its inaccessibility, and insufficient oxygen.
</P>
<P>
With the advancement of satellite remote sensing techniques,
and telemetering automation technique in recent years, Tibet has
established a comprehensive meteorological probing system,
comprising of satellite telemetering and meteorological radar
probing, greatly increasing the sources of information.
</P>
<P>
A meteorological information network, which links with Beijing
and the autonomous region's prefectures of Shannan, Qamdo, Ngari,
and Xigaze has come into shape in the autonomous region, with
information processing and data transmitting automatic.
</P>
<P>
The focus of meteorological research has shifted to applied
meteorology since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
To date, the autonomous region has been divided into several
smaller regions, featuring diverse meteorological resources,
providing a scientific basis for the development of Tibet's
farming and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological information has also been provided as a
reference for the autonomous region's civil aviation industry and
forestry sector, reducing weather-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's meteorological departments have directly and indirectly
helped mountaineers from both at home and abroad, by offering
accurate weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
As one mountaineer put it, " half of the credit should go to
meteorological departments when a mountaineer succeeds in reaching
the top of a mountain."

<HEADLINE> Hebei Develops Water-Saving Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province,
neighboring Beijing, has been making earnest efforts to develop
water-saving farming in order to ease the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Hebei's per capita amount of surface water currently stands at
262 cu m, less than the national average for Israel, which is
well-known for its aridity.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of water has been compounded by economic development
in recent years," a provincial official said, adding that Hebei's
water shortage amounts to 6.8 billion cu m annually.
</P>
<P>
"Chronic water shortages have become a major damper on
agricultural development throughout the province," he said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, efforts were made to build reservoirs in
the 1950s and 1960s, thereby bringing over 90 percent of the
mountainous areas under the coverage of reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Hebei turned to subterranean water by sinking
wells. Since the 1980s, the local people have come to understand
there exist limitations in developing new water resources and,
therefore, have leaned toward saving water.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has shown that water-saving farming is the right way
to fundmentally tackle the issue of water shortage," the official
said, adding that the provincial government has increased its
financial backing for water-saving farming by an annual 30 million
yuan (about 3.6 million US dollars) since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei provincial branch of the Agricultural Bank of China
has also provided loans totalling 100 million yuan for the
development of water-saving projects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The combined efforts have begun to show results," the official
said, adding that the acreage of Hebei's water-saving irrigated
area has reached nearly 1.8 million ha, about 44 percent of the
province's total arable land.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hebei plans to create another 666,000 ha of
water-saving irrigated farmland by the end of this century,
explaining that one ha of water-saving farmland can save 300 cu m
of water each year.

<HEADLINE> Universities, Colleges Seek Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's universities and colleges
are seeking various co-operative means to raise their quality in
teaching and research.
</P>
<P>
Most institutes of higher learning used to be subject to the
ministries and departments under the central government, having
little connection with local authorities, said Zhou Yuanqing,
vice-minister of the State Education Commission (SEC), here
recently.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there were not many composite universities in
China, he said, while local economies boosted by the country's
reform and opening-up have demanded a better role for universities
and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the higher education institutes are enhancing
co-operation with local governments or other institutes.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1992, Guangdong Province in southern China was
the first to sign agreements with the SEC to make joint efforts to
develop the South China University of Science and Engineering and
Zhongshan University.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Province in southeastern China and the SEC have agreed
to seek joint development of Xiamen University.
</P>
<P>
The local governments have helped build some specialized
institutes inside the universities, and they have been paid back
with considerable numbers of outstanding personnel and scientific
and technological advances.
</P>
<P>
Some medium-sized or even small cities have also contributed to
the development of universities because of their need for talented
people.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many higher learning institutes have joined
hands so as to share teaching and research materials. More than
100 universities and colleges have tried out such a method
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In the course of educational reform, the combination of
universities and colleges has become another trend over the past
few years. A score of higher education institutes have become
composite ones across the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Inflation Will Continue to Drop: Dini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy's inflation, down for several
straight months, will continue to fall and is likely to hit 4
percent soon, caretaker Prime Minister Lamberto Dini said here
today.
</P>
<P>
After rising in the last half of 1995, inflation has fallen a
surprising 1.5 percentage points in the first quarter of 1996 to
hit 4.5 percent in March, he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has hovered above 5 percent in recent years due to
political turbulence and economic slowdown, making it difficult
for Italy to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for Economic and
Monetary Union which sets an inflation limit of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dini also outlined other achievements during his term in
office, such as reduced government expenditure, the creation of
jobs and the growth of exports and investment.

<HEADLINE> China Rail Stations Face Axe in Market Economy Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China is to close 1,566 passenger
railway stations - 30 per cent of the country's total in
number. But officials said that the stations to be axed only
average 20 passengers a day.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a package that aims to push China's
low-efficient railway department into the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese railway authority will also close 1,607 freight
stations along its rail lines in the near future, a Ministry of
Railways conference was told.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ministry said the closure of the stations will
enable the railway department to use its production resources to
the optimum.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,607 freight stations, 565 hardly handle a car a day,
they are to be shut down within the year, the officials said. The
other 1,042 handle less than three cars a day each, and are to be
closed next year.
</P>
<P>
The conference held in the port city of Dalian in Liaoning
Province also urged turning specialized departments, such as those
for container transport, special cargoes, loading and unloading,
into independent businesses.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the various needs of the market, the ministry will
endeavor to open more luxury, tourist and non-stop trains.
</P>
<P>
To sharpen its competitive edge against air and highway
traffic, the authority will raise the speed of trains on major
lines from around 60 kmh to 140 kmh. It will adopt new, more
comfortable passenger trains, and set up computerized ticket sales
systems.
</P>
<P>
For freight transport, the authority will introduce 5,000-ton
heavy duty trains on the busiest lines, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Orders Congressman's Arrest on Drug Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Supreme
Court has ordered the arrest of the former president of the House
of Representatives Alvaro Benedetti for illicit enrichment, a
court spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Alvaro Benedetti had allegedly received
two checks worth a combined total of 45 million pesos (about
45,000 U.S. dollars) from the front companies of the Cali cartel
to finance his election campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The cartel's front companies also supposedly paid for his
stay at the luxury Intercontinental hotel in the southwestern
city of Cali on a number of occasions during his race for office,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Benedetti is the fifth congressman to be arrested as part of
the court's investigation beginning in April 1995. More than 10
congressmen and senior public officials, including President
Ernesto Samper himself, have been under investigation for
allegedly receiving money from the cartel in the country's general
elections two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Foreign Minister Raps U.S. Helms-Burton Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today condemned the U.S. for
tightening trade embargo against it and damaging the interest of
other countries trading with the island state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, who was making a
stopover at a local airport here, said the U.S. has not only
attempted to infringe upon the Cuban sovereignty, but also tried
to restrict trade between Cuba and other countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed an anti-Cuba bill, named
after its Republican sponsors and approved by the Congress, on
March 12 as a punitive measure against Cuba after it shot down two
small planes piloted by the U.S.-based Cuban exiles in February.
</P>
<P>
But the bill gained little support from the international
community as more and more countries have established closer
economic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
While pledging to continue Cuba's reform, Gonzalez said his
country will as always follow the socialist road and never make
itself a victim of the U.S. policy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Astronomers Snap Hyakutake Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronomers got clear
snapshot photographs of the Hyakutake comet as it roared towards
the earth last month.
</P>
<P>
Details of the solar-system photo shoot were given by Chen
Daohan, a research fellow of the Nanjing-based Purple Mountain
Observatory, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
On March 26 astronomers at an observatory in Qingdao City,
Shandong Province, took photos of the comet and its 42,000
kilometer long tail. At its widest the comet was 18,000 km in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
The comet's ball-shaped nucleus, consisting of ice and dust
material, emitted a large amount of gas and dust while being
bombarded with radiation from the sun. This produced a "hair" and
"tail" effect - much larger than the relatively small nucleus of
the comet, said Chen.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The 1996 Olympic Torch Relay
unveilled its look at the Georgia Dome stadium in Atlanta on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The relay, presented by Coca-Cola, will have its designs and
logos associated with the cross-country tip undertaken by 10,000
torch bearers.
</P>
<P>
Included is a pictogram of runners exchanging the Olympic
flame, inspired by human figures depicted on ancient Greek
vases. The torchbearers represent contemporary renderings of the
classic human form.
</P>
<P>
Another dominant theme is a "Quilt of Leaves" motif borrowed
from the Centennial Olympic Games themselves. The emblem
symbolises the thousands of communities the Olympic flame will
pass through on its cross-country journey.
</P>
<P>
"This design upholds the sanctity of the Olympic flame and
complements the look of the Centennial Olympic Games," said
Ginger Watkins, managing director of corporate services for the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG).
</P>
<P>
But the Olympic symbolism may get a bit jostled by the
corporate logos of Coca-Cola, Champion, Hanes and German
automaker BMW.
</P>
<P>
The torch, which began its international journey this month in
Greece, will arrive in Los Angeles on April 27 and pass through 42
states and 29 state capitals before arriving at the Olympic
Stadium in time for the July 19 opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
It will be carried across America in 84 days by runner,
bicycle, horseback, boat, plane and train.

industrial output value accounting for 40 percent of Liaoning's
total, rural enterprises, however, have shown deficiencies when
coping with market shifts because of their generally small sizes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the provincial government has helped these
enterprises to improve their management style and product quality,
and establish large company groups by means of merging and forming
jointly-run bodies.
</P>
<P>
At present, Liaoning has 97 rural business groups whose output
value surpasses 100 million yuan each. A total of 76 of them are
certified as large or medium-sized enterprises by the state.
</P>
<P>
As a result of achieving economies of scale, most of the groups
so far have reported good business performance.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Zhongwang Group Company consists of five joint
ventures. During the province's present drive to transform its
traditional industrial bases, the steel industry needs large
amounts of phenolic resin. The company seized the chance and soon
claimed 90 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Last year the company reported over 600 million yuan in output
value, and five million yuan in profits and taxes.
</P>
<P>
In the Jinzhou area at the southern tip of the Liaodong
peninsula, a group company has been formed by the area's over 30
timber processing plants.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the rich forest resources in northeast China, the
company has vigorously developed domestic and overseas
markets. Last year it achieved an output value of 300 million yuan
and an export volume of 200 million yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will continue its efforts to form business groups
among rural enterprises, and aims to have 500 large and
medium-sized ones by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Offers More Support for Chinese Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Breast-feeding and infant
dehydration used to be new concepts to many Chinese families,
though they had long been buzz words of the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Guo Mei, a UNICEF official, told a meeting held in this capital
of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that since
UNICEF issued a program concerning health care education in 18
provinces and regions of China, the aboved-mentioned problems have
being tackled step by step.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, at least 600,000 Chinese families have
benefited from the program, especially more rural and pastoral
women have mastered scientific baby-raising methods, abandoning
their old traditions.
</P>
<P>
Women in the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions
were pleased to read handbooks on child care in their own
languages.
</P>
<P>
Ling Jiesheng, a professor working for UNICEF, pointed out that
spreading medical knowledge among Chinese families has a
significant bearing on enhancing Chinese people's physical
wellbeing and improving children's lives.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1995, China and UNICEF jointly held various
training courses for 23,800 medical workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 20 sets of audio and video materials concerning
health care and baby-raising have been produced, while 28 sets of
posters and handbooks have been published totalling 720,000, as
well as 629,000 leaflets.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Chinese government has invested six million yuan in
the project, and more money will be used to help Chinese parents
to acquire medical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has also contributed equipment, including cars,
computers, cameras and duplicators, to improve the efficiency of
the child-care efforts.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that a co-operative program plan for the next five
years has been formulated to provide more support for China's
efforts to help children.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans to Export Rice to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry is
planning to sell at least 100,000 tons of 15 percent white rice
worth 50 million US dollars to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Another rice sale to Iraq for the same value is also planned to
follow, since the United Nations has allowed Iraq to sell crude
oil worth about 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that initial rice deals had been
finalized between the two countries during a recent visit to Iraq
by a Thai trade delegation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has asked Iraq to pay 100 million dollars in cash for
the rice, but Iraq said it could pay only half the bill in cash
since the country's spending for food imports has not yet been
finalized.
</P>
<P>
The Thai ministry also has sent a trade delegation to Jordan
and some African countries to discuss possible rice sales to these
markets.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expecting a significant harvest from its second
crop during April and June and the country is stepping up efforts
to promote its rice exports, especially low-grade rice.

<HEADLINE> Wilkins Helps Panathinaikos Enter European Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA star Dominique Wilkins
scored 35 points to help Greek side Panathinaikos tame CSKA Moscow
81-71 on Tuesday to reach the final of the European clubs'
basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
Panathinaikos, who ended up third in the last two Final Fours,
beaten each time by bitter Greek rivals Olympiakos, will meet
either Barcelona or holders Real Madrid in Thursday's final.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by 4,000 enthusiastic fans wearing the club's colours,
green and white, Panathinaikos made a strong start, opening a 4-0
lead in the first two minutes with a two-pointer from Fragiskos
Alvertis followed by two free throws by Nikos Ekonomou.
</P>
<P>
But CSKA, helped by the organising skills of Vasili Karasev,
fought their way back into the match to lead 20-14 after 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Russian club, seeking their first European title in 25
years, played exciting, fast basketball but struggled to outwit
the Greek defence and Panathinaikos were soon back in command,
leading 36-33 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Wilkins scored 15 points in the first half and moved up a
couple of gears after the interval, proving that he still has
plenty to offer at the age of 36 by adding 20 points to his
total, including two crucial three-pointers.

<HEADLINE> Tibet-Xinjiang Boundary Fixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1,100-km boundary between the
Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
was fixed today after four months of delimitation work.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Council and from both sides were
present at the signing ceremony held in Dayi City, Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
This was the second provincial-level boundary line fixed by the
central government in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The first one, between the Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui
autonomous regions, was defined last year.
</P>
<P>
China's 65 de facto provincial demarcation lines are
traditional historical ones, and have never been fixed by the
central government.
</P>
<P>
"Boundary disputes have never ceased to take place," said Doje
Cering, deputy head of the internal boundary demarcation work
committee under the State Council and minister of Civil Affairs,
at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
There have been over 1,000 boundary disputes since the New
China was founded in 1949, with disputed areas amounting to
140,000 square km, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council started pilot demarcation of six provincial
border lines in 1989, and decided last year to spend five years
officially establishing all the country's provincial and county
boundaries, beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress session which ended in March
this year has decided to list this work in the country's long-term
national economic and social development plan.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 provincial border lines will have been delimited by
the end of this year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering added that "the nationwide delimitation work bears
great historic and realistic significance for China's lasting
economic development and social stability."
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments to take more of the overall
national situation into consideration, though some of their
interests in land, minerals and other resources might be affected.
</P>
<P>
"They should also give clear explanations to the public
concerned, and minimize confrontations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Foschi Cleared of All Charges by Arbitration Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Embattled teenaged swimmer
Jessica Foschi, who has been protesting her innocence for eight
months following a positive test for steroids, was cleared of all
wrongdoing by an arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
A three-member American Arbitration Association panel,
convened by the U.S. Olympic Committee, voted unanimously on
Monday that a U.S. Swimming decision to place Foschi on probation
"violated fundamental fairness" and called the sanction "arbitrary
and capricious."
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Foschi tested positive for steroids at the
national championships in Pasadena last August, setting off a
rollercoaster of rulings and reversals that brought intense
scrutiny to drug testing in the sport and the punishment process.
</P>
<P>
Though international rules state a positive steroid test
brings an automatic two-year ban from all competition, a
U.S. Swimming review panel covened in February decided that Foschi
may have been sabotaged and put her on probation rather than
suspension. She was also subject to strict drug monitoring.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Swimming President Carol Zaleski, bowing to
international pressure, called for and received a reversal of
that ruling, placing Foschi on two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
After the sport's world body, FINA, gave Australian star
Samantha Riley only a warning for a drug violation, however,
U.S. Swimming again overturned its suspension of Foschi, allowing
her to compete at the Olympic Trials in March while under
probation.
</P>
<P>
Foschi missed qualifying for the Olympic team, but Monday's
arbitration panel ruling lifted the two-year probation, exonerated
her of all penalties and concluded she had been improperly
punished for a violation she never committed.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming evidence produced in this proceeding
inescapably leads us to the conclusion that Foschi and all those
connected with her are innocent and without fault," the panel said.
</P>
<P>
"This has all made me a little tougher," said Foschi, who has
set her sights on the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia. "I'm glad it's over."
</P>
<P>
The saga may not be quite over, however. FINA has requested
documents on the case and could still suspend Foschi for two years
internationally, although she would be able to compete in the
United States.

maturing in November 2006, which finished at 8.28 percent from
8.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jump in rates came as soon as the markets opened. Trading
then settled into narrow bands for the rest of the day and few
dealers expect rates to drop in coming days.
</P>
<P>
The sharp turnaround on New York financial markets was sparked
 Friday with the issuing of much stronger than expected American
job figures. This raised fears that interest rates would need to
rise to keep a lid on inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said all eyes would again be on Wall Street overnight
as investors tried to gauge likely trading patterns for the rest
of the week, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves Evacuation from Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today asked the Pentagon to begin evacuation of about
450 Americans from Liberia following an outbreak of fighting
between rival factions in the western African country, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said that two Army MH-53 transport
helicopters arrived in the Liberian capital of Monrovia late
Tuesday to take out the first Americans who wish to leave and that
the helicopters were expected to leave for nearby Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said though none of the
violence in Monrovia is directed at Americans, the Clinton
administration sees "it as a potentially dangerous situation."
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the Americans in Liberia would be trapped in the
chaotic situation, the Pentagon earlier this week made contingency
plans for a possible evacuation, rushed some transport planes
and helicopters as well as a small contingent of U.S. troops to
Sierra Leone. Besides, an assessment team of six Army special
forces soldiers and a security detail of 18 elite Navy SEALs
arrived in Monrovia Tuesday to assist the U.S. embassy in the
evacuation, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said Christopher made the decision
mid-morning Tuesday to evacuate Liberia. "He judged it was prudent
thing to do," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official told reporters later that the
evacuation from Liberia had begun, with the operation expected
to continue through the night.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Stop of Foreign Interference in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations on Tuesday called on all
member states to refrain from interfering the internal affairs of
Afghanistan and stop the transfer of weapons to the warring
parties.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, in a speech at the Security Council meeting on the
general discussion of Afghanistan issue, said the crux of the
problem was the lack of even a minimum of trust between the
different factions.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the foreign interference in Afghanistan and
arms transfer had complicated the conflict, and delayed a final
resolution," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin noted that after the withdrawal of foreign troops, the
problem in the country had become essentially a domestic one.
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve a peace, the factions must first implement
a cease-fire and establish mutual trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that, with the assistance of the United Nations,
the Organization of the Islamic Conference and concerned
neighboring countries, Afghanistan would achieve a good solution
which was not hampered by ethnic differences.
</P>
<P>
Almost two dozen of other countries also addressed the council
meeting, which was intended to identify the root causes of the
continuing conflict and try to figure out appropriate solutions.
</P>
<P>
Among the suggested solutions are the imposition of a U.N. arms
embargo against Afghanistan and the convening of a U.N.-monitored
conference of Afghan parties that could help accelerate the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets with Greek Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton in
a meeting with visiting Greek Prime Minister Constantine Simitis
here today expressed concern about the situation in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Clinton offered U.S. help in finding a solution to the disputes
between Greece and Turkey, both being U.S. allies. He told his
guest that he was interested in seeing "how we can be helpful in
resolving some of the difficulties in the Aegean."
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two Mediterranean neighbors heightened
because of a confrontation last January over a tiny island in the
Aegean Sea. A clash on the matter was averted by Washington's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
"I think all these issues should be resolved without the use of
force or the threat of force, with both parties agreeing to abide
by international agreements and with mutual respect for
territorial integrity," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry quoted Clinton as telling
the Greek Prime Minister that the United States "favors having the
ownership question of the islet referred to International Court of
Justice or other arbitration forums that would be appropriate."
</P>
<P>
The Greek Prime Minister made a presentation in the White House
talks, which President Clinton found "enormously encouraging,"
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the question of Cyprus. Clinton
indicated that acting Assistant Secretary of State for European
Affairs John Kornblum would be available in coming months to visit
the region and to discuss with the parties concerned in an attempt
to "generate some new momentum." That mission, McCurry said
Washington hoped, could lead to "a renewed dialogue" on the issues
related to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
As for bilateral relations, McCurry stressed that today's
meeting provided an opportunity for Clinton to underscore the
importance Washington attaches to "very close and warm bilateral
relations with one of our closest allies, not only a NATO ally,
but a nation with which we share enormous coincidence of security,
economic and political interests."

<HEADLINE> IFOR Announces New Measures in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led IFOR spokesman Andrew
Cumming said today the NATO forces would take additional measures
for detecting the main anti-aircraft systems because the parties
in Bosnia failed to meet the relevant provisions in the Bosnian
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Cumming told a press conference in the Serb stronghold Pale
that IFOR would assist the work of humanitarian and other
organizations included in the reconstruction of the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the IFOR troops had mainly confined their mission
in the military aspects such as the separation of local troops and
patrol on the Zone of Separation. But now with the peace process
in the military aspects going on well, the IFOR seems ready to
enlarge its task to civilian affairs.
</P>
<P>
International Police Force spokesman Alexander Ivanko meanwhile
said the Serb authorities were maintaining very correct relations
with the international police force.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Serb army Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic, now in a
Muslim jail in Sarajevo after the Hague war crimes tribunal had
dropped the case against him, Ivanko said the international police
force were following up his case but his release has not yet been
announced.
</P>
<P>
As regards the four Mujaheddin arrested by the Croatian police
near Senj on the northern Croatian coast, IFOR representatives
confirmed that the Croatian authorities had brought charges
against them for carrying out commando actions in croatia.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Halt to Fighting in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday urged warring parties in Liberia to stop fighting and
warned them of serious consequences by failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Liberia's political leaders immediately show by
concrete positive actions a reaffirmation of their commitment to
the Abuja Agreement and fully honor their obligation by
reestablish and maintain the cease-fire, they risk losing the
support of the international community," said a presidential
statement of the council.
</P>
<P>
The weekend fighting began when policemen and fighters loyal to
Charles Taylor stormed Roosevelt Johnson's home in a Monrovia
suburb, saying they have come to arrest him on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Both Charles and Johnson are members of a six-man ruling
council created by the Abuja Agreement last August. The peace
agreement had brought about a rebirth of hope after six years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
"This new outbreak of factional fighting, the harassment and
abuse of the civilian population and humanitarian and relief
workers, threatens the peace process and raises serious doubts
about the commitments of the factions to its implementation," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the presidential statement expressed concern about
the safety of the U.N. personnel and other international workers
in the country.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Liberian parties to fully respect
international humanitarian law with regard to the civilian
population and to ensure the safety of United Nations and other
international personnel.

LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank resident economist
